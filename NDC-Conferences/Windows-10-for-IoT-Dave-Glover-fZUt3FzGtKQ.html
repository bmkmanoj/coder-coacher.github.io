my demo why I get rid my demo because
they breathe a sigh of relief that
actually but
of course I knew it a fighter but of
course when there's people watching
there's gotta be something happens all
right because the screen really
resolutions drop so low and you don't
know how to use the menus a variety okay
so my name is david glover i'm a
developer evangelist at microsoft and so
my role is to kind of kind of get out
there and and connect with developers
that's my day job be it in the community
or being our partners or customers it's
kind of where we're a fit and if you're
serious about doing things around edeard
of things particularly the enterprise
space then do feel free to reach out to
me those will feel free to reach out in
any way I kind of could have a vague
prevent presence on Twitter so I'm d
Glover d Glover on microsoft com it's
for the best fit and I try to be not too
bad at email I wouldn't confess to being
the most fantastic either Twitter or
things like that quite good this is a
bit lower bandwidth right I'm gonna I go
get a little video will play a little
video give you a sense of what weirdo
future holds
imagine if you could connect the dots to
see behind where your business is today
to where it could be in the future would
you begin to see ways to make
improvements or see what once seemed
impossible is now within reach
technology is rapidly accelerating the
transformation of your business it's
changing the way we work imagine if the
most vital parts of your business were
connected people assets processes and
systems everything from your factory
floor to the field with the Internet of
Things They candy and simple changes can
transform your business right now with
the internet of things you can extend
your business's reach and make better
use of its resources data that was once
untapped is now an asset even the most
critical issues can be solved in real
time you can see ways to make the most
of every moment the reasons why you
should embrace the internet of things
are clear but how do you get started we
believe the Internet of Things begins
with your things the things that matter
most to your business start small from
where you are today and build from there
make the most of systems you already
have in place alrighty that you probably
get a general sense of it now there was
a really good reason why I played that
video besides dancing a tap-dancing a
bit of time it kind of gives you a sense
of what the game is for Microsoft and
we're we're kind of focusing our
attention surround the end of the things
it's very much into enterprise and
business and though we call of course
internet things has become the new trend
and everyone's talking about a little
blah blah blah we've been doing the
internet of things at least 20 years and
the Internet of Things has really been
going on probably for the last 40 to 50
years if you think about process control
systems scatter systems all those types
of systems out there they were
fundamentally
internet of things so we've been doing
embedded so you would have heard a
windows embedded in those types of
products for a long time but what we've
done is because the internet thing has
become the new thing all our all those
products and platforms and technologies
that kind of lived a bit on the outside
of the main main thrust of Microsoft
particular on windows in the platform
have now all moved them to be part of
the windows too so that's the biggest
difference and so the innovations that
we bring out into Windows Windows 10 the
colonel all those types of things now go
into our Internet of Things enable
products and platforms so that's very
much where it goes and it comes all the
way down to things like security and I'd
say securities come out the one of the
number one thing if people ask me what's
the most important bunch of things I
said security security security and then
anything else for that it's kind of
interesting data is obviously we're
interesting but for enterprises
securities cover those number one thing
number one priority and what we're doing
around the platform wall away from the
client platform was up to the cloud is
ensuring that business can do that with
confidence and secure and security so
that's very much so it's kind of why I
played that video because you kind of
get a sense of where we're going for and
it's to work with photo building systems
out now that's said I would say that
this session is part enterprise and part
maker is everyone comfortable the term
maker so most people hits again here so
people to go the infinite with
electronics and build something cropped
up something garage door openers pianos
what about those drum kits might be
things so I'm going to give a bit of a
sense of both and the demos that i'm
going to show you are kind of earring on
the maker side but the using enterprise
technology so I've kind of made them you
know but a bit fancy um and but fun now
all the code for these demos lives up on
my github and so my name's Dave Glover
and they unfortunately someone nicked
glove box so I run for the plural so
that's where you can find me on github
com glove boxes and you'll find all the
code that are in these demos plus way
more than your Posse ever really want
and I also develop
code up there and co2 samples up there
obviously around windows I'm bit of a
fan of Arduino so there's a lot of us
stuff up to be around Arduino and I even
kind of hack like I really am a hack
when it comes to things like Python I
can kind of hack my way to Joy on Python
and I look at the language as oh wow and
then actually sometimes I really hate it
and sometimes earth she quite cool so
you'll find my code across those kind of
range of products and the other thing
that we do in fact I'll jump around at
the moment ok so I mentioned before yeah
so this session is kind of a bit about
the driving forces opportunity and
development and I kind of want to step
back for a moment because I mentioned
before that we've really been doing the
Internet of Things so i would say 40 to
50 years what we eatin 50 years product
feels about right and so what's
different now the biggest difference is
really around commoditization so if you
had an awesome idea ten years ago five
years ago and you wanted to take
something to market you might have to go
and mortgage your house to go and build
something to go and get the technology
to put it all together go along and find
an organization who was willing to
invest with you and it should go and
build something and it would typically
cost hundreds of thousands if not
millions of dollars certainly 10 years
ago 20 years ago these types of projects
wouldn't the millions of dollars now as
we know things like the price of silicon
that's sitting inside our and inside our
mobile phones the arm process and that
they're like a couple of dollars so
they're really the whole commoditization
has really changed to the point where i
might be wearing a Fitbit or those types
of things those products are immediately
accessible bit because it costs a big
part of that the other thing that's
changed obviously of the recent last
peps last five years is the advent of
commoditization around compute and
storage so really around the cloud so
you've seen these really tiny devices
being able to collect data but
fundamentally they need to better push
the data somewhere and we want to be
able to do that
really cost effective rates and again
that's exactly where cloud computing
comes in and I pulled out one other
factor and here that I think is really
quite amazing it's 3d printing in the
idea now that if you want to go along to
some crowdfunding idea they typically
want to see something kind of how does
this product look and the advent of 3d
printing is really going to
revolutionize manufacturing you've only
got to look around i think in china i
think i spotted an article maybe a six
months ago with their printing houses
and printing places where people live so
really that whole thing's changing but
certainly when the internet things the
idea about a prototype and build
something are really amazing the other
thing i'd say I've kind of touched on
this is really the access to capital and
that's the other thing that's really
quite different if you had a great idea
you typically had to go to a large
organization like hitachi or General
Motors or or people like that who
encounters the manufacturing clout and
say look I've got this great idea can we
get out there now we can go out to
crowdsourcing and crowdfunding and
Kickstarter's and say look I've got this
awesome idea put on a fiver I get enough
people to put on a fiver I've got enough
money to contain approach it out there
the other thing I would say and
particularly for enterprises is this
hunger for knowledge and if you think
about most of our organizations what we
do is we gon build product or service
and we ship it out somewhere and often
that's the last time we can kind of
interact with it and so organizations
are grappling with this idea about how
can I get the information back from the
and understand how people are using it
and for that product or service I might
be using and how can I get that back
into the system to understand what I can
do to manufacture and be and be smarter
and things of that so really say that's
a huge difference there there's this
whole big data thing that's going on
machine learning be able to kind of look
at the data and kind of Bill were out
and understand packs of the data and
things like that and the other thing
that would say that's really changed is
the whole open source movement and you
might think it's kind of weird Microsoft
talking about this open source but we do
this and I've got to say Microsoft has
changed immeasurably over the last five
years so I think we can
came from a point where we were actually
pretty open and then we kind of got less
less than open and now man we just open
sores pretty much everything so all the
way from our developer tools to the.net
framework to visualization frameworks to
a whole range of things out there have
really gone open source so we understand
kind of the open source world for
software but what's happening is that
open source has happening to the
hardware hardware world as well and
that's one of the other things that's
happening so you'll find that things
like Arduino is there an open source
reference for open source hardware
reference I could take that reference
implementation and I might have a great
idea and go manufacture my own Arduino
is with some sort of you know whistles
and bells on it and I could do that
quite legitimately I could take that
that fab design and then go from
manufacturer so those are some of the
big things and the other thing is this
kind of this maker movement its kind of
happening again and I think we've kind
of we've gone from a point where we
think about computing we know a lot of
the kids with nowadays I think we a lot
of us complain odd i can use power porn
XL but actually they do they understand
how two computers work and I think
there's this whole move back towards
stem you know the science technology
engineering maths and people getting
back to building stuff again and I think
we're seeing that whole revolution
happening as well where people want to
get out there and you've only got to
look around on YouTube and it is just
full of this stuff that people are going
on and it's just building up and
building up a knowledge base that people
can actually get out there and build
things so to give you an idea what we're
trying to do with within the Microsoft
kind of vision of things it's about so
we're building out platforms a client
based platforms which can make sure
neighbor you to get that data and to go
to get that data into the system and
then start being able to build things
out there so but something to understand
what their value of that data is so
that's fundamental water and that's a
lot of what we're providing in our cloud
services being around power bi or stream
analytics or storage or all these types
of things it's fundamentally what we're
trying to do in terms of our overall
goal is to really harness the
intelligence out there
in these systems and really what we're
trying to say is for organizations and
I'm sure maybe organizations your end
they're thinking about this Internet of
Things and our general advice and
guidance is try not to boil the ocean
try and come up with an idea that you
can say look if I could change one thing
in my business what would it be and I
like a gap there bit of that data rather
than try and sell we could do this and
this and this and this and across the
organisation wouldn't be fantastic our
real goal is to try and find one thing
out there that you can kind of do and
then hence where you try to see it this
whole idea of intended of your things
and in terms of the opportunity now
these numbers vary I have to confess two
years ago I was using a number i think
was 200 billion devices by 2020 and this
number has been rounded down and now to
round about 25 billion devices by 2020
and is actually a reasonably achievable
number and I'll show you why in a moment
and i took a rough number of three
percent so I think Australia's around
about three percent of GDP and I know
this you can't miss to say well we got
three percent gdp we're going to have
three percent of the Internet of Things
devices but just just go with it I think
I came to about three quarters of a
billion devices in Australia and you
might be thinking like who the hell is
going to be using all these devices out
here and to give you a sense of where
that might be and I'll talk about this
in a moment where he obvious yep
so over that to give you a sense of what
we're doing we have something like 125
buildings on our campuses which we have
internet enabled and we get something
like what does that half a billion data
points per day of information about
what's going on how are buildings been
used so we can control things I air
conditioning and lights and all those
types of things and we save around about
ten percent now when I talked about this
number about this 25 billion number one
of the biggest things I see in Australia
and this is we kind of made about the
point when I talk to people about
Internet of Things it's often about
agriculture so it's often about being a
track animals there was a there's a
project in Victoria which is looking at
which actually does this they put little
sensors on the back of bees and they
actually track where they're going
around does anyone know why we're doing
that anyway what's it the dying out your
bees it's a fundamental problem to
agriculture probably to our lifestyles
to our life and given that we're so
dependent on bees pollinating everything
is that bees are dying out and so this
infinite of things project was literally
put these little I effectively an NFC
tag on the back of these bees what you
have to confess I think probably
contributes to their dying out and they
were basically flying around and they're
looking to understand where these bees
are going so when you start thinking
about agriculture you try to think about
the mining industry finance sector here
in Australia is big as well these are
kind of where our numbers come from so
clearly most of us are kind of either
carrying phones which are maybe tracking
our steps or we've got fit bits or what
about the device out there we've got all
these things out here so it doesn't take
too long for all these devices of course
we're getting down to very small and
very cheap devices so this is kind of
where the opportunities now the finance
sector is absolutely ripe as well for
Internet of Things and again when I talk
to people
it's in the space and again the examples
will talk about a real so for example in
the finance in the in the insurance
sector you can pay a lower premium if
you're willing to share data about how
you drive or maybe you live in a flood
prone area so you maybe you've got a
sensor in there which looks at potential
flooding and so that you get early
warning on flooding there's a whole
range of things out there from health
for a loan health if I'm were prepared
to demonstrate that I walk 10,000 steps
a day for example I might get a lower
premium flooding the in the US I think
it's General Motors and Ford now
instrument their data and submit their
cars i should say and they are streaming
i think it was something like 25 gigs a
day of data from all the cars across the
u.s. and for the clothes makes and
models so they get the whole whole
ability to better get preventive
maintenance hey that the car is playing
up with the emissions are high or
something like that maybe she can get
the car checked out but so those are
kind of some of the opportunities now in
terms of what we're doing around windows
10 so hopefully you all appreciate that
what we've been doing is trying to get
to one platform one API so you go and
build a Windows application on Windows
10 it'll rain run across a range of
things from hollow lens to raspberry
PI's to embedded devices to desktops to
tablets to phones and so that's kind of
what we're trying to do with with the
the platform the other focus of what
we're doing is around security and
obviously enterprises really care about
security and they care about it on their
desktop there Kevin on the kiosk and
they care about it all the way down to
the smallest devices and that's really
kind of what we focused on is making
sure that all the technologies that we
build around security or software
patching or all these types of things
are available from the Raspberry Pi
product and I've got and sitting inside
this robot all the way up to the largest
financial control system so we kind of
treat all those technologies go into the
box and a
part of the part of the deal and the
other thing is really about being
connected clearly that's kind of what
the internet of things about and be
about it be able to do that security and
things like that so we've got the
universe of platform so not only have we
done the universal platform for
application so from a software
developers perspective we can go and
build an application application across
these platforms but from a an OEM
original equipment manufacturers
perspective they can go and write device
drivers once and they will work across
all of Windows 10 being on armed be on
an x86 be on x64 so that's the other
thing that we're done with Windows
Windows 10 again is just to make that
more accessible from people building
applications to people are building
system level and I've kind of talked
about all these things now we have a
number of editions of Windows 10 what we
call IOT so we have ask you now so you
have basically desktop on your phone and
things like that but we had now have it
and this used to live in the embedded
world so if you have been around
Microsoft for a while and you're kind of
wondered where you know an enterprise
embedded version rent and here because
Microsoft pulled out of the market no we
have absolutely not it's morphed into
Windows 10 IOT enterprise and it's there
for driving process control systems and
kind of enterprise-grade things out
there and there's often a legacy a
significant legacy of applications and
control systems and experience and all
these types of things so on that
platform we support win32 application so
native windows cydia win32 applications
plus we support managed applications so
the universal Windows platform based
applications so as I said it's really
targeted towards enterprises and process
control systems it would be the kind of
stuff you'd find in an attaching lathe
for example or you know those types of
really kind of big and big industrial
types of things now the other thing we
have and again we've had this for quite
a while it was under the
platform but we have the synced Windows
10 IOT for mobile and again this clearly
one iteration of that is the mobile
phone there's one SKU of that but also
you also Windows IOT mobile goes into
lots of other devices so things like
they're scanning for retail systems you
know what are you go and do a stock
check those the types of systems that
would have Windows 10 IOT mobile built
into them and then people go and build
their applications on top of that so
hand our devices but you're really
looking at running uwp applications only
now the one at the bottom it here is the
one on most again talked about and this
is called Windows 10 IOT core now
Windows 10 IOT core is a free of charge
license there is no cost you can go up
to the up to the up and to dev windows
com / IOT and you can freely down
download the ISO for it and you can
build it you can manufacture it you can
do your heart's content and get out
there so the enterprise versions cost
but mobile versions cost but that IOT
core is a free of charge license I will
talk about there isn't there was a
slight skew on them no pun intended in a
moment and as I said down here it's
optimized for small footprint down to
quite a quite a second syllable small
footprint it can run really i can run
background tasks uwp background tasks
and you can run the kind like a kiosk
application so a single shell of you
want which could be a uwp application
and it's built on low-cost silicon now
apologies I just wanted to double-check
something yes ok cool I have got it here
so we did announced in the last version
the last push of of Windows 10 which I
think was around about November some
1505 i think it was it have happened in
February or November kind of in that
range and we did introduce another skew
for Windows 10 IOT core and that's
really for OEM
so diff I step back a moment so the
Windows 10 IOT core that I talked about
which is free of charge you can download
it that fully participates in windows
update which you might say that's a
fantastic thing I really you know I all
software being from Microsoft or
wherever and variably needs to be
patched I think if you see I think the
expressions recants if you can't patch
it you can secure it so those platform
that platform automatically participates
in Windows Update now there are some
scenarios which you might say we'll hang
about it doesn't suit me for Microsoft
to go and push out of Windows Update I'm
running this application and retailer
for example and there's no way that I
want anyone to touch my system when I'm
going into the Christmas period because
it's a retail system and everything's
locked down so we brought out a special
skew for OEMs that you can get hold or
through OEMs which is kind which is a
very small fee no I can't remember but
I'm talking the dollars and then that
one there there is the ability to
control the update for precisely the
reason I said before that some
organizations just want to be able to
control the release cycles the patching
that goes on to these devices just
because there are some often some very
critical times out there 484
applications ok so I've kind of touched
upon IOT and a touch deport I OT core
and I've touched upon the OEM skew of
that which you got more control over the
update process now for most of us when
we're building stuff I'm assuming is
everyone heard a raspberry pi I'm
getting so yeah and I'm hoping you all
know that Windows 10 you can download
for free you can put it on here
Raspberry Pi raspberry pi 2 and above
and you can go and build applications
for that now in terms of and that's
great so but in terms of commercial
platforms what we do when we go and
build when we go and build Windows 10
IOT core we build it for 342 platano 41
platform and to system on a chips to
system-on-a-chip platforms so we go and
build Windows 10 IOT core for the
Qualcomm Snapdragon we go and build up
for the system on a chip Intel Atom e
3800 and we go and build up for the
platform which is different we go and
build up for the whole Raspberry Pi so
the idea behind it is I could be an OEM
and there are a lot of OEM so going out
in building it so I could be an oem say
look I've relationship with in town I've
done it for years I'm going to go
Windows 10 IOT core on an embedded board
that I've been selling out to retail for
forever and I'm going to put Windows 10
IOT core on that or maybe and we're
going to go on Qualcomm so those are the
kind of differences so these have
traditionally and these are your
traditional kind of folk who go out
there bill commercial systems embedded
systems and they're going to do it and
we go and build Windows 10 IOT core for
that now we go and build obviously
Windows 10 IOT core for I'm based on
Raspberry Pi but the Raspberry Pi is
different because we go and build for
everything on that board we build for
i/o we build up for video out we build
out for networking hold the whole you
know the thing that the operating system
does and so we go and build out that and
then people can go out there now the
reality is that all these boards here
these boards here i'm showing all have
developer version developer board
versions of their platforms except for
raspberry pi raspberry pi 1 and Sondra
so r as we pay these are developer
boards and yes there's nothing to stop
you're going out to the market and with
the Raspberry Pi based solution and I
know a number of partners who actually
going to do that said look we've looked
at the construction and of the Raspberry
Pi as it stands and we like it meets our
needs are going to put an SD card
builder application and we're going to
put it out to market and there are some
people really doing that and people also
doing out in these other platforms what
you can do and what we kind of recommend
for the Raspberry Pi is you go and talk
to element 17 no element 14 I'm sorry
yeah and you see and you go to them and
say look I'm
building for the Raspberry Pi platform
and I don't want to ship it out on the
the retail version of the Raspberry Pi I
want you to go and build me one which
it's got I know four gigs of ram and
it's got two gigs of flash memory built
in and it's going to have this network
peripherals and things like that so you
go to the element guys and say look can
you go and build me this and I'm going
to build my application and put it onto
that platform and then I go out to
market with that now the reality is that
takes more money and it takes more time
so I do know that there are partners out
there just going out and raspberry pi
but just kind of care to keep in mind
that raspberry pi really as a developer
board wasn't really designed to put out
into production but people aren't doing
it but you really go to element and say
look I want to go and build these
platforms okay so the next thing I want
to talk about is what we're doing around
security so we have the same level of
security all the way from boot so from
secure boot all the way up through the
stacks or all the drivers and all that
type of thing assigned so we have secure
boot and a know if you know pressure
under Windows 10 that's how it works but
the bootloader loads up and then we'll
only load in security signed drivers and
you're basing it a stack which is only
made up of certified and signed drivers
that's kind of how Windows well it's the
whole idea is you can't go what you know
low-level drivers and their to go and do
key log chemo because and things like
that the other thing about it is we also
amazing enough have BitLocker support in
Windows 10 IOT core now you do need a
TPM so I gosh remember that TV
understands or a trusted platform module
and that was something that would
typically be built in by an OEM and
there would be a key on that and then
you would go and encrypt the disk on
your Windows IOT core platform and
you'll get a fully secure boot stack and
you get fully cured fully secured
encrypted storage which is just amazing
on a device that's really kind of a very
much a commodity
device you get all the cryptographic
support you get Windows Update support
all those types of things you get
universal memory so Universal Windows
applications you kind of get the whole
capability model all those types of
things that we kind of want with my
building things o manage memory and
signed executables and all those types
of things so that's kind of the
investment we've taken those whole
investments out they were booting into
windows and take it down to pretty much
free platforms out there on the on these
types of things now kind of touched on
this I think this is probably even
getting it to be a bit old news now but
I'm hoping most of you now appreciate
that the whole push behind Microsoft
over the last five years is to converge
the platforms and we really are there
pretty much do the main platform out
there which is really managed to
converge the ball down to one pretty
much one API the universal platform api
so be at phone be at Windows 10 desktop
tablets and Windows IOT core to hold a
lens the things you can put across the
air have those kind of virtual virtual
reality type of experiences so in terms
of building applications what do you
need so you're go and build out there
for universal platform you need visual
studio you can get the Community Edition
which is free so if you're a home
hobbyist and hacking you want to play
all those you can get all the tools out
there for free you need the Windows 10
IOT SDK which is licensed free you can
build two styles of applications you can
build headed applications and headless
applications so headed application be
like a kiosk app you come along the end
you maybe you got a touch screen on it
you go tap tap tap tap where you've got
a keyboard and you kind of build out an
experience headless applications are
really just background so there's no UI
involved a movie just providing data
collection service and things are bad
there's a web management interface and
for the real diehards and a she's pretty
cool and I'm not sure I'd be a
PowerShell expert but you can PowerShell
into these things and you can manage
them or you can ssh into them and you
can remotely manage them with dual those
kinds of things so you can kind of do
all the things you expect and better
want to better do
okay so what I'm going to do in a couple
month of demos so the place to get
started is absolutely dev 1.com / IOT
and up there there's a nice wizard for a
get started and all that kind of stuff
and you can click on those links and
download the LSO's and download the
dashboards all those types of things now
the other place that I love and I musta
made there's spend way too much time on
this side is hackster dot io does anyone
else spend time on hexter ok cool well
if you want to learn a bit about the
making humidity and what people are
building all those types of things then
head to hex texture Hexter calm so
there's two ways you can get it you can
head to Hexter diode hexton yeah
microsoft xtube.com and that'll take you
up to the website and then people like
myself and i do publish up there we
publish our software we publish about
hardware design all these types of
things and then people kind of get to
share it and we're going to get it share
it out there so it's a great place in
great set of resources now in terms of
languages now the make it den that will
get out the back are all c-sharp based
labs but like building for the universal
Windows platform you can pretty much use
not every language about a lot of
languages out there so you can go and
build applications and c-sharp C++
Python mode vb.net for the real diehards
there's a full remote debugging
experience which is just amazing so if
you've done any embedded development
you'll appreciate the lack of remote
debugging so you the idea is that
invariably you want to better debug
something Institute because it's got the
sensors on you want to find out where
the heck is this code going wrong so
from visual studio you can basically set
breakpoints the code executes on the
device and the debugger work specially
backwards and forwards on network by the
way i would thoroughly recommend you to
do that over ethernet because doing over
Wi-Fi it's a bit subversive language the
other thing that we've got on there is
we have extensions for uwp and we stand
we expose out kind of all the governance
or although the hardware interfaces on
platform so we said we need you to get a
general purpose input output points
ports and there is something called I to
see or I squared C or have you come from
which is a standard bus mechanism so you
can have multiple I to see devices or
basically sitting on a bus with
different addresses and you can say I
want to talk to the temperature sensor
which lives on a dress on a 75 and
another one which made lives or 90 all
those types of things you can talk to
spi pulse width and universal
asynchronous and received transmission
the other thing that we also support is
arduino wiring libraries so there's a
vast library of software out there
collection software but people are built
for the Arduino platform and you can use
that on the on Windows 10 IOT so you can
basically import them now it's not going
to be true that you can bring in any
Arduino arbitrary Arduino project does
anyone know why Java no okay it's a bit
of skill it's obvious cube until you
start doing add we know and all these
platforms are often really timing
sensitive so Arduino is not a
multitasking operating system it is a
hard real-time operating system and a
lot of that code runs with the
expectation that it is the only thing
running on that better hardware whereas
Windows 10 is a general-purpose
operating system and there might be
memory management going there might be
someone doing our network traffic might
be blah blah blah going on you can't
guarantee timing so there are kind of so
that those are the reasons there can be
some Arduino libraries which you get a
port across beautifully because maybe
they talked to another hardware device
which is not particularly timing
sensitive and there's a lot of work
being investment of the for software in
that and you can bring that across now
the other couple of things in here
they're really quite unique um the one
of the first one you are talking about
is speech services so built into Windows
10 IOT core is both voice recognition
and synthesis of voice
works really well um it's nothing to do
with the clouds I don't do with Cort on
or anything like that and there's a
speech recognition built into it and and
it really does kind of work you give it
a vocabulary so you need to constrain it
it can't go and understand every you
know sentence and language and
everything out there this synthesis is
amazing as well you give it a string of
text / 0 you know a reasonable string of
text and it will go and read it back to
you and it works stunningly well the
other thing that we've put into Windows
10 again across the black platform is
this thing called all join now how many
people heard of all join when a couple
of hands going up there okay so all join
has come out of the all seen alliance
and it's a really important is trying to
address a really important platform
issue with Internet of Things and that
is basically their lack of
interoperability so if I go and take
someone's IOT project from hitachi
someone's from LG someone's from Apple
someone's from Microsoft sometimes on
Google you can imagine all these
products out there that are all talking
often quite proprietary proprietary
protocols you know turn the light switch
is on and not be quite a proprietary
mechanism by which my phone might talk
to a back-end switch to flick the light
on so all seen are the all seen alliance
and the old join Alliance is around is
an industry-wide move to address this
interoperability issue and interesting
enough i think in 2015 it was the most
successful open source platform now does
anyone know who is sponsored by and give
in mind that we put all this technology
into windows its spawn expansive by the
linux foundation and it's just amazing
I've been a Microsoft for over 20 years
now and I have to say just to see that
change its going on so we are actually
working with these industry groups and
in this case it's been driven by the
Linux Foundation
about how to solve this interoperability
issue so i can go order a range of
different manufacturers out there and i
can go and start to interoperate it's
not going to solve everything but it
solves a lot of those kind of issues so
when I say Microsoft has change and I
talked about before open source it's
fascinating to see what we're doing
taking those technologies that we're
working with the industry contributing
into these open source Linux Foundation
and enroll in there that technology into
windows and that's really kind of what's
going on so I'm going to give you a very
quick demo and it's really just to give
you a sense of how the stuff works so
the first thing I've got up there you
can see I've got this little gizmo and
on top of it there is an ultrasonic
sensor and I'll show you kind of what
and basically it's sitting on top of a
servo and it's going backwards and
forwards and backwards and forwards and
it's just recording the distance and if
I come down here there was an
application now so you can what i'm
doing here is normally I would have the
output being displayed over HDMI but
that kind of gets a bit messy so what
we've done to effectively done remote
desktop for Windows IOT core and you can
now do remote display of your UI to be
building out some sort of you I
experienced way and it's kind of stopped
and started I think I might be doing it
over Wi-Fi which is probably a little
bit much let me just go back over here
so no scope and we connect up to it okay
and if I come in front of it and I stand
in front of the ultrasonic sensor you'll
see they've picked me up those orange
dots and literally it's like a bat and
it's sending out singles is there
anything there and I think it measures
up to about 3 meters I think that was a
reasonable reasonable distance and it's
a and just picking up and then I'm just
using standard Windows 10 you I
technologies it's as a more based
application so if you're familiar with
going into blend
building out an application for Windows
10 that's what is running here and it's
just using some open source controls
which are little pie charts and
essentially 123456 pie charts that are
done to get that kind of radar effect so
that's kind of how this applications
running and I said it's just sitting
there chugging away now the other thing
and I know if you can get and close
enough I can well hey it did work so
hoping hoping this would be a nice easy
way of demonstrating their stuff now
this kind of builds on a point I made
before is that Windows 10 is a
general-purpose operating system and
some things require really hard timing
so for example to turn the servo
backwards and forwards you basically
sanded a pulse of a different length so
if the pulse is slightly longer it would
turn it would change the position by
which the server will change and it
needs a really precise timing so you can
see Justin here if I move my mouse over
there see that little gizmo on top what
that is it's a little hard we know chip
and what I've done is I've built a
little application which is running on
the Arduino and it's talking over I to
see and I to see it's just like ethernet
it's just like a bar siegen basis in
messages backwards and forwards so my
windows 10 application which is a
general-purpose operator operating
system and it's not fabulous at doing
really really precise timing so
basically what I do from windows channel
I hand off to the Arduino and say hey
look I want a pulse of seventy percent
in this case a duration and it would
move the move the server around seventy
percent and that's kind of how this
stuff works now what I also decided if I
didn't I didn't really have to do this
but I did in the end I want to hack
around with them I also send a command
from Windows 10 to the Arduino to point
to ask the ultrasonics distance to do
its measurement so actually I actually
offload quite a lot except for that UI
which you can see I'm here so that there
are doing on Windows 10
mostly just responsible and not even
doing that particularly well because i
think it's just pushing it over Wi-Fi so
windows 10 in this case here is really
just responsible for the user interface
and it's responsible so every time it
kind of every second every two seconds I
think it might be no in between every
second i move two degrees I just send a
message off to the Arduino over ITC so
move the servo two degrees and then
while you're at it I want you to do the
measurement and then I want you to
return back the result back to me and
that's kind of how this stuff works so
that's a great example where if you're
building out applications and variably
you need to mix technologies for these
things based on kind of scenarios so the
other thing i want to show is the the
remote desktop so this is the the
windows 10 portal and you can see if i
can come into here and you can get what
version of windows 10 i'm on and i think
this will automatically update tonight
or tomorrow to affect that is the
release build i believe and you can i
can come in here and i can see the apps
that are running so you can see these
are the apps so you can see this thing
down here called solar scope distance
mapper it's a foreground app and i can
set it to be the default app and I've
got other applications which could be
the background I can go and look at
things I performance and you can see
there's really not an awful lot going on
on this plate on this demo on the device
because you remember i said i'm handing
off most of it to the Arduino i can go
and look at i/o most that i owe is
probably the fact that I'm remotely
demonstrating the the UI is probably not
really much I on going on there and you
can go and see the amount of memory and
things like that that's been used now
one of the limitations that we have on
Raspberry Pi is that we only have the
basic display driver build we don't have
an accelerator driver I believe that we
are we have kind of said we will do it
but we don't have it yet
so do be aware that when you're building
zamel based applications don't go crazy
because there's a software renderer you
can go and look at the network you can
go and look at bluetooth what bluetooth
devices or audio devices and if i can go
i can go into TPM i might have a real us
BTW p.m. for example when i talked about
that trusted platform module and down
the bottom there is a sing for remote
and I've enabled with a Windows IOT
remote server which is basically allow
me to do this remote display so that's
the first demo day I want to show you
now the next demo the next demo I want
to talk about is mostly about all join
and what I'm going to go into is I've
got this application up here and it's
called the iot explorer for all join and
it is a generic or join listener it just
goes out from the network and one
basically if anyone doesn't broadcast
say I'm an all joined it will pick up
those messages and say okay and then
just presents a list of all the devices
that are all joining and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go across to the
SONA scope and you'll see that the SONA
scope has four interfaces and three
methods and surprise surprise it gots
died and stopping there plus about
speech in there as well but so if i come
across here and just minimize that up
over here
and I'm going to go and hit the all join
method on that and invoke it ahead stop
so what I've done here as I've used a
general purpose or join Explorer and you
can see I'm interacting with this
application on the platform here which
is an all join enabled out which and we
show you in a moment now clearly this is
not the application you were put out to
your consumers you'd go and build a nice
phone application on Android iOS or
Windows or whatever it was and you go
and build that but this is really just
to demonstrate that this really is a
universal so I could have an air
conditioning unit from LG or attach your
some that which might be all join or hue
lights I think hue lights are all join
enabled I can have those in my house
sitting the Wi-Fi and they would expose
out or join interfaces and that's how
you can kind of connect to these things
work so I just shut that down and I'll
just for a moment yeah so we'll keep
that so I hope you've got a bit of a
sense of that now the next project i
want to show ya actually I'll just jump
across get back into the or join
Explorer now what I've got is another
project over here and I'll put this in
front of a camera and it's the same
principle in this case here I've got a
little robot and yet the robot and
things are that's hardly enterprise but
it is also all join enabled and in this
case I did actually go and build an app
and it's called Rover Rover let me just
go and double check that that really was
yeah and you can see for a moment and
then there should go lose the gray so
this would be an example here where i
built out an app which is now talking
over the all join protocol and you can
see if I kind of snap that over there
then if I go forward you can see Walla
and I go left right stop
reverse yadda yadda and I can obviously
because it's it's actually bridged over
my phone from terms of networking said
you know we could Rove its way around
here but the important thing i want to
show get across there is that it's all
join that's doing that tech bet interop
and you can see you can go and build out
an experience to go and do that and what
I wanted to show very briefly sorry I
should have had this loaded now in this
project I've got some XML yeah the world
can't get enough XML and what this is is
that this is a definition of all join so
in here you can see apologies if I make
it a little bit bigger not for this is
that exciting but I showed you the user
interface for that I showed you from the
audience pleura so it's basically just a
bit of XML would you go and describe the
methods in this case I've gotta start
stop and speech I could also go and
define properties and I can also define
events and your german world they call
them signals and you might have some in
which as i know it's got hot it's
overheated you might want to send a
signal across your application which
would throw an event in your application
you say he'd change that to read send a
message get somebody into to look at
understand what's going on with the
other temperature and if i come across
over here that i'm going to try this now
the thing that i've installed and here
is the all join obvi you go and go into
Visual Studio goes into tools extensions
and updates and then here you'll see the
installed one it's called all join
studio and you install the or join
studio and that a neighbor that adds up
this new interface up here and what I
can do and we'll try this for a bit of
fun
yeah so what I did there are two ways
you can do this you can either go out
into your network and basically ask look
for all the or join capable device of
chip sending our broadcasts and you can
see I've got one here for my rover so
there goes the 14 / and the other one is
my sonar so those are the two all join
xml there's effectively you could go and
inquire on them it will pull back the
xml from those from those devices and
then inside Visual Studio we will create
all the libraries for you and then give
you nice and defaces into those into
those capabilities so that's kind of how
that works or you go and build you're
going browse your own one and click on
OK and you go and put that in and yeah
so that those are two ways you can
either build your XML you can go out and
choir on your join libraries out there
and go and build them alrighty is so or
join me and I don't think you can
underestimate really the power of that
and that it's interop it's a costly
industry go up into the all seen
Alliance website and there are hundreds
of manufacturers who are part of
participating in this overall iot
interop and it deals with device
discovery security all those types of
things it magically does all that for
years part of that overall specification
and this is just your join example that
I've ever just showing you now one of
the things that you really must have you
do play around with this technology and
I think I lost half a day on this is
that you must give your application the
all join capability so inside Visual
Studio you can go into the package
manifesto I think whatever it is you go
along there to capabilities tab and
you'll see that it was all join so
you've got and run these demos you go
back and coughed up your own and you
wonder why the hell are exceptions on a
security or capability so you must go
and give your all join
application I've done that okay and then
kind of one last thing I like to give a
bit of a plug for this platform so for a
lot of people building something like
this arduino based so no scope of things
that is really way more pain that you
really want to go and do maybe they were
just level one of the great ways are
getting on board with Windows 10 IOT
core is with something called Grove pie
is anyone heard of Grove these kind of
us kind of like a it's not a standard
but it's become like a de facto standard
I guess and there's a standard set of
plugs and you whole range of sensors out
there and there's everyone and people
got out and written the drivers for them
that's the thing that you want drivers
for these things so people written the
drivers for the ultrasonic sound sensors
and all those types of things and the
USU and build out the application you
get in there The Grove pi drivers into
your visual studio project plug in your
devices into Grove pie and voila you can
start building your application so if
you really don't want to monkey around
with hardware and you say look I've got
this idea I want to play around with
other things of that it will make your
kids something that you want to get
involved then really recommend you go
I'm going to kind of go down that line
now in terms of in terms of getting
started as I said dev windows com a
chayote Microsoft hexed is a great place
drivers you invariably when you're going
to look at a project you want to kind of
say well I want to go and do distance I
want to go do temperature I want to go
into humidity or whatever it is you very
need to make sure that their device
drivers out there for windows that
people have written or we have written
or other people written so you'll find
is a whole stack of drive it out and
github.com / MS hyphen IOT and I write a
whole over in the whole lot of drivers
as well so i'm up at the own github
glove boxes and i published my drivers
up on to new get and i think this guy
poori had done a whole lot of stuff
around you as well but basically when
you start thinking about your
applications make sure that there are
device drivers out there the other
question I kind of get asked about is
where do I kind of buy stuff from and
Peter suspect you all got different
places I tend to hunt around our ebay
and amazon a great place
little bird electronics is based here in
New South Wales tronix lab is based in
Victoria call out can't remember their
blood maybe even Perth our risk
components are everywhere element14 and
J cars those places you typically if
you're looking for something or ebay by
far the cheapest to be happy to wait for
month to six weeks and you can get up
for like a fraction of the price if you
want it note now you go up to tonic
slabs or my RS Components or these folk
and you can kind of get started with
with the technology from those guys and
that's really the session so hope you
give you a bit of a sense what we're
doing around Windows 10 IOT core it's as
whole as I said instead of embedded
sitting outside of the windows and it's
part of Windows it ameritz all the
technology the release cycles are the
same so when we bring out the
anniversary update for Windows 10 voila
the the anniversary update will appear
on my raspberry pi as well as that all
those technologies all the security all
the patches all those types of things
they invariably end up the smallest
devices and cheapest devices as well
language of your choice you can be part
of it you know in terms of kind of
getting involved as I said there's an
IOT lab out the back so that if you want
to have a bit of a play around with it
just kind of give things ago and fire it
up and that's pretty much it so are
there any questions yeah yep
oh absolutely no you have classes so you
you would only subscribe to the stuff
that you are interested in if you were
like manufactured then your application
would only talk to the lights yeah yeah
I'm I think you could use knowledge on
that you'd go and one you're going to
use security I look if you tire down the
security on it you can put in to the
platform you could go and distribute a
key for example and you could be a whole
lots of different ways you might say
okay I've got in there um yeah so the
way you'll probably work and you
probably connect overall join you're
probably go and set a property on the
platform on the device and on that
setting that platform it might be the
key the shared key or whatever it is and
then any methods would have to provide
you know the other part of their key to
batygin so you gonna do you go in two
ways out that but really this whole
thing about all joint is its kind of
universal fabric and then you can go and
build stuff out there for it's
absolutely it's a fantastic initiative
I'm not saying everybody's on board with
it by any stretch but a lot of people
are and it really is a really well
voluntary worth looking at already I
think that's pretty much it I've got a
funny feeling I'm probably due to start
my next session bad now and given us any
me and i throw over run okay so the next
session here will be about more kind of
services side and I can I give you a
flavor of that but anyway I think we're
finished and if you want to stay stay in
a few next sessions thank you very much
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
