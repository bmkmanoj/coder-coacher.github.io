thank you to our sponsors today my name
is Christina Alden on Twitter and
Instagram
I am lucky girly girl if you wanted to
continue the conversation online its
hashtag lucky UX design must seduce
shape and more importantly evoke an
emotional response I love this quote
from April griemann she's a designer if
we were to define user experience it is
an international standard it's a
person's perceptions and responses that
results from the use or anticipated use
of a product system or service there is
a difference between user interface and
user experience Jayne Miller sums this
up really well the UI is a saddle the
stirrups and the reins the UX is the
feeling you get being able to ride the
horse and rope your cattle here are some
examples the UI is the app icon on your
smartphone the UX is how pleasurable it
is for clients to press the icon their
response time and also how often they
press the icon another example the UI is
a newsletter system that you use to
communicate with your clients and the UX
is a client's emotional response how
often they engage how long it takes them
to reply to you
and there are multiple influencing
factors when we speak about user
experience the system the user and the
context of use all of these things are
the resultant emotional response to your
brand and the different elements to user
experience marketing branding visual
design usability so why is it important
well we want to create services and
products that are simple that are
valuable and are effective because as
designers and architects of the future
we have an opportunity to play a
powerful role in constructing reality
and improving humanity's experience on
this planet design can be reactionary
responding only to current conditions or
it can be visionary by presenting
solutions to problems yet undefined
I'm just kidding everybody I'm not going
to make you sit through an entire hour
of this presentation but I think I made
my point your user experience is
included at every level of your business
your products your services your
employees your interactions with your
brand's I represent five brands for most
of you this is the first time that
you've ever seen me today how was your
first user experience with those five
Browns my name is Christina Alden I'm
lucky girly-girl on Twitter and
Instagram and I'd love it if we continue
the conversation on Twitter with hashtag
lucky UX thanks so much NDC oz was my
first year here it's fantastic so
amazing conference and I'm really glad
to be invited thanks so much to all of
our sponsors so you know user experience
it creates life experience and life
experiences are what it's all about
right a lot of people talk about you
know money's everything I'm all about
creating awesome experiences that's how
we do it in our family and that's how I
do it in my work that's how I do it in
my team's user experience creates life
experience and people are not
remembering this I think that sometimes
we think that it's just the interface
right it's just the icon or it's just
the website and that's not true because
your user experience people are engaging
at every single touch point of your
brand so we're going to talk about that
today if you have any questions please
interrupt please ask questions I'm an
interrupter I get excited about things
and I like to ask questions so you know
creating a seamless shopping experience
engaging with your brand right up to the
point that people put the money in your
bank
it's got to be seamless and it's got to
be a pleasurable pleasant experience so
let's talk about why
people engage all their values their
emotions oops go back their values their
emotions their motivations that all of
that sums right up in this teeny tiny
little window for user experience often
times people think about values and
sometimes we include motivations too but
we're not thinking about the emotions
when we're talking about that I'd speak
a lot about emotional intelligence
that's a whole different talk but you
know I'd like to make sure that as we're
talking about this today you're thinking
about the user experience as the
emotions that all the different touch
points of your brand's your products
your services so where they engage phone
calls online social media in meetings
with swagg right how many people have
been in the conference and you picked up
on a Jinky pen that doesn't work and
you're like oh you've gotten throw the
pen out right because you want to make
sure that every single touch point with
your brand with your logo with your
products with your services is
pleasurable and even your swag even your
employees even at conferences these are
all various touch points that people
have opportunities to engage with your
brand so make sure that those user
experiences are pleasant here are the
different elements we're going to talk
about these today and then I have a few
little examples and suggestions for
resources but you know a lot goes into
it a lot goes into the user experience
and so let's just talk about the first
one here brand identity business culture
your core values brand messaging your
logo design so who here has specified
core values at their company you you
have them your owner your manager your
employee okay so about half of us and
who here can recite them who knows them
all right away offhand nobody know a few
yes so you know here's the thing
core values tell people what your
company is all about they tell people
the story of your brand and you know
they tell people what your top
priorities are
and you know how those those core values
are expressed they come through every
little touch point of your brand so
let's talk about core values a little
bit here's a great example from
Dartmouth College
they have three main core values that
they focus on results orientation donor
focus and teamwork now they have a few
other little subcategories that go under
that but it's very very simple they are
if it doesn't fall into this then it's
probably not going to be a good fit for
Dartmouth everything that they do
focuses around these core values here's
another example at Zappos I'm from Las
Vegas and in Las Vegas we have Zappos
headquarters they have ten core values
now I think ten is a little bit overkill
but I'll tell you what every single
employee at Zappos they all know what
these core values are they can all
recite them because they're on the wall
because they're in their meetings
because it's how they do business
it's how they treat their employees it's
how they communicate with people and
their customer service they're excellent
they're at customer service
so Zappos does core values really really
well in that all of the at every single
level of their business these core
values are expressed here's another
great example Quicken Loans is obsessed
with finding a better way and so for our
clients our communities our team members
we're obsessed with finding a better way
that's their core value and look it
shows you can go to any glass store this
was taken from a great place to work
every single one of the across the board
ninety seven ninety eight ninety four
ninety because their employees are super
happy Quicken Loans treats their
employees very well they treat their
customers very well I am a customer I
have some of my best friends who are
lead engineers at Quicken Loans and they
do a maze and amazing job at
illustrating their core values
consistently throughout their brand even
when we had a problem as a customer
instantly their leaders their management
team their c-level team got on the phone
with
and corrected the the errors with our
mortgage these guys are doing a terrific
job in the way that they support their
culture it within and also without
internally and externally and and the
ratings are like this across the board
consistently this is my cellphone number
if anybody wants a I have an example of
some core values test that you can test
at your company to see if your people
actually know your core values and how
well you're doing so if you guys want
the information I also can give you
copying my slide deck and I have some
other resources that I can send you so
if you want to text me you know let me
know it's interesting to think about
when people think they have core values
but just having them in a little
handbook on that first day where people
sign it off and they say oh yeah we get
core values we're good we're great
people don't think a lot of the time
about how they're also living those core
values and an demoting them throughout
their their brand and consistency is
what makes or breaks that right so
having the same brand message at every
single touch point of your brand your
logo your products your website your
social media your ads they used to tell
us in marketing I own a digital
advertising agency they used to tell us
that people had to see things seven
times before it sinks into our skulls
right all those seven times will ignore
it four of those times so seven times
but now with digital advertising and all
of this stuff that we're constantly
being distracted twenty-one times so
people have to see it twenty-one times
before it actually sticks in there in
their brain so make sure that that
consistency is ongoing throughout and
here are some examples
googled one of their core values it's
best to do one thing really really well
so what do they do they do one thing
really really well that's what they
started with so they just have a very
very simple plain search bar very simple
Dell one of theirs is we strive to make
sure that
everyone in any environment can take
advantage of technology and we're
constantly curious we never stop trying
to get smarter to find smarter ways to
get things done so you know they
instituted the bring your own device
policy right bring your own device to
work and they wanted everybody to have
access to whatever kinds of technology
they used at home and at work
iBM is innovation that matters for a
company and for the world so what did
they bring us Watson in in so many of
these brands we're seeing at all the
various touch points how they're
illustrating their core values for
Rackspace results first and substance
over flash so you know they focus on
speed they focus on speed over over
fancy shiny things and of course you
know Zappos back in Las Vegas what they
do their whole thing is about treating
their culture and their customers well
so that everybody is having fun and I'll
tell you on any given day in downtown
Las Vegas you're sitting at a coffee
shop or you're hanging out you never
know what's going to come bursting out
of the Zappos door whether they're
having a parade or whether they're
having drone races or they're having
cardboard boat races like you just you
just never know what's going on but it's
always a party over there because they
take really good care of their customer
service department their programmers and
also their customers so let's talk about
this next element the user interface so
what are some types of different user
interfaces Kenobi's let me know mobile
apps websites conferences conferences
are a user interface as I it at my first
three minutes probably the worst three
minutes of NBC in your experience so far
but you know I just like to everyone
just think about what kind of message
you're giving the world at any given
moment at all these various touch points
and use
interfaces so and we have you know
different questions that we can ask as
we are developing our user interfaces is
it simple to use I do things like show
my mom websites or you know go talk to
my aunts about what do you think about
this ad because they have this fresh
eyes and they're not techies and they're
not in advertising and so I like to get
their opinion as well on what their
experience is with the interface
whatever that it is that we're building
and remember you know a confused mind
says no so is if it's not easy if it's
not a seamless experience right from the
start all the way to the bank account a
confused mind will just bill believe if
there are too many options or if it's
too difficult is there an easy
conversion lead them down a nice easy
path towards the conversion goal on your
website through your app through the
meeting through the sales pitch and the
customer service can customers easily
engage with this customer service
department are your customer service
reps empowered with the tools that they
need to give good customer service or do
things bottleneck sometimes they'll
bottleneck with managers if they're
always constantly coming to the manager
to ask for permission what do I do about
this how do I do that the customer
service is really important and that was
figured that out well because you know
they win great awards for customer
service market research market research
includes a lot of different elements you
know that some some examples of market
research metrics are our surveys you can
do focus groups sometimes and they don't
even have to be difficult you know you
could just go grab a group of people
that are within your your range you know
I lived in LA for a little bit what I'd
sign is craigslist ads people just
pop-up craigslist ads and say hey we
need a focus group for this if you fit
this demographic then come on down on
friday and and we're going to ask you to
test some things a be testing is
something that we use in in my field
where
even if you have to ads where you change
a picture it'll be the same exact
language it's fascinating how you can
get significantly different results even
one tiny little word that you you might
not think is very significant you can
change the results just by doing a/b
testing and understanding what your
market likes and the other thing that
you can use are heat maps if you are
using web or apps to see how much time
people are spending where what moat what
areas they're spending most of their
time and the time spent in gauged
measuring that is also important
especially if you do things like videos
people are only getting through the
first 10 seconds of your video or if
they're barely getting to the first two
minutes of your presentation and ëcí
global before they walk out I haven't
had anyone walk out yet but and
interviews so interviews are another
good idea I had a girlfriend who went
out and started her own business and it
was just really simple she picked out
her her focus group her target market
and she just started scheduling
interviews and she interviewed like a
hundred people and she gathered a lot of
really good market research before she
launched and then of course she she did
the other things as she was building out
her products with surveys and focus
groups things like that uh the next
element that I want to talk about is you
know who who is going to help out with
this
I find that generalists make really good
people to fill out these positions
because they know just enough about a
little bit about everything to be
dangerous but not like a specialist
who's very very linear
by definition specialists keep getting
better and better and better and better
at one thing right and so having an
overseer the creative director that's a
generalist is a good move because you
know when there is a multi specialist
and
they can talk to the project manager and
the developers and the front end and the
managers and the salespeople user
experience designers same thing having a
generalist in this position is going to
be much more beneficial to you than
having a specialist in this position who
often you know they're very very focused
what they do and they're very excellent
at what they do in that position but
having a generalist is going to be much
more significant for you so you know you
could see with all these different parts
we've got programming interaction design
interface design information design
motion sound graphic design written you
could see with all of these layers all
of these different layers having one
person who knows a little bit who can go
between the layers is going to be more
beneficial to your team than having just
a specialist who only knows one thing
and so all of those things they add up
to the user experience the emotional
response the brand engagement this is
how we get loyal clients so again
resources if you're a manager you want
to test how this how well this is
working in your company send me a text
the other thing if you're a manager I
sometimes we might have a tendency to
shut people down right we're busy busy
busy we're we're moving forward people
might come to us and say hey I got this
idea I want to do these oh no we already
tried that and you know who knows maybe
they might have a new twist on an old
idea I like to encourage people to have
a better communication pattern than just
shutting people down right away because
what happens is after a while if you
hear that enough times your team starts
to get a little bit disgruntled and then
they just there's going to be less
innovation and we see this as companies
get larger and larger and larger I work
a lot with startups and small companies
and the passion right there is very
infectious they get really excited in
startups but you know if you're a
manager and
you're growing and you're growing and
you've tried things I like to encourage
people to use a little bit different
language that might still be encouraging
so instead of saying you know we already
tried that say something like you know
I'm not I'm not convinced yet
tell me more and of course you can't
take on every single project you know
but sometimes it's really easy if you're
busy and you're busy and people are
presenting you with things and it's easy
to say you know what I told you about
that already no we're not going to do it
you know a something like a you know I
know we're not going to do that yet but
you know maybe you'd be willing to mock
it up mock something up and and we can
compare and you know or also sometimes
you just have to say no you know but
instead of saying that will never work
try something like you know the timing
makes it wrong it's the wrong option for
us right now it's a little more gentle
and it's a little less soul-crushing on
your team because the next time they
have a great idea that might actually
work
just what I'm not going to bring it to
you right because there's a bad
experience for them so I'd like to
encourage you to think about that and
think about the language that you're
using when you're communicating with
your team when you're developing new
products when you're looking at the user
interface because your team members our
user interface face to I mean what would
happen if you're thinking about going to
a company and you see somebody at a
conference and you go hey you know you
work at company a how's it going over
there
and they come and go oh my gosh no don't
do it
now managers over there horrible they
stifle all your ideas is that's part of
his user experience for your brand so
think about that messaging as you're
putting out that information has anybody
are used business model canvas so when I
first started my business I went out and
set up this great business plan we have
SBA the Small Business Association in
the United States and they have a great
little little walkthrough tutorial that
walks you through there's 50 page
business plan that goes step by step by
step by step by step and you you put all
this information in there and has your
executive summary and your projections
even though you don't have any users yet
and even though you don't really have
any projections so um it you who come
out with this big huge document that you
immediately just put off to the side and
never look at again and it's very
confusing so they came up with a very
fluid motion for that where you're
constantly taking an assessment of your
resources of the tools that you have of
your partners or your collaborators and
it's a really good way to mock up your
business plan as an active live document
it's a living document and it's
constantly moving well these guys so
exciting uh they did the OS canvas
because everything is an operating
system and so what they did is you know
they they moved it around all these
different parts the the structure and
space of your project the authority and
decisions the information communication
the meetings the rhythm the
communication coordination the people
the development so what the ready did is
they took a survey I think it was like
2000 companies and they came up with
this plan so that again it's a fluid
moving document so at any given moment
as you're taking features out as you're
putting features in as you're losing a
project managers you're coming in with a
new project manager as you adding team
members or growing partners and
collaborators you have this living
working document that is always
available it works really well if you
put it up on the wall so the whole
entire team can see it or you have it
online so people are constantly checking
it and seeing it instead of having some
big boring 50 page document that's off
to the side somewhere this really helps
especially for visual learners right as
far as all of the moving parts and how
they're interacting with each other and
engaging with each other it's called the
OS canvas and I encourage people to
check it out to look at it with your
next project
another way that you can create a
positive user experience is to create
random acts of culture I love this Chuck
longenecker from digital telepathy he
talked about creating random acts of
culture so even if your manager and your
culture is not perfect and you can't do
a big overhaul because let's face it
it's it takes a lot
I've spoken to some companies where it
takes them about five years to change
over their culture seven years to change
over their culture of their company and
you can do just tiny little things fun
things Zappos does parades Zappos does a
fun little outings you could do just you
know whatever fun little thing that you
want to encourage your people to express
their innovation express their ideas and
interact with each other
cross-departmental having these things
increases the user experience the
creativity when we change our brainwaves
from from alpha mode to beta mode it
helps our brains actually be more
productive when we go back into alpha
mode so in certain all these little
random acts of culture that are going to
help encourage people cause creativity
is much more beneficial and you know
there are a few books that have been
written about company culture so you
know a lot of companies like Quicken
Loans
that are doing cool things where they've
they've taken away managers or you know
in the case of holacracy where they have
different pods and it's not necessarily
a flat company but they have flat
companies too there are all these
different ways that you can structure a
company and a culture to help create and
cultivate more interaction more
engagement and more creativity for
creating products and services that are
going to succeed so delivering happiness
is a great book a connection culture is
another book that is in the culture
engine emotional intelligence 2.0 is
like my Bible I love this book there are
26 traits to emotional intelligence and
they talk about awareness of self
awareness of others your management of
self management of others and how that
is expressed at every single level of
your business and of your personal life
so there is a lot around emotional
intelligence that you can do to help
transform things if you're having
trouble in your team if you are having
difficulty or you're stuck on a project
and you have your developers fighting
with your project managers fighting with
your front end designers these these
things can help and then outliers is
another really great book for a Malcom
Gladwell talking about the success of
people how individuals succeed at
different levels and what is it exactly
that that helped them succeed and help
their products go viral and help their
services help the masses reach the
masses so then you know people look at
me and they go Christina no no no I've
read the books I gave the books to my
manager and he looked at me and he said
no not going to do it uh-uh we're not
that's not our thing so you know I have
another book that I might recommend for
you it's called unconscious branding and
Douglas you know he says that if you
want someone else to completely believe
in your idea you have to make sure that
they come up with the idea themselves
and that's how you create a loyal loyal
fan so this book talks about the best
way for your boss to adopt certain ideas
that you know maybe in those books or
maybe in a new feature that you think is
going to help your product services run
more efficiently make the user
experience better this is a really great
book because it talks about unconscious
branding and how we can help other
people buy into the idea
by you know making it their idea making
it seem like it's their idea and then
there's some language again I I think
that words are very very powerful and so
when you're having a user experience
when you're engaging with people with
your brand's you know there are there
are very simple phrases that you can
practice to get them to think and it's a
it's a formula that I use that is
certain certain phrases so would be you
know instead of coming to your boss and
saying hey I want to do this I would say
hey what would happen have to happen for
us to do this it's it's more it gets
them thinking about oh yeah that's a
good question because what happens with
your brain is if somebody asks you a
question it's very very difficult for
you to move on to the next thing until
that question is answered first so you
know it would be like I wonder what
would have to happen for X to occur you
know what could I say to help you
approach it from X and it doesn't really
matter what X is it's just the way that
you're phrasing the question in order to
get them thinking about you know what
what what it will be and oftentimes you
know sometimes it will be that it's not
a good idea or it's not good timing for
for a feature adding the feature at this
time but you know sometimes it'll be oh
yeah I guess I hadn't thought of that
and you know the goal is to get their
mind chewing on it to get their mind
thinking about what would have to happen
for this to occur and and you know
either way you know whether they adopt
the idea or don't you'll still have
better information than just being
completely shut down another tool that I
use is I agree I agree so something like
you know I know we can't do this yet but
what could I do to get us one step
closer or you could say you know I agree
and
and I'll add that we might also be able
to and so if people come to you with an
idea or vice-versa and you shut them
down right away instantly that pushes
them off but if you say I agree and
there it breaks down that resistance and
they're going to be much more open to
listening to what you have to say about
adding that feature or changing up the
design or whatever it is and then so
people look at me and they go Christina
not my thing I'm not in the business of
convincing or or or talking because the
people at my jobs no they don't listen
my managers just aren't interested in
that well may I suggest other resources
for you about companies that may follow
your core values and companies that do
actually focus on culture every single
level of business and companies that are
doing things a little bit differently if
you look at their products if you look
at their services if you look at their
management their employees at every
single level people are happy their
users their customers they're happy
because of they live their core values
and they understand that user
experiences included it every single
level of business I'm people look at me
and they go oh Christina no that's not
an option I can't go to another company
I can't talk to my managers and you know
I read the books I gave them and they're
not interested then you know may I
suggest volunteering these are some
companies that I have worked with to
help me share my knowledge share my
experience and you know practice these
things so as I share as I mentor as I
teach other people I grow also and if
I'm not happy at my job if I'm
not happy in the workplace then you can
also go out into other places and seek
out that culture that is going to be
stimulating that's going to be creative
and it's going to also help shape and
shift the younger kids and teach them
when I mentor I mentor you know anytime
at seven to eight people at a time and
we talk about different things at
different levels of their career when I
teach them the tools that I've used and
share my experiences and watch what they
do with it then I learn as well I also
have come up with a lot of collaborators
especially Iran girls in tech Las Vegas
for a few years with my co managing
director and those relationships put me
in touch with women who I wouldn't
otherwise have access to
and so we've collaborated on different
projects we've worked on different
scholarship programs and different award
programs together and I've been able to
connect with other women and and
high-level executives that weren't
necessarily around because through
different volunteering I got to connect
with them and when you mentor other
people and you share that information
with them it really changes the culture
and it helps feed your soul especially
if it works you're not getting that
right and people go out now Christina I
am NOT a volunteer and I don't care and
that's not my thing and I'm already
connecting with people and I'm fine with
it but you know what you could do is
think about the time that you have so we
all have time we all have the same 24
hours in a day and if you're stifled at
work and you're having a very difficult
user experience at work and it's not
working for you
I really suggest that you make notes you
work on your side projects
you talk to your friend and start that
that small business that you've always
wanted or build that app that you've
always wanted to build you know even
even if you're really super stressed at
work and and you you can't really get
out of your job and you can't really get
out of that culture and it's been such a
horrible user experience for you you
know maybe you just sit maybe you just
breathe
maybe you just create white space when
we talk about emotional intelligence
it's interesting how our brain works you
know we we want to oftentimes there's
that fight-or-flight response that we
have first the the amygdala and the
unfortunate part is is that the amygdala
gets the signals gets the input faster
than our prefrontal cortex the cognitive
mind the cognitive brain and so we're
much more prone to react when we run
happy when we're stifled that's where
our creativity goes down that's where
we're exhausted it's negative we're
complaining about work we're complaining
about our our bosses or our co-workers
because it's not working out but you
know if you even start thinking what is
possible what would have to happen for
me to be happy
what could I create and this is really
simple just asking those few questions
every single day stimulates your brain
to focus on these other parts that are
possible these possibilities of an app
these possibilities of a partnership of
a collaboration of a new creative
project project that you're working on
and if you create an outlet for your
ideas you've create an outlet for your
creativity you create an outlet for your
frustrations it helps balance out those
feelings so in our minds we all have
this innate natural response
it's called dimorphic expressions we
have this innate natural response in our
brains to counteract whatever it is
we're feeling right so
sometimes we I have a five-year-old at
home sometimes I'll be like hey stop
that what are you doing and he knows
he's in trouble but you want a smile I
do this I will speak quickly or I will
be a little bit nervous and I'll laugh
inappropriately this entails laughing
appropriately at times that you really
probably shouldn't be laughing because
our brains go out fight-or-flight and
then naturally through dimorphic
expressions this is a thing
our brains counteract that by laughing
or by doing the opposite emotion of that
to help balance it out so I encourage
you if if you're not happy or if you're
you're feeling stuck or you have these
feelings to think about what's the
opposite thing of that because once you
start focusing on that you cultivate
more of that and you cultivate more
emotional intelligence and that's where
the creativity for problem-solving
somebody said earlier one of their talks
that were not really engineers we're
problem solvers when when we're
developers and so that's exactly what
happens you can't solve problems when
you're in it when you're in
fight-or-flight mode when you're in fear
and that's what emotional intelligence
tells us so cultivating those kinds of
things is going to be a lot more helpful
for you and you know I've changed my
mindset most of us are not given those
tools for managing our emotions I know I
wasn't as I was growing up it was
children should be seen and not heard
right so if we can cultivate these in
ourselves and cultivate them in our
teams it's really interesting and
fascinating at the problems that we can
solve and how creative our brains get
when we put our minds together to work
on these problems and kind of chew on a
solution that that might be best for
everybody and break down exactly where
in the project way
are in the scope of work at what point
are things breaking down and emotional
intelligence helps us get there because
when your brain is ready to receive that
information and it can can work on those
problems and kind of chew on those
problems in a positive way you're going
to be able to solve those problems
better because remember a confused mind
says no and if we can make it simple if
we can make it engaging then people are
going to be much more successful in all
of the products and the services that
they provide mmm
so I still pretty quickly that's all
that I have for the the talk today but I
wanted to talk about if there are any
questions lots of times people want to
know a little bit more about how they
can make changes in themselves or
changes in work through the existing
structure that they have does anybody
here work at a company that uses
holacracy or any kind of alternative
culture changes in their in their office
now everybody has pretty much a set
hierarchy how many people here are
independent developers have their own
businesses yeah so when we talk about
working in teams I work in different
teams for nonprofits for advisory boards
or sometimes as a consultant
we might be called in to work with an
in-house team right just for a product
launch or things like that and so when
you can think about the user experience
at that level as well it really really
helps having an outside person come in
but at the same time if you come in and
you're not really well received because
you're met with resistance and that can
also offer issues and problems on the
project and does anybody have any
questions about user experience Oh
our company culture core values okay
