going to talk about Kotlin next level of
android development but before about it
I want to tell you words about us
because when we started our adventure
with coupling few years ago there was
nearly no materials about it there was
no books no courses nearly no nothing we
were learning that from from the
references and people were often asking
me what am i doing and when I responded
and they literally thought that I am
working for ketchup company because
Kotlin is a popular ketchup in in Poland
they couldn't understand why I'm
developing and I'm investing all my time
and energy into like a small language
that is used by a few companies around
the world they couldn't understand that
it was a passion for me and I wanted to
share we want to share our passion and I
want to start from what what fascinated
me and why what drove me the most during
this period and for me Kaplan was like a
fresh breath after all the pains from
Java JavaScript I've seen lots of stuff
that were working wrong I think code
that couldn't be extracted I seen like a
common patterns over and over again I've
seen a lot of boilerplate code I was
programming in Java
in every day job so I've seen a lot of
boilerplate code and then I could come
back to home and have some fun with
Kotlin and discover that you can you
can't forget about it it can all be made
made better and that's why I loved it
that's why I decided I have to work in
Catalan and every day and since I
started working in Catalan I felt like
that and I feel like that until today a
lot has changed we published with eager
a book about Kotlin in android
development we are writing articles we
wrote fast some our open source
libraries we are
presenting our fruits of our work on the
stage but our passion is still strong
and today we want to share this passion
with you this is about us now eager will
tell about the history of Catalina yes
so before we I cannot tell you about the
language about its features like let's
briefly look what is what is caught in
history so before we go to that we
should ask ourself a question why we
need another language right because why
jetbrains would create another language
there are over 500 languages a lot of
them are dead but still a lot of them
are canon currently used so the thing is
that JetBrains was working with Java for
for a very very long time and the Java
was the human technology main language
so they learn about this strength but
also limitations of the language and
also many problems that that we can
encounter were working with it so at
some point they decided they wanted to
switch to something but of course that
before they decided to develop in
language they tried few others they
tried Ravi directed tried Scala and
probably others and all those languages
kind of failed their expectations
because they were good but very good
language is when you wanna start new
project not necessary when you have
existing project anyone are kind of
migrated into something new and we all
know that nobody will rewrite into the
idea from the scratch right it's like
pointless so jetbrains started working
on this project I would say secretly to
see what what can we do with that in
quite long time ago around 10 years ago
so it's not true what many programmers
think that this is quite a new
technology it is quite opposite it's
quite mature very quickly it was
revealed to the to the world as a cotton
project and very one year after it was
open source so from this point basically
everybody could contribute the language
and give their knowledge and because
your program is you probably realized
right that after
at some point in your career you realize
that some rules kind of go over seem
single language of programming like
static typing or dynamic company typing
with different things so everybody from
different languages from different
experience with different products could
could give the value to the decoding and
between 2012 and 2015 it was the three
years where coating was very intensively
developed number of people like growth
lock rapidly in terms of slags groups
stack overflows questions and keep her
project and this was the time arm where
language wasn't officially officially
released yet but jetbrains invested into
so much that they created even some
project some product in using coding
technology that officially wasn't
released and two years ago we had like
official stable version of coding and
this as you can imagine was of course
the change because now many companies
that were afraid to use unstable
technology which was in beta version
were now good this this feel of
certainty that this technology arrives
and very quickly companies from
different different industries different
applications like mobile or spring which
is back and started to apply Cortland
more or less at the Edison at the same
time Gradle joined the coding project
because they wanna use code they wanted
to use new scripting language for grado
because as you know group groovy is
which was currently used it's dynamic
language so it's difficult to provide
code encode assistance and it's much
difficult to work with so one year after
release of coding 1.0 next version was
released which fixed a lot of issue
maybe not a lot but fix many issues with
the cotinine like parks improved
compiler added some new features like
compilation for for JavaScript because
till this point we kind of thought about
coding as a language that is a
replacement for Java which we can
compile into JVM
but at this point jetbrains added
another target so from this version we
can compile coding to different target
which is Java JavaScript of course
quickly another company started to adopt
the cotton square which is biggest
producer for Android libraries decided
to tell Android community to let's go
with cotton we love it it's great
technology and we got official Android
support which basically means that
Google said yes use this language as an
alternative to Java for Android platform
and so every tool every solution that we
rely we will release from this moment we
will have official support and this was
a big missing puzzle that many come
because at this point many companies
were kind of still afraid to use it
officially without official Google
support and this was the game changer
for for Android and of course the
community was was happy many companies
since then applied the language into
into production and used it inside their
applications Marcin will tell you more
about some feature one of my favorite
features of code name is its security
and by security security in terms of
land which we mean that more errors can
be prevented during compilation time
instead of taking place during runtime
and of course the the biggest source of
errors especially in Java is so-called
billion dollar mistake you have you ever
heard about it ok some people who heard
about it sir searched our score the
great computer scientist apologized for
what he what he implemented saying that
it caused billion dollars of pain and
Lost's he obviously were talking about
nullpointerexception
and Java finally sorry Kotlin finally
made good typing system Fornell pointers
basically every property must be
initialized so we cannot change
uninitialized property without any other
special modifiers before we before it
properties cannot be now when they are
normally typed to allow
now we need to explicitly say that
property that property is not able but
no label property cannot be used
explicitly we need to unpack it first
before we use it and there are a few
ways how we can unpack it the most
common and the easiest way is to use
safe call it is if it's calling the
right side when left side is not know if
so left side is now it is returning now
so it is it is very security and it is
behavior we want in most cases the other
way is unsafe call it's a very bad bad
practice in cutting it's throwing an
error when left side is no this is
exactly what we have every time we are
calling anything on Java so in here is a
very bad practice in Java it's known
what shows how as Sakura Catalan is
comparing to Java another way is we can
use different ways of smart casting so
once we check for if the type is now
after this check in the scope of this
check it is casted - not now and
compiler copying compiler is smart it is
really really smart and it is getting
smarter and smarter so disgusting works
really well for various of different
situations actually it works known not
only for non ability but also for type
so if we check if something is of some
type so in the scope it is casted to
this type is cool and another way to
deal with new ability is to use LDC
operator Alvis operator basically
provides default value when left side is
now not how a here used
safe call if the person is no
then whole expression is no so the
default value will be used some default
value is used either when person is no
or when the name of this person is no
but on the right side we can use also
other stuff you can come function and we
can also return from the function this
is especially useful when we have some
some requirements and parameters and we
need to finish execution and they are
not matched or we can even throw an
error so it is also in used in similar
cases this is one way how Kotlin
provides security another way is that
kopplin explicitly distinguished
read-only and readwrite properties
read-only properties are like Const but
they are more powerful because copying
introduced a lot of ways we can fill
them
for instance lists can be filled using
the functions that are that are used for
for this so we don't need you know the
table lists we can just make lists in
fill it and assign it to read-only
property in in place or we can use
property delegation so in here we are
providing this name and it lazily so
this function to provide the name will
be called during the first call of the
name so it's lazy and this way there are
there are lots of similar way this way
read-only properties are highly
supported and thanks to that they are
much much more often used than readwrite
properties it it is very it is much
easier to to work with the state when
most stuff are not changing this is one
thing and another thing is much easier
for multi-threading even this our state
is not mutating all the time and the
third thing that highly improves
security is that coupling distinguished
strictly label metal and imitable
types and all the types in Kotlin are
immutable by default like list set or
they are all in the table you may ask
what is the difference between the table
and immutable immutable type is type
that is not changing the state we can
still like we use this to for instance
string is a very common example of in
moe table type you cannot change value
of string you can create a new string
for instance by connecting two strings
so the same list encoding they're
immutable so you can change the property
by by making new list that is having
additional elements or that is having
class elements the table lists are
mutating its state when we use immutable
types it is much easier to unit tested
it is much easier to do multi-threading
so in general then which is not safer
okay that's about safeness now Igor will
tell you about blessed nests of Kotlin
features that supports object-oriented
programming so just bring design the
coding that's right we try to not force
programmer to use certain programming
style and that's why coding supports
object-oriented programming as long as
some function concept of functional
programming basically the idea is to
take the best things from both both
words so in terms of object-oriented
programming
let's let's imagine that we have a
simple simple class where we want to
represent the person so basically you
want to represent for information like
name surname age and the fact that this
is person person class so in Java
more or less we need 40 nights of code
to represent it properly because we need
to define try fulfilled define
constructor parameter assigned them
create getters and setters right we
could skip grater and setters and then
then we can forget about all the
benefits of encapsulation so this is the
way to go to go with Java encoding we
have simpler way to
represent the same concept so first of
all we can we can forget about Gators
and setters because in cotinine we don't
have field as in Java we have properties
which which for which compiler cannot
generate getters and setters but so in
this case you would have three
properties constructor parameters and
assignment but this also can be
simplified even more because in coding
we can define properties directly inside
inside inside the class and assign them
from constructor so this gives us even
less the scope but the best version of
it is this where we define all the
properties inside the constructor and
this way compiler will generate all the
fields all the Gators on the set all the
setters so this is exact equivalent of
the of the of the Java class and when
you think about right we as a programmer
spend most time reading the code so here
in code line we have all basic
information that means right class and
three properties define plus the only
thing that's extra we can say whatever
not this property is mutable or
immutable great extension of classes is
concept introduced in coding that is
called
data class so basically by prefixing
adding motive data modifier to person
class compiler will generate some method
for us that will make our life as a
programmers much much easier so let's go
briefly through those methods so so
first is to string so in some languages
it's done properly in some like Java
printing printing the person prints the
hash of the memory which for us as a
program is in most cases is useless
right unless your program making really
low-level language printing the address
gives you nothing encoding data classes
by default of a right to string method
so allows us to generate proper string
that contains all the fields or the
properties defined in primary
constructor and this information right
for us programmers all of us to debug
application easier or love the stuff to
actually see what's happening
in the in the program another
improvement is equal methods so if we
create two instances of object in Java
and try to compare them by default in
Java this will be false because we
compare compare those object by
reference so those are two different
instances those two references point to
them so they are not equal encoding in
terms of data classes underneath our
coding calls equal method so its
compares object by its structure but the
data it contains which for us as a
programmers is much more natural way to
to deal with object and usually can help
us to not to make some bug but the best
feature of data classes is the one that
allows is to create copy of an object in
very easy way so they tag they compiler
generates the copy method and in this
case we create exact copy of the object
containing the same fields but the best
the best thing is that we can actually
use something that is called named
argument syntax so in cotton if method
has multiple parameters we can call them
by name so we can say call this method
and set the value of this parameter for
for for cage in this example so at the
end we create copy of the object and we
modify only single single property so so
and all of the other properties will
have the same value as in previous
object so this this improves working
with immutable datatypes multiple
threads and this is very very convenient
continue wait for functional programming
work mark you tell you about consistency
yeah this is actually my most favorite
you know trait of Kotlin there are a few
you know deep concepts i have and for
instance my master were always saying if
you're using control C control found a
file in one project and you are doing
something wrong not in Java because in
Java you have to do it over and over
again but in cotton in there is code
readability highly supported and also
cutting is release concise so using
these features you can you can make it
better and
but before before about that I want to
talk with you about Hell and it in
detail I want to talk with you about
java.util hell this is how we call all
these all these classes with static
functions that are in every Java project
developers hate them and why do they
hate them so much just let's look at an
example this is how we were
traditionally creating and feeling
Cleese it's an ugly way Java created
util for that that that helps but like
let's look at that white is in RA is not
in lease White's name is us list and we
we need to remember the name the name of
this method and how we how we use it it
would be much easier to just make list
off and set of elements
this is nearly like collection literal
but better because we have the name so
we can made similar by ourself or we
know what what is that you know so it's
it's like collection literal but even
better another even bigger thing is that
we have common patterns around the curve
this is how we for instance hide the
element we need to set its visibility to
view gun how we would want to do it
we would prefer to call hide method on
this element but there is not such
method implemented in Android so we
could make Java util but it is it
helpful we need to place it somewhere so
we need to remember this we need to
remember the name and also we need to
pass the argument as an argument the
view that is changed so it is
counterintuitive
and it's a bad practice but that we are
passing as an argument element that is
changed so this is this is bad this is
why we hate Java you tease I will I will
tell you in a minute how to fix it but
first let's fix the previous thing oh
sorry
first one more example string also we
want to protest string this is how we
want to
process it replace some elements
capitalized but there is not such
methods for string instead we can define
java.util but this is not helpful this
is this is ugly and this is not the way
we want to use this stuff okay I will be
back to that let's start from the
functions and functions in Catalan are
awesome you can define functions in
nearly every level as you can see you
can define top-level functions that you
can use everywhere in your project of
course depending on your visibility
modifier but but basically while when it
is public you can use it everywhere so
list off is defined as a top-level
functions and it can be used everywhere
it is really powerful tool for things
that are intuitive and that are used
very often you can define member
function it's a normal method but you
can also define local functions local
functions are functions inside the
functions so they can reference and
change the values of the of the methods
and they can use the arguments so we
don't need to pass this all this data
via argument and back via return type we
can just change them so it is a powerful
tool for code extraction inside single
method how we can fix our other other
problem we can in cotton we can easily
define so-called extension function it
is extension function to to type view
that is changing its visibility so using
this function we can actually get this
height method that I've showed you that
we want to have we can can define
ourselves and use it other and our
project this is a simpler example how
extension function works you can
redefine extension function to string
that is cutting the string after an
element and here you saw how we can use
it we are just making string and we can
use it on that string so it shows how
easily extension functions can be
defined and used
we can also define extension properties
it might be counterintuitive but
actually as as we said before property
is not a field property is a setter and
getter or just a getter
so basically it's a function so if this
is a function we can make extension
function so there is a syntax for
extension property that looks nearly the
same we are just making property on some
type and in all instances of this type
we can just call it like normal property
and once it is called it is actually
calculating this value using the getter
of this extension property similarly we
can make readwrite extension property
that is also setting state so every time
we set assign a new value the setter is
called so the visibility of the element
is changed I think the C sharp have
similar similar thing but in here the
syntax is a bit different there is even
higher level of code extraction we can
achieve and we can use use for that
higher level functions let's see these
two functions that are some is counting
some of all the elements from A to B and
product is counting product of all the
elements from A to B they look really
similar and they are actually similar so
we would want to extract common parts
but there is there is an operation
inside so it would be hard to extract it
in Java but not in coupling in cotton we
can define an operation as a as a
function this is a function type it's a
function that takes two arguments of
type integer and returns an integer and
we pass this operation as an
as a function using lambda expression we
provide initial value and we have
everything extracted this is a good way
to make code extraction but when you
look at that this is quite a useful
function I mean not with with this with
the scope from A to B but for instance
it is really useful to calculate twofold
collection or something like that this
is this is why actually a fault for for
collection is defined the same as add
lots of other functions for instance
here is Hughes an example of map and
filter very very commonly used functions
they are used to make collection
processing but what is very specific to
Kotlin is that they are defined as an
extension functions and this is very
important because they are extension
functions to e terrible terrible is an
interface actually interface with one
single method and lots of stuff are a
terrible more than just the collections
for instance you can you can integrate
over a string because string is an array
of characters so you can actually use
all these methods on string and you can
also make your own type make it a
terrible and you could you then you are
able to use map filter and all these
other functions all on this on this type
so this is really cool I will come back
because I want to show you one more
thing it is also in line functions they
are all in line what does it mean it
means that their body is injected into
into their code so they are not really
cold during the computation time the
calls are replaced with their body and
the lambda expressions are feeling the
the cause of that so thanks to that this
is actually this is extremely efficient
this is as efficient as if you would
make these four lobes and ifs inside so
this is this is extremely efficient
solution if you if you sequences it's
it's it's even even more efficient so
it's it's really good solution
yeah another result of the fact that it
is extension function is that you can
very easily create such functions and
you can can make you know lots of
different functions for different stuff
and that's why there are lots of lots of
such function for all the collections
and thanks to that we can very easily
process all the collections or all the
data types but this is something that
Igor will tell you more about so each
time I look at the definition that
Marcin show I'm thinking what's going on
there but like actually they are much
much easier to use than writing and look
and read them so let's imagine that we
have some sample collection containing
free items that free fruits in this case
and we wanna we want to perform some
operation like filtering guidance of the
collection so normal approach like maybe
it's normal but typical from few years
ago is more imperative or imperative
programming style says that we define a
list of steps that we want to achieve an
operation so inter stems in this case it
would be let's create look over items in
the collection or in the list let's
perform some checking and if the
condition is met let's add this this
item to the to the filter array codeine
codeine I want to go more into
declarative way where we actually define
the result that we want to achieve
that's why we have the functions which
which takes as an argument takes another
function which contains the operation
that margin margin describes so but
because when you think about it most
operations of the collection I kind of
we have like operation which is similar
like looking through the collection but
it's often differs in the details like
for example how much ink element is is
detected of course in coding we can we
can change those operations together
that's why that's why we can apply
multiple operations into a collection so
that's in this case we want to filter
some students that students that are
passing to the nest and next semester
then maybe filter them again
using the using their score and great
then take ten the best the best of the
students on the air and then maybe even
group them by sex which create a stew
collection containing two sexes assuming
there are two because the last time I
seen there were over ten you missed
there should be sorted by function in
the middle right now we are taking ten
first elements no not and best so when
you think about this collection each
each of those operations create
intermediate collection and this way
it's much easier to get an understand so
let's imagine another case we have we
have a list some times that we want to
convert to first drink in search in
certain certain ways so if you wanna
join this list to string we can again
using codeine named argument syntax and
pass the parameter that interests us of
in this case you wanna join join into
string and pass only to set the
separator we could also pass more
arguments right like perfect prefix or
postfix which we result in in different
in different string of course we can
also transform those elements using the
functions that we are passing and in
this case we can we can make them is the
is the upper case of course without
without these functions without this
named argument syntax and default para
values we will have function like this
which is which is typical behavior from
Java which is extremely difficult to
read and understand because then you
think okay this is like seven parameters
like what is parameter number five is
its suffix like so it's quite I would
say painful to maintain one more thing
is that we can of course perform
additional operation like like sorting
conduct on the collection so we can sort
it by simple by single value like a name
but we can also pass a comparator as an
argument which which will allow us to
sort the collection using multiple
multiple arguments and as you can see
this is extremely easy behavior and
very expressive because this code
contained basically the information that
we need so we're saying to sort it and
sort it by this this and this field and
the best feature of the code in my
opinion multi-platform development this
is a news actually because it was
announced on the hotlink on which they
took place like or something so this is
a news that it is a great thing because
we can make multi-platform applicated
development in a full stack only in
Kotlin and the idea starts from the fact
that actually you could make all the
elements separately using coupling in
other words we use cotton in JVM it is
coupling that is compiled to Java code
and in case of cotton is the dalvik
bytecode but copying
also have its JavaScript variant cut in
layers that can be used to write to
browser it is quite popular to write
react applications uncut ninjas and
since since last month's you can also
use code in native to write iOS
applications or any other applications
Kotla native is basically compiled to
native bytecode so you know the same as
C C++ so and note that all of them are
working
all of them work natively so in in
Android we can use we can use libraries
from Android in the in the browser we we
use frameworks on libraries for browser
and in iOS we can we can use the same
views we can we can use libraries for
for iOS so we can make it like purely
natively approach from the developer
point of view but if we have on and
these scotland's are actually different
they are the same cuddliness from the
developer point of view they can only of
course use
the different libraries but they are
just they have the same syntax they work
the same so this is actually one cutting
the the point is that it is compiled to
different byte code but when we have so
much clients we could actually make them
all in one project and we could make
parts that are common among them and
there are always sub parts for instance
data model is a perfect example
it is like everywhere you know in every
application there is data model and it
needs to be the same or nearly the same
in all the clients and and backends so
it can be extracted and placing in
common module common you can use only
pure cotton encode but thanks to that
during the during the compilation every
part that is compiling itself will use
it and and take it into its own project
so did we have huge code reuse it
another example for common module I
remember I had to write in my company we
wanted to improve security so we wanted
to make like a unnormal hush for further
security and the problem was that we had
to implement the same strange function
made by by some security guys in PHP
Objective C and in codename so and it
had to work the same because small
difference will not accept it on the
other side so it was it was a horror
actually in if it would be coupling
multi-platform project we would define
it once in the common module and use it
everywhere so cotton team showed an
application where they implemented for
the functional it was quite a it was not
a simple application was function an
application for further conference and
it was written in in cotton and it was
multi-platform code name project and it
was written for iOS Android and it has
web client you can use it for voting for
finding everything there was a lot of
features in that and it was it was
written this way and it had
common module that that contained the
common arts i together with other
contributors also made a multi-platform
project but it was it is a bit bigger
right now we have right now we have
right now we have four clients desktop
written in turn and FX it is like Java
FX but better it we have web on react
and Android watch and mobile we are
working on iOS it is it is a higher
level of abstraction because we not only
have the common module for the common
stuff among everything including
back-end but we also have special common
client module that contains all the
business logic so like we have we always
reuse MVP some presenters use cases they
are all placed in common client and they
are used among all the class and all the
platforms so platforms need only to
define the view how they look like and
all the behavior is implemented once and
well tested in the common part I want to
show you an example and first I will
show you an example of this common
module and how we can define they define
the data model this is this is a simple
class that contains some data but what
is interesting in this class is that I
placed here an occurrence it is a date
time you know it represents some point
in the time but Kotlin does not have
such a presentation for daytime every
platform have its own so for instance in
in Java we have like calendar or date
and JavaScript we have so how we can
deal with that and copying inside its
multi platform for its multi platform
projects provided a special possibility
for for common models that they can
define expected classes the classes
this is like a set of methods and and
requirements we expect to be defined on
the platforms and on the plot and the
platform specific versions of this
common module we only need to define
actual classes for these expected
classes so this is for for example is
JVM actual class it is more functional
we can I can whenever I use this on the
VM I can use all these methods but in
here I included only methods that I need
to use in the common module so I need to
compare these elements to serve them so
I only make them comparable and I needed
to use to string and from string for
seller serialization for so this is all
I need and I need on the common module
and this rest is in the in the platform
specific modules similar I mean
different but also there is actual class
for cotton JV for cotton joyous
another thing I want to show you is an
example presenter a presenters assuming
now contains business logic for one view
and I've chosen a pretty simple
presenter it only it is only reacting
when user clicks the button and it is
sending the data for it shows the loader
know that this is that properties our
saturday.and Gator so they can be also
in interfaces so and viewer is an
interface okay so they're this they show
the loader it sends the feedback to the
to the API using repository and once it
is done it shows that the success in
case of error it shows this error on the
deal whatever happens it have to hide
this this loading so I use actually
corrupt inst in here this is a simple
logic and now and this is an interface
that that represents how our view acts
and all the views needs to implement
this interface and use this presenter
and thanks to that they can be stupid
they can just they can the presenters
contains all the logic so the view only
calls them and and everything else is in
in cursor off of these presenters and in
here we have a presenter and this
presenter is called when a user sends a
feedback we've we've we've the feedback
from the forum and and once it's done it
is finishing the activity actually there
is more logic inside but I deleted some
parts of there it's also showing the
result but I didn't want to do it in
here okay so this way this way our
presenters contains our business logic
our views are stupid and you can easily
make more and more of them our ambition
in cotton Academy up is to make also iOS
mobile watch Android TV car Firefox
plug-in Firefox Chrome it is all
possible and it's not it only takes time
for us but it is all ready to go so I've
seen an example you know you can see
projects where iOS is implemented in in
Catalan native where Firefox is
implemented in cotton native so it's all
ready to go and at that time to sit and
and and write it if you want to help us
this is the link and we are very open
for contributions and learning it all
together ok this was one approach but
there is another fascinating approach
because if you look at that we have
cotton in native it is compiled to
bytecode
and actually every device doesn't matter
if it is computer or phone have some
processor and it is running bytecode so
actually you can make you can make
version for every device on on the
Catalan native so you can write Android
application on cotton if you can write
iOS application or cut in a difficult
and even from from assembly you can also
write a browser application in the
Catlin native and they are all written
natively they are all very efficient so
it's very good for games and and this is
and thanks to that we can have common
models don't need to be common they can
be cut in native modules and they can
use Kotlin native libraries like C or
C++ libraries as long as these libraries
much all the platforms so this is very
cool alternative solution I want you to
look at this solution and and I want to
compare them they are both code called
native but they are called data from the
other side this is native from the
development perspective that you are
developing it the same way as you
develop it if it wouldn't be Kotlin you
know so you are not changing your
behaviour you can use the same things
you can use the same libraries so it is
native from the verb and point of view
but this is native from the compiler
point of view that the code is actually
compiled to bytecode so it is native for
for our bytecode both solutions have
their pros and cons this is much easier
to do and like for smaller stuff it is
like more standard way so it's I think
it's much better way to do like an
application or something but if you need
to make like some advanced game I think
this is much better solution because you
can make high performance using OpenGL
on GL years and this is actually what
what continent made because I forgot to
mention it they made a game that is
written for all of them this is a screen
for this game and they also made server
in it is all encoding native and it's
not a trigger game so this is working
and and you can you can you can do it it
can check it out and it is available on
github so this is not it's not a wish
it's a it's now so
and both solutions are available and I
believe that the second solution is just
begging for some good game development
framework that is written natively in
and all in code means from bottom to up
okay I hope that you are fascinated in
Kotlin now agora will tell you how you
can start your adventure with katli if
you want to check it out basically if
you wanna play with cotton a little bit
and see what is the syntax how does it
work we like cotton to improvise perfect
solution which is called cotton
playground it's a basically website that
have online compiler where you can run
the code some you have even some ID
so the idea assistance could have some
coding cones which are kind of exercises
and kind of tasks or challenges to to
play with cotton to solve them of course
cotton is compatible with most of most
of the powerful ideas available today so
all you need is a cotton packing
installed so some of them like Android -
you have cotton plugin predefined some
of them like an theory they are we need
to kind of check it somewhere in the in
the Creator so it's quite easy so in
terms of Android that we are talking
about basically we just select single
checkbox include cotton project and this
will configure the Gradle dependencies
inside the project and we can start
using kita out of them out of the box
what's important here is that not every
one of us is lucky enough to work on new
project every day right like mostly we
work on a project that are maintained
for a long period of time so you kind of
joined somewhere in the middle of
lifecycle it's a bunch of classes so
nobody will throw it away and say like
let's draw like our work from us four
years from 50 developers and start using
code in most that's why one of the
coding biggest advantages that this is
something that
JetBrains worse aiming for is
interoperability this means that we can
have some we can create closely cross
language projects so we have Java
classes inside our project but you can
also have a coding classes inside the
project but it's more than that because
it's
interoperable this means that from
within coding class we can instantiate
or extend any Java class exactly in the
same way as we would extend God
instantiate coding class or extended and
the other way around
so inside coding class we can use Java
classes exactly like any other coding
class so this means that basically if we
target JVM we can use all the libraries
that allow the label for java inside the
cotinine like any other write library
the another cool thing is that because
originally cotinine was kind of replaced
replacement for java we have this
converter which converts Java code into
cotton so we can take whole class and
basically run single comment which is
called convert cotton and it will change
the change the code it's it's not the
usually most dramatic approach but
coding or cotton plug-in has a lot of
assistance that we would convert this
normal code into more coding declarative
style or simple simple and shorter
syntax
besides converting whole classes we have
also this nice feature of converting
parts of the code so let's say we are
not sure how to write some encoding we
can write it in in Java at the language
we know copied to clipboard and simply
paste into cotton file and unless this
is assuming this is valid Java code it
will be converted into cotton before
before pasting into into the file so
regard if you want to know more about
coding and definitely multipad from
development to check cotton Academy
which is marching marching blog he
describes yeah we also we also write a
book we figure
Android development with Kotlin it is I
think especially suitable for people who
are Android developers and they are
moving to Kotlin but I think others can
profit from that too also there are lots
of resources for cuddling there are
various companies like with which is
really active there is really active
community and it is really cool so once
you have some question you can just go
there and ask and
lots of people can help you there is
there is a cotton talking cotton is a
podcast there are talks there is cotton
in Inc LinkedIn there are lots of
resources for cotton in developers
website you will find those things
actually working also what we recommend
from for the big beginners is definitely
check out the Android resources and
copying Docs
this might sound like crazy to read code
and to read documentation but actually
cotton Doc's are great I was literally
learning from cutting Docs and I I love
them and they are even better right now
because they're like features like every
code you can just click and it's your
move to ripple so we can play with every
example and every example is working
because you can you can do it so it is
they have really cool documentation and
also there is the so-called Copeland
cards there is huge set of like
challenges challenges tasks that you can
try yourself and it is I think very nice
way of learning by challenging yourself
if you like this way so basically you
have a task set of unit tests that
verify whatever not you you solved it
correctly okay that's it for today thank
you for your attention thank you
and I believe you have some questions or
not oh so boycott Li no mono scholar
because I seem to be solving very
similar problems I hate job is not very
good so basically like Scala is super
power of language in terms were you can
do everything in Scala but this is all
so many disadvantages because you can do
everything in many ways so it's much
more difficult to learn because in sky
life of problems like okay somebody
created librarian defined custom
operated operator so what is the
difference between exclamation mark -
monkey and monkey is the measure mark
are so it kind of skies I would say more
powerful but at the same time is much
more difficult to to learn it is saying
that Scala that scholar works with Java
and Kotlin is interrupts with Java and
this is a feeling if you think that the
biggest case that in in cutting you can
basically go into Java project change
one class into cotton and it it works
just like that in Java it's not so
simple I tried it and it never works
this way and also in Scala is Scala is
very good for like data analysis or it's
also good for for for back-end but it's
not so good for like applications
development I have done it and
computation time is quite high and also
execution time at least when I was using
Scala for mobile development it was it
was much slower than
then then Java where the copying is
nearly as fast as Java so this is I
think the answer some other questions
okay cool thank you for your attention
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
