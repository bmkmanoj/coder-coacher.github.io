was it four of NDC Sydney who here has
been here all four days cool did anyone
go on the boat last night welcome I'm
surprised you're here congratulations
give yourselves a round of applause for
showing up is anyone here with a sponsor
of MDC please stand up come on come on
do it do it do it
alright everybody clap thank you it's
without the sponsorship that we would
not be here so thank you very much for
sponsoring in DC alright so today I am
heatherwilde and this is choice is
overrated designing products that know
what you want before you do so this is
the most hated slide that I do but I do
it because if you don't talk about
yourself no one else will so I'm gonna
go through this real quick
I am the CTO of a company called twit
and also a Rocketeer
that means I'm very busy as well as
speaking here I'm also busy designing
products for these two companies I've
had 20 plus years of customer experience
design means I am older than I look and
I am currently the only female Advisory
Board Chair to an engineering school in
the world which is pretty cool I think
and I was one of the founding employees
of a company called Evernote which is
automatically installed on many of your
phones and computers by default so
you're welcome and also an early
employee at Spirit Airlines which is
currently the most profitable airline in
the United States which is also pretty
cool I think and I've gotten a lot of
awards and stuff and I currently write
for Inc
Forbes and tech Co so I'm responsible
for a lot of clickbait you see on the
internet again you're welcome
so we make 35,000 conscious and
unconscious decisions every single day
stop and think about that for a second
just from the time you've been walking
in here you've been making probably
around 150 decisions just from the time
you sat down am I in the
right talk ish why is she wearing that
dress did I eat the right thing for
lunch should I really have gone on that
boat trip last night why am I not
talking to Troy Hunt right now this is
the kind of thing that you are talking
about and thinking about in your head
these things are not always conscious
but they contribute to something called
decision fatigue and as designers it's
our fault when we design things like
that every single day we have to keep
filling out forms on the internet and
making sure that we're actually doing
things in a way that makes sense so for
example this is a real form from a
donation site a charity asking people to
donate money by the time you've gotten
just to your address to enter your email
which is like halfway down the page
you're given up on the fact that you
want to actually give money to this
thing and you go away there's a better
way people by the end of the day people
are so tired that they don't even know
what to Google anymore they're asking
and this is a real screencap I didn't
make this up if you go into Google and
you start how do I actually Google shows
up
how do you play Google something is a
top hit on Google and it actually makes
sense if you think about it because
people are trying to figure out how do
you enter the syntax to make a Google
search pop up in fact some people try to
figure out what is it that they can type
in to make somebody's results pop up in
another way and I have friends all the
time they're like how do you make your
results look different than mine when
you're typing in the same things well
it's interesting
but it's it's just you're so tired by
the end of the day that everybody pretty
much looks like this now you get home
from work after making so many decisions
by the end of the day you're already at
like 25,000 decisions just by the time
you got into work home from work that
you just you don't want to do anymore so
we create products like this like the
Amazon Alexa and they're meant to help
us right
we're now asking the Alexa Alexa what's
the weather and then we hope that it
gives us the right temperature but then
we have to make sure that we've
programmed it first to tell us where
where we're located in the world and
what we have to do and maybe it's gonna
ask us do you want it from the weather
channel or do you want it from Weather
Underground or do you want it from
somewhere no no no no more decisions
please just give me the weather I've
been trying to get my show me pictures
of ammos alone it's been like five tries
already okay can you show me pictures of
the mouth dawn okay can you show me
pictures of a mould
loan no no mode okay can you show me
pictures of mold loan okay please show
me pictures of not loan you can't tell
me that this hasn't happened to you okay
Google this is my last try can you show
me pictures of a mold law
powdery mildew Google can you
shut down it can't even do that by like
so when we design products we want to
account for everything if we're not
anticipating our users then we're not
going to give the best chance
so I mean Google a lot of us use ok
Google or hello Siri or all of these
things that are meant to help us or even
hey Alexa but if the skills aren't
working the way they're supposed to
because we're not accounting for
people's different accents then it's not
really helpful and everybody has
autocorrect fails every single day this
is a problem I I can't tell you how many
times I've turned off autocorrect and
then it turns itself back on every time
there's an update so it's really it just
it's such a part of our technology now
that people are just used to trying to
automatically translate autocorrect from
other people so what we won't need to
make sure is that we do not cause these
kind of problems when we're already at
our cap if we are designing things that
are making people so if we're trying to
design something that's easy and people
are just at their wit's end already
then it's a problem so companies are
trying to help so Amazon has created
something called the - button and I know
Amazon's not big here in Australia yet
but it's coming and the - button is
something that is pretty cool because
it's meant to anticipate products that
you order not all the time but sometimes
so for example this is something that
you stick on your washing machine - when
you realise that you're running out of
washing powder you click the - button
and then it
send it with to you within two days and
then over time it learns how frequently
you're going to need it so then it can
just add it to your subscribe and save
without you needing to do the - button
magic is a service that you have in the
US where it's it's integrated in
iMessage also in facebook chat where you
can send it just I want this done and
then they just ask one little bit of
information and then because they're
integrated with your contact list they
have most of the information for you and
they can then do things however it's not
truly anticipatory because you still do
need to invoke it who here thinks
Netflix is a really good example of
anticipatory design exactly
so Netflix is terrible for this because
every time you open it up how long does
it take on average to pick a movie or TV
show yeah like 15 to 20 minutes right or
longer my friends and I have started to
do something called Netflix roulette
where we just close our eyes and point
because if you spend too long what
they've started to do is have about an
infinite scroll in each direction for TV
shows which is not anticipatory at all
what it's trying to do is actually help
their data algorithm to pick out what
you are going to pick in the end however
that's not helpful to the user because
now with all the decisions that you've
had to make you're already fatigued and
you can't possibly pick something so if
it's gonna take you half an hour to
relax then you're not really relaxing
however there are 2.5 quintillion bytes
of data produced every single day
because of all of those decisions were
making online all of those things that
we're entering on Facebook all of the
things that we're doing without even
knowing it like those eye tracking
things that we install into our software
- to capture heat mapping information
even the things like all of the
that we type in facebook Messenger and
iMessage and stuff that then suddenly
somehow magically becomes retargeted ads
within Facebook and we're like how did
that happen
that goes into the 2.5 quintillion bytes
of data and I have no idea what that
looks like but it probably looks
something like this and it's just a lot
of data over and over again so much data
that it actually has to be transported
by things like sneakernet still people
are actually carrying hard drives in
FedEx planes around the world because
it's so much it can't even be carried by
the pipes but it allows us to do
something pretty cool we actually now
can tell the future we can start
predicting what people want because if
we're using AI to do this we have a
higher degree of personalization
available and that's pretty darn cool so
now we actually start to be able to
create these anticipatory experiences
because we have so much data available
we can do some awesome stuff with it
ideally with an anticipatory system
we're going to limit the options that
people have we're gonna cut back on
those decisions they have to make and
then make them a happier healthier
person so that they can actually use a
product that makes them happier so here
is the the basic blueprint for something
that has anticipatory design it is the
cross bones of machine learning user
experience and IOT so think about that
for a second you've got an actual bit of
hardware something an IOT device and
that's very important because you have
to have something that allows you to get
the input now that can be an Alexa it
can be a nest device it can even be some
application that you've created for an
iPhone like it can be an app however it
needs to be some kind of
put device that you're using to collect
data then you've got your machine
learning algorithms
crunching lots and lots of data and
you've got beautiful design and that's
key - it needs to be beautiful you can't
just have some jenkki thing that you
paid somebody on Fiverr to do this has
to be absolutely gorgeous or people
aren't gonna pay attention to it and
we're talking like Joanie Ives kind of
gorgeous now when you're doing it you
don't have to be right all the time and
that's the cool thing so there's there's
a company in America that happens to
also be around the world called
Starbucks you might have heard of them
that's doing something anticipatory with
their ordering they have the Starbucks
app and if you install it on your phone
they're using a combination of NFC and
beacon technology plus you're ordering
history to know what things you like so
if you are near certain stores they they
will pop up a notification that says
come on in your coffee's ready
your coffee's ready
you haven't ordered it how do they know
what you want how do you know how'd they
know you were there well hey if my
coffee's ready I'm gonna go in and pick
it up right that's pretty cool that they
already knew and if what's what's cool
about it is that the coffee's not
actually ready they don't start making
it until they sense that you're walking
into the store but by the time you're at
the counter the coffee is ready so but
they have an idea based on your past
purchases of exactly what one you would
want based on the different times of day
what your purchases would be so what's
interesting about that is if you show up
at a Starbucks at 4:00 in the afternoon
and they hand you a coffee that's
automatically charged to you account you
don't even have to do anything about it
and it wasn't exactly what you really
wanted them but somebody just handed you
a coffee would you drink it probably
you're probably like yes
so that you just had any entry
whoo-hoo I got a present even though
you're paying for it and that's what
Amazon's goal is Amazon is hitting it
big because every time somebody gets a
box from Amazon they're like I got a
present it doesn't matter that I got I
had to pay for it I get a new box and I
get to open it all the time so it's that
loyalty that is bringing people back so
they're doing things right we're gonna
get into a little bit more about that in
a second so here's how again this works
it's just another way of showing you
what the anticipatory design is so you
have to collect this data you have to
have some means of collecting it and
then you create a way of reading it you
have to have a way of crunching that
number and then you get to anticipate
things and it's so who here is a data
scientist in the room anybody yeah cool
so world is getting really fun for you
guys the more data there is and anybody
that was not a data scientist come and
talk to these ones after this because
they're very important because you
cannot do anticipatory design without
having a good data science consultant or
a data scientist on your team so here
are some good examples of anticipatory
design in Google Maps they not only now
are showing how like when you search for
something they're actually giving you
goober results when you're searching
because they're assuming that not only
will you want to have some kind of
transit to places it's not just Maps now
but also when you're searching for
restaurants they're assuming you might
want to book a table there and then
interestingly if you do booked a table
in the email it says would you like to
book an uber to get there so it's a
completely integrated thing and not just
uber but in whatever country you're in
it has the local taxi apps as well so if
you're in Europe you'll get get and halo
if you're in America you'll have
and left so here it was just a burr that
popped up for me but I'm sure as others
come in there'll be others
in uber the anticipatory application for
it is you open it up it already knows or
it already assumes that you are starting
from where you're at so it wants you to
point in where you're going now you can
override that until it you want to start
from somewhere else like if you're
booking for someone else but it's
anticipating that you want to start from
where you are so that is a saving steps
moment for people nest is a really
awesome hardware device that when you
get it it has certain settings
out-of-the-box where all you need to do
is punch in your zip code your postal
code for it and based on the settings
around you from what they already know
from their massive amounts of data it
will then automatically program the nest
with some general settings for your area
for temperature for what the people
around you generally use and then from
there it learns beyond that what your
personal preferences would be for
example I live in Las Vegas Nevada which
is a desert and generally hot in the
summer and cool very cool in the winter
so people tend to keep it hotter in in
the houses in the summer around 80
degrees Fahrenheit which is like 32 or
24 here or something like that so when
people set that instead of having it at
72 it would be around 80 now if I was in
New York it would be around 72 in the
summer so based on the zip code it
automatically knows that digit is an app
that anticipates your spending patterns
and will will hide money from you so
that you can actually save money because
most of us are terrible at that now I
don't know about you but if I have an
app that knows that I'm bad at saving
money and finds ways to scroll it away
from me I'm all for that and that's
that's how did it works it knows for
example that I
might spend money at Starbucks on
Mondays and Thursdays so it'll take the
money on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Fridays
as well that I would spend on Starbucks
and hide that so suddenly I've got extra
money in a savings account that I
wouldn't already have project soli
is a hardware anticipatory device it's
guessing what people would actually use
as gestures it's trying to figure out if
if you would know what like a hand knob
turn or a volume knob turn would be in
the air whether there's no volume knob
at all
so without so it's trying to sense and
anticipate what you would actually do to
conduct music in your house so if you're
just sitting on the couch what gestures
would you use to raise the volume of
music or lower it and by creating an
anticipatory experience with hardware
that's what that kind of looks like my
company twit one of the things that we
do is we anticipate what kind of trips
people will want to go on based on their
personality so we have created not only
a behavioral assessment to understand
the the personality that people have
when they're traveling but we've also
taken a lot of data from not only the
the web and people's way all of that
information out there about people but
we've taken the data from available
trips and matched that together to
understand these are the best trips to
recommend to people and as more data
comes in we'll be able to have a better
recommender engine for them medium has a
very cool thing that I recommend all of
you that our product designers start
doing right now instead of having a
password reset they have an email link
so nowhere does it say reset password
because everybody hates having their
password reset what they do is instead
of reset password it just says email me
a link to sign in because if you can't
remember what your password is if you
can't remember what it is
then you just want to be able to sign in
so they're anticipating the next step
beyond that so this is absolutely
awesome anticipatory design there so
we've all heard of the uncanny valley
this is where machine learning has an
uncanny valley it's a really big problem
because you end up with okay people are
okay when you suggest movie
recommendations it's fine and we're okay
with glass holes walking around like
with their taking pictures of us and
stuff we're not cool with very very bad
recommendations like if I walked into
Starbucks and they handed me a unicorn
frappuccinos all the time I'd be really
freaking pissed at them so like if they
didn't learn that I was ditching those
in the trash every time then that would
be a problem but if every single thing
that Amazon was sending me and
suggesting to me and if everything in my
subscribe and save box was perfect or
most of it was I'd be super happy and so
would you I'm willing to bet so what
happens when it goes wrong in the u.s.
target I don't know if you have target
here but there was they used some
machine learning to figure out what
purchases would work for people like
what they crunched the numbers to figure
out if they could predict certain buying
patterns for people and what they did
was find that if you had unscented
lotion mineral supplements and cotton
balls that you were likely pregnant like
if you were buying these things so they
then signed you up for like their target
baby option and started sending you
coupons for prenatal supplements and
diapers and things like that
unfortunately a father in Minnesota got
these addressed to his 15 year old
daughter
and was wondering what the it turned out
indeed she was pregnant
target knew it ahead of time and she was
very much in trouble so when you're
doing things wrong you need to make sure
that you're you have a way out
it's no problem if Netflix suggests the
wrong movie it is a big problem if
target tells you you're pregnant before
your doctor does and if you think about
things we're algorithms are suggesting
people to be targeted at airports that's
another big problem so we need to be
very careful about what we're
anticipating so you you want to make
sure that you have the right amount of
data and that you're you're analyzing it
right and that's where these guys will
come in handy as well because they'll
give you the right filter to look at it
so Amazon is a very very popular company
because they do three things very well
they provide convenience for one-stop
shopping they remember what you bought
when you bought it and they recommend
other products for you
and that's extremely cool because they
have jumped to the top of the charts
around the world for that there's
there's very few companies like rocked
on does that and very few others so
Amazon is doing that but they're also at
the forefront of design they've filed a
patent for anticipatory shipping they're
testing this out in various places
Las Vegas is one of them where the idea
is this is from their patent the idea is
that they will have within 15 minutes of
you're ordering the product that you
have ordered exactly to your doorstep
and how do they know that well it's
based on your usage patterns on the
internet not just on Amazon and also on
your previous buying
they'll know I mean they generally have
it down to two items already and in
their testing this out with something
called Amazon Prime now in in certain
cities in America what it does is
they've checked to see they have
different distribution centers where
within they can deliver things within an
hour and it's the most popular items but
it's also like some items that you're
like why on earth would this be well
again it's based on people's preferences
that they have them in these shipping
centers so that they can get to them
within an hour so it's kind of creepy
though to some people that how can
Amazon know the exact thing that I want
before I even knew I wanted it well how
many times have you been to a forum to
ask questions about a TV like your the
inputs on your TV we're going out or you
wanted to know if if something was
compatible with a Playstation that you
had or something there's questions that
are predictors of and behaviors or
predictors of what we're going to do and
we're not the only ones in the world
that do them so it's by not just doing
them on Amazon
we even even the reviews that we read on
Amazon are often enough information to
know what product we're going to end up
with in the end so Amazon is just
starting the corner in the market on
that so now we're going to get into how
to turn something into an anticipatory
experience first thing you need to do is
imagine whatever your business is as a
service if you're already a service
you're ahead of the curve but if you're
not a service if you're just a product
whether it's a hardware product or a
software product then you're not there
yet it has to be some kind of a platform
where it can scale and once you once you
can serve your users some way then you
have the beginnings of an anticipatory
product then simple but you need to
create digital access to it
so even if you have a form if it's not a
digital platform you're not there yet
like you could have an API great but if
it's just a hidden API that's plugged
into something that nobody can access
not great so make sure that you have
some kind of digital access where you
can gather data and you're good now
find ways to automate because if you are
a service delivering a product and you
have no way to automate that then you're
not scalable and we need to scale into
the many many many many millions upon
millions upon millions amounts of data
and you can't do that with just random
delivery drivers running around so there
are is a great amount of I mean delivery
is great for example but they're still
not going to be able to get the massive
amounts of data to predict people's
buying patterns then launch an automated
service because now that you've got the
ability to watch it how many people have
created something or thought about
something forever and never got it to
launch exactly launching it is 90% of
the way there and once it's launched yay
you're done right no okay now you have
to actually figure out what your users
can live without and here's the
anticipatory part because it's and it's
a real ethical question of you know
better than them what they need right
because you're the product designer
you're the you're the creator so what is
it that you can take away you've got all
these features you've got everything
that they need but what is it that they
can do what is it that they need to do
Spotify is a perfect example of this
Spotify used to require you to create
playlists when you came in and you
couldn't really do anything until you
like added all your friends and listen
to what they did and searched and
everything now Spotify has
a great feature where it has automated
playlists you go in there's six buttons
super anticipatory you just hit a button
and it starts playing music awesome it
also searches your friends histories to
see what they're listening to and it'll
start playing if you want it to it'll
start playing based on what they're
playing it's great too they actually
stole that one from Pandora but that's
cool
so with Spotify they're anticipated
they're anticipating that the reason
you're going into Spotify is you want to
listen to music that's it so you know
what the homepage of Spotify has it
doesn't have menu options settings it
has listen to music and then there's a
Settings gear
hidden in the library which is three
pages away because they don't want you
to have to deal with that so knowing
what you can hide knowing what you can
knowing what's distracting is the key to
anticipatory design then analyze it
you've got a lot of data that's coming
in so pay attention if you've got
outliers that's okay
contact those people figure out what's
going wrong with them maybe there's
somebody that's colorblind and you need
to account for that if you've got a
whole bunch of people that are suddenly
dropping off after you took out a button
then you better put that button back
because you screw it up but you need to
understand what people are actually
using and a lot of times you're gonna be
right you're gonna choose the right
things because you know your product
better than the customers do and if you
actually go on vision on purpose then
you're going to design the right things
but keep analyzing do micro experiments
all the time and you'll be able to tell
exactly where the right things are but
the aim of this should be to simplify
things
when Spotify took their menu and hid it
in the library
it wasn't trying to make things
difficult on people to get to the
settings it was to make it simpler so
that you didn't have clutter when you
were looking to start music now for
those of us when we do have to go to the
settings we're like oh my gosh I have to
go to the library to get to the settings
to the whatever but how often do you
have to do that probably not that
frequently so yes it may be annoying
then but it's simple for everyone else
most of the time and everything that is
on that screen should add value so
whatever you have should be a valuable
interaction like Spotify again those six
things that are anticipate Ori are
valuable to the user they are something
that makes a difference and if they
didn't make a difference they shouldn't
be there if they weren't valuable stick
them on a high foreign screen or get rid
of them altogether make it an easter egg
because if it doesn't add value if it's
not simple and if it's not a beautiful
design if it's clunky and you're
shoehorning it in get rid of it it
shouldn't be there please people
pre-populate your forms you should not
have any reason that you don't know
people's information that there's things
that you can hide like if you already
know somebody's browser information if
you you've got a reasonably good
information about their email address
because you're getting it from a
newsletter you should probably know what
their first name is - if it's coming
from a newsletter you should know in the
backend what their browser information
is and what their geolocation is you
should there's so many bits of
information you can pre-populate right
now if you're not doing that you fail
you fail you fail so please make sure
your pre-populating as much information
as possible and don't have more than
probably more than five things on one
screen at a time it's okay to have
multiple screens for people to go
through but if they see a big long form
they're just gonna get so tired and
they're gonna leave especially if you're
somebody that's trying to get money from
someone if you're trying to get money
think think stripe they don't even ask
for your name they just ask for the
credit card information and
and you need the name later but really
all I want is your money just give me
your money people that's it so like they
got it down to a science but it's like
yes what is the most important thing
that will add the most value here your
credit card that's it all right done
let's move on
and you put on the unity minutes early
smartthings life like never before
pretty cool huh
like that we're living in the future
this is stuff that I was promised I
would get when I was a kid and I'm like
yes okay so it's art it's 20 years late
I was supposed to have this in like 1999
whatever it's here now so what are we
gonna do next where where's the next
stuff like great I've got a an oven that
makes dinner for me awesome so what are
you guys gonna think of next
so our phones are already having
conversations with each other which is
awesome and Elon Musk is totally freaked
out about BOTS talking to each other
which is great too because he's afraid
of all sorts of things but he's also
gonna take us to Mars so we'll give him
that one we have us an amazing
opportunity to create such amazing
things and I'm so excited about this
time so I just want to leave you with a
quote from one of my inspirations
Buckminster Fuller who here knows who
Buckminster Fuller is yeah cool he's the
guy he's a crazy dude that invented like
the geodesic domes if anyone's ever seen
spaceship earth at Disney World he
invented that but he basically said that
integrity is the essence of everything
successful and that's something that you
need to keep in mind when you're
creating an anticipatory experience
because you are going to be taking away
choices from a user late and if you are
not ethical about those things that
you're taking away then it's going to
cause a big problem but if you have
integrity about what you're doing if you
are on point if you're on purpose then
the things that you design will be
beautiful and will last for a long time
so with that I'm gonna open up the floor
to questions and that's where the duckie
brigade comes into play anyone that asks
a question
gets a duck so if you want one of these
you need to ask a question all right so
who here has any questions to ask come
on all right do we have a microphone
hi so what exactly would you do to
figure out the trade-off between this is
a piece of information that I can hide
from somebody versus this is a piece of
information that is necessary okay so
that's where I would I would always go
to the simplest thing possible what is
like go down to what are the basic
elements of your application what is it
supposed to do so think about the Apple
iPod what at essence is the iPod it's
it's something that you listen to music
so they took away everything except the
toggle switch from the iPod the original
iPod didn't even have a display screen
on it and when you're designing
something that's anticipatory always go
back to thinking about the iPod the
original iPod where the only thing on it
was a way to advance music so where you
could connect it to the computer and
then add more things but that was like
the hidden menu so what is the very
essence of your product and your basic
design should allow your users to do
that and then hide everything else and
that's where I go nice catch anyone else
all right
you've spent a little bit about sort of
what happens that you need to feedback
information when you get it wrong and
sort of recover gracefully from that it
seems like working out why it was wrong
is gonna be a really huge challenge can
you speak a little bit as to how you
could figure that out here's where
customer service comes in so I know as
engineers we don't like to talk to
people it's really hard and we don't
like that but when we notice those that
I mean and and also like we're
anonymizing data so it's difficult I
mean so when you're looking at the data
on a big scale you don't know that this
is an actual person however people that
are having a problem you can then send
out a mass survey when you notice that
there's issues to your users and say hey
can you give us feedback and then they
will give you feedback and then you can
use that another thing is if you are a
public entity people will often use
things like iTunes reviews and Amazon
reviews and all sorts of things like
that and then you can read those and be
really sad about the hateful things and
if anyone was in my talk yesterday about
your customers hate you you can there's
many things that you can learn from your
customers but talking to them and really
understanding and filtering that
feedback is an amazing way to tell and
that's why I like for example at
Evernote when we released an iPhone
version that was green on green with
green text very different shades of
green but suddenly our downloads were
terrible we figured out quickly that it
was because well it looked beautiful on
the latest version of iPhone most of our
users didn't have the latest and
greatest and it looked terrible on the
older ones so they just stopped
downloading it and just using the
desktop and we asked them and that was
why so see can I do this
no but it was close all right I just
wanted to do is get your opinion on do
you think the predictive interfaces
would hinder some people's choice to
change like you mentioned the example of
Starbucks coffee let's say people want
to change or try something new with with
that you know discourage people from or
you know changing making different
choices uh still with when when you've
got a good anticipatory product you
actually can then recommend things to
people as well so Starbucks is actually
really good at that too where they
actually did and there's a video of me
if you want to check it out on YouTube
where Starbucks sent me to unicorn
frappuccinos one for me to try and one
for a friend to try just because they
knew I won on the unicorn Whisperer and
- I love Starbucks so just I was at home
one day and a person showed up at my
house from post mates with two unicorn
frappuccinos and I was like wow that's
really anticipatory of them so then I
went on YouTube of course and
live-streamed my reaction to it so it's
really funny you might want to look that
up but yes so you can push out things
based on what you know of your users and
and you can keep testing that and
testing that and that's what target was
trying to do with their target baby the
problem is when you're dealing with
personal preferences like there's very
certain things that you can't touch like
they'd they didn't realize that baby
stuff is very personal just like you
don't want to touch politics or religion
either so there's there's very very
specific things that you want to stay
away from but it's okay if they suggest
the wrong drink at Starbucks so learn
what's good and what's bad alright I
might hit you in the head when I do this
so hold on is like
oh very not close yay all right okay and
then you spoke about the the target
issue and when you when a vendor
wouldn't look out look at some of these
information but what about as a consumer
is there technologies or guidelines for
how people can indicate their
preferences about how much of the data
they want to have inspected absolutely
so any company that is collecting your
data is required to let you know that
they're collecting your data so you can
then go into your preferences and say do
not collect my data if you're if you
live in the EU and I know some of you do
that google allows you to opt out from
being indexed by Google every company
says when you're on your Android phone
when you install an application it goes
through what things it asks you to use
so if you want the ability to have your
data tracked then you can say absolutely
go for it and for other things it's like
no so I am one because I know how a lot
of this works what I do is before I
install a new application I check I
check to see what the security policies
for the companies are what their track
records do they have a responsible
disclosure program that's a very
important thing for me if they do have a
responsible disclosure program then I
know that they're actually on top of
security and they're going to be taking
good care of my data that doesn't mean
that they're not going to have a problem
at some point in time that doesn't mean
that that they may not have a data
breach because I'm sorry people that
everybody gets breached at some point in
time that is that is a fact that is not
something that that companies can do but
the way that they keep breached the
amount of data that's taken and the type
of data that's taken is is what can be
taken care of so so yeah if if you want
to opt-out of things than any good
company will be able to let you know
that
good catch I didn't want you to move
that on the topic of data trafficking do
you think it should be opt-in or opt-out
by default well I actually prefer it to
be opt-in by default because I know that
the data is is going to be anonymized so
it's it's going to be used for you in a
silo and then anonymized as a whole so
any good company and and well I mean
these data guys can tell you that in
general like the data is useless if your
name is attached to it anyway and for
example the reason that stripe doesn't
get your name is because it's it's
useless to them to store your name with
it so what you need to do is store that
information in a separate place so data
on large scale needs to be anonymized
because your name is not important so
yeah I I think opt-in by default so that
we can have this because you on your own
are not useful to anticipatory design
you as a person in the country of
Australia in the world is are extremely
important let's see good job all right
anyone else all right well cool thank
you guys for coming I hope you enjoyed
it if you did like the talk there are
green cards outside if there were not
Troy Hunt has red cards right outside
his talk and I really appreciate it
so great day everyone thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
