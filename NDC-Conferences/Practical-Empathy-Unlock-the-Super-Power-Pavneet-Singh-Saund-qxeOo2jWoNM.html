our developer go back in the years and
remember I remember how it was the start
at your first developer job it's your
first day you're feeling nervous excited
tense and perhaps a little scared you
enter and you're welcome
you make the rounds you say hi to
everyone and then you shown to your desk
Jagr you ever equipped in front of you
and then you get your credentials and
then start logging in so you had access
to the dev systems and then you start
copying and it's setting up your
environment now while this is going on
you're working around you start hearing
noises in the background
you start hearing voices rising up you
hear that productions down something
happens with the database
I like wow this is exciting the first
day I mean what's up and then you start
scanning the screen your screen and you
see that you just deleted the database
in production oops
so you see the CTL coming towards you he
pulls you over and you're standing there
you're struggling to even say a word you
want to say sorry want to say one
explain yourself then he just looks at
you and says you mess up everything get
out of here
you never come back this seems like a
pretty strange examples to bring up but
it happened just a few days ago a
developer walked in on his first day and
made a mistake and was fired now in this
post he goes into detail about what
happened that's not important now this
is an aluminium furnace is all made of
aluminium but you got element inside it
around I will say how many years ago
when I was 18 I stood in front of one of
these my job was to add alloys into this
furnace from and create different
mixtures I was meant to put 10 kilos of
manganese I put 150 what that basically
means is the whole batch and the sole
production line is closed down for
around a week every day they lost around
the million dollars in revenue so I
broke production as I stood in the
office of my supervisor
I still remember feeling feet together
tense I was sweating and not because
it's hot there I was sweating he came
around the desk he put his hand on my
shoulder and he told me
how are you oh yes and how are you I
said I'm scared don't worry we all make
mistakes go home have a rest come back
tomorrow when I came back and they
didn't clean up this mess and the week
after I would give him full
responsibility for everything to
destruction like what I was shown what I
was shown that they was empathy he knew
what it felt Center he knew how it was
to make mistake and he understood I was
scared I didn't know that the time but I
recognize now so hi everyone I'm pav
neat I am a web developer but for anyone
who's seen the keynote web developer the
web developer title is kind of taken so
I'm not some certain berners-lee I'm a
team lead at the combat group where we
make where we maintain and create the
Nordics largest e-commerce store we are
60 around 60 developers distributed
three four different locations I'm also
a contributor to our local dotnet user
group and I also part of the local stock
black community for any programming
language so any developers in in our
area and that's all give me ping get
member
I'm also the author and creator of the
site's coding with empathy dot-com it's
a site where I store a human aspect of
software development I try to go three
it's a place for me to reflect upon
things gauge how others feel around
topics and explore how this D developer
do we develop in a team within
department and also across our industry
and obviously with the drop of empathy
but where has this focus on them to
become have I always been empathetic you
see it's actually not something that
I've really reflected on until very
recently it was created after one of the
most difficult periods of my life where
I've never been lower but the result was
empathy which has led me to too well
which led me to say that empathy is now
become a guiding principle in my life as
a software developer so just a quick
overview or what we can touch on today
then you go into some definitions go
into a story about discovering empathy
and how we could try to cultivate
ourselves oh one thing
I am no expert on this matter I am a I
have no titles I have no courses this is
my experiences and take voters so does
anyone here want to share their
understanding what empathy is a word or
a couple of words anyone just shout out
there's note there no wrong answers here
anything being able to understand
another person's position right anyone
else here on someone else feels well you
guys are good all right
it is it is hard it's different it's
difficult as many people don't actually
understand what is this definition which
I'm gonna bring up this from three sir
Wiseman I think Donna Braun has made a
popular its ability to see the world as
others see it understand another's
current feelings do so without judgment
and communicate that understanding back
to them this is the way I see it a
mixture of they're basically two or
three types of empathy one we often
associate ourselves with which is
emotional empathy and then there's
cognitive empathy emotional is all of
these the way I see it and cognitive is
more around perspective taking and
without going very deep into the
feelings
Sam empathy I also think it makes sense
of sympathy and with sympathy I mean
these these terms get mixed around
really really awesome I don't know if I
fully grasp them myself but this is my
breakdown so far sympathy is when you
feel sorry for someone right I'm sorry
for your loss you're showing sympathy
it's not a bad bad things there is just
another way of expressing it whereas
empathy you're feeling with someone so
with sympathy you conceptually
understand the struggles of what
someone's going through how they're
doing don't have look what are going
through where is empathy
it's not about understanding it's about
connecting you connect with that feeling
within you with sympathy it's very easy
to offer a solution come with your
perspective and with empathy again
you're focusing on the connection itself
through empathy you can actually come to
a solution which which is the right
solution or a right and better solution
than with sympathy now we can't always
go into empathy because that's a lot
deeper we can get into that an example
of empathy and sympathy is well my my
son came home the other day and he told
me that someone called him a name on the
bus and I jump straight and say wow
that's horrible why'd he do that he must
feel bad and why what I really look back
me and said no no it's not the Sun but
me he also called it to my sister that
made me mad
I was thinking well I'm jumping to a
conclusion here I'm hearing that someone
called him a name and instead of asking
him more about it I'm jumping the
delusion and I'm also saying what I
think about that so that was more closer
to sympathy than empathy what it isn't
empathy is not about agreeing you don't
have to actually agree with what the
other person saying or feeling or doing
well feeling but not the same and it's
not a quick fix and you should not it
should not be over setting your personal
boundaries so are we talking a little
bit about how we're going to cultivate
them or how we can cultivate empathy for
ourselves we jumping into introspection
which is basically self-awareness
understanding ourselves listening and
gaining perspective firstly bit up my
journey
when I when I entered technology when I
entered the development industry I
actually wasn't a developer I was
electrical engineer I knew nothing about
programming and I was thrown in the
project here we go here's the manual for
vb.net enjoy I'm I basically picked up
VD and I we moved off the c-sharp and I
mean it was all about focusing on
technology so I had a couple of
technologies on the radar that get the
jump from B B to C sharp is very quick
sudden put it there and I think this is
something a lot of us do we find
technologies and we go into them and as
we dig dig up things you see all of
these other dots coming up to other
technologies other things dive into and
we get obsessed with these different
things after a while we find our our
clique our tribe our group other thing
or if I'm like many people with the same
language and interest in people and we
kind of stay there for a while but
empathy was never on my radar those way
out and interesting thing is I never
even thought about people when I was
working with people I am I was assigned
tasks I went off spend a few days of
them came back sigh another task and
then I was on the project go away work
yourself come back in half a year well
and just with that vb.net manual so then
I move over to another job where where I
learned that it's possible to work
together and that was a hard experience
for me because suddenly I have to think
about a shared code base I mean nowadays
like I don't know I think it's more
common now we solve our share code with
code bases we talked about shared
repositories I used to put my code on my
USB stick or the cd-rom account remember
it was very personally and I we talked
about things like scrum talked about
things like pair programming testing
these are things that no idea about and
then I met someone called a user now III
I always worked on the backend I work on
services I was on things that you know
didn't really affect anything I thought
and then I moved to web development and
everything I do just go straight out
like wow and I found it really hard I
struggled because I did what's in the
story I try to put in the computer I put
in the system and pushed it and then
someone comes back exactly that's wrong
that's not very nice for dam users I had
that you know that can tell fates ah but
it's hard it's an app that mean that
plus one of the things other things like
we talked about unit testing we talked
about tester involvement and one of the
devs wasn't really a fan of that and he
was so so bad but he didn't like it a
bit Disney to my words he was really
really bad for not being on board with
testing not being on board with with
yeah we hadn't we have a tabs versus
base discussion every other day I think
he was but the point is in my mind he
was bad I I know he wasn't bad as a
person but in my mind of developer he
was bad and these are different things
well things go on and I mature a bit let
me go on and this is not too long ago
this is me burning I remember coming out
of a meeting you see the projects aren't
running late and totally and your
programs is meeting our team your five
of us on the team we are our part of the
project is way behind we're doing a best
but then you're offered a choice either
work overtime now while you have a
little flexibility or wait a few weeks
and we can mandate overtime
okay thank you that's a really nice
choice and at this time I'm a team lead
and while this is being said I just felt
my blood bubbling I felt how this was
this was something which was III didn't
leave it but I had no words to
communicate this outfit I didn't
understand how to communicate this you
know good way and they were swearing
involved and there was a very loud loud
discussion at p.m. though at the end
though we kind of agreed those who are
on the team those one team who want to
work extra who feel they can they can do
it otherwise you couldn't you see and
sure we agreed and we moved on I'm still
I even though I've read my meaning i I
didn't really agree I can understand why
are we working like this chart deadline
we didn't have value I assumed it not
value
time went and we made it we actually
made it
like yay the Prophet was happy people
around me are happy this was me I wasn't
really happy I was like I was tired
really tired see even though we agreed
agreed not to not to work if you don't
feel we could as a team lead three year
people around me are working weekends
weekdays evenings I can't go home and
just watch them work overtime so that's
my feeling
at the time and I then I started putting
hours I didn't talk my wife about this I
just did it and we have two kids she was
pregnant with a third and this kind of
pull from both ends
after we celebrated this this this win I
went on vacation I didn't come back for
six months so burn out and it's through
this experience of being at the lowest
point where I I didn't know what to do
I I couldn't deal with technology I
didn't dare I can walk um use my phone I
could use my watch like what is this
where am i this is what my colleague was
asking about earlier how did you get out
of that now this talk it really isn't
about and burn up itself there are many
things run burn out that it is a very
defining moment in my life but he has
how do you get out of that how the end
up with empathy it was by chance that
same colleague had had lent me a book
way many years ago four months ago can't
remember
he lent me a book which was
sorry Janka book which which I suddenly
picked up because I didn't have anything
else to do which looked a lot like this
as we're called nonviolent communication
by Marshall B Rosenberg and now I was
reading this and I'm like well what is
this well why I'd read this I tried
skimming before I couldn't make any
sense of it but now I was more present
now I was more aware at time and this
made a huge impact on me but as I was
reading them reading through his book it
can gives you a process to how to
approach any kind of conversation any
person in a very very straightforward
way which matches the definition of
empathy where you where you okay I can't
remember the definition right now but
the point is that in the beginning the
book is all about understanding others
it's all about community communicating
with others and all about getting to
what their needs are any any form of
communication especially violent which
is negative is basically an unmet need I
read all this I was thinking wow this is
cool I'm going to use this and use this
and go use this and then I came to the
last two chapters which is about self
empathy and then struck me this is what
I needed I need to I needed to spend
time checking my own feelings and
understanding where I am because in the
example where I where I started working
overtime because the other working
overtime I had broken my own boundaries
and I didn't even know it I hadn't spent
any time defining what my boundaries are
understanding where my limits are what
was okay and what was not okay which led
me to thinking about myself
it's a very egotistical but you have to
come start with ourselves so this led me
to something my wife talked about a lot
which was mindfulness and with
mindfulness I found a way to calm the
chaos see I was on the phone the entire
time you know before I'm just checking
Twitter checking social media I think
many of us recognize that you know that
that thumb right and this became an
opportunity to need to actually zone out
and actually come more not sooner but
actually come in tune with my feelings
and then understand that there are a lot
of thoughts going on in my mind even
though I think I'm completely present
another another thing I started doing
was journaling now this was hard for me
because I I wasn't used to writing
things down he's in a while since
actually wrote this in the paper he was
weird
but so it was like you know the dear
diary to everything I like I know what
to say like hi how are you I'm fine no
but after after trying this review days
I'm just kind of felt that well I can
actually write things here I can
actually empty myself it was kind of it
was really cathartic really like really
good to jump to everything and and that
these two things mindfulness and
journaling have many huge impact on my
well-being and understanding
bit by bit where my boundaries are it's
an ongoing thing but to me it's been
huge and we do this in social
development as well because I mean we do
have in our processes like we have
retrospective we're meant to sit down be
honest Purcell
writing down same thing there which
moves me to the next thing which kind of
helped me out of this difficult
situation and again enforcing quite
empathy is important this is something
which I got from from nonviolent
communication where Marshall the
Rosenberg just says don't just do
something listen whereas we usually
think that it officers wait don't just
stand there do something I really that
in the heat of time before I was
overwhelmed with emotions and everything
and really false expectations I was
feeling as I was treated unfairly for
some reason I felt that I wasn't
important
I'm but most importantly I felt that my
voice didn't matter
I felt unheard I was approached by
someone in the company on the human
resource side who reached out to me and
started a conversation he said he wanted
to help and he said he wanted my help to
get this going
he'd been through similar issues as a
similar experience himself and he said
that for him it was important if I came
back to the company or not he didn't
care all he cared about is if I was I
will to get up but I was able to get up
on my feet that made a difference
because what I experienced then is that
someone reached out to me and then for
the first time in a long time I felt
someone listened I felt heard
and he was using well he showed
everything to me the same way I was also
contact another professional actually
and they did the same thing
he listened they both listened and that
was an extremely healing experience and
this kind of opening the opening to the
power of what empathy actually is now
none of them actually told me what to do
Naaman said okay you should be at work
around two months or three months or
whatever they listened I figured out the
answers myself they guided me but I
figured enough myself
so listening is a huge huge part of
empathy we're always focused on what we
want to say in the conversation rollers
folks in our points and our experiences
so I suggest instead try to listen
listen intently to what someone is
saying look them in the face
turn off your devices listen and not
only listen try to understand what
they're saying and where they're coming
from and if you can go one step further
trying to understand the emotions but
you can't do this properly you cannot do
this properly if you have your own noise
going on in your mind you can't do this
if you have your your narrative going on
you're thinking about okay I see you're
struggling I would do that I like that
you could do that it's really hard to
actually listen to what they're trying
to tell you they might be saying we
can't look my example we can't work
overtime probably the thing I don't want
to lose time with my family my children
my wife needs me that's what I was
trying to say fighting out the words
it says that empathy is a key to
understanding and what do we do as
software developers day in and day out
we try to understand user requirements
we tried to understand code we try to
understand other people it's it's a
complementary skill as my my my taking
it so laughs kind of learning from this
from this period it was protected
because another thing I was doing in
this in this time before I really
crashed was I was blaming the project
house draining management there's
arrogant you know what people say a life
didn't I was really really I felt that
their distance between us so now when I
when I came back to work this around six
months later I walked past our CEO I
stopped and asked him do you have five
minutes well okay I and he said a pretty
meeting a calendar I'll do okay I did
that for the meeting two days later and
it was for 10-15 minutes I think and we
sat there for one and a half hours first
he listened to me and then I listened to
him then I kind of put a face to angry
management isn't angry management it's a
person he is also person who's
struggling to with his things he has in
his ambitions his needs his desires for
the company for himself what happened
was I gained a completely different
perspective
whereas three four months ago or three
four months previous I was contemplating
becoming a farmer now I decided to
actually stay the company so it makes a
lot of sense to to gain perspective to
try to see where another person is
coming from understand who they are but
its face because they face there so how
would this work as a developer so on a
day-to-day basis we work in a team we
work for the tester or help the testers
we pair programming we pay program we
test and work together but they're still
kinda distictive lying between dev and
QA and we we do preferring within team
of what we could do is and do pair
testing because our devs are saying
we're not good at my experience that I
was there
we're not good at testing we are
developers we're not good at testing as
I really are aren't we good at testing
comple test now there are obviously
different levels of testing and what I
had it was actually I did this I jumped
with my our QA I started pair testing
and it was a it was a huge experience I
saw each JIRA task with the how to test
filled empty I saw how it was the pick
up a task which said implement sequel I
saw how it was to try to test the task
without even touching the code because I
always jump in the code for the branch
check out things I didn't do that I did
what he did and I felt his pain and he
also start doing pair programming and he
helps with writing tests he helped I
understand requirements I'm actually
setting up the task for end
and back back to our dam users we we
tried actually sitting down with our
customer customer support and answering
phone calls emails and just being
helpful there we gained a completely new
perspective into how our customers use
the product and now it affected us and
also again about getting perspective
putting a face and when a gun then comes
to personal context irritations you know
every day say things dis coat this
framework versus that framework that's
typically a sign that you don't
understand where the person is coming
from angularjs why anger versus react
why do you go one way not the other
because on one side you're saying the
same things but I mean the same
arguments on each side how can you and
then end up with different frameworks
you have to understand where the person
being why the experiences and that's the
only way to gain that understanding hope
times going fast year to me it's been a
really really long journey to come to
this point
well time wise to only be in a year and
a half to but it's been really really
struggle for me I've gone through many
painful experiences and everyone's
journey is unique
what I have the have learned though is
that empathy has served as a guiding
principle when I was in pain and think
about think about how will work if we
can do this when you're not in pain but
actually just struggling a little bit so
I use empathy whenever I can I try to go
deeper I try to talk to people I try to
understand where they come from
be there be present mindfulness
journaling they all help but is empathy
something to learn can actually learn
this I mean people are argh and don't
agree that about this but I'm very sure
you can I feel that I've also gone
through this empathise are skilled you
need to actively practice giving and
receiving answer to like any other you
need to practice it and you need to keep
on practicing it and again do so by
looking at yourself first begin with you
understand what where your boundaries
are where how you tend to react and
don't filter when you money do
journaling don't filter we're all out
there listen intently and gain
perspective this is one thing we are
tend to be really bad at doing when you
disagree so much of someone that you
can't see where the common ground is
that's especially we need to try to
reach out and gain that perspective
because they weren't born angular
developers don't born react developers
it'll happen over time through
experiences but empathy is hard we call
them soft skills but these are the hard
skills this is what we should be selling
spending most of our time on now to be
able to even show empathy we need to be
need to allow ourselves to be vulnerable
in this this graph from which I drew
this is based on something been around
said where when we don't when we don't
allow ourselves to be vulnerable we end
up with a culture or relationships to
look shame shame and blame when they
allow us that we've all know we can have
empathy
now empathy is no guarantee that
everything will be fine
empathy does guarantee that we see each
other it connects with each other and
are allowed to progress from there it's
something Seth Godin said empathy is the
hard part the rest of mechanics we're
not wired to walk in someone else's
shoes it's not a first instinct showing
up with empathy is difficult it's hard
to outsource and it will wear you out
but it's precisely what we need from you
this has been my experience and I can
I remember story from in that very very
rough time where my daughter she
couldn't something was wrong with her
shoe
I don't know what it was she said it
scratched it itched and now I was late
to work
I've been up till 10 day before her and
got up around 4:00 or 5:00 with a
newborn or I mix up that this is on the
way out the door the brussels gonna
leave in five minutes and I was dressed
now
I raised my voice and basically shouted
out there let's get out we have to go
she listened picked her up put in the
car go to school I don't know
this was very very difficult experience
maybe to go through how difficult was it
for her to experience this let me take
the time to be be vulnerable and connect
with empathy things like this don't
happen so empty is a choice like an
example of the junior developer who got
fired to make a simple human mistake and
my own experience of being shown empathy
it's a choice and the volatile choice
you open yourself up to connect with
someone or a deeper level P they do so
without judgment whatever my or daughter
was going through that day was not more
important Tori was a lot more important
than me being at work at eight zero zero
I believe you can all take small steps
to make the world a better place to each
other our family our friends colleagues
but all you need to do is have the
courage to begin with yourself and again
fifty a guiding principle for you
Thank You SL after
they don't have any questions any
thoughts any reflections I want to share
give it to me over then you'll note here
any observations any experiences yes hi
sorry thank you thank you I I try I try
to do that for myself and oh please well
this thank you I don't know anything to
share all right thank you so much okay
