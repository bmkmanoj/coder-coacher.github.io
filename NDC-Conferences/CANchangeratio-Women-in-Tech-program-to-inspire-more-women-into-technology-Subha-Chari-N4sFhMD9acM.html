this is awesome you have food all day in
this conference I've never seen any
conference that gives you food all the
time so so this is awesome I just want
to thank NDC at the outset to give for
giving me an opportunity to talk about a
topic today that I'm very passionate
about 1.4 million jobs will be created
by 2020 in computer in computer science
can someone guess how many jobs are
predicted to be filled half four hundred
thousand that's all that songs been
predicted to be filled by the time 2020
is not far away this is actually a US
labor statistics but we're not far
behind as well so my name is sue Bukhari
and I'm an X developer I'm working in
currently in digital strategy with
Commonwealth Bank my talk today is about
women in tech and I want you to take
away two things from my talk today talk
to women and girls in your life about
why they should consider a technology or
a computing career it could be your
girlfriends your cousin's your nieces
your aunt's anyone ensure that your
organization employs inclusive practices
that will retain women who choose a tech
area sometimes minority women don't
voice their ideas or they shy away from
it just encourage them to actually you
know do a bit more about it clearly more
than IT industry is dominated by men but
it hasn't always been this way so a
little bit of a trivia anyone in the
audience know or remember a name called
Ada Lovelace awesome brilliant Albert
Einstein everyone
Steve Jobs everyone Grace Hopper nice
okay sir ADA was the Countess of
Lovelace who found the first algorithm
back in 1843 which is the basis for a
computer programs today Grace Hopper was
an admiral
she actually led a lot of programs that
led to development of the COBOL
programming language back in 1940 50s
somewhere there until the 60s computer
programming was considered a clerical
job so it was more for girls software
most was more considered more clerical
while Hardware was more for men then it
was realized that as you can see up here
it was realized that it was not only
challenging but it was lucrative as well
so there was a lot of push then to get
men onto becoming software programmers
as well according to researchers that is
when the decline actually began so today
we are on a mission to change this ratio
and bring diversity into tech industry
now why do we need gender diverse teams
again a trivia anyone yeah absolutely so
gender balance company perform better
financially it's it's said to have been
performed better financially demonstrate
superior team dynamics and productivity
we all work in product development and
at the moment its global it's it's
everywhere so having a gender diverse
team actually brings that holistic
approach to product development and they
there's plenty of examples where you've
seen comparisons between gender diverse
teams with as opposed to monolithic
teams and you know how they performed
and how they had to you know go back and
redo a lot of their products as well so
a lot of benefits that that's been seen
with gender balance companies
trying to play the video No so that
video when it played and if it played
was actually done by Microsoft when they
did a lot of promotion for girls in stem
these were primary school girls talking
about how they loved science how they
did a lot of coding themselves and what
all they did with the according there
was a lot of passion when they actually
talk about that so when I get to play it
you will see maybe later what happens is
at that age there's like 70% of girls
they love science they love technology
they want to do something with
technology but as they grow the number
actually drops down to 20% so 2 out of
10 people actually then go into choosing
a career in university at a career in
university or or a work force so that
was what that that video was going to
actually play so we'll try and come back
to it at some point in time I actually
come from India
I did all my computer education there I
did my schooling my university and I
actually worked there as well back then
it was 50% I assume it's still 50% it
hasn't dropped as far as I know but the
numbers here have actually dropped down
to 20% so you know that's a drastic drop
and and trying to find out why the drop
is I've got two daughters myself who've
grown up here and I'm trying to find out
why that drop was there was a lot of
reasons that you could associate with
this so there's generally a stigma
attached to technology which suggested
that it's a boys thing so all your ads
and your commercials that shows girls
playing with dolls while you had boys
playing games and they had all the cool
you know gadgets that they could play
with so that that's one of the reasons
that they predict that it's you know
girls get a stigma that it's a boys
thing there's a lack of encouragement
and inspiration as well provided by both
the parent communities and the teacher
in in both schools and universities so
when I approached schools for my for my
program they had to send out a
permission nor to the parents telling
them about the program this is a coding
program right so send the permission
note to the parents asking for asking
for the permission some of the parents
actually said now I t's not for my
daughter I'm not even going to send them
to the course even though the course was
free so there's there's there's not that
encouragement by parents and teachers so
that has to improve as well the
experience that I wanted to provide the
girls basically was give them a taste of
technology by actually doing some
hands-on coding and encouraged them via
that when I was researching I went and
did some surveys with the schools and
the girls about 80 90 percent of the
girls that I surveyed said they wanted
to learn technology they love science
they want to do stuff but then they said
oh I can't take that course anymore
because we don't have enough girls to
join that subject and that course is not
available for us to choose so this was
the driver for the initiative called can
change ratio which have been
spearheading for the past 18 months with
CBA now if I was able to show you the
video it actually said seven out of ten
girls in in primary school or when they
were young were interested in technology
and then it declined down to 20% or so
we knew we had to actually get the girls
early and then build a pipeline so this
is the pipeline going from high school
into universities and then into
workforce so at every stage you know
encourage them give them what's needed
for them to keep moving in that
direction
and we knew that everybody wanted to
know technology so the best possible way
was to actually give them hands-on
coding exercises so a curriculum was
basically device a very simple one
because we didn't have too much time for
them to you know to go and do this
outside of the school curriculum a
curriculum was devised each school took
it differently some did it as a boot
camp some took it over ten weeks over a
term
some did it over to terms so we were
flexible because we actually wanted them
to do this have some focus and do this
so we actually got reflexed the timeline
and the curriculum based on what they
want you to do overall about 40 hours of
coding is what we thought was needed for
them to stand up a website that they
could use for their school later on so
it's a it's a website that's a living
website it can stay in the school you
know maintain an update within the
school which means the next set of next
cohort of girls were actually going to
do some coding as well with that the
teachers were actually trained in coding
so even if the girls graduated out of
schools the teachers could then you know
continue to maintain that that momentum
in technology once they did a fair bit
of coding or even right at the end we
then said they now need to understand
what is it in real life so we actually
partnered with some of the tech
companies like a B&amp;amp;B Amazon Google all
those companies and we said look we want
to bring our students to visit your
company we want them to see how your
engineers work so these companies were
really awesome they actually went over
and above and they showed the girls or
rather did a tour of the floors to the
girls so they could see how cool it is
and what's the impact of technology that
they were having with that they actually
then Skyped a lot of their engineers and
their VPS and everybody from us because
a lot of these companies have the
engineering back in the US or and
Singapore or somewhere else so they
actually Skyped them in and these girls
actually talked about their journey
which actually inspired the girls as
well and then they visited CBS all this
sort of finale a CBA so they came to
visit CBA we took them on a tour on our
digital floor so I work in digital so we
took did a tour of the digital flows we
didn't know a lot of Design Thinking
workshops with them for the day and
finally they actually graduated as with
any school a certificate and and and
they were so proud they were they were
so happy to actually receive that
certificate so the result we had our
first cohort graduate on 29
July 2016 from banks town girls high
school here's a picture of the
graduation ceremony more so I would like
you to focus on this where this girl
they actually presented their code and
their website and everything and you can
actually see these girls so proud of
having done coding so they're so happy
and they wanted to showcase it they
wanted to show everybody what they've
done and I believe they've actually
continued doing this in their school as
well whenever they've got an opportunity
they actually gone in did this perfectly
school as well so the pilot was
successful but we knew we had to do a
lot of tweaks to that because I'm not
experienced in doing such a program with
schools or neighbor is the schools so it
was a lot of learnings that we had to
take from it we did pre surveys we did
post service just to see you know how
they felt what they felt it was very
funny because I used to go to the school
for the pilot when the pilot program was
happening because I wanted to make sure
that everything was going okay and you
know all of that things roundabout for
the first class they were so excited
they were they're all you know all up
and trying to do stuff when I possibly
visited them in the fourth or the fifth
class I could see they were also down
and they didn't know what they were
doing and you know they threw up their
hands to say oh I don't know what I'm
doing and then around the seventh class
when I went back they actually you know
said oh we've got this website working
now so they persevered they went through
it and the teachers and the and the
teachers from the school and our
trainers was so supportive so they could
get them through that and they said oh
we've got that now so we had a lot of
tweaks that we did and then we went we
went with the rollout we had ten schools
actually come by and visit us on the
30th of June this year so one year later
overall we've done about 22 schools with
this program five hundred students have
graduated about 40 plus teachers have
actually also done hands-on coding with
this program
that's we are a picture of the website
that the girls are showing so you know I
just had some pictures that I could show
some of the quotes we received where we
never thought Tech was so cool and one
of the students actually the one was
presenting before either this one or the
one before she said she wanted to take
Physiology in University she was a year
10 student you want to take physiology
after doing this course she said oh now
I might combine IT with that and see you
know how I can do text up with
physiology as well so that's actually
the outcome we wanted to achieve and it
was it was like a really emotional
movement as well to see for those who
are parents and have kids when you see
your kid go up and get a certificate you
know you get that emotional feeling
that's how it was basically I've got two
daughters so this is a personal passion
for me as well so I hope this initiative
has inspired you to also help increase
the ratio of women in technology and
going back to the two key points that I
mentioned that I would like you to take
away from today's talk talk to the women
and girls in your life about why they
should consider a technology or or
computing career ensure that your
organization employs inclusive practice
that will retain women who choose the
tech area thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
