9 o'clock thank you so much for coming
in to see me so early today I am just
really really excited about where dotnet
is going and I'm doing this talk and
follow it up with another talk and the
other talk will be about the big-picture
stuff
this talk is about c-sharp 7 straight
going into what you're going to see in
Visual Studio I will cover some Visual
Studio things and c-sharp 7 itself so
just to check how many of you use Visual
Studio code instead of Visual Studio
everyday as your primary editor how many
of those books okay a few things I'm
going to show you that will be boring
but the rest of it is most of you are
using at least some Visual Studio so how
many of you are on Visual Studio 2015
right now it looks like almost everybody
kind of on both kind of trying to get it
yeah so that's great normally in a talk
like this it is people that think
they're going to move forward relatively
quickly and so one of the things I'll
just do a sneak peek from the other talk
is that the announcement is we should
see Visual Studio 2017 for release this
spring and whether that means between
now and March or March and June I can't
say for sure but it is looking fairly
solid there are public RCS so everything
you see today is in a public RC and you
can go home download the stuff and do
everything you'll see me do today okay
now if you took an early picture of this
slide my email was wrong so you know one
take a different picture if you earlier
took a picture but that's a really
horrible plane slide and you can see
I've put not much time into branding the
stack because I have no intention of
showing you any more slides in this I
have some in case it all goes really bad
so I have to tell you this I just think
it's so awesome that the team did this
yesterday in
I guess maybe I shouldn't say this but
yesterday the public RC got a huge
hiccup for like everybody I knew and I
could not run Visual Studio 2017 this
was madly creating a PowerPoint deck for
you and B it got reported to the team
about 10 o'clock in the morning it was
fixed before 5 o'clock and I'd like you
to do the math as to what time that is
in Seattle
not only did they fix it in seven hours
they fixed it in seven hours in the
middle of the night so totally total
hats off to the team for the fact that I
can show you what I'm going to show you
today so yeah so we're gonna make that
pretty right there
oops no that's not pretty just so you
just so you know when you mess up your
your formatting you'll never forget this
again it's my initials control KD so I
go down in the fame for being able to
format your code so I will just do that
okay so everybody can see the font okay
they're very happy we're good ready to
go alright let's get rid of this oh I'm
just I'm pin that okay so this is a this
is a demo that I put together explicitly
to show obviously the 2017 features but
it's a variation of one that I did for
2015 and who knows maybe I'll bury it
again for the next version but it's sort
of like a like half way to being a real
project but not too close I just don't
want you to get too comfortable but
there is a folder from my domain stuff
and I kind of want to start by going in
and opening this file and showing you
just a this part of the little dummy app
what it is so there's a public class per
person then I have a student that
derives some person okay and then if I
come down here further
I've got staff derives from person and
also adds a staff role and then I have
an instructor and finally I have a Flags
enum for what the role is so you can
sort of with me in the general gist of
this so the first thing I want to talk
about is this right here
now I know that some of you are gonna
look at this and you go oh yes I could
go on forever because I asked sometimes
hey who can do this and somebody in the
room will be able to go like
astoundingly high with the 2 4 8 16 32
64 64 250 yeah somebody can go really
high with that it's not me so I really
like in the future which is the binary
literals so now I can say Obi I think I
have to go to this space all right yeah
there we go and then so this one would
be Obi one oh right you're with me here
and then we've got 0 B 0 1 0 0 I do a
couple more of these and 0 B 1 0 0 0 and
then I can just keep adding zeros right
and so you've got the general gist of
this and oh I forgot how many this was
so let's just put a bunch of them just
to get the idea and then on this one and
I'm not sure these are exactly the
numbers said and that one just had a 1
at the end ok so one of the things that
we can do here let's fix that little
squiggle okay one of the things we can
do here it's really easy to see that
I've messed up on that race car and
driver thing right the race cards are
everything because there's a one at the
end and that's not what I intend for a
flag Zeno if you don't want Flags
needing them is it's kind of what just
looked at it it sets the bits and you
can combine them and somebody could here
be an instructor and a student without a
problem or an instructor I'm sorry in a
department chair without a problem
so you with me on that you like that you
think it's more readable where's your
hand think is more readable I like it
better than the other one because I
don't have to remember I'm not quite
sold during the readability yet but you
might get there ok so the next thing I
want to do is how many of you like the
fact I put everything in one file raise
your hand if you like to fact if at all
my classes in one file you don't you
want me to fix it
ok so we'll do a little cut and paste
here just take it you know 20 minutes or
something so we'll just go
first of the control mo I'm going to
collapse everything so I've got things a
little bit more tightened up I've got
person well this is a person class we'll
leave that I'll come in here I'm going
to hit control period and I'm going to
say move to students don't see us I'm
gonna say control period enter do that
again control period enter and yeah we
go ahead and do this and I think this
one or to control period inter whoa dude
where did I just do
did you get that did you see that oh my
gosh you guys are not excited it's too
early in the morning oh my gosh look how
about we do that take you could have
done it faster right three or four
seconds I cleaned all that out and what
that allows you to do it's actually not
the fact that you just like did it
because I know if you go home but unless
you're going like yeah I don't have any
files I have a bunch of classes in it
but when you're sitting down and you're
doing your initial development and
you're kind of just playing around and
trying to figure out things you're going
to look like and you're doing some stuff
you can put it all in one file now cuz
cleaning it up takes absolutely no time
so that's where this is going to help
you not so much that right now you've
got these files you need to clean up but
it gives you the flexibility to do it
now why are you something else here I
want to take let's go ahead and we're
gonna make a let's just turn a staff
into a race car driver so what I'm gonna
do is I mean a ctrl-c ctrl-v you guys
have done this all the time right
now let's come up here and let's say
gosh I got to rename this puppy and
let's make sure I hope my mouth right on
this one this is a little bit finicky
but I changed the name to racecar driver
and I hit enter
bye goes RN and I go in here and what do
I see
annoying all right so there is a
scenario unfortunately this did not work
out these are driver okay so in some
situations I did not hold my mouse just
right it will actually change that name
for you but cash you know you this
happens right you wind up with the class
name doesn't match the internal name so
the first thing I'm going to do is just
to be sure this is differentiated from
the
1 I'm gonna just add a 2 there so now
I've got a class of staff to you in a
file of race car driver boy that makes
no sense at all let's see what happens
if I come up here and hit control period
ok rename file to staff 2 or rename
racecar driver
rename staff to 2 race car driver are
you excited
all those places did you go before it
was just like gonna rename I thought oh
this give me a pain if I do it just
right or whichever helps me I can get it
but right now all I have to do is say
yeah that was a race car driver dude and
it's done ok and that is a full rename
so if anybody else is talking to it it's
going to get fixed too so I wanted to
show you a couple like cool tricks in
Visual Studio because I think the things
I just showed you
display the real theme of Visual Studio
2017 and c-sharp 7 which is your life
just gets easier with a whole bunch of
little tweaks here and there that's what
I think it's all about now you're gonna
hear about some bigger ideas like
pattern matching and I will show you
pattern matching but for right now today
why does pattern matching matter because
it's gonna make your life easier it's
what today is all about these make your
life easy that sound good you like that
I love it ok fantastic ok now one of the
things I've done today is that I
actually have open my notes ok you can
say hmm introduce binary literals we did
that we didn't do expression body
members in more places we'll go do that
but it's for two reasons one I don't
want to forget stuff and 2 if you like
I'll be happy to give you my notes and
that'll be a fast way that you can come
back and say every time I read the
release notes my head hurts
and just say here's just a quick bullet
point list of the things I covered I
tried to include the right names so you
can then google to find out more about
what you care about does that sound good
all right ok so what I want to show you
now I'm going to come up to the quick
launch you guys you know about quick
launch and you you make a guess as to
what you want to look at and I think I
want to see some stuff about style right
now it's a quick way to show you a
couple of features how
get two new gun style text editor codes
I don't know how I got two new get this
is where I actually want to be and I'm
gonna go here to general I hope that
other dialogues just a little funky but
I will show you what's going on there so
this is a imperfect dialogue because I
cannot move this bar okay but we'll live
with it there's an expanded set of style
issues style things you can fix and some
of these are really cool let's get past
the code block because what I care about
is some stuff down here so we have
expression body members I'm sorry this
is the it's not where I want to be wait
I'm in the right place it's cool style
format sorry no wait I mean the right
version I am in the right version okay
hang on it's here I just need to find it
real quick
I had already I think scrolled down too
far yep here we go okay so you can
define your preferences for this so if
you like to see code that has come on
you do this prefer this that always has
this in the front you can do that and
now you won't get requested to make that
change and how many of you use resharper
i've not used this with resharper i
can't tell you how much this in new
sharp are gonna get along I would
certainly hope that JetBrains comes in
here and takes advantage of these
definitions they are done in a very
generalized way so how many of you hate
the VAR character and never want it used
in your code at all anybody and once
when I have two or three people like
never want to see it okay well that's
okay you won't be nearly as excited
about this that's okay though so here
we've got four come on come on you can
do this for VAR you can say that for
built-in types yes I want to use them no
I don't so I can say explicit type and
then I believe that that there's a
feature here about being able to use the
system in 32 instead of int okay I
believe that that is for Jeff Richter
and no one else but do any of you like
to do that
in 32 instead event nobody okay there's
a couple people on the planet they push
hard for it so we've got that but the
other thing I really want to show is
expression body members okay we got
these in C shops six that's when you
have your getter and you can just say
you know public string first name equal
angle bracket and you can give the
result we've been able to do that with
properties this is what I'm talking
about in the first one that's the the
basic approach of being able to just
return the value we've been able to do
that on methods that is actually
preferable block body let's change that
to expression body now we can do this
for constructors and I just wanted to
use it because they're super quick way
to show you that we can now do
expression body members for constructors
we don't care too much about operators
right and also this is the really
exciting one we can do it for setters is
that cool so cool you like that okay so
now we've got a way that we can expand
our usage that of the justice simple
expression body members you do have to
put the surrounding property if you're
in it for if you're gonna use a set on a
get or if you're doing the get or you
can just next to age just say yeah
here's the return value okay so I got
that one let's see make sure I didn't
miss anything else there okay we did the
extracting the class we sync the class
names we've got that okay so let's go
back here for a second it's back here
let's get rid of this we're done we're
not going to save anything Karen again
now there are some purple lines there
can you see them they're vertical purple
lines of dots can you see them when you
first open visual studio 2017 you may
not be able to and that's because by
default they are light gray I thought
that with the projector it was a
complete toss-up whether they would be
visible in any way whatsoever so I
changed them to magenta and you may want
to do that because you may want these to
be a little bit brighter and in the
notes these are called structure
adornments I have no idea why you would
for that so it's in my notes you can
find it it is in fonts and colors to
change that what do you think do you
like those
that's that pits down just make them
white on white or something if you
really hate them you can actually turn
them off okay just say adornments and
you can find them and turn them off
what's I actually right now think okay
okay but imagine a long file and imagine
you're trying to keep a long file
straight now you're going yeah okay
really long file that might be super
useful okay now comes the really
punchline imagine that in a really long
file so you know what you're looking on
wait a minute namespace oh yeah so it's
probably class so you've got both layers
so as you come in here you get the third
layer as well so not only do you see
what you're currently wrapping but you
see what it's inside of and it's inside
of so you got that so you can see the
structure of your app right there i Aqsa
this is an older feature I don't know
that everybody's actually really in tune
with it
but the scroll bar options over here I
want to use the map mode medium I'll be
fine do you guys do this in a big file
this is really really super valuable
especially because that big blue bar
tells you where you are in your big file
and then you've also got any errors and
it home line look like a Christmas tree
because there's so much stuff in there
right you you over there and you've got
all this little all those dots means
something and you can figure that out
okay so we've got that one am i doing on
time
oh great okay so the great thing is is
that the visual studio features show
really fast so I get the I mean the the
C sharp features okay so let's do a
quick intellisense and then I'll get
back to some code you guys have gone a
long time with that code so let's let's
go over to the program file and then
I'll go from there to start and explain
what this program actually does okay I'm
going to do ctrl J that's how you bring
up intellisense okay now I'm gonna make
that a little bigger come on Scott in
there okay what on earth have you guys
seen this yet that thing across the
bottom you seen it
you guys have already seen it no you
just confused by it I can't blame you
that's a lot of icons okay
what that's giving us is a way to filter
intellisense and each one has a
keystroke so you'll be able to also do
that so you can see this is alternate
kay to get to key words now you're gonna
have to see if I can make this work okay
no suggestions for key words no key
words fit here here's some namespaces
come on your name sister you do this no
suggestions for namespaces do you expect
I picked a crappy place apparently okay
let's just pick another spot let's go
here control J this whole focusing end
thing is a little tough I'm gonna can
you guys see that well enough right
there it's not gonna work okay great
okay so now key words there's any key
words here it's just string and
namespaces no namespaces oops that we
see everything now we see any namespaces
it's not working there we go now we see
whatever that is so you got that idea
right don't have to keep trying to make
this work because it's really
misbehaving on me I think that I should
have made a better choice of this and
see if maybe now I can get a little bit
more interesting stuff yep here we have
some types here we have some matches
here we have some why am I getting not
getting methods here I have no idea okay
but you get the idea I don't quite know
why it's not behaving right now but you
get the general idea right okay cool
those great big huge long lists and all
the stuff that you normally do right now
to make them work typing the first
couple of characters typing the first
couple of characters of each word typing
the first letter of each word all of
that fuzzy stuff all that still works
but we also get the ability to filter
Kenny let's make it normal again you
guys can only see that code right in the
back you good
I see the nodding head so I always see
the nodding heads of the people that
Canada people that go yeah I know I
didn't know I need glasses or look
whiter let me know if you want any
bigger okay so I needed to create an
application that made it
obviously to demonstrate what I want to
show and specifically what I want to
show here something about pattern
matching versus inheritance because if
you go out on the web and you look for
examples of pattern matching in c-sharp
7 you are going to see code and say I
would never do it that way and the prime
example is to give a bunch of shapes and
then calculate using pattern matching
the area of each shape okay if I want an
area for each shape that I own I'm going
to make area a property of the shape
because every shape in the world has an
area a line has an area of zero so I
wouldn't do it that way and so I wanted
to create an application that really
honed in on the notion that pattern
matching is different than inheritance
okay so if you've got something like the
area of a shape which is inherently part
of that class of that object it just
owns it put it in there like you've
always done don't make any changes okay
but here the example that I've come up
with is work have a pretend University
and you already saw some of the classes
it's got students it's got instructors
it's got department chairs it's got
things like that and the notion is that
we want to send everyone a message at
the end of one particular semester that
gives them some sort of a nice message
about what they did and what was going
on and we want to make it kind of
specific to who they are we don't want
to send instructors the same message
that we want to send students and we
don't want to send students the same
message we would have sent them last
semester so you with me on this it we're
going to depend on our person hierarchy
but we're going to do something to it
that is not just a part of it it's
something that relies on it but it's a
different set of things so you're with
me on all of that okay so that's why
it's kind of a goofy application and
we've got things like getting thank-you
messages that's the the key thing we're
doing so to get here we're going to
look at how we're seating the data okay
so let's come over here come on you can
do this no you can't apparently I don't
know why that keystroke combination just
didn't work okay so here what we've got
is the data that we're starting with and
you can see that I've got a few people
there we've got me in my two sons I put
this up once and one of my son's was in
the room and hide his brother's name up
there I said Ben he's the smart he's my
he's really smart so he has a four hour
average and my other son was going you
know you said that with me in the room
right so they're both up there they're
both worse Martin okay so we've got all
that and somebody real quick tell me how
much a Sebastian Vuitton makes from that
you're kind of slow you haven't worked
it out yet what it's not o'clock in the
morning okay how many of you have to
look at 9:00 o'clock it could at nine
o'clock in the morning how many of you
might have to read code at nine o'clock
in the morning okay so this is really
hard
I don't like hard things that's wine
okay I have insert on I'm going to fix
that and so they would go and I'm going
to come over here and I'm gonna do that
and I'm going to again I've made a
mistake here and let's do that and
actually the Israel he does not actually
make 334 million dollars so I can find
out now first of all that I did make a
mistake and there was an American
footballer that I did have in there but
I thought you would have no idea who
else well there was so anybody who else
well there is no thang any I'm from
Denver we're bitter
we're very better than he went to
Houston and he's in the playoffs and
we're not show we're very bitter okay so
now you can read a 33 million dollars
right and did you notice I never got a
squiggle when I had all these things
wrong okay there are places in the world
that it's not every three characters
there's places in the world that it's
four and two and six and eight it
doesn't matter you can put these
anywhere in fact not only can you put
them anywhere you can put as many as you
want okay you can do stupid things as
well as smart things stick these in
there in a way that make you and your
team happen not good okay so we just do
a control see you there okay good
like that so now look at that I go wait
a minute you know what that reminds me
of something those binaries really
weren't that easy to read let's go back
to this now it's in the staff roles
because remember I moved things so let's
go over to staff roles and let's come
down to these guys and they're pretty
easy to their but now they start being a
little hard so now let's come over by
every four because that's the logical
unit for a binary and let's start
sticking these guys in here oh they get
that count right nope okay so now how
much easier is that to read okay way way
easier to read way way easier to compare
two values and see if they're off by one
zero right so I love the combination of
these two and I love them independently
but I really love putting these two
features together okay
good really likes this happy you happy
do you like c-sharp seven so far I
haven't even shown you pattern matching
or tuples okay
so this is awesome okay let's come back
to the TV program with our loss program
I must have not double clicked it every
once in awhile that features annoying
and sometimes I really like it okay so
what we want to do now is to find out a
little bit more about this whole get
thank you messages thing so I'm going to
come here and just bounce over there and
here is a rather bizarre code I
apologize for a little bit of
bizarreness in this to make a couple of
points but what I want to do is I want
to return I'm gonna pass an item of all
persons which we just made in the seat
count and I want to return as bunch of
strings which is the specific message
for each person and I want to return how
many people are under staff and I just
want to go through this group once and
get both those values honestly I'd
probably just use a link count to get
the staff count with a where clause but
it doesn't make a good demo so I'm going
to do it this way
okay so create a list of messages great
I'm going to work from there we've got
the staff count starts at zero good
place to start it we loop through and we
get each message okay let's take a look
at what that looks like
let's get rid of these two lines we
don't need to us okay person is student
student equals no how many of you have
written that code before if something as
something else
I'm sorry VAR something var the variable
name equals some other variable as
something next line if that new variable
is not equal to no anybody ever written
that code before how much do you like
that code you really want to write it
forever
it is such stupid code okay so what if
instead we could write code that looked
if and I've just blanked on this syntax
so I might get it wrong the first time
should be right let's see if we got that
right
we did not get that right person is
student I actually have this down here
cheated just in case I'd like because
some of the syntax is not at my
fingertips nor we really have it ready
to do you guys know this trick you can
hide any code you want to with control
mhm
I randomly hid some code here and
unfortunately the problem I'm having is
that there we go
that is correct why did I not get that
oh it's just ah my syntax was correct I
just have you reused a variable name
that's going that syntax looks right it
was right okay what do you think come on
guys it's 9:00 in the morning get a
little excited man okay look at that
that is is that better you can oh gosh
that's so much better
oh it's fantastic and we can go ahead
and we can also this is a normal totally
totally normal
piece of code so I can just do this as
well it doesn't have to just be that
part it's just a part of it it's
conditional so now I can get rid of this
I didn't think I get rid of should have
to get rid of one more here somewhere
yeah right here I should get rid of this
one and then let's see okay if you like
I can do this
you like that great you like it oh cool
all right so I'm gonna real quick do
these others okay because it won't take
that long
so I'll just say person is instructor
instructor and I'm gonna get rid of long
before I freak out at the syntax error
and does that say unreachable code
unreachable code how did it oh I have to
that's because right here this should
have been an S if person is student okay
so for the student now they have a GPA
or if they're personal student I forgot
to get here I don't need the variable if
I wanted to add the variable I would
have a small issue in there this has
changed throughout a couple of different
bills I believe this is the final
version though I can't say for sure
because remember this is still in
progress
it's squiggled because we do have a
conflict in naming so it's it's named
one one scope outside the if statement
and I believe that it's going to change
it as extensive discussion believe me it
does anybody ever watch the extensive
discussions on language they get very
very boring okay so here let's get rid
of this one first and now we're just
going to say if person is staff staff
okay cool okay so you guys like that
better right hey look it didn't fit on
one screen before and now it does we
love it when I've all fits on one screen
yeah
okay so but I don't think it's good
enough yet I think we can do better what
do you think should we try okay so let's
see what would happen if we used a
switch I like that
so we'll do switch person okay
and now if I can remember all this
syntax first switch case student does
that work
Wow it's not gonna work unless I put
that in there and then it's going to
need a break so I'm just going to start
just by doing this so it should compile
case why is that not working all right
I'm gonna cheat again because that looks
right to me and I don't know how I
messed up I'm sure I have messed up but
it's probably as it is in there that's
probably the story it's this one it
needs a very it what yeah okay
let's try it again case student student
I don't know why it needs it that that
doesn't make sense
anybody see something else I did wrong
let me know okay what is your problem
you have okay let's just call this
student 2 to make sure we have our
syntax correct okay okay it just needed
the variable name out there and I want
to I forgot to do something that I want
to do some just going to delete this for
a second and I will come back to it but
I want to look at the reason I redid
this is I want to do it in a simple
version right here this code probably
looks a little bit new and uncomfortable
to you right you're like yeah I like it
better than the old code but really I'm
not comfortable yet so think of it this
way from here to here approximately just
split it in half the type goes on both
sides of this that is a conditional you
saw that we not does not required that
we had a variable named after it
okay that's the conditional that tells
us whether it's true or false from here
to here what I have highlighted what
does that look like every other
declaration you've ever done anywhere so
it's just an overlapping conditional
and declaration and I think if you think
of it that way it'll stop looking quite
so weird okay questions likes giving you
guys permission to ask questions you'd
ask me anyway wouldn't you I hope so
okay so now we've got this student and
then we've got this other piece that's
that's part of this which is we can also
say win and win allows us to get this
kind of code in oh come on my I didn't
bring my other mouse which would have
been a brilliant thing to do who knows
what the M is who can tell tell me why
there's an empathy into that what is it
decimal what is a decimal is a base-10
number you should use decimal in almost
all cases unless you have a demonstrable
situation where you know double is
faster and important for you yes it's 40
times slower and you never care it's the
difference between like 40 nanoseconds
and 160 nanoseconds it's really really
fast both ways okay so I have that I'm
gonna get rid of that squiggle by simply
getting rid of this line of code which
was equivalent see that those are
equivalent okay and then I've gotten my
case we'll just do it this way it's
gonna be a little messy as I go through
this and then let's get rid of this line
and fix up this one so we can just say
well we're going to have that power so
we can just say a case student and now I
do have to say student - okay
that's looking nice I don't really need
this bracket because for some reason we
have to have brackets and if statements
for ourselves not the system the system
could care less but for our heads for
some reason we desperately want to see
them in an if statement and would you
please take him out of that case we
didn't like it there so I don't know why
we're that way but that's pretty common
that people like in one place and not
the other okay so here we just do this
really quick we just do case instructor
instructor that's pretty easy get rid of
that and we're about to be done and give
it to that and we get rid of down here
now you'd say how fast I'm doing this
and I'm actually talking at the same
time and it's really early in the
morning for me too so you guys can help
me when I make mistake
it's okay it's okay okay now and then we
can also still do our default it is
default right okay
now there's another thing that we're
going to be able to do and I don't
actually have a good demo for you but I
do want to mention this because it hurts
your head when you when you first hear
it and that is that you there is now and
it is a statement throw new and valid
operation that is a statement a
statement has a semicolon at the end a
statement cannot be on the right side of
an assignment that's what a statement is
an expression does not have a semicolon
and can be on the right side of an
assignment it can be a lot of other
places as well so there is now a throw
expression as well as a throw statement
and you're going huh
and just one quick example of how you
could use that and I must need another
that has to happen so after this I can
say var x equals I'm going to make this
I'm just going to do a quick ternary a
dummy ternary I realize this is
completely stupid code but I think it'll
make the point okay you could not do
that before see chef Sevan you might not
want to do this okay because this is
stupid but this you can use any place
you can use an expression now you can
use throw okay and that can be valuable
in case statements okay what do you
think anybody like that better than
where I started whoa dude yeah that is
so much better that is so much better
great okay that is that is pattern
matching okay
yeah host F sharp they're cool they got
tattoos and all that you know F sharp
it's really cool right this is this is
what we care about pattern matching
right now will care more they have fancy
stuff who will get it but this is what
we care about right now question
can use a lambda where do you want to
use a lambda right here I haven't tried
I'm going to give you a quick answer of
probably not okay
I haven't played around with if what
you're really trying to get to is that
being a funk but this right here we have
a type and that type is going to have to
be resolved at compile time so my
expectation would be no lambdas there
where I'm a little slower is would is
there a scenario you could put a lambda
there and sometimes they surprise me
and I'm only 75% sure that yeah no you
can't put it there either
you might be able to put it there how
many of you are familiar with I'm gonna
switch gears a little bit unless there's
another question on pattern matching
okay oh nope yeah okay so me scratching
okay how many of you are familiar with
string interpolation that came in
c-sharp six you guys like that do you
think it's nicer than my string format
here okay yeah I actually do too I think
that that would be kind of nicer there
but I got old code with boatloads of
this in there and it's actually a pain
in the neck I was about to say something
else it was a pain in the neck to change
him right you guys you guys have done
some changing of these right that's kind
of a pain okay so you're gonna be sad
you didn't wait control period enter
when the further win all right yes like
that okay how many times you get
something like this it goes off string
in it goes off screen but it's in the
middle of a string and you gotta put the
the put the quote in and then you put
the new line in and then it's all
squiggles and then you put the other
quote in you're like yeah that's a pain
right what that's so stupid why can't
you just do that is that cool
come on guys this is call okay it's this
little stuff what I said is you know yes
we get pattern-matching big-big okay but
the real thing about c-sharp seven is
that your life is better because you can
do that and you just saved yourself what
ten seconds not a lot you save yourself
ten seconds six or eight times a day
hey man you get a day off at the end of
the year right do the math but someplace
down there this is really is just
tightens things up and there's a second
reason yes okay it makes our life easier
things can go faster but there's a
second reason it matters and some of you
have thought about this some of you
haven't
but programmers have a huge need and a
huge dependency on their flow do you
know how if you're sitting working and
somebody comes over and asks you a
question then when you're done it takes
you a lot of time to get back to where
you were that's flow so flow actually
has a lot of micro at micro well I guess
I'll use the bad term micro aggressions
it has a lot of things that pick out it
like a little bird coming this things
like that okay now I wanted make fix
that string first of all had it had that
thought then I have to go and to do that
I have to put in a double quote and then
I put in an in and enter and then I'm
programmed to get upset about squigglies
shall I go squigglies and then I put the
quote in and all of that has not only
taken me 10 seconds but it's derailed my
brain not a lot like that person who
comes in and asked you a question
but addy rules are just a little bit and
so these little things in c-sharp seven
make our code more readable and they
help keep us in our focusing in our flow
without having anything about oh now I'm
going to have to extract that file and
I'm going to have to to rename that file
in
all these little things really add up to
a better experience that's why I like
Visual Studio 2017 any questions so far
okay so there's another kind of kind of
biggest feature that I want to talk
about and it has to do with what we're
returning right here and let me go back
to program for a minute and there's two
steps to showing you this there's two
improvements so the first one is how
many of you like the fact that to do an
out parameter you have to declare it
first
this is particularly annoying around a
tryparse or a try-catch or a tri-gate
value okay this is annoying right why
should we have to do that you're a
compiler would you get your act that's
not exactly what I meant to do let's
just get rid of it this one okay and
then let's just say you know you're an
integer be done with it
is that cool okay so things like try
powers try catch at least in this
version are not going to be updated with
the next feature although at some future
point maybe they will but we don't only
use out parameters right now when we
truly need them and if they're in your
code you probably will be able to remove
them however if they're in someone
else's code like tryparse then now
you'll not have to pre declare that's
nice the other thing we can do is
something called tuples which are new
actually in theme that work right in
them pretty much right they work right
to the degree that you will probably
encounter them there is still some small
tweaks that are going on with some of
the ways that they're restricted and
defined and some things like that
language design under the hood is really
messy and if you ever doubt that just
for grins go read any thread on github
on any language feature and you'll be
entertained for at least 35 seconds
there like hundreds and hundreds of
messages from people like me that
actually care about the associative
property of the null reference operator
and you you care that I care because
that particular feature was done wrong
from c-sharp 6 the null reference
operator had the wrong associative
property and myself and a bunch of other
people fought very hard to get it
switched and because of that you never
knew that conversation happened and
that's that
the way it should work that's the way
open-source should work but let me come
back over here and go to my my Springs
2016 term and by the way I haven't built
this for a while so let me just build it
and make sure I've never messed up we
get rid of the warnings they're just in
there that's probably telling me that I
can do something and that's probably an
if-statement someplace where I could
take advantage of something so where is
it we'll just go go look for for grins
so it just is telling me that on line 20
I don't know my numbers on line 20 is
yeah I can use pattern matching there we
already know that we already like that
okay so what I want to do now though is
say fundamentally this is wrong my
declaration here is just fundamentally
wrong and out parameter is a
fundamentally wrong concept it's a
parameter I'm giving it to you
I understand technically why this is the
this works I understand all that but
from a just logic point of view it's a
parameter I'm giving it to you if you're
giving it back to me it you should give
it back to me so in starting in sous
chef Sevan you're gonna be able to do
this little sweetheart and you're gonna
be able to do like this and then this is
not actually going to work just know
because at this point it'd be kind of
hard to actually define it you would
actually have to well you can okay what
you would have to do is come down here
and say messages okay you'd have to do
that and staff count now needs of are in
front of it because previous it was
passed in so it was already declared now
it needs to be declared okay so you like
that it gets better it gets better this
whole little you know you can do that
parentheses thing when you want to but
you know why should we have to I think
this works this was going to work I
think it works if it doesn't work you'll
forgive me
ants staff count okay and now at this
point I can do that
yeah I think I still have to do that
okay so so I can actually give those
names
okay is that cool okay so now yeah I
think I stuff to do that okay so let's
go back to the program because what we
care about now is this is broken now
because we didn't like that anyway and
so now I can say let's just do AI
numerable string and that's coming back
as thank you messages I don't know if I
capitalized that thank you I have just
let's just steal it there we go there we
go that's my name it was right there
idiot sorry alright okay and staff count
okay and now let's get rid of this okay
that is sensible I'm giving you people
please okay that's what I gave you what
you give me back please tell me just
give it doc you like that it's just
freaking awesome
okay now we also you guys I asked okay
you all like the VAR keyword okay so if
you like the VAR keyword then maybe we
could use var in here okay so let's just
say var and maybe this is a case you're
not crazy about var but which case don't
use it just you say things you like that
is that cool okay let's see if we can't
get even cooler what if that's boring
that's boring I don't want to write that
more than once what if I did that you
like that this is awesome stuff okay
this is great and just in case you this
ever is something you want to think
about there is discussion of wildcards
and what that means is that do you have
to take all the values and in the
meantime just use an underscore if we
don't get wildcards just use an
underscore because it kind of fades into
the background and it indicates that you
don't really care about the value now I
want to make it very clear that thank
you messages is not the same name as
messages so these names do not have to
match not required at all okay so is
that cool okay so let's take this if we
take this one step further
okay let's save our t equals and
take all of this because somebody here's
wondering about this so I'll show you
okay we just make it on one line just to
be pretty okay okay so now what type is
T but it's it's an anonymous stuff it is
not actually an anonymous type there is
a new thing called it a value tuple now
how many of you have used the tuple
that's in before c-sharp seven a lot of
you have okay it's broken it's really
sad there are so many things wrong with
it I believe that it will go into the
dustbin of time and hopefully become
obsolete okay first of all it's a class
what that means is it's a reference type
what that means as it goes on the heap
what that means is if you use very many
of them you're gonna have pressure on
your garbage collection a1 problem B how
many of you like that value one value
two thing okay so what we'd like this to
be is a value tuple that has some clue
that we gave this thing names
we didn't say ienumerable value one we
said ienumerable messages on the other
class so what we would like this to be
is a tuple where if we say console
console died right line I hate that one
just left okay just don't give that to
me okay T dot oh my gosh messages right
out those messages okay that is coming
back as a value type that understands
the names that you gave it and the types
you gave it can it get any cooler than
that I don't think so okay really I
don't think I have anything else on that
one okay so this is incredibly useful
and powerful and so I think every single
place you're using an out parameter
you're going to switch over to this I
also think that most of you are also
going to get a little crazy with this
and you're gonna start passing back a
few more things and you need to okay and
I just will tell you that when I started
working I spent six months in Python
I had a boss that thought I was to
Microsoft II and so he said you're not
touching anything Microsoft it worked
for six months it was a great experience
was not good for the company but it was
great for you I was ready by bad code I
had a great guy working for me who
actually wrote was to the Python code
but Python does this in house for a long
time and we did it maybe two dozen
places and I would say about a dozen of
those that we later backed out so it'd
be cautious with this one it's
tremendously important invaluable but
don't go crazy with it because I do
think it's something to have a light
touch on very very important in code
like this but then again in this code
why did we really just not go through
this list it's a small local list why
did we just not go through it again
so this isn't a case we particularly
needed that optimization of only going
through the list once if that had been
some very complex logic that did not
belong in this code that a where clause
in this code in just a normal link where
and dot count wasn't appropriate in this
code then it would have been fine to go
ahead and and move it over there but
just be a little cautious with this one
I am quite confident it will be misused
whether it's misused by you I don't know
but I'm quite confident this feature
will be both used and misused okay now
don't have time for this I've got a
couple minutes here I think I'm going to
show you one more language feature
instead of more Visual Studio features
and that is that and this is this is
kind of get a little hard to get your
head around and how many of you are in
John skis talked with me yesterday we
touched on this and we did it really
badly because we threw you really into
the deep end so let me show you what's
behind that and when they in order to do
this syntax right there they needed to
have the concept of deconstructing a
type so we have a value tuple it has
names you see that in the second time I
do I call the method but we need to be
able to yank it apart into its a into
its pieces okay instead of making that a
feature just for tuples they made it a
general language feature so what I what
I'm going to show you you can do is to
say we're going to create a person
equals we're just going to do person
stop first
I just need a person I just need a
variable that's going to be a person I'm
just using like that's why that squiggle
was there okay so what I want to be able
to do is to say first name last name
equals P whoa I did that on stage
yesterday with absolutely no warning
whatsoever and people are going huh okay
so if you were there and didn't follow
let me explain it now so we're gonna go
over to person and we're going to create
a new method and this method is going to
be a public whatever scope I want void
and it must have this name deconstruct
that's the magic it also then must be
it's a it doesn't have to be this here I
did it as an extension method this would
also be an extension method this one is
not going to be now I in need out
parameters out string and it's gonna be
first name and out string bless me okay
and then in the interest of time I'm
just going to say that these now need to
be assigned that's why there's a
squiggle right there is they're not
assigned so I'm going to say first name
equals name and then in the interest of
time I'm going to say last name equals
my favorite last name Flintstone but
mostly because I'm not reminding you of
how to spell Flintstone okay
it is not Flintstone okay so now it
compiles is that cool now let's go back
to program and see if that compiles no
I need of art but I also having a school
under P no Dickens I just gave you a
Deconstructor person is a key-value fish
who said that who said that you're
brilliant thank you so much about you
dot value hey you guys happy save
massive pair programming thank you so
much that really speeding this up right
there so I have got just a couple of
minutes left so the first thing I want
to do is take any questions on this okay
so you can deconstruct you can
deconstruct intelligently or stupidly
which is what John and I were playing
around with we just really stupid
deconstructions please for your friends
and your neighbors and keeping your job
do intelligent deconstruction and then
another thing I want to say here's the
reason our parameters are used here
instead of other features you could
think of let's go back to this the
reason app parameters are used is these
are actually intended to be overloaded
ok the design is done such that you
could have a Deconstructor that we
turned one parameter which was named or
two parameters which is first-name and
lastname or some other number now
whether this is a good way to extract
those values from your person class I
don't know think that through on your
own depends on how big your person class
is but deconstructors are going to be
very useful in some cases I'll give you
a quick example if you've ever created a
point class to create an X and y or x
y&amp;amp;z value then you could create that
class with a constructor but getting the
values back as x y&amp;amp;z required just a
little bit more code you can now do that
with a Deconstructor inside your point
class so that's a more logical usage of
this okay do I have any questions I'll
see if I can find one or two visual
studio things to show you otherwise got
about a minute and a half or something
yes
so the question is can couldn't you just
use a method that we turn those values
did you need to do this this extra
Deconstructor thing and the answer is
absolutely you could sorry this is the
one you want the difference is whether
this is going to look like that these
this is the breakdown of that of an
instance of that type this is what this
is saying or what you're pointing out is
that you could have a method with any
name and call my method and that would
absolutely you could also have a
property that I believe I haven't
actually done that but you should be
able to use tuples and properties as
well so you can have either a method or
a property that did the same thing and I
think that's a better answer for the
first name last name get the name is
more logical than to deconstruct that
but it is nice to also have the D
constructor and there was also a
question and over here somewhere same
question okay any other questions okay
if I out of time I get a min and a half
you guys want to go early let me show
you something one more thing yeah
question
where's question okay oh thank you so
much for asking that question do you
know the answer and that's why you asked
it oh thank you that's a perfect way to
close this out because I said that this
is making your life easier you know I
said all this kind of stuff and then I
went into tools options tools options
he's a very outdated concept it comes
from a time that most of us worked
unlike one company one project our
projects were pretty static they didn't
change the rules a lot and now oh my
gosh
rules change all the time and besides
that there's a guy down the hall he
insists on using this Visual Studio code
okay so what good is this skin of b2 my
project because it's just here on my
machine and how does that really help us
and the answer is that and this is still
getting finalized okay but there's
something called editor dot config which
is a name that's expected to be the
configuration for project this is kind
of more widely in the community they've
extended the syntax for that because it
had to be extended fairly far to hold
that information so you so that can be
attached into an editor dot config
exactly how it goes from your tools
options into
that config right now still unclear but
you will have an editor dark config that
code will recognize Visual Studio will
recognize and will King to be checked
into source control with your project so
everybody gets it which is essential to
this working correctly so thanks a lot
for that question and that runs me out
of time I want to thank you so much for
spending this morning and I hope you
have a great time I'll be in room one
after this and there's a lot of other
great talks going on at the same time
thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
