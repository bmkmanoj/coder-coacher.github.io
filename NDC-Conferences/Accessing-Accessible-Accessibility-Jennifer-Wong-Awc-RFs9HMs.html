going to get started here
so
as you saw on the website today I'm
presenting accessing accessible
accessibility I'm Jennifer Wong I'm a
software engineer at Eventbrite and this
is my official Eventbrite photo with my
cat fry you can find me on github at
Jenn's or or on Twitter at my blue
wristband so I'm here with my brother
today and because it's our first time in
Australia I think you're supposed to
hang out with baby kangaroos right so
before I really get started I just
wanted to do a quick privilege check so
I'm speaking about accessibility today
and because I have a certain amount of
privilege I can't fully comprehend what
it's like to live with a disability so I
just wanted to point out that I'm
cisgender I'm straight or heterosexual I
am from a middle to upper-middle class
family I have no physical social or
learning disabilities I'm
college-educated and I have a socially
acceptable body type so before we get
started it's really good to like check
your priveledge and understand where
you're coming from when you're working
on accessibility
my interest in accessibility actually
started by going to a conference called
jQuery SF in 2015 and that was partially
I'm seed by a man named Jennison
Asuncion and he's actually an
accessibility advocate and he organizes
the Bay Area accessibility and
inclusivity design meetup group in San
Francisco and he also organizes GAA D
which is global accessibility Awareness
Day and that falls on May 18th every
year so there I actually saw Carole
Karen speak and she talked about what
it's like to navigate the web as a
partially sighted person and John
Cooperman talked about going from a
developer to becoming an ally so he's
coming at accessibility from the
developer and coding perspective and
then I also saw Viktor serán speak
about the Aria spec and so you went in
great detail into what aria is
and I'll talk about that in a little bit
so going to that conference and just
they had a whole section of talks just
about accessibility and its importance
and I was like I need to know more about
this tell me more so what is
accessibility as Jennifer Marsden said
one source of truth wikipedia so
wikipedia says web accessibility refers
to the inclusive practice of removing
barriers that prevent interaction with
or access to websites by people with
disabilities
when sites are correctly designed
developed and edited all users have
equal access to information and
functionality so here are a few people
who have accessibility needs so here we
see Beverley Redick and she's actually
helping customers and you can see she's
got a guide dog here and she's
navigating the web with her keyboard we
also see a senior who just he has no
specific disability he's just older and
you can see that his keyboard is
actually a high contrast very large
large type keyboard and then last year
we'll see an IBM fellow Chico Asakawa
and she is actually blind and she's
testing this navigation app called nav
cog which helps navigate people through
different spaces so who else needs
accessibility everyone and who has
everybody so everybody could be anybody
with any type of disability so you could
have a visual disability and that may be
blindness low vision poor eyesight or
color blindness it could be a motor or
mobility disability and that would be
difficulty or inability to use your
hands may be caused by tremors or muscle
slowness you would have loss of fine
muscle control and those things could be
caused by anything from Parkinson's
disease to much muscular dystrophy and
sabri both
cerebral palsy that's a really hard word
to say and Stroke
you could also have auditory
disabilities so that could be anything
from deafness to hearing impairments or
being hard of hearing you could also
have seizures and that may be due to
photo epileptic seizures that are caused
by flashing effects and then lastly
there are also cognitive or intellectual
disabilities and those range from
developmental disabilities to learning
disabilities such as dyslexia and then
cognitive disabilities affecting your
memory attention or developmental
maturity problem-solving and logic
skills so the point of having the slide
up here is just to point out that
there's a range of disability so saying
that somebody has a visual disability
doesn't automatically mean that they're
blind they just may have like like
blurriness in their eyes things like
that and it could be caused by a range
of things so some statistics here
there's like a myth that people with
disabilities are a minority user but
that's actually not true and we can see
by this chart put together by Google the
yellow bars are actually just people in
the US using the internet with
accessible needs and so you can see that
people in the US with blind that are
maybe blind or have low vision that are
using the internet actually totals more
than the entire population of Canada
Italy or Mexico and then those who are
deaf or hard of hearing that are using
the internet just in the United States
totals more than all those countries as
well as the entire population of Spain
so people with disabilities are not a
minority user we can also see that in
the statistics that I have here so about
18 point so I'm from the US and that's
why I have the US stats up there so
eighteen point seven percent of the US
population have some type of disability
and twelve point six percent have a
severe disability and then about
eighteen point five percent so it's
about on par with us of the Australian
population has a disability as well so
based on those numbers and numbers
pulled from the World Health
Organization of people living with
disabilities
the entire world we can estimate that
about 7.5 percent of Internet traffic
comes from people with accessible needs
and that's a lot of people so some quick
stats about Eventbrite so we actually
noticed that about 25 percent of our
traffic comes from people who are over
the age of 45 and we also noticed that
our bounce rate is higher among that
population so that's also something to
consider you know when you get older
like I started wearing glasses recently
whereas I didn't have to before you may
begin to feel like arthritis
osteoporosis carpal tunnel things like
that and it makes it much harder to
navigate the web as you get older so
even if you're not living with a
disability you may well everyone becomes
older and that means that the web's
gonna be harder to surf so why should
you do accessibility well you're all
here so you already want to be allies so
let's do it together one note about the
a11y so I for a long time read that as a
lie but it's actually because there are
eleven letters between the a and Y and
accessibility so I like to say a lie a
lie sometimes so why else should you do
accessibility well it's the law in a lot
of places so here on Australia you guys
have the Disability Discrimination Act
or the DDA of 1992 and it basically
states how you have to make things
accessible in general overall for people
in Australia so section 24 specifically
states that is it is unlawful for a
person who provides goods facilities or
services to discriminate on the grounds
of disability in addition to that there
were actually some advisory now it's
tacked on in 2002 and while this is not
specifically a law its advisory notes
and how to make the web accessible so
that was added on as well other reasons
why you want to do accessibility you
might get sued so here we see Bruce
Maguire and he
actually sued the Sydney organising
committee for the Olympic Games or so
cog he basically filed a complaint with
the human rights and Equal Opportunities
Commission under the DDA which I just
explained and he essentially said that
he was not able to navigate the Olympic
Games websites so he won that lawsuit
and so cog was required to make changes
to their website to make them accessible
and they didn't so then they got fined
20,000 Australian dollars for that so
during this time Bruce McGuire said in
an interview it's an ongoing campaign to
raise awareness about web accessibility
and keep asserting the fact that people
with a disability have as much right to
choice and inclusion as the rest of the
community
other places where there are
accessibility laws not just Australia
but also in Brazil the European Union
Ireland Israel Italy Norway the United
Kingdom and the United States so if
you're looking to internationalize your
website or your business it's definitely
good to take a look and see where all of
these laws overlap and which ones are
the most stringent some other lawsuits
so the Federation for the blind in the
US actually sued Target in a class
action lawsuit target paid out about 6
million dollars and that's on top of the
4 million dollars they paid in legal
fees during this lawsuit most recently
Juan Carlos Gil actually sued the
winn-dixie stores which is a grocery
chain in the US and he won that lawsuit
so when Dixie only had about 30 days to
comply with WCAG 2.0 Double A which I'll
explain it in a little bit but something
to consider so right now you have quite
a bit of time to make your website
accessible but if you get sued you're
only gonna have about 30 days other
reasons to do accessibility so it's
really great for SEO if you make your
website accessible it automatically
becomes better for SEO
as well as becoming better and more
navigable by everyone so for example
Googlebot is the world's most prolific
blind user of the Internet so how should
we do accessibility the first thing you
want to take a look at are some
standards so as I mentioned earlier WCAG
stands for it actually stands for the
web content accessibility guide and
those are put together by w AI which is
the web accessibility initiative of w3c
which is the World Wide Web Consortium
they really like their acronyms so
they're if you don't know w3c is an
international community that creates web
standards and so they've created a bunch
of web standards on accessibility as
well section 508 is part of US law and
it specifies that things must have X Y
Z's need to have accessible information
and that's specified in Section 508
specifically so it's federal agencies as
well as any group that takes federal
funding in the US and then essentially
the equivalent in Australia is the DDA
which I had mentioned earlier
interestingly because section 508 and
the DDA are not super specific on web
accessibility they're just like we're
just gonna try to comply with WCAG 2
point o Double A so that's kind of a
gold standard these days however there
are criticisms about wcag 2.0 so first
they the first criticism is that it
doesn't sufficiently put the user at the
heart of the process so essentially like
as a user is going through user flows
that doesn't get addressed in WCAG
there's nothing to specifically address
accessibility for those who have
learning or cognitive disabilities and
it also doesn't keep up with current
technology so
be CAG 2.0 came out in 2008 so it's been
about 10 years and it hasn't been
updated since then and the guidelines
are really hard to navigate just to give
an example I'm gonna click on this guy
so you guys can see just how crazy it is
don't mind my banana so this is WCAG and
you can see 2008 here and it's just like
a wall of text and there are a ton of
links but there are just so many links
and it's crazy
so if I wanted to for example find out
what color what are their regulations
for color contrast and like oh god I
have no idea where that is there's
somewhere down here so you could just
keep scrolling and scrolling for days
and like not be able to find what you're
looking for
so yes that is definitely one of the
criticisms alright back to slides okay
so now we've gone through standards
let's talk about how we might want to
test accessibility so one of the first
ways you'd want to test is just by
tabbing through a website so you just
use your tab key and see what gets
focused as you tap through your website
so that gives you an idea of like the
tab index of elements on your page you
can also try navigating your website
using some standard keyboard shortcuts
which I link to here other ways to test
is by using screen readers so some
screen readers this is an sampling of
some screen readers that are out there
let's see I've got some notes here
jaws window eyes and NVDA are only four
windows NVDA is actually free and
window-eyes has an interesting deal
where I think if you have Microsoft
Office it's also free voiceover is used
on Mac or OS X and iOS and talkback is
used on Android
so just really quickly I wanted to talk
about the popularity of screen readers
so these numbers or this chart comes
from web aim which is a group I'll talk
about in a bit but they put together a
survey every about every year this one I
think is from 2015-2016 and they ask
people a bunch of questions about their
accessible needs so they they've
basically asked what is your primary
screen reader and here the most popular
one is jaws but I actually noticed
there's a trending line going downwards
and more people are starting to use
zoomtext
and window-eyes as well as NVDA so here
are the numbers just really quickly so
again we see jaws is most popular
followed by zoomtext window-eyes and vda
and then voiceover and voiceover is just
becoming more popular because people
have iPhones and that's what's used on
iPhones as well as OSX other ways to
test you could test by using different
assistive technology so here we see a
Braille reader up top and then a high
contrast keyboard below and then here we
see some people using some of this
assistive technology so we have Billy
Harrison here and he actually monitors
the air force information networks
global information grid and you can see
he's got assistive technology on his
hands to help him type on the keyboard
up in the top right you can see David
Riley and he's actually a legally blind
employee at a store so all of these all
these photos are generally from a US Air
Force Base because they're the ones that
I can use non-commercially and then also
because they have to actually comply
with section 508 because they're a
federal agency so you can see here he's
legally blind and he's just leaning into
his keyboard and he actually has works
in customer support and then lastly
you'll see an employee named Bernard
Burnie were we and he's using zoomtext
here to test websites a bunch of other
accessible devices
you can see some special keyboards you
can see a Braille reader somewhere in
there there are also single switch
buttons up there and just different
configurations that make things easier
to use for people that maybe have like
lots of fine motor control also we see
here a mouth stick or a head wand for
people who don't have it use of their
hands or their arms and then lastly
we'll see here a chin controller so this
is Raymond Jenks and he's an
instructional system specialist so you
can see here he's using a computer input
device and a chin controller to do his
work and then also to drink water and
take phone calls so he's doing quite a
bit over here so you can also use eye
tracking devices if you know you want to
put together a really crazy
accessibility lab and then also there's
single switch single switch on-screen
keyboards so you see here essentially
it's a button that allows you to surf
through websites and through your
computer's operating system and here's
another example of one of those
keyboards all right so those are ways of
testing with assistive devices other
ways you'll want to start getting tested
is using web validators so here are
three that come highly recommended that
we use all the time at Eventbrite
there's wave which is created by web aim
and then there's acts created by deck
University and those are both available
as Chrome extensions or Firefox
extensions as well totally is created by
Khan Academy and you can actually just
drop a script into for example your dev
or maybe your QA environment and that'll
allow you to test your website as you're
creating it another thing you'll want to
validate is color contrast so there are
a few here
they're actually ton a ton online for
verifying that you have good color
contrast I really like accessible colors
because if a color doesn't work they'll
recommend a slightly different shade of
it and
sure that it's compliant with WCAG
another really interesting Chrome
extension which my friend told me about
it's called no coffee and it actually
will simulate visual disabilities so
here I've basically I've upped the blur
and I've also wanted what else did I had
I added cloudiness and that mimics
cataracts and some snow so this is the
Eventbrite homepage and you can see like
how somebody else with a visual
disability might view your website so
it's a pretty neat extension some other
ideas you can try removing the CSS from
your website and see if you can navigate
it you can bring people in and do
in-person user testing to see how you're
doing on your website you can try
blindfolding yourself you can try
blacked-out glasses and then you can
also turn down your screen brightness
and try to navigate using a screen
reader or your keyboard you can also use
just like no coffee a color blindness or
low vision simulator so here is actually
a photo of some guys that Dropbox the
accessibility lab that they have there
and they're just testing their website
using these weird goggles all right how
else can we do accessibility so we can
do that by making sure our codes
accessible so the first thing that you
wanted to do is make sure you have
semantic HTML so don't use a div as a
span don't use a span as an anchor tag
and don't use an anchor tag as a button
or as bee and puppycat say you use the
sword as a sword so other things you'll
want to make sure you have in semantic
hTML is having a clear heading structure
so that means making sure that you have
a correct flow of everything from your
h1 to your h6 is also you'll want to be
using semantic HTML tags such as nav or
footer
there's all types there's article aside
main section header don't go too
overboard use them where they're
appropriate with images you also want to
make sure that you have an alt attribute
and make sure that within that Ultra
attribute there's something descriptive
and easily understandable if the image
is actually just decorative and has no
other function make sure that you have
an alt attribute with nothing in it and
that'll tell essentially tell screen
readers so you can just skip over this
image if you have something more complex
such as a chart or a map you'll want to
make sure you have a full text
description of what that is also forms
make sure that your inputs have labels
so make sure that your label has a four
attribute and make sure that your input
has a name attribute so that they're
correctly associated together and then
make sure that in general across your
website that your forms have consistent
labels and buttons for example if you
were to go into a website and one button
said login and then one button said sign
in that could get really confusing
especially if you're coming at a website
from a screenreader and you're like
those buttons do different things I'm
not really sure so make sure you have
consistency across those labels and
buttons also with buttons and links
you'll want to make sure that you have a
non-color indicator
I know designers really like to remove
that underline from your links but it's
super helpful for making your access
your website accessible also having a
clear hover and focus state is important
for those buttons and those links as
well tab ordering so avoid this if you
can it essentially tells your keyboard
or your browser like how you want to tab
through your website if you can't avoid
it then what you want to do is only use
tab index of 0 or tab index of negative
so tabindex of zero essentially is like
telling the browser like hey I want to
put this thing into the tab index or tab
ordering and then negative one will just
remove it from the tab ordering so try
not to go into one or higher when you're
setting a tab index because once you do
that you're actually telling the browser
exactly how to navigate through so there
are pieces of your website that may get
skipped if you do something like that
videos and animations so you'll want to
make sure that your videos have closed
captions and make sure you turn off
autoplay that's like not helpful for
accessibility or for example people who
suffer from seizures also you want to
make sure you have a way to pause play
and stop
pause start and stop your animation or
your video and then also it's really
great to include a transcript of the
video so that could be on the page or it
could be a link to a transcript
elsewhere how else should you do
accessibility aria not this aria a
different Aria so Aria as I I may have
mentioned earlier well W AI stands for
the web accessibility initiative and
then Aria stands for accessible rich
Internet applications as I said earlier
w3c we we likes their acronyms so
essentially Aria was created because out
of the box screen readers worked with
regular HTML but if you needed to like
add more information for screen readers
to understand what's happening on your
website
Aria tags were created however just like
with Aria from Game of Thrones you'll
want to be careful with Aria and Aria
tags and the reason for this is you want
to just make sure that you have semantic
hTML first so Aria was created actually
before all the semantic tags that we got
so before nav and before footer before
main so it's kind of supplementary to
your semantic hTML so if you start to
use the Aria too much it could be over
kill get it ha ha so the structure of
Aria is their role states and properties
roles are essentially a main indicator
of type and it allows tools to view
elements as other elements of that type
reviewed it's a little bit confusing but
essentially if for some reason you're
unable to use a form a form tag then you
can actually add a role form onto your
element and you'll expect or screen
readers and people navigating your site
will expect that that object functions
as the way a form element would as well
so there are a ton of types of roles and
you can ignore the abstract role because
these three landmark document and widget
inherit from the abstract role so just
pretend that abstracts not there and is
abstract let's see a landmark role
essentially identifies a large area to
be used by a screen reader so for
example the role banner and that would
be a large area of a banner a document
role essentially provides structural
description for a section and are
typically like non interactive so some
document roles are it's like the form
where they're actually mapped to
elements that already exist and then
widget roles describe commonly use
interactive patterns that don't have
semantic HTML already so for example
role tooltip Aria states are a little
bit self-explanatory I think they
essentially describe the state of an
element so you have dis you have
disabled you have busy grabbed hidden
and invalid and then Aria properties
will describe properties of an element
so here you have a long list of
properties one thing I want to note
label and label by always confuse me so
label by is the Aria tag you'll want to
use
if your label is actually visually
available on the page and then label is
if that label is not visually available
on that page other cool Aria things you
can do is you can add skip links via
Aria so there are several ways you can
do that but it allows you to essentially
skip the main navigation of a web page
so if you imagine you're tabbing through
a website and you go to the next page
and you have to go through every single
piece of a navigation it can get really
tedious and annoying so having a skip
link is super helpful the ways that you
can do that is you could have a visible
link at the top of the page which is of
course the best way to have a skip link
you could also have a visible link
that's elsewhere on the page which is
less helpful because it's not actually
associated with the navigation then you
can have an invisible link which is
really not super helpful unless you're
tabbing through you're using a screen
reader it's nice to know that you have
that available to you first or you can
use an invisible link that becomes
visible as you're tabbing through or
with keyboard focus so that's actually
what we use on Eventbrite
so you can see here in the top left we
have the Skip main navigation and you'll
also want to be careful about your
wording with that so skip me navigation
I think is pretty clear and once you
click on that you'll be shot down to the
search bar here so you can skip browse
events you can skip learn more you don't
have to login and all that so how else
should you do accessibility you'll
definitely want to make sure that you
prevent regressions so making sure your
website stays accessible so the ways you
can do that is you can add unit tests
you can add automation tests which we'll
go through and insure for example that
your links have alt text alt attributes
and then the other way we do things at
Eventbrite actually is we have modular
reusable components so components on
their own can be made to be accessible
and then it's up to each team when
they're using those components to make
sure that they're still accessible in
the flow that they're creating but
having those modular reusable components
be
the ball already is definitely a step in
the right direction okay demo time so
everybody I assume has some form of
mobile device and/or computer if
everybody wants to pull those out that'd
be awesome
so we're essentially going to use
narrator if you have a Microsoft device
talkback if you have an Android device
or voiceover if you have a iOS or OSX
device this is a link to my speaker deck
which is not super helpful because
actually this speaker deck is not
accessible because it's a PDF so you
wouldn't be able to tab through on that
or actually fully read the text but
let's start off with narrator so if you
have a Microsoft device right now you
can go to bitly slash AAA windows I
don't does that it can anybody or can
you all raise your hand if you have a
Windows Device right now that you might
be using oh I thought this was a dotnet
conference ok we'll skip narrator then
and ease of use which is actually used
on the windows phone ok how many people
have an Android device okay we'll start
with talkback then so you can turn on
talkback by going to settings and then
you should be able to find talkback
somewhere in there there's also a link
here bitly slash AAA Android and that'll
give you information on how to do that
once you've turned on talkback you can
what you'll need to know is that you
touch to explore so it'll read out to
you pieces of your operating system on
your phone and then you'll double tap in
order to click on something and there we
go everybody turn up the volume
and then you'll also use two fingers to
scroll instead of one so those are all
the things that you'll definitely need
to know okay how many people have an
apple or iOS device okay so I'm gonna
skip these screenshots since somebody's
got got talkback on so with Apple
essentially what you want to do on iOS
is go to bitly / NBC AAA iOS and I can
actually just scroll through these guys
so you'll start by going to settings and
then general settings once you get to
general you can go to speech
and once you go to speech you can also
you can just turn on speak selection so
the cool thing about iOS is it's pretty
easy to get to what language you'll want
to hear as well so you can just go to
pronounciation and choose different
languages and different voices okay so
I'll just leave this up here and then
I'm going to get into voice over on my
computer as well so the way that you do
it on a Mac device is actually you just
press command + f5 so as you can see I
chose a British voice because we really
like British accents in the US so let's
see if I go - I'm gonna get out of my
slides really quickly accessing
accessible accessibility key with Chrome
web content accessibility guidelines
WCAG 2-0 window where content
accessibility guidelines WCAG 2 0 link
see how I'm tabbing through and what the
screen reader is reading
so let's check out and be seen sorry I'm
kind of putting NDC on the spot by doing
this
conference web content 90% loaded 78%
loaded you are currently on web content
to enter the web area press control
option n DC let's pray Sydney right
brace okay Chris come on terror Walt
there's no there's no skip navigation
that's one thing that I'll point out so
we're in the menu okay in a prayer
that's good and then so you can see that
having the skip navigation would be
really helpful here oh what's that
oh so that's something to note so I'm
actually in the menu right now so even
though the menus actually closed
visually it's open for the screen reader
oh there we are okay all right I think
that's enough voiceover okay so that's
just a demo of what voiceover is like
and using a screen reader I'm also just
gonna show you really quickly voiceover
utilities so if you have a Mac device
this is really neat because you can go
to speech and then you can actually
choose a bunch of different voices so I
really like bad news
so obviously I mean these are joke ones
but if you go to speech you can
customize it and there's all for example
if you speak English there are many
types of English to choose from you have
United States you have Australia India
Ireland you have Scotland
do you have South Africa and the United
Kingdom and you may have noticed that I
actually have Diego compact and Spanish
and that's Argentinian Spanish because
we have an engineering office down in
Argentina okay so that's voice over
utility now I'm gonna go back to my
slides maybe
sorry technical difficulties here
or maybe not
okay sure
yeah
thank you all right so to finish up I
want to talk a little bit about
accessibility at Eventbrite so the first
person to get everything started and
accessibility was an engineer named Ali
lacquer she really pushed for making
sure that Eventbrite was accessible and
trying to get everything started so the
first thing that she did was she
acquired buy-in from people in the
higher-ups you know they so she started
by creating a presentation and she
talked about the benefits of
accessibility and there are several so
the first she talked about were sales
benefits and one example is we would be
able to get clients who required
accessibility compliance so for example
schools that are taking federal funding
in the US so there's a sales benefit
there and the ability to get ticket fees
by closing those clients legal benefits
or something that we talked about
already so making sure that we're
actually following the law and then also
that gets tied in to
internationalization and making sure
that things are accessible across
different countries and across different
laws in those countries and then lastly
of course actually it should be firstly
really.but consumer benefits and making
sure that your website is much more
easily navigable by people using your
website so she made this whole
presentation and she was able to get
buy-in from people higher up and so we
started actually by having web aim come
in and do an entire audit of our
consumer flows so web aim is a nonprofit
organization and they operate out of the
Center for persons with disabilities at
Utah State University and that's been
since 1999 but essentially they put out
a ton of standards and
guidelines on how you make your website
accessible but then they also will
partner with people and they can
actually run accessibility audits on
your website so we partnered with them
and that's what we had them do and so we
got an idea of where we really need to
work on things to make them accessible
an Eventbrite ally also put together a
cross-functional team so I can't
emphasize enough the importance of
making sure that this is
cross-functional it doesn't only come
from engineering you'll need the support
of all types of people because this
affects so many people in so many
different areas so we had people in
engineering we had people from content
strategy we had an account exec who was
from sales we had design involved we had
customer support involved we had our QA
team involved and also our legal team
involved so it's quite a bit of people
just pulled together to talk about how
to make our website accessible and then
from that we were able to put together
more documentation and best practices so
our centralized accessibility
information is actually on Google Drive
we also have a series of videos that
talk about how to make things accessible
and then we have a bunch of internal
documentation so things like having
notes and github and how to make things
accessible for engineers there are
guidelines specifically for design and
how they're going to make things
accessible in their designs
there we go so some tools that we use at
Eventbrite so the first is the color
contrast analyzer and our design team
actually uses that it's a plug-in for
sketch so they can check to make sure
that their designs have the correct
color contrast before they go over to
engineers we also use totally which is
that plugin that I mentioned earlier
where you just drop that script in and
we actually have it available on our dev
and QA sites we're currently also in the
process of migrating everything over to
react and redux so we also have this
linker plugin which is pretty great so
it'll actually check your JSX
and so anytime somebody is trying to
compile and push their code up they'll
get an error if it's not accessible and
so they actually have to stop and make
things accessible before they can push
their code and then we have a bunch of
acceptance tests that also check to make
sure that things stay accessible across
the site so here you'll see the color
contrast analyzer for sketch so you can
just tell your designers like hey get
this plug-in and then make sure things
are at color have the correct color
contrast here you'll see totally and the
way that totally works is it's this it's
a tiny little tab in the bottom left and
it's got like little spectacles and when
you click on that it expands up and
it'll analyze your site I'm soda like
header and color header structure color
contrast images having alt text and
things like that we also have a bunch of
acceptance tests so here you can see a
bunch of our acceptance tests which are
written in Python and we check things
such as your links have text so you
don't have a bunch of blank links your
images have alt attributes oops
and then other examples are making sure
that your inputs have labels associated
with them if you put together an
accessibility project at your company I
highly recommend using project
management so we actually set benchmarks
and we use JIRA JIRA dashboard to track
those we have like goals we tried to set
deadlines and then involving program
managers
can be super helpful as well to make
sure that you're staying on track so our
initial estimate was that it would be
about two tickets or so per team of
three to seven developers and that was
per sprint which is about two weeks for
us and then for ten sprints so this is
what our accessibility dashboard looks
like so we have we can keep track of
what tickets are being worked on or in
progress which ones have been resolved
we have them organized by team so we can
see which team of course my team has
most accessibility tickets that we need
to take care of and it's really helped
because people can just like check out
how we're doing you know in a quick
second oops this is a stock image from
keynote but it worked really well with
this slide so definitely don't work
alone so you'll want to have people on
your team being as I said earlier allies
to work with you and have those people
be accessibility ambassadors with you
because doing it alone you're gonna just
be that like one targeted person it's
like Jen's always bothering us to be
accessible so you need people on your
team to make sure that they're like
helping you out there so you're not the
one targeted person so the way I started
to do that was actually I got I had the
privilege of going to our Argentina
office so you see here I'm hosting an
accessibility workshop and everybody has
headphones on and they were asked to
turn down their screen brightness and
all they had to do was sign into their
Eventbrite account and then purchase one
ticket to any event and we had about an
hour and nobody was able to do it so
that kind of brought things into
perspective for people for our engineers
and we have people in design and QA here
as well and they could really understand
like how hard it is to navigate our
website I mean of course we're noobs at
screen readers so we're not gonna do as
well as somebody who's more experienced
but it was really hard the other thing
like with don't work alone is like we
really need to work as a team and this
something I said after everybody totally
freaked out and the reason why everybody
totally freaked out is if you look at
this button here on this little
slideshow
that's a button that's not something I
photoshopped in and it was added by one
of our engineers to help
pause start and stop this animation or
slideshow and the designers were like
what is that and so they got really mad
and that just kind of points out the
importance of making sure you're working
with design to make sure well this is
accessible we also want things to look
nice as well so we I mean we have a
resolution on the way so we're working
with the design team to make something a
little nicer looking all right so what
happened with the Eventbrite consumer
accessibility project so it's still a
work in progress I say sorry for any
convenience convenience caused because
we're slowly working through our tickets
and making things more accessible in the
future the things I really want to work
on is I want to make sure that we
complete all of our JIRA tickets I also
want to build out an accessibility
process checklist which we have in the
works and that would be for a product
team our design team engineering team
and QA teams and so each department
would have their own checklist to make
sure that the work they're doing is
accessible I also want to have a more
focused effort from our fun and Foundry
team because I think accessibility
touches everything across the website
it's not one feature team and so we
really need a push from our front end
foundry team and then I'd like us to
just have more involvement with the
accessibility community as well and some
resources so as I mentioned before
there's web aim there's WCAG and then
also there's this accessibility slack
channel that you can have access to so
they have a bunch of accessibility
advocates that are part of the slack
channel so if you have questions or if
you have resources to contribute it's a
really good place to be and that's all
I've got for you
I think I can take some questions if
anybody has any
so the question is after having the
workshop did people forget to continue
checking for accessibility and did they
retain their buy-in so I would say that
it depended on person person out of that
workshop I definitely found a few people
who became more accessibility advocates
which is great because it's a smaller
office and so there are a few of them
that are constantly kind of like helping
to make sure things are accessible so
they're just checking different pull
requests out and making sure that those
things are accessible so yes buy-in does
drop-off for some people but as long as
I think you you really hit a core with a
few people that can be super helpful any
other questions
the question is have we had any feedback
from disabled users so we haven't had
any specifically positive feedback
because they think it just means your
website is usable but we definitely get
information when things are not usable
and so that those are tickets that we
work on kind of constantly to make sure
that things become more and more
accessible I would like to bring in
people to actually test the website
maybe like my grandma for example and
see how things work and I think that
would give us like much more informative
feedback go ahead
so the question is are we doing more
work for people with cognitive or
intellectual disabilities not at the
moment but it's definitely something
that's on my radar because I don't want
it to fall by the wayside oh I think
Denny has so Denny is actually giving a
talk right after this about
accessibility as well so I think he he
may have an answer for you
yeah so everybody if you're if you're
still interested in accessibility and
you still have buy-in definitely check
out Denny's talk L Waters is also giving
a talk and accessibility later today and
both L and I are doing an AMA I think
540 any other questions okay you get six
and a half minutes back thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
