person's good that's fine I'll go with
that I'm going to hopefully help you
become a social developer this is one of
the things that has been very important
to me in my career but it's something I
learned very late in my career as well
and that describes actually pretty much
every talk that I do it's stuff that was
difficult for me to learn or took a long
time for me to learn but became very
very important to me so this is one of
those things because as developers we
need to talk to each other now when I
talk about becoming a social developer
I'm not talking about interacting with
people on Facebook I'm talking about
talking to developers in person
especially when we're at awesome events
just like this one now I know some of
you are you're probably a little
apprehensive right now because you're
thinking oh man he's gonna make us talk
to each other but don't worry because
this is not a highly interactive
workshop okay so so for those of you who
are a little nervous that's okay this is
not a highly interactive workshop so
even the people that are down here in
the front row near the door they're
they're gonna be okay too you know the
people in the back you guys are kind of
stuck with me and the reason is I want
this to be a nice comfortable safe space
because a lot of us are shy a lot of us
kind of have these behaviors that we're
used to and we don't we're not
comfortable interacting with other
people and quite honestly I'm like that
too but I've learned how to change my
behavior over the years and what I found
is that when I've started talking to
other developers when I've started
meeting new people when I've just had a
chance to interact with people that are
doing things that I'm not doing with
there's a ton of benefits that I've
gotten from this I get to talk to people
who are working with technologies I'm
not working in I get to find out what
they're good for what they're not so
good at I get new ideas of people who
are solving problems in ways that I
never would have thought of
and this is especially important because
a lot of times you know we get kind of
hooked in our work teams you know so
maybe there's this group of people that
we interact with all the time we're all
working on the same problem once we
start getting outside of that world we
find out how people are approaching
things different ways and it gives us
new ideas and new challenges of how we
can go through and actually make those
bring some of those ideas into our own
development world and of course over the
years I've made a ton of new friends and
I'm not a social person by Nature and
for some reason I know a lot of people
now I know way more people than I feel
like I should know but again it's been
really really awesome for me now you see
me up here on the stage and you're like
well Jeremy you look pretty confident
you look like you're not afraid to talk
to people and yes I do look that way but
the really the reality of situation is I
am just like you I'm one of those people
who was the loner at the conference I
don't know if you've ever you know
growing up shy it's just it's it's
painful it's horrible and I don't know
if you ever had this this kind of
situation but I I did I did this all the
time whenever the teacher would call
roll in class I'd be waiting for my name
to get called you know it's like okay do
I say here do I say present is my throat
clear am I gonna choke on it you know
and it's just like why am I so nervous
about this this is not something I
should be nervous about but it's just
because of the behavior of growing up as
a shy person and you know that kind of
leaks into the rest of the world too now
I was one of those really lucky people
when I was a young developer the team
that I worked on my management they
totally believed in training and
conferences so they would send me to
conferences all the time and it was
awesome
because I learned a lot of stuff every
presentation I went to I learned
something new and even it was something
I couldn't use right away gets filed in
the back of my mind for me to use it
later but
brakes and mealtimes were horrible
they're horrible because there's all
these people all around me people I
don't know and and what do I do I freeze
up right and and you don't want to just
like stand in the corner because that
makes you look pretty sad and pathetic
and we know we're sad and pathetic we
don't want to feel that way so of course
what we do instead is we pull out our
magic device right and I would do this I
would pull out my magic device and I
would love to say it's this device here
which is the one I carry today but in
reality this was many years ago and so
this is the magic device that I was
carrying back then I won't ask who's old
enough to remember those because you
probably have arthritis from that scroll
wheel scrolling scrolling scrolling that
was awesome though I love the scroll
wheel with a click it's great to know
that Apple brought that back with the
Apple watch so you've got the little
scroll wheel with the click it's awesome
so this is the device that I used and
the thing was as soon as I pulled this
device out I had a force field around me
right because now it looks like I'm
doing something productive because we're
all professionals in the industry so of
course we're constantly getting paged on
stuff because our work doesn't stop just
because we're somewhere else and so
obviously if I'm going like this there
must be something on fire at work right
and I better take care of it now so it
looks like I'm doing something busy and
productive so I don't just have to stand
there and look sad and pathetic which is
the way that I actually feel and I don't
want to talk about how many conferences
I went through where this was me and I
look back at it now with all of my
experiences of talking to new people and
and what I found out is that talking to
the other people the conference's is
almost as awesome as all of the good
presentations that are there sometimes
it's more awesome it depends on the
conference but I didn't realize how much
I was missing back then when I was
putting up my force field the other
thing that was just horrible was the
terror at mealtimes
now this events actually kind of cool
because they just kind of feed us all
day so we don't have to worry about this
but man you walk into the banquet room
and there's just all these tables right
and you see all these tables and you're
like where do I go and sit right and of
course I would go sit by myself but that
looks sad and pathetic right so I don't
want to go sit by myself so I try to
come up with some other way of you know
joining a conversation and so there's
times where I go in and you know kind of
look at the banquet room kind of scan
the room see who's already in there and
I'd see this group of people sitting at
this table having this really great
conversation and I'm like you know what
I'm gonna go up and sit at their table
they're already talking so there's no
pressure on me to talk and I can just
kind of listen and join in the
conversation once I have something
really witty to say right but then I go
and sit down I find out they're all from
the same company and all they're talking
about is how Jack never makes coffee
after the coffee pots empty right so
it's not a conversation that's useful to
me it's not a conversation I can join in
on and I've done that many times at
these babies conferences the other times
you know there's been times where I've
gone it's like oh well there's a table
with two people sitting there and having
a conversation I can go up and just kind
of sit and listen to the conversation
that's already going on and I've
actually done this and the people
sitting at the table we're talking in
Swedish which there's nothing wrong with
Swedish any Swedish people in the
audience okay cool I'm only gonna offend
about five people then but what I found
out is that as an American who of course
only knows English because that's the
way we are I found out that my childhood
did not prepare me to interact with
Swedish people as much as I thought it
did and apparently if you talked like
the Swedish Chef it's highly offensive
so the thing is you know and another
conversation I couldn't join in on and
and after you sit down at the table if
you find out it's a convert
you can't join it you can't just pick up
your plate and go somewhere else right
because now that just seems rude so
you're kind of stuck with whatever
situation you you start out with and
just to prove that there's nothing wrong
with Swedish people this guy's my friend
I have a Swedish friend who he's
actually speaking right now and another
so yeah Philipp Ekberg I'm looking
forward to talking to him I get to see
him like once a year so I actually get
to see him this week which is cool so
the thing is having to go through this
mealtime terror and just kind of putting
up my force field whenever things
whenever anything was happening it was
stressful and it was stressful just
because I didn't want to do the
interactions and again I really didn't
think that I was missing out on much I
wouldn't say that I was comfortable with
who I am but I'm an introvert right and
introverts are supposed to be that way
right no they're not because when people
talk about introverts and extroverts a
lot of times they say you know what
introverts are shy and extroverts are
outgoing and that's a manifestation of
behavior but that has nothing to do with
what being an introvert or an extrovert
actually means these are just behaviors
that come out of that what it means if
we're an introvert or an extrovert it
has to do with where we derive our
energy from when we're talking about
introverts we derive our energy
internally and so we're comfortable
being by ourselves having lunch with a
book having coffee with a couple of
friends and that's actually energizing
to us and because of that our industry
as developers attracts introverts why
because we're talking to the computer
all day we're solving problems all day
we're not interacting with people so
having that internal energy it's just
great for our environment if I'm going
to
sit down and problem-solve in front of
my computer all day now extroverts
divide their energy externally from
things going on outside of them so they
like a lot of activity they like a lot
of people around them and they find
actually sitting down and doing nothing
like an introvert would love to be
boring and it's actually draining and
that's what we really need to understand
now the behaviors that we have come out
of this because obviously if we're
comfortable being internal and kind of
by ourselves we're not going to develop
those social skills that make us
comfortable interacting with strangers
and that's okay but we can change that
and so just because we think about
introverts and extroverts as shy and
outgoing it doesn't mean that that's the
way that we have to behave and in fact I
I was in this is a spot that's in
Florida in the southern US and this is a
place that extroverts would love this is
just heaven for extroverts there's all
this activity going on there's all this
there you can't hear the music but
there's a bunch of music there's a bunch
of noise there's a bunch of people
there's a bunch of stuff going on and
this is awesome extroverts love that now
me as an introvert this was hell for me
because I'm just like okay okay make it
make it stop because again this is
draining and so basically if we can
recognize that we know that we're in
certain situations sometimes we need to
step out and take a few minutes to reset
and in fact I do that a lot especially
events like this where I do interact
with people because I want to I want to
take advantage of the situation so I
kind of spent my life up to a certain
point which is approximately six years
ago I won't tell you how old I am but
you can probably figure out that I'm
two-thirds Greybeards so that puts me
into a certain class of age so six years
ago really isn't that long ago as far as
my life is concerned
and I made this observation that changed
everything for me and I'm gonna pause on
that so you can think about how
important that is okay that's so I was
at a code camp which is a developer
event and I actually live in Southern
California which is nine time zones away
from here and it was at this big
beautiful University campus and at lunch
time again
lunch time stressful at those types of
events there was this big grassy quad
and it was awesome because I got in line
I got my tacos and then went out and
looked at this big grassy quad and I saw
developers just kind of scattered across
the lawn by themselves everybody's
sitting there eating by themselves and I
felt like you know what I think that I
could graph this and plot a uniform
distribution based on the way people are
sitting in the grass I mean that's how I
felt and you know what quite honestly
that was my first inclination too
because again that's my default state my
default state is let's go find a quiet
spot to sit down and have lunch but for
whatever reason I still don't know why I
think I looked at this scene and I just
found it kind of humorous I'm like
here's hundreds of people all in the
same place just sitting not talking to
each other and so I said you know what
I'm going to try something different and
so I found someone who is sitting by
themselves and they really were enjoying
their tacos and I just went up to them
and I said do you mind if I join you now
I wasn't quite this enthusiastic it was
more like this you know and what I found
over the years is people don't like to
be rude so most of the time if you say
do you mind if I join you
they'll say no I don't mind cuz what are
they gonna say well I don't want to I
don't like the way you look
you know so most of the time people will
say yes trying to think if anyone's ever
said no to me I'm sure it will happen
soon if it hasn't already and so sitting
down having conversation with just one
person that's not really a big deal but
what happened next is what made things
really really interesting because I sat
down said hey I'm Jeremy so what do you
do and he's like oh there's funny story
about that let me tell you about it and
we started talking and people came up
and joined us first one person came up
they sat down they listened to the
conversation for a little while then
another person came up and another
person and another person and slowly
they would come up they would sit down
they would listen and then they would
join the conversation and by the time
this lunch was over there were two
circles that had formed around us I
wasn't even looking at the person I
originally sat down with because our
conversation attracted more people to it
and thinking about that later I'm like
wow that was really cool so instead of
these twelve people actually think I
have 14 people up there stead of these
14 people sitting on their own having
lunch now we're all engaged in
conversation we're learning from each
other and so I started thinking about
you know so what's going on here and
that's when I had my realization my
lightbulb moment and that realization
was developers love to talk they love to
talk they will talk all day long but and
there is a very big but to this they
don't like to start the conversation
and I've seen this over and over and
over again developers love to talk and
why is that well it's because you got
two developers together and they're
gonna start talking about all of these
nerdy geeky stuff that they cannot talk
about with anybody else it's like my
significant other doesn't understand any
of this right my cat doesn't care Hey
look I found someone who cares about
piss let's talk and that's the way it is
we'd love to talk we just don't like to
start the conversation and so I started
thinking about well why is that why is
there this problem of people who just
love to interact but just won't do it
and again the problem is it's that
initial fear because we all have fear
that's that's the what if you know what
if there's an earthquake right again you
know what if a plane crashes while I'm
doing this you know and it's not always
rational fear but in this case when
we're talking about interacting with
people there's definitely a fear of the
unknown because again as an introvert
I've exhibited shy behavior over the
years this is what I'm used to this is
what I'm comfortable with and I I'm not
exactly sure what's going to happen when
I start to step outside of those things
that that I know when I'm comfortable
with there's also fear of rejection
right now I did say most people are
polite and that's true but there's
always that fear that maybe this
person's gonna think there's something
wrong with me right if I don't talk to
them they won't think that there's
something wrong with me if I do talk to
them there's a possibility that they
will and then of course there's a fear
of failure as well I'm putting myself
out there I'm taking a risk what happens
if that risk comes up bad right and so
these are the things that really hold us
back
and
I'm not gonna say that this ever goes
away a hundred percent because I don't
really like to lie to people because
quite honestly I still have this fear
you know that people are just gonna say
hey that Jeremy guy he's kind of a
doofus isn't he yeah what a dork now the
difference is that I think I'm old
enough now that I just don't care about
that anymore
I'm fine with being a dork I'm fine with
not being perfect I'm fine with people
thinking that I'm a little weird
hopefully not too weird but a little
weird is fine so these are the things
that that really hold us back now I have
kind of continued that observation since
that at that first lunch and I've seen
this over and over again whether I met a
user group maybe a local meet up maybe
at a big conference maybe at a regional
event this is actually a photo that was
taken at a local code camp and I guess
it's okay for me to use because I stole
it off of their website and it has me in
it so I'm using it but this is just kind
of the the quad area before the event
was starting one day and you can see
there's a lot of conversations going on
there and kind of what I've seen over
and over again when I'm part of an
active conversation which is very common
for me now
is that there'll be a developer who
comes up and kind of spots a
conversation that's happening and of
course we're human so we want to be
involved in a conversation it's just you
know we want to be social that's just
kind of part of who we are as people
we're social creatures and so we'll spot
this conversation going on there like
maybe I can sneak up and join that and
so you kind of creep up to the circle
and you enter the listening phase where
you're just listening to the
conversation that's going on now again
we're still we're still fearful we still
don't know if these people are going to
accept us or reject us but right now we
don't have much invested in it right
it's one of those things it's like the
people that are down here in the front
row next to the door if they need to
leave they can
right whereas these people back in the
back corner it's tough for you guys to
get out of the room so there's not much
invested at this point so we enter that
listening phase okay can I follow along
with this conversation are they talking
about something that maybe I have
something to add and then the next step
is that we'll put out some kind of an
exploratory comment just to see if we're
going to be accepted by the group you
know maybe it's commenting on you know
someone was talking about an xkcd comic
that they saw the other day and of
course we all read xkcd and if you don't
you should because it's a little too
much like real life so we'll put out
that exploratory comment to see if we're
gonna be accepted by the group you know
and if we say something really weird and
we get that look like then we know we're
probably not yes let's go ahead and step
away
but we haven't risked too much yet but
if we are accepted then we become a full
part of the conversation and I have just
seen this happen over and over and over
again
I've watched developers go through this
process now you've probably noticed that
I've been saying developers rather than
introverts and there are extrovert
developers out there but again because
of the nature of our industry it
attracts introverts so kind of the
stereotype of the introvert developer
yeah that's pretty true so when we
become the full part of the conversation
you know now we're part of the group and
that's really cool stuff and so this is
what I've seen over and over again so
I've been thinking about okay so people
have this fear people love to talk and
people kind of go through this process
of trying to join in existing
conversation how do we just start a
conversation when there isn't one going
and that's where things get really easy
and really hard because at this point
I'm going to tell you starting
conversation from a technical standpoint
it's the simplest thing in the world
it's the simplest thing in the world but
it's also completely and totally
terrifying completely and totally
terrifying and that doesn't ever 100% go
away either because we all have those
those fears so let me go let me show you
the three simple steps that I do to get
a conversation started and this actually
works
more times than it should step number
one is I go up to somebody and I say I'm
Jeremy hi how you doing and again I kind
of rely on the politeness of people and
so usually they'll respond with their
name tell me who they are if they don't
say anything at all okay maybe I won't
continue the conversation but again most
people are polite and they don't want to
be seen as rude so they'll respond and
then the next question is so what do you
do and I would say probably about six
times out of ten the response to this
question is I'm a developer I'm like
okay yes we are at a developer event I
kind of figured there's a pretty good
chance of that could you be more
specific
and I'll actually move on to talk to ask
what kind of technologies are you
working with what are the things that
make you excited what works well what
doesn't work well
hey you're working on something that I'm
not working with tell me about it I want
to know all about this stuff
and with those three simple steps man I
have started so many conversations so
many conversations so many conversations
that I am amazed that it even works
because again that's not me that's not
my nature
and again I try to think yes I am a shy
person but that's because I spent many
decades of my life acting like a shy
person but because I'm an introvert that
doesn't mean that I have to be shy
because shyness is a behavior and
behavior can be changed and that's
really what I focused on behavior can be
changed now I'm not going to change the
fact that I'm an introvert I will always
be an introvert and I'm fine with that
and I want to try to learn more about it
so that I can take full advantage of
that but that also means that in going
through that process I try to figure out
okay what do I have to do to make sure
that I keep my energy up while I'm still
interacting with people so that shyness
can be changed and when you start doing
this it is terrifying completely and
totally terrifying for some people it's
debilitating and for me it's actually
pretty close to debilitating just
because again that's that's the way that
I've spent most of my life but the thing
is it gets easier because each time we
have a successful conversation each time
we make a connection with another person
that's now positive feedback in my world
because quite honestly if I had tried
this and failed five times out of 10 I
would have given up on it a long long
time ago because I am NOT someone who
takes failure easily and I would have
said you know what this totally isn't
worth it it works half the time forget
that but what I found is that it works
like nine times out of 10 that means if
I go around I'm at an event like this I
try to start 10 conversations nine of
them actually go somewhere and that
tenth one that doesn't go anywhere
fizzles out that's not a big deal to me
anymore because I've had nine successes
when I have a 90% success rate that's
awesome
the other thing that makes it easier is
I only do this at developer events
I don't talk to people at the airport I
don't talk to people at the bank I don't
talk to people at the supermarket I only
do this at developer events and one
reason is because it's easier to do this
to developer events because I can
guarantee that if we look at everybody
who's here
we all have at least two things in
common first we love technology second
we want to learn so everybody that's
here the hundreds and hundreds of people
that are here we all have these two
things in common so we have a starting
point for a conversation and that's what
makes it easy because again
developers love to talk about technology
once you get them started so if if
you're here it's like hey so what cool
stuff have you seen so far hey you know
what this morning Jeremy did this
awesome presentation on how to become a
social developer let me tell you about
it right I'm hoping you guys will do
that today you guys don't sound too
hopeful well you don't seem convinced
yet so let me tell you about the
benefits that I've come across and again
these are benefits that I've seen
personally this isn't stuff that I'm
making up this isn't stuff that I'm
reading in a book in fact I have done as
little research as is possible on this
subject all of this is just based on my
observations and interacting with people
over you know about 6 years of time and
I've I've seen it so many times that I'm
pretty convinced that this is real and
maybe I should talk to a real person
who's actually studied it and they can
tell me where I'm wrong so that's
something that I'll have to look into in
the future but for now I try to think
about the benefits because a big one is
the technologies that we can interact
with because especially when weird
events like this it's really easy to
feel inadequate because realistically I
can know this much of the technology
that's out there
right there's just too much to learn we
can't learn at all
and it's really easy to look out there
especially if you you know there's maybe
someone you follow on Twitter it's like
man this guy's always tweeting really
cool stuff about this particular topic
he must just be really a genius
or you know what this woman just I can't
believe what she does with document
databases she's just a genius in this
area she must just be a genius and
everything but the reality is were not
all geniuses and everything we know our
little bit of technology and some of us
go wide and some of us go deep and you
know it's all kind of a little bit
different but each time I talk to
somebody new I can interact with someone
who's working with different
technologies that I'm working with maybe
they're working with the same
technologies that I'm working with but
they're using them in different ways and
what I find is that the more people I
talk to the more touch points I get into
the various worlds of technology and I
never come across that one person who
knows everything because that person
doesn't exist you look at the speakers
that are talking this week I don't know
everything
as a speaker I will be glad to admit
that and and I know the other speaker so
I can feel free to talk for them too so
the thing is each time we talk to
somebody now I get a touch point into
this area for example I am totally not
in the JavaScript world that's just not
my world but I know people who are in
the JavaScript world so that I know that
if I have a problem come up and I'm like
you know what I remember I was hearing
man talk something about this
I should really ask him if this is the
right tool for the particular scenario
that I just ran across or you know what
I don't do any mobile development at all
I don't do native I don't do hybrid I
don't do web apps I've seen it off of
them to know kind of what they are but
if I have a problem come up I know the
guy to call I'm gonna call up my buddy
try and say hey try mister mobile let me
run something by you see what you think
so because I have all of these contacts
I don't have to know everything
which is really a relief because I can't
know everything so it's great because I
have all of these people that I can talk
to just to just figure out hey what's
the right tool for the job because I'm
all about the right tool for the job
so I have a challenge for you now at the
beginning I said this is not a highly
interactive workshop that was not a lie
but I want the rest of the conference to
be highly interactive for you so this is
my challenge and I did my challenge in
the form of code because I wanted to
keep your interest as developers so of
course we've already kicked off this
method attend NDC Oslo and we want to
maximize the amount of Awesome we get
returned from this so here's what I'm
going to do first of all since we're in
Norway
we're gonna have some jumper float is
that right how close was I way far away
jumper flawed
closer worse this is why I speak English
badly thank you so we want to maximize
the amount of Awesome that we have and
so really what I want you to do is I
want you to meet someone new because
every time we have a successful
interaction with somebody are awesome
increases and if you do that over and
over and over this week you're gonna
find out that you know what there's a
whole bunch of awesome that we're
getting from the presentations but
there's a whole bunch more awesome that
we can get from the people that are here
there are a lot of people here and there
are a lot of people here with different
experiences and quite honestly I would
expect there's at least one person here
who can completely change your life I
don't expect that you'll necessarily
find them but it's worth a try so that
so throughout this week I want you to go
through and try to meet as many people
as possible talk to them start those
conversations get the benefits out of
them now I do have some tips for you
that will hopefully make some of this
easier the first tip is turn off your
forcefield when you're in between
sessions yeah of course we have to check
our device to make sure that nothing's
on fire back home right make sure that
our
are happy and everything but as soon as
you verified that put your device away
turn off your force field because quite
honestly if you have your force field on
nobody's going to come up and talk to
you but without your force field on even
if you're looking sad and pathetic
there's a chance that someone will come
up and talk to you and you can actually
have a good conversation and in fact I I
wear this shirt intentionally to try to
start conversations it's worked a couple
times I love the shirt just shy not
antisocial you can talk to me and if
you'd like to get one of these this is
actually from the xkcd store I ran
across it completely by accident one day
so and I'm like that is the perfect
shirt for me so number one thing you can
do
turn off your force field people will
not approach you if you have an man if
you've got a laptop open this is like an
invisibility cloak right because now you
really look like you're doing something
important right and not just playing I'm
skipping ahead apparently and it looks
like we're doing really something really
important and not just playing what's
the latest goat simulator the one goats
in space so yeah that's what I do so
that's one thing we can do the next
thing is skip ahead
not necessarily skip ahead yourself but
help other people skip ahead in the
progression that we talked about earlier
so we have this progression where let's
say we are part of a conversation
already and someone does approach our
circle and they kind of go into that
listening phase and they're just kind of
waiting for that spot to inject their
witty comments so that they can see if
they'll be accepted and they can join
our circle
don't make them go through that as soon
as someone comes up to join your circle
if you have a circle going welcome them
say hey I'm Jeremy here's my friends who
are you what do you want No
just introduce yourself make them feel
huh and in fact I'm gonna go back to
this picture because this picture is one
where I was specifically doing that now
first of all in this picture I'm the I I
look monstrously tall in this picture I
guess I am monstrously tall but I really
look monstrously tall in this picture
and I actually remember this because I
was having a conversation with some
friends of mine Justin and Bill and this
this third guy came up and you know kind
of crept up to the circle and as soon as
he got close enough I said hi I'm Jeremy
this is Justin this is Bill how you
doing and actually got him involved in
the conversation so you know I talked
about comedic Lee you know like grabbing
someone by the lapels and dragging them
into the conversation but you know in a
nice way just make people feel welcome
so we can help people skip ahead and you
know get through that progression
problem and actually do have some tips
for solving the terror at mealtimes
again we don't really have that problem
as much here at this conference since we
just have all this awesome food all day
which is really great let's go sample
some some stuff in the meantime but
there's a couple things that we can do
first of all recognize your captive
audience when you are standing in line
somewhere you now have a captive
audience this is where I start most of
my conversations now unfortunately the
registration line this morning went way
too fast because I have had some awesome
conversations and registration lines
just waiting for you know to go through
the process
same thing waiting to get to the buffet
and you know what's even better about
this is when we have a captive audience
now we have a third thing in common
right it's not just we love technology
and we want to learn it's also I want to
get to the food or I want to get to the
beer I want to get to whatever so now
we've got a third thing in common and
I've started a lot of conversations in
in lines and
you know quite honestly like I said it
doesn't ever get easy and maybe that's
just me
hopefully it is just me because I would
love to think that this becomes easy for
everybody it's still hard for me to
start conversations and if you put me
into an environment like let's say the
expo hall I have a lot of trouble kind
of finding somewhere to anchor to go up
and start a conversation with somebody
because there's just kind of people
milling around and I I feel kind of
awkward just kind of walking up to
somebody who's just standing there and
starting conversations so I love the
captive audience because you know what
again what's our investment in this well
we're standing in line we're gonna have
to stand in line until until we get to
whatever our goal is and so just during
those few minutes let me go ahead and
start this conversation with somebody
and I have somebody who isn't gonna walk
away they're not waiting for a friend
they're obviously in the same line that
I'm in and so I find it really easy to
do that now I am working on you know how
do I become more comfortable talking to
people in you know like reception type
situations I don't have any tips for you
because I'm not comfortable with I said
and I'm not afraid to say that it's okay
to not know everything right is that
okay okay now see there is another
advantage especially if you have a
buffet line at a conference or another
event like that is when you make a
friend in the line now you have somebody
to sit with this has worked for me so
many times at so many events because now
I'm no longer walking into the big con
into the big banquet room by myself now
I'm walking in with a friend it's great
because now you can say hey let's go
find a table to sit together and again
most of the time that works sometimes
they want to go join their co-workers or
sometimes they'll say hey would you like
to come and join me in my coworkers
that's even better
but now we're not just walking into that
situation completely completely on our
own so I this is
do I seem a little overexcited about
some of this it's just because it's
worked so well and it's become such an
important part of my life as a developer
just meeting all of these people now I
did get one great piece of advice from
Jeff Fritz he works for Microsoft and he
says what he does when he walks into one
of these banquet rooms is he looks for a
table where there's two people kind of
not sitting next to each other you know
maybe they're kind of a a couple seats
apart and then he goes in any forms the
third corner of the triangle because he
figures okay if one person doesn't want
to talk there's probably a good chance
that the other person might I've just
doubled my odds of starting conversation
and again if you can get that
conversation going it's going to attract
more people and oh man yeah I just think
about all of the the great interactions
that I've had doing this and the thing
is you never know which of those
conversations are going to turn into
something bigger because what I'll find
is you know at a typical conference
that's you know three four or five days
long
I might have conversations with maybe 1t
people that I've never met before you
know I try to reconnect with people that
I know to you know make sure that my
relationships keep going but I also try
to meet a lot of new people and most of
us most of those don't turn into longer
relationships but sometimes they do and
I'm always kind of surprised at which
ones do because it's you know that
person that I had breakfast with on the
first day and for whatever reason I keep
running into that person over and over
throughout the week and we just stop and
chat and we might have lunch and we
might have a hallway conversation at
some point and in fact I didn't expect
that he was going to be in the room but
mr. David Neal who's in the front row is
one of those people that I've had this
experience with you know meet we met
last year at a conference and again I
think it just started out with a meal
during one of the the days I think it
was breakfast pretty close to the
beginning of the conference and we just
kept running into each other throughout
the week and we even had one of those
great hallway conversations you know
where you kind of skip a session and
just talk to somebody so a great David's
taking a picture of himself so not quite
sure what to think about that because we
have a narcissist down in the fair so
the thing is you never know which of
those conversations turn into something
longer and you know now I can make fun
of him in a foreign country right
David's a good guy but we live what like
3,000 miles apart right because I'm I'm
in California on the west coast and
you're in Georgia right which is on the
east coast of the United States which is
still very far away from here another
person is Phillip Ekberg like I
mentioned I met him about four years ago
at an event kind of kept running into
him over and over at that event and
we've kept in touch over the years and
it's weird because these people that you
meet and maybe you see them once a year
because you're just at the same event
once a year Phillips one of those people
because he lives in Sweden he lived in
Australia for a while and I've never
been to either of those countries but he
would come to the United States for a
Microsoft event and so I get to see him
once a year and the interesting thing is
when you see people in person that you
haven't talked to you but you form these
relationships you pick up the
conversations like they never left off
and that's something that still amazes
me because it's like you know what we
haven't talked for a year but I'm still
comfortable talking to you and I feel
like we haven't been apart that long and
of course we keep in touch over social
media and things like that but you know
kind of that in-person communication is
really important and in fact over the
years I've formed relationships with
quite a few people and these are just
people that I pulled off of my my
Twitter feed the people I follow on
Twitter it's not an exhaustive list but
these are like 37 people that I know
because I talked to them and in
event conversation turned into something
bigger and that's something that again
it's really hard for me to understand
that because I'm not a social person I'm
not it's just not my nature but I've
somehow become that person and it is
this really ugly side effect because I
have become that guy I've become that
guy so I was in a first time I
experienced this I was at an event
sitting around a table talking to five
or six people and I know everybody
that's in our circle so I assume that
everybody knows everybody else because
obviously if I know you you must be
important that other people know you too
because I don't just know people
randomly right but what I found out is
you know have any conversation it's like
oh you've never met him before
oh you don't know her and I'm the person
who does the introductions I'm the
person who does the introductions that's
not right
I'm not that person I have a friend that
I worked with for many years and she was
one of those kind of bubbly social
people that did this by default right
and I worked at the Disneyland Resort
which just was an awesome place to work
but we have 20,000 people on site okay
it's a lot of people in this one little
area and we would just wander across the
property and just come across somebody
she's like hey Steve how's your son Jeff
doing and I'm like how do you know him
and how do you know he has a son and she
was just one of those people that would
you know collect all this information
and hang on to it and again that's not
me I'm completely the opposite I have
trouble remembering your name after you
said it three minutes ago and in fact I
do I end up apologizing because I speak
quite a bit and so I'll meet the same
people over and over again and it's like
okay your face looks familiar
I'm sorry I don't remember your name and
so my standard line that I've come up
with is
have to meet you five times before I
remember which I know is not polite but
I at something I need to work on is
figuring out how can I remember people's
names so I can go forward what I really
wanted was I really wanted Google glass
to work right because I would love
Google glass to say this is Jeff you
last saw him three months ago at this
event
I'd be like Bing okay I remember that
now I would love that maybe contact
lenses that aren't too intrusive so I'm
still waiting for that technology but I
found out that for the people that I I
to know I'm like oh okay oh yeah this is
Debra she lives in the Bay Area and she
knows all about angular oh this is
Phillip you know he lives in Sweden and
he's been working on a bunch of xamarin
stuff he does some async/await stuff oh
oh yeah Ike's from San Diego and he
deals with sequel server he knows
everything about sequel server oh Barry
yeah Barry's from Phoenix and he does
really cool stuff with unit testing and
TDD
oh yeah and what about Adam oh yeah Adam
works for Microsoft and he he he's doing
a lot of cool stuff with like uwp and
hololens and stuff like that I'm
introducing these people to each other
that is so not me but it's a really cool
ugly side effect and in fact I've made
use of it quite a bit because now what I
found myself doing is connecting other
people so I'm gonna point to Maggie
there's Maggie pine right there so I met
her at a conference and we first time I
met her we just had a little chat I met
her at another conference a couple
months later and we ended up having a
longer hallway conversation because the
session we wanted to go into was packed
full and neither of us wanted to stand
up the whole time so you ended up having
like this hour-long conversation and
during that time I found out she is
totally into problems with date/time she
knows all about the scheduling stuff and
she's like yeah so I've run into this
and this and this and this and I'm like
I know the perfect person to hook you up
with and that person is Matt Johnson
Matt Johnson is mr. date-time and I knew
him for
interacting with him for years he lived
in Phoenix for a while then he moved up
to work for Microsoft and he was at that
conference - and I'm like let me hook
you up with Matt and boy those people
talked nerdy stuff about date/time like
you would not believe man time zones and
daylight savings time all that stuff oh
man
but what's really cool about that is
because now you know I consider these
people my friends Maggie's actually
gotten involved in the some of the open
source projects that go around date time
and so she's through Matt has kind of
gotten into a whole nother world that
she now blames me for which I will take
credit for that you know it's like yeah
that's great I hooked two people up
I made somebody's life bigger that's
awesome and I've been able to do that
several times and so I don't know how I
became that person I really don't it
wasn't planned that's for sure because
if someone said Jeremy you're going to
be the social coordinator at this event
I'd be like hmm no I'm not that's not
gonna happen I can tell you that right
now but for whatever reason this has
just kind of happened organically
because I made this decision that I'm
going to step outside of my comfort zone
face some of my fears and you know
specifically in an environment where I
know I have at least two things in
common with everybody in this room I can
be comfortable talking to them and so
now I you know that fear has really
turned into fearlessness now I'm not
going to say fearless meaning without
any fear its fearless as in I have less
fear again for me it hasn't completely
gone away but here's the thing nobody is
safe from me anymore because for example
when I was a young programmer the loner
of the conference I would go and see
these presenters
and I'm like oh this guy must be super
guru he's up on the stage he's telling
me really cool things and it's
influencing the way I'm developing and
that's really cool and I've made I've
made decisions on directions I want to
go based on what this person said I'm
really happy about that and years later
I had a chance to talk to some of these
people in person and I'm like ah you
know what I'm gonna go up and introduce
myself I'm gonna say you know what you
have no idea who I am but I went and saw
you speak back in 2009 and you talked
about this and this and this and that
influenced my decisions to what I'm
doing today and I just want to say thank
you for that and because I'm not afraid
to go up and look like an idiot I can do
that and some of those people have
actually turns into peers and colleagues
now so you never know where it's going
to go now if you do want to continue
this conversation I do have a website
which is called becoming a social
developer.com and what I'm trying to do
is encourage other developers to do this
I want people to start talking to each
other I want people to start sharing the
awesome experiences that they're having
so that other people will be encouraged
to do it as well and I'm looking for
nice comfortable ways of introducing
this so if you have any ideas head out
to the website and there's some links
send me your ideas because I want to
share those because I have some ideas
they're not great based on my personal
experience they've worked but I know
other people have ideas that I don't
because again I don't know everything
there you go
I said it I don't know everything so I
want to hear from people who are having
different experiences or who have
different ideas and approaches because
one of the things I'm concerned about is
I want to make sure that we're safe
during this communication because just
like I warned you guys at the beginning
this is not an interactive workshop the
reason I said that is because if I ever
see that in a conference session
description I don't go in
because you know what I want to have
control over my own interactions that's
us
I I don't want to go into a room where
people are forcing me to interact I
don't want that I want control over them
myself so knowing how I am I want to
make sure that I approach this in a way
that other people will be comfortable
with as well which is why I didn't force
you to turn to your neighbor and
introduce yourselves you can decide
whether you'd like to do that on your
way out or not but I'll leave that up to
you
so let's just kind of review what we've
seen
first of all shyness is normal for
introverts but it's a behavior
it's not something that's innate in us
it's something that we've learned based
again on some of the you know if we
derive our energy internally we don't
really have that motivation to go out
and learn those interaction skills and
so shy becomes comfortable but because
shy is a behavior it can be changed and
one way is by talking to developers
because developers love to talk again
it's our outlet to talk about nerdy
things that nobody else wants to talk
about and it's not always development
stuff you know sometimes we'll end up
talking about nerdy Star Trek stuff -
okay
or Settlers of Catan that's another one
that people love - yeah apparently we've
got at least one of those in the room
yeah you know who you are so this is
like the place where we find those
people right so let's talk because we do
love to talk and then here's my three
simple steps to starting conversation
I'm Jeremy again I rely on politeness of
people to respond with their names what
do you do again expect for them to say
I'm a developer that's fine move on to
the next step so what kind of
technologies are you working with what's
making you excited these days
and it doesn't have to be like what
you're doing at work as a career it
could be a hobby stuff you know people
are doing really cool stuff with Arduino
which I know nothing about
I built the world's saddest robot at a
workshop but other than that that's not
my world so I love seeing cool stuff
that's people too and so this is just a
really easy way to start a conversation
and remember the
week we are in a safe place we all have
two things in common we love technology
and we want to learn so we are in a safe
place you know that about every single
person that's here and then just kind of
some tips
turn off your force field again feel
free to pull it out make sure nothing's
on fire but as soon as you've done that
put it away
turn off your force field if you are in
a conversation and you see other people
trying to join the circle be welcoming
invite them in don't make them go
through that process of standing around
listening awkwardly and hopefully that
the hoping that they can inject
something into the conversation bring
them in make them feel welcome and of
course if there is a line if you're
waiting in line for beer or food or
something else now you have a third
thing in common captive audiences are
really really really easy to talk to and
I hopefully I've gotten across the
benefits I have seen these benefits in
my in my life
in my career they have changed my career
they have changed how I think about
things they've opened up whole new
worlds for me new technologies new ideas
new challenges and of course a ton of
new friends
so with that I'm going to repeat the
challenge meet somebody new do it as
many times as you can while you here
this week you're gonna find some of
those relationships that will continue
throughout the week you'll be surprised
by those you'll find some relationships
that continue once you get back home and
hopefully you'll be very pleasantly
surprised by those so meet someone new
do it as many times as you can if you
want to practice I will be here all week
so feel free to practice on me I have no
problems at all with that because that
makes it easier for me if people come up
to me then I don't have to start the
conversation hey so that's kind of
selfish but yes feel free to practice on
me and so that's what I have for you
today so to some talk if you do have any
questions again I'm going to be around
for the week if you head out to my
website
these slides as well as the link to the
becoming a social developer website and
of course if you want to tweet really
awesome things about me I'm at Jeremy
bytes or if you just want to follow or
continue conversations later on I'd
appreciate that so with that just one
more reminder on your way out make sure
to drop one of the evaluation cards in a
bucket to let people know how well I'm
doing or how badly I'm doing depending
on how much you enjoyed this hour and
thank you for coming and please please
please meet somebody new this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
