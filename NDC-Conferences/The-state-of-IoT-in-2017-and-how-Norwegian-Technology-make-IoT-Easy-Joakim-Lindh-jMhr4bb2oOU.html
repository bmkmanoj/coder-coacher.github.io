want to talk to you about IOT and
specifically Norwegian technology and
how them actually makes IOT simple
my name is Joakim Glynn I am IOT tech
lead at a company called web step
previously I worked for the company
called Texas Instruments where I was an
embedded C software developer so that's
my background I work with embedded
connectivity solutions sort of within
Internet of Things
now I moved on to kind of that the
higher level of the software realm where
most of the people that this conference
actually work within to try to combine
what is you know the hardware the the
kind of nodes IOT stuff that's out there
combine that with the cloud solutions
that become more and more popular so I'm
going to go through this talk give you a
couple of examples talk a little bit
about my experience what I've seen when
working with customers all around the
world kind of the tips and tricks so try
to feed you with some portion of
thoughts in in the hopes of inspiring
you and also make you understand why
software is the key for the Internet of
Things and why software developers are
really really important for the future
so let's start with definition what is
Internet of Things depending on who you
ask you're going to get different types
of answers you're going to get different
depths of the answer I like to keep
things simple simple as possible for me
in terms of things is the digitalization
of the physical world and by that I mean
that you take something in the real
world and you represent it in a digital
form simple as that so if we take a
simplified architecture of internal
things I like to talk about
a node that could be for example a
sensor that measures humidity
temperature pressure whatever in the
real world that information is sent up
to some sort of gateway now depending on
how you send the data there's different
types of gateways you have like telecom
base station if you for example think
about cig Fox and BLT Laura you have
those kind of solutions or it's your
smart phone that connects to this sensor
then we talk about Wi-Fi Bluetooth
Bluetooth Low Energy
or it could be proprietary solution now
proprietary solution is more often used
when you want to get full robustness and
absolute minimal power consumption I'm
going to show an example on just that
then comes the interesting part which is
why I actually moved in from the hard
world into the software all because at
the cloud that's where the interesting
stuff happens the this is the place
where the data comes in this is the
place where you can store the data you
can do analysis on the data you can do
predictions into the future and you can
actually control based on the decisions
and decisions made in the cloud today we
don't control that much from the cloud
today we simply represent data in a
visualized way for people to that then
can do things manually in the future
we'll be able to look back this
information out to nuts sensors but
something called actuators and then you
have the full loop from the physical
world into a smart system and back out
to the real world again and why is so
many companies interested in this ilt I
mean the concept ilt if you really look
at the definition of it it's been going
on since the 60s
but why are people so interesting
interested in this now partly it's
because of Moore's law but I'm going to
talk a bit about that later but let's
just look at some some numbers so
Gartner they stated that in 2020 30
billion devices are going to be
connected forbes cisco ericsson
they also give their own statements
about this cisco actually states 50
billion devices that six more than
actual people on the earth six times
more so in general we're 7.5 billion
people today we're 7.7 around 2020 so
that's a lot of devices it's going to be
connected and if you look at the actual
market for this if you google IOT you're
going to get a lot of answers on smart
homes and that's the most common example
because it's easy to relate to as a
person it's most easiest way to relate
to in terms of things by thinking about
security at home home automation things
like that but when I look at Internet of
Things I see some other parts which are
more interesting this chart shows some
other interesting areas for example in
manufacturing we talked about optimizing
a process to make it either low cost or
to simplify it and if you think about it
if you autumn eyes a process and make
things really low cost to produce and if
it's not dependent on actual labor costs
anymore you can bring back a lot of
manufacturing that is now done in for
example China or whatever in the world
you can bring that back into Norway
Sweden or whatever you want to do the
manufacturing because it's not about
labor costs anymore if you think about
health care and wellness think about
elderly home think about the person who
works there think about all the
administrative stuff they need to do
hand out pills keep track of things what
if with IOT we can make dog those things
automated and the people who work there
could instead be out with old people
holding them in their hands and
listening to their stories so it's not
about just removing jobs which a lot of
people are actually afraid of it's about
also redefining the type of jobs that
people will do so there's a lot of
interesting things going on when we look
at the market not only smart homes and
and drones and cool stuff this is
probably the last business slide I show
but I just want to make you understand
the value of Internet buildings and how
you create the value so you talk about
something called value chain that means
you take something raw and you run that
through a pipe and that turns into
business value so in IOT sense you would
go from sensing something for example
with hardware going up to the cloud
doing some some sort of storing
analyzing making decisions controlling
which is more software related so you go
from hardware to software to
monetization from a business business
model standpoint the story is a bit
different because this is how the
business models would look like as well
but for IOT it's a different concept
because it becomes more complex and
multi-dimensional so instead of value
chain we talk about something called
value network instead where companies
you know Co produce the actual value
that's kind of interesting it also
creates something called Museum of
partners you're going to see that if you
go to website you're going to see
partners you're going to see like a big
list of partners and I don't think they
actually maintained it connections with
all of those partners so that's kind of
an interesting part of it but let's get
a little bit more technical I want to
talk about the technical challenges so I
was as I said working worldwide before
in a large corporation I work with
customers and I often stumbled across
one of the main challenges when they
designed the IOT products IOT solutions
from the node perspective typically you
have a small arm processor that runs on
a small coin cell battery so you are
when you write the code when you write
the solution for the node itself you're
very limited to the actual code you can
write these things typically runs on 128
kilobytes of flash with like 82
kilobytes of RAM so everything needs to
be very optimized but you can optimize
it too much because you need to be able
to do software upgrades you need to be
able to do monitoring run diagnostics
things like that so that's a big
challenge from the node perspective
adding to that you have obviously the
connectivity which I'm going to touch in
a little bit more detail later but you
have the challenge of choosing the right
technology as we will see most of these
solutions that enable connectivity
talking to connectivity today they
actually are software programmable so
even though the radio front-end itself
is hard where you can buy software
change between for example Bluetooth SIG
be Wi-Fi that become becomes more and
more enabled out there in the world even
though interoperability is still a big
challenge if you have a bluetooth
product it doesn't matter it actually
can connect to your phone there's a lot
of problems with interoperability and
obviously security security is the main
topic and you probably heard as multiple
times during this conference about the
the attack last October with the Mirai
botnet where somebody actually through a
our C channel orchestra as an attack
against dine with a DNS provider and
they actually used IOT or IOT devices to
do this
VCRs things like that somebody stated
connected vibrators and you know people
actually blame a lot of different kind
of IOT devices but in the end it's just
devices that yeah haven't changed the
default password on but there's a lot of
problems with security and one funny
thing is there's a catch phrase for when
you talk about IOT you often say that
the s in IOT stands for security have
you heard that before
yeah and it's kind of true it is true in
the network sense so you have the node
maybe you've been able to complete all
these steps from the network perspective
you have complexity and the complexity I
mean by that is you need to maintain a
lot of different nodes typically these
networks maintain different type of
protocols and this need to be robust
this is like the bottleneck in the
system so there's a lot of challenges
connectivity interoperability and
security are actually the top-rated
technical challenges in the cloud
however things are a bit different
because in the cloud you have infinite
processing infinite storage sort of so
the problem there becomes another
discussion there instead we talk about
the amount of things going in and what
speed they have into the cloud so this
is actually I'm starting on the
definition of big data here which
applies to the cloud so you talk about
the speed the volume how much data comes
in the variety is what kind of different
data comes in to your system and finally
can you actually trust this data that
goes into the system and you need to be
able to do live processing you need to
be able to handle historical data and
also typically you run predictions which
is why cloud is actually ramping up
significantly now if you look at
different providers now why are people
actually going from cloud sorry on
premise solutions they have their own
server rooms but they go over to cloud
why is that it's because it's a lot
cheaper and it allows you to ramp up the
time to market is really small its
scalable I mean when your network needs
to grow you do it by software and it's
secure
many people they actually say that they
don't dare to go to cloud because of the
gdpr and the things going on but that is
the reason why you should go to the
cloud well you should deploy your code
at the cloud so as the service is
becoming more and more interesting where
you put a lot more of your things on the
cloud solution instead and you have
redundancy and so forth so let's take a
look at the big players there used to be
four big players that we talked about so
Amma Amazon Microsoft Google IBM when it
comes to the cloud offering and people
going to these solutions iBM has been
ramping down a bit and I think that's
because they've put a lot of focus on
their cut
native computing with the Watson pepper
and all those things while Amazon
Microsoft and Google has put in a lot of
effort and I dare to say that actually
Microsoft is dependent on assur going
gold otherwise they're going to have big
problems as a company and if you look at
from an IOT perspective this is
interesting if you look at what these
three guys are providing Google
Microsoft Amazon they're providing on a
paper they're providing the exact same
things all of them has storage they have
some sort of IOT hub
it's called IOT hub in Microsoft is
called IOT core in Google it's called
just IOT in Amazon it is it's just a
bi-directional kind of hub that allows
you to do provisioning and security as
well they all provide some sort of edge
have you heard about the expression fog
any of you know okay
some of you fog is cloud it's a part of
the cloud that actually executes out in
the network or in the node that means
that if you have downtime you can do
some of the processing that you usually
do in the cloud you can do that out in
the edge so therefore they call it fog
but it's kind of interesting how these
guys actually release how many of you do
get newsletters from Amazon about their
new services yeah one two three that's
quite interesting because you can wake
up in the morning you open the email is
like BAM this much new services and two
days later BAM it's new services I
attended a training yesterday that
Amazon actually arranged and the guy was
there was Technical Evangelist even he
couldn't keep track of all the services
and new stuff that they actually add to
the to Derek cloud solution so imagine
the people who need to choose between
these and try to figure out which
actually services to use varieties it's
quite simple though anyhow let's move on
from cloud and take a look at the
evolution of Internet of Things I'm
going to give you a concrete example
shortly but I just
first refer to this Michael Lee Porter
created is a really nice article about
Internet of Things and see the title
down here about you know the future of
IOT and how products change and so if I
talk about a coffee machine that's a
product you have to display on it and
you have a smart product a coffee
machine can tell you it's time to fill
up the beans or you can see a display
when it's time to clean the machine so
forth you add connectivity to it and all
of a sudden you can get a notification
when it's time to buy new beans or you
can for example have it order it by
itself you can also for example enable
it so that when your alarm rings in the
morning it actually makes your coffee so
it's ready for you moving on we have
something called product system which
means that you start connecting things
to your coffee machine that could be I
don't know a milk warmer or something
like that then in the future we look at
like 2020 2025 and this is not numbers
from the article this is numbers I've or
me my college made-up and it's what we
think is actual time frame because these
product systems are going to be able to
talk to each other in the future some
systems already do this today but you're
going to have this as I talked about the
system where you have sensors and
actuators and to illustrate this we have
a real product that follows this process
quite similar do you guys know what
radon is how many of you know what radon
is most of you radon is a deadly gas
that kills you which is not good so you
can actually in it's available
everywhere you can measure the radon by
I don't know which year this is from but
you place this in your home and you had
to lay there for a while you send it off
to an institution you get results back
by a letter that says hey the radon is
high you should do something today
everything from a region company they
created a way to monitor and present
this information directly to the user so
you have a smart product this year they
release a
err visualizer which essentially
mentions the radon and it could push the
information to your smartphone so that
you can know if it's time to do
something about it
now if you imagine this going into a
building with multiple apartments or a
bigger area or a city you can get sort
of a state of the radon over times you
get a more advanced system where you can
collect and do interesting things it
doesn't get that interesting here though
but what gets interesting is when you
combine this data with other types of
data so you have the system of systems
architecture so imagine this a school
it's a spring morning there's a smart
system running connected to multiple
services and it detects that the radon
level is very high so you have an
automated system that checks well the
wind comes in from the east and to the
west so and by checking the weather
report and also you have a small sensor
outside you make the decision so let's
open these windows and get years to get
the deadly gas out at the same time you
get report that in the park just east of
this building there is pollen this
morning which is not good because in
register we see that we have allergic
children so this is the kind of and then
the system obviously needs to make some
smart decision based out of that data
but these are the type of systems that
we're going to see in the future when
more companies open up their data
providing an API where you can grab the
data and do something intelligent about
it still we have a couple of years until
we get there but there are some similar
systems out there today let's talk a
little bit about wireless protocols
whereas I would like to call it the
Battle of standards I like to show you
this one first
do you know why this is funny because
it's true yeah because it is and it
doesn't only apply to wireless standards
that apply to all standards cable
standards software standards it applies
to many things for me who comes from the
embedded world in the connectivity world
it definitely exists and it's a problem
so if you're going to design an IOT type
of solution you need to first sight of
which embedded solution are you going to
have which support which connectivity
you need to define which of these
protocols you're actually going to use
what type of network are you going to
pass this information on up to the cloud
fortunately to pass it up to the cloud
it's quite simple it's like three or
four or five standards that you can use
to get the data up so in essence it's
it's quite simple and typically your
company is also biased when it or you
typically some companies I say are
typically married to Microsoft and they
won't even touch the other vendors and
that's really good because then though
they don't have to make that decision so
companies typically have their you know
they have their partner to have their
cloud provider already which is good but
there's a lot of problems going on here
because it's just a complete mess so the
question is if you're going to design an
IOT product how do you know which
solutions are good which solution
solutions are bad how do you know if
somebody or something is good or bad and
can you take all these different
solutions and just put them and compare
them apples to apple and make a decision
out of it I don't think you can I don't
think that's the way you should do it
you should never just pull up all the
different scenarios that you can you
know handle for your solution what you
need to do is you need to dig down to
the problem statement figure out what is
the actual problem you're trying to
solve and once you know that you look at
the protocol the solution the framework
that is available easy to you in order
to solve that problem instead of just
looking at all the different solutions
so back
again on wireless technology and the
reason I think the reason I'm actually
even though you know mentioning this at
a software conference is that most of
these relate a lot to software most of
these are actually software configurable
as I told you earlier and it's important
to know that for software developers
that hardware is becoming a commodity
and more and more things is actually
fully software configurable and now to
to make you understand a little bit
better when it comes to wireless
communication there's two different
things you can separate all the
different wireless protocols into either
it's these short-range networks that's
the kind of typical ones you have in the
home or in an area or at a conference
like this it's like the Wi-Fi Bluetooth
that wave is popular for home automation
people thread is something that's coming
up more and more to Google behind that
one and you have the wide area networks
now the wide area networks is the one
that typically are they have a base
station or they have some sort of
network attached to building that covers
a bigger area this is where smart cities
comes into play you have the Phi G 5g
that comes up I think to 2018 if we're
lucky it's going to be able to handle
data rates up to I think it's ten
gigabit per second or even 100 as I saw
an interesting movie from the US where
they had a race car driver that got a VR
headset or it was in a our head said my
VR headset and the attached a camera in
front of the car and then they blacked
out all the windows and then this camera
send information over 5g to a service
that sent back to his headset so he
drove full-speed on the racetrack
basically with a feed through 5g which
is quite crazy and now it was
interesting to see if we talked about
smart cities Laura and B IOT and cig Fox
are like challengers right now Laura and
sig Fox or already deployed
Switzerland have 99% coverage with Laura
envy IOT is something that is upcoming
you see that Thalia Telenor local
companies they invest heavily in it and
there's also a lot of other companies
throughout Europe there is actually
investing in MB IOT and the cool thing
is that this is a completely new part of
the LTE standard and it's enabled by
making a software upgrade on the base
stations so Laura sig Fox should be new
hardware to be placed out for the new
network but Envy IOT we make a software
upgrade to the base station not all base
stations but the most the newest ones
you make a software upgrade and you have
this new technology that you can use
device you can connect your product up
to the base stations which enables a lot
more cooler applications in terms of IOT
so let's talk about some Norwegian
innovation examples how many of you are
from Norway all of you maybe almost I
already mentioned air things so I'm
going to talk a little bit more about
that not many of you know disruptive
technologies raise hand a few okay cool
this is going to be interesting you're
going to see some awesome over here
everything let's start with them I
talked about them they're visualizing
air quality so we have around 300 deaths
per year in Norway due to this deadly
gas and it gets trapped in basements and
things like that so this company was
originally a hardware company they made
this sensor they had engineers doing the
hardware doing the production and things
like that they wanted to make this
smarter product they wanted to make a
connected product they want to make an
IOT product out of this so they added
some software but then they realize okay
if we're going to make an IOT product
out of this we're going to need a couple
of things in order to do this you're
going to need connectivity we're going
to need security privacy apps web we're
going to have to do a complete cloud
solution
complete architecture for that we're
going to need service design and we're
going to have to do system integration
on this and connect it to business
models now if you take a look at this
the amount of new things they need to
add internally in order to make this
happen I see a lot of software engineers
coming in connectivity that's a software
engineer security privacy that's
software engineer apps web cloud service
design system integration they're all
software engineers so all these
companies who have products who have
hardware if they want to make smart
connected products they're going to need
a lot of software engineers so being a
software engineer is a very good place
to be when this IOT wave is well it's
already ramping so there's definitely
going to be a big need of software
engineer so I like to talk about their
things because they are in the change of
you know going into this type of market
so they were quite surprised on how many
software engineers you actually really
need in order to make a product on a LT
product so moving on
wouldn't it be nice every time I read
that I always think about Beach Boys in
their song anyhow knowing that the
operation looks after itself that's kind
of the tagline by disruptive
technologies so what they've created is
a small sensor see if I have one on here
maybe if I'm lucky maybe a law that is
so small so small sensor looks like this
and it's quite unique in the way that it
actually hosts multiple processors it
has multiple sensors it has a battery
and a full radio circuitry in this small
package and what is that why is that
interesting because there's a lot of
different IOT devices that can do the
same thing that this can actually do
which I'm going to tell you about soon
but the key here is
it's extremely small so with this sensor
you can actually fit it in door openings
in windows things like that why would
you want to do that I'm going to talk
about that in a minute
it's totally robust so if you look at
the package itself they tested it in a
chamber to simulate I think five
thousand meters of pressure so it's
really robust medical grade plastic in
terms of lifetime what would you guess
this small sensor sending data say a
hundred times a day let's say
temperature data a hundred times a day
give me give me how many years with this
last and it gets us to five ten actually
fifteen years so this can measure the
temperature in here quite accurately for
15 years Sonny's is sending the data up
to the cloud through a small cloud
connector not only that it's in terms of
range we talk about 40 meters 40 50
meters indoor but this through walls if
we're outside you can actually get up to
10 1000 meters and it's simple so how is
this actually how do you deploy this
product well you you stick it on the
wall you plug in a connector in the wall
that's it it's running no parrying no no
sequence no nothing so this small sensor
comes in three flavors one is when you
touch it it sends the data the other one
is temperature so it seats you with the
temperature measured and the last one is
proximity and that's quite interesting
because if you place this in a door it
will actually tell you instantly when
you open the door and when you close the
door same with windows it's going to
tell you instantly when you open it when
you close it and you can actually ask
the system if it's open or if it's
closed it sends this data to the cloud
connector the cloud connector simply
operates as a base
station it doesn't know a specific
sensor it takes in all the sensors that
are running their protocol and sends
that up to the cloud
it doesn't even decrypt it so the
encryption is end to end all the way up
to the clouds
there's no way to intercept the packet
in the cloud connector itself the Cal
connector can support several thousand
of different of these sensors you can
imagine in this conference maybe have
four cloud connectors you cover the
entire arena with all other sensors
placed out there using Google's cloud
solution but that doesn't really matter
because as a developer or as a company
if you want to play around with these
things you just access their API you
have to API is one REST API one G RPC
and this is the way that most of IT
companies are going to deliver their
solution they're going to deliver it in
a way that is similar to sensing as a
service so that means that you would for
example pay a small fee every month for
a certain amount of sensors running your
system which you access to an API where
you have credentials and that's where
many IOT companies are going to be in a
couple of years instead of selling the
product you're going to pay for it in a
monthly fee so what disruptive
technologies is doing they're targeting
different type of applications for
example do you know that in almost all
buildings you have fire extinguishers
and you have actual people walking
around checking that those are there all
the time what if you can just place out
the sensor instead then you know if it's
gone or if it's not gone so these are
the kind of different scenarios that
they're trying to cover by this small
sensor that lasts 15 years which you're
more or less just place and forget so we
add web step we we thought this was cool
so we wanted to do a hackathon you know
what a hackathon is of course you know
what hackathon is so we took a couple of
sensors we took 30 consultants we had a
day we played around with it
and we come up with some pretty cool
cool ideas and I just want to share a
two-minute short video what we actually
managed to do during this hackathon
see if we can get working it's just two
minutes
you
yes we were quite surprised actually how
how cool demos we were managed to do
during these two days and getting the
scissors up and running that's what you
know kick-starts the whole is just you
connect things and it works in in in
half an hour you're up and running with
actual development and that's what I
want to see with all those different IOT
solutions that's going to come need to
be easy to use just mentioning a few
things about hackathons that I think you
should bring with you into your
companies if you're not doing hackathons
you should definitely do hackathons
because in a business sense it actually
allows you a way to look at new
technology which is something all
companies need innovation and by doing
hackathons and evaluating new
technologies or methods or platform it
allows companies to assess new
possibilities and you take new
approaches for the individuals obviously
you play you have fun you innovate you
actually build your competence you
motivate yourself and allows you freedom
to do whatever you want
typically you have some guidelines for a
hackathon but in the end you end up with
something completely different from what
you wanted to do in the first place
which is really good and this is
important for all software engineers to
get this opportunity so if you don't
have hackathons at your company have
hackathons now I will just have a few
more slides I want to talk about the
future what actually what we can try to
think about when we look at the future
there's always people that says that
Heights like IOT blockchain AI all those
things that always people are
disappointed that the technology isn't
really there because typically humans
think in a linear way technology
technology is not evolving linearly
technology is actually evolving
exponentially and it's evolving so fast
that the
humans can't actually keep up with it we
can't keep up with a technology that is
happening and all the new stuff that is
happening all around the world so if you
think back ten years ten years ago we
got the first iPhone Moore's law says
that every 18 months
the amount of transistors for a certain
space will be half so it means that
either you get twice the processing
every 18 months or you can do
optimizations every 18 months and if you
look at iPhone with ten years ago we had
the first iPhone today we have a
completely different type of iPhone the
the advancement has been made within
those ten years that's what we can
expect in five years and after those
five years we can expect that change in
two and a half years so that's the
exponential 'ti that we're going to see
with technology some people say that we
are soon going to go into this hockey
stick and it's going to take off it's
already happened it's already taking off
and we're doing significant advancements
and throughout this conference people
said that well Moore's law it isn't
really valid anymore because we're going
into quantum physics and so forth well
it's not true because IBM they just
announced a five nanometer technology
just yet a week so we're still following
Moore's law in a sense we're still
seeing advancements that's going to keep
up this exponential growth now Charles
Darwin he said that it's not the
strongest of the species that survives
nor is it the most intelligent that
survives is the one that is most
adaptable to change now what does that
say
combined with the statement that
technology is evolving faster than our
ability to adapt it's a bit
contradictory and it's a bit scary so
there is change coming and we need to be
able to to actually follow the change
that is coming
now you may wonder why is there a Lego
stormtrooper on my slide and obviously
I'm a Star Wars fan I'm also a turtle's
fan if you haven't figured out when I'll
get but the reason why I'm having this
is because I can't help to make
comparisons with IOT and Star Wars if
you think about if you've seen that how
many of you are Sora's fans yes some of
you that's good enough the first movie
Phantom Menace which is by the way
horrible not the first movie that came
out but the first movie in the
sequential order anyhow they talked
about something called midi-chlorians
midi-chlorians is what enables the force
it's something that is in all everything
in all things in people in whatever that
communicate to each other you get any
connections it's the exact same thing as
internet'll things it's things that
people have things in things that talk
to each other not only that not only
that midi-chlorians if you look at the
robots that's AI in itself if you look
at the clones the clone scenes in Star
Wars they were actually they had an
implant that Darth Sidious actually in
an instant to control all the clones and
manage them too well do awful things so
that's not a good thing what else is
there with Star Wars well is it the
Death Star Death Star is like the
coolest smart-home I've ever seen in my
life
right so there's a lot of things in Star
Wars anyway let's talk about the actual
things I was going to talk about so
summarize the best practices that I've
learned throughout being in supporting
customers worldwide with IOT development
first of all is battle standards first
of all is if you're going to do an IOT
project don't sit down and compare all
the different protocols or the different
things you can read about on the web try
to get your problem statement and the
actual problem you're trying to solve
and then check availability for that
don't compare for example cig Fox Laura
and B IOT unless there's actually
connection in the country where you're
going to release your product for
example and you can do assessments by
doing a hackathon try it out is it
feasible next step technology
acceleration the technology is moving
really fast so you don't have time to
sit down and do 100% assessment of a
technology or a method or something you
need to do you need to not overthink and
just do stuff try stuff run pilots you
have to try it out otherwise you can't
keep up with the technology that is
advancing thirdly it's a bit
contradictory as well because keep it
simple stupid is really important when
you're designing things I have so many
customer stories that I could share with
products that they're adding features
things which are completely unnecessary
and just causes problems and it's a
total mess when they release it so
keeping it simple which is contradictory
with my next step you need to have
security from the start you need
security by design with IOT you need to
keep security as a concept all the way
from the start and that typically isn't
the same as keeping it simple stupid but
in a way keep it simple stupid but also
think about security that's important
last slide future today I've talked
about internal things I talked about how
we get in data from the real world how
we collect the data talk a little bit
about how the data is going up to the
cloud so we have this big data we have
huge amount of data that needs to be
able to be processed and handled you can
do predictions so forth combining them
with a topic I haven't actually said
anything about during this talk but
blockchain which is sort of a
distributed ledger technology it
provides a way of recording transactions
and digital sort of interactions in a
way that is tampa free
to cure it's quite transparent and it's
easy to audit so this is the type of
technology that we're going to see is is
ramping out in terms of communication
and storing things that need to be
tamper proof combine that with machine
learning with specifically maybe deep
learning which is the most popular
algorithm that you run in those type of
systems if you combine all this you're
going to have something quite amazing
we're probably going to reach what is
called that technology singularity which
means that robots actually exceeds
humans in intelligence but it's going to
happen but we don't really know if it's
really really good or if it's a disaster
the only thing we know is we're going to
reach that point sooner or later some
people they state that it's going to
happen in 2035 I really hope I
experience it myself and I've heard
multiple people at this conference
talking about just that so that ought to
be interesting
most of these things like 99.9% of all
the things that needs to be done here is
software so the future is software this
is where software engineers are needed
and not only this there's also multiple
other fields that ties into this
beautiful danger that we're going to
have in the future by that I'm not going
to talk so much more because it's late
in the day and it's the last day and I
know all of you probably want to be
somewhere else
soon so I'd like to allow you to ask me
questions if you have any
rock solid I'll be staying here for a
while if you have some questions cool
