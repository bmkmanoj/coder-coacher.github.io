lot of backlash around this that that
developers shouldn't have pulled that
package from NPM or whether NPM should
have allowed that package to be deleted
no the fault the stupid developers one
person called it was us for relying for
giving our dependencies to others we
don't think about these things we just
say it's free it's awesome let's use it
and it's a VC back service yes but what
happens when that VC wants to cash in
because at some point VCS do want to
cash in and what do they get right moral
of the story you are responsible for
your own dependencies you are
responsible for your own things nothing
is free
absolutely nothing we think was a was a
database that I don't know something
you've used shut down it got a lot of VC
rounds here's an application I used to
use on the on the Android it was called
everything me it was fantastic
thirty five million in three rounds
fifteen million users it shut down why
because it's false users is not revenue
if you can't create a business model
around your users it won't matter
eventually it doesn't matter how many
users you have can someone give me an
example of something in the world with a
lot of users that they're struggling to
find still a profitable model anyone
anything please what Twitter there you
go have you heard of Twitter right and
of course the best part it's not only
free services and free software we also
have free information right this is el
mundo es which is a Spanish newspaper of
course this is not what el mundo looks
like when you go to it this is with an
ad blocker this is not what el mundo
looks like when you go to it this is
what it looks like when you go to it
right it's in Spain Spain realized that
they can put advertising on newspapers
so they provide 90% advertising 10% news
and there's another one this is what the
independent they wanted to throw a party
so of course we don't use it like that
my family uses these sites like this we
don't we hate ads they're horrible
they're disgusting things so we use ad
blockers
because those are good things right and
then what do newspapers do they make it
even harder for us they now put blockers
that block our ad blockers right and
they say you're using an ad blocker you
shouldn't be doing that others kind of
say no you've got five free articles
you've done your time it's over
right this is the Telegraph it's okay
because you really can't read more than
five articles on the Telegraph anyway
some are nicer Guardian is like you know
for the less than what you pay for
Starbucks you could help support us in
terms of journalism how many of you pay
for online newspapers how many of you
use ad blockers right so in fact three
two out of three Millennials now use an
ad blocker so you know what I'd blocked
it it said I'm gonna sell ad adblock
plus now sells ads it's it's so
beautiful the irony in that is so
beautiful is it not but you're not
paying of course you're not but you are
paying because we're degrading the
quality of information and we're seeing
that more and more daily right and we're
blurring the line between news and
content marketing you're familiar with
content marketing jetbrains we do
content marketing we sell tools so we
create articles around software
developments and all of these things in
a hope that one day eventually you'll
come across one of our articles and say
these people know what they're talking
about
let me purchase their products yeah it
doesn't really happen but it looks cool
it sounds great
okay now news sites also use content
marketing this is very typical site you
can see where the advertising is right
it's very clear in your face you know
where the advertising is in this site
now it starts to get a little bit blurry
because you actually don't know if this
is like investigative reporting or is it
something that someone has pushed there
it's actually content marketing except
they've come up with a better name they
call it native advertising right because
they're blurring the line between what
is real reporting what is real
journalism and what is someone paid me
to put their article on my news site and
now you get a lot of the news from
Facebook and Facebook said well we're
going to stop from ad blockers using
Facebook but you know the best thing you
can do with Facebook is stop using
Facebook but that's another matter
but you say in the world of social media
traditional media is becoming irrelevant
it is like nowadays with Twitter with
Facebook with all of these other
networks it's becoming irrelevant to go
to even news sites as such right we get
our news on Twitter instantly and social
media has given us all a voice everyone
now has a voice and uses crowdsource and
now we've created these different types
of communities right we have facebook we
have snapchat we have Twitter
there's Google+ I don't know if anyone's
on there yet but it's still there but
what I've actually created is an
isolation we've created different walled
gardens right in that we're all in our
little garden with our little people
listening to our little news that's
crowd-sourced by those around us and of
course where does that news come from
well it comes from our people our
circles so recently there was some some
elections in the US I don't know if
you've heard of them and they were
saying that you know there's some blog
posts and some news articles and some
information that people are sharing had
been kind of censored and Facebook
workers were kind of like saying that
you know this article is about
Republican shouldn't appear and they
were trying to you know persuade people
to vote one way or another and this
wasn't even about politics so Mark
Zuckerberg came out with it with a
response in it which he says that you
know the I have the power to share their
thoughts and experiences that's what
makes social media unique we are one
global community when everyone can share
anything from a loving photo of a mother
and her baby to intellectual analysis of
political events these were words by
Mark Zuckerberg Facebook
photo of a man cradling 6on in shower
repeatedly removed by social network now
remember it's ok for mothers but
apparently not for fathers but it's not
ok for mothers in certain cases either
because if they're breastfeeding that's
seen as pornography by someone at
Facebook and it's also banned question
is we heard about these stories the
other question is which stories don't we
hear about that are not being shown to
us this picture very famous picture was
deleted from Facebook and a Norwegian
paper I believe published about this and
then they put the picture back they said
it was a misunderstanding how many times
are things being removed from our little
walled gardens that we're not aware
about so they said let's get rid of the
humans we'll put in artificial
intelligence to solve this we know how
that went because they fired that issue
as well and then these social networks
introduced things to us they introduced
timelines and moments how many of you
are on Twitter how many of you look at
moments right it's it's news that is
interesting to you right they got rid of
the chronological time order of tweets
and they said we're going to push things
that we believe are interesting to you
so we're going to give you information
that matters the most
it's about your needs showing what you
care about first and I asked who knows
what I care about first who is it is it
a person or is it a computer algorithm
what is it and what is it basing these
decisions on and we'll get to that in a
little bit and then of course we've got
this other thing that's been coming up
which is fake news which has always been
around the difference is that now we're
aware of more things right fake news has
always been around and you know BBC was
talking about you know the rise and rise
of fake news nowadays anything that you
don't agree with you can just call fake
news but you know there's a rise and
rise of fake news so Google said we're
going to introduce fact-checking feature
who at Google is going to introduce this
what's behind it based on what
so now there is a omnipresent company
that is going to decide for me what is
fake and what is not that will make my
life easier because then everything I
read must be true and I'll trust this
company and I can say Facebook I can say
Google I could say anyone it doesn't
matter someone is doing it for me
where is our judgment balance balance
actually see here's a little thing that
happens quite often and I've seen this
in my circle of friends right I see a
tweet come out someone has done
something awful right you see a tweet
bla bla bla
or bla bla company or blah blah whatever
has done something oh this is horrendous
so someone retweets that and it gets six
thousand tweets ten thousand tweets
right how many times have you done that
how many times have you seen a tweet or
a headline and you have retweeted that
be honest you've done it never
you've never retweeted a headline or a
tweet okay good on you a lot of people
do right how many times have you read an
article of that headline and then
retweeted it okay how many of you have
read an article and then try to look for
multiple sources of information to see
if that article is accurate and then
retweet it but that's the general thing
that doesn't happen right and when it
does happen there's this other thing
called confirmation bias in that we try
and tend to look for articles that align
with what we want to believe in with the
position we're trying to take and this
is a big problem even for machines right
so essentially what we are doing with
social media and it's not about Facebook
letting us in or not without registering
is we are creating our own walled
gardens we're creating our own bubbles
surrounded by people that more or less
think alike and we're not calm
trusting information enough in fact
there's this very good paper that you
should read that is talking about this
exact thing it's saying maybe we need to
encourage people to read both sides of
the story remember that old saying that
there's two sides to every story now it
doesn't happen that often because it's
so easy to just get information and
share it and given we've got so much
information overload we don't have time
to analyze every bloody tweet doing we
just share and forget and that actually
destroys people and it destroys lives
how many of you are familiar with Orwell
George Orwell right recently passed
couple past month 1984 has come the
bestseller in on Amazon right now George
Orwell said that you know it would be
we're going to have this thing a Big
Brother and there's going to be control
and censorship fortunately for us he was
completely mistaken
how many of you have heard of Huxley
Aldous Huxley or read the book brave new
world in it even before George Orwell in
1932 he talked about a society in which
we have a controlled population that we
are so amused and entertained sex left
and right drugs left and right and we
have artificial procreation this is in
1932 was he right apparently so how many
of you have read this book amusing
ourselves to death and this is one of
the best books this is by Neil postman
and this came out during the boom of the
TV and it is about relevance lost in the
sea of irrelevance and let me just quote
to you what he said said what all well
feared were those who would ban books
what Huxley feared were those that there
would be no reason to ban a book for
there would be no one who wanted to read
one all well feared that those who would
deprive us of information Huxley feared
those who would give us so much
information that we would be reduced to
passivity and egoism sounds familiar
right oh well feared that the truth
would be concealed from us Huxley feared
the truth would be drowned in a sea of
irrelevance
sounds familiar Orwell feared we would
become a captive culture Huxley fear
will would become a trivial culture
preoccupied with some equivalent of the
feelings or g4g and the centrifugal
bumble-puppy in short always feared that
Walt would hate us what we hate will
ruin us Huxley feared that what we loved
will ruin us this book is about the
possibility that Huxley and not all
wealth was right unfortunately for us
they were both right yeah and this is
even more relevant now with the Internet
it's not even about media it's not even
about TV the book basically is talking
about how media Telegram all of this
started to bombard us with information
that didn't really concern us didn't
really impact our immediate life and
this has gone to much greater scale and
we're paying by sacrificing our time of
course we've got so much information by
creating an environment in which it's so
easy to become trolls and foster and
live in that we have this concept of
share and forget did you did any of you
hear about a couple of years ago a lady
that went to Africa our white lady that
went to Africa and she was in Heathrow
and before she got on the plane she
tweeted I'm going to Africa hope I don't
catch AIDS
I'm just joking I'm white she tweeted
this gone on an air eight hour flight
when she landed in Africa South Africa
her life had been destroyed right she
had been fired she had been she had been
doxxed people were harassing her people
were taking waiting to take pictures of
her she's destroyed she's now in some
remote village in America trying to get
by by having a job and she was like the
chief communication officer of some
multinational company right her life was
completely destroyed now she says that
was a joke it was a sarcastic joke I
don't know she knows I've heard
sarcastic jokes like that and that could
well be a sarcastic joke what
we do as a society we judged we executed
and we moved on we moved on from that
how many of you remember that it's in
the past but person's life was destroyed
what do we do we just share and forget
not looking at the truth not looking at
the facts not looking at both sides of
the story and that's a person's life of
course this even has greater
consequences given you know recent
events we don't contrast information and
when we do it's very biased in what we
try and do and there's so much
information now that it's really
becoming hard and of course not only
information we have applications that
are free as well anything you want
there's an app for it what do I eat
there's an app for that I landed one day
in Gatwick I don't even use TripAdvisor
I landed in Gatwick immediately my phone
vibrated and it said hey welcome to
London
do you want some good restaurant that I
could recommend I don't even use the app
but it's on my phone it lights it up
what do we exercise when do we exercise
we track that right when do we work we
track that I got an application called
focus that shuts down everything but
there are services you can sign up to
that will monitor your working patterns
and tell you where you could improve and
where you could not improve where do I
go we track that and who else is going
to be around there all of us use these
applications or we'll use something just
like Google this is Google now on my
phone it is the most amazing software
ever it knows everything it knows where
my fights going to be delayed when my
gates going to be changed where I'm
checking in where my car is parked it is
fantastic what my meetings are who I'm
talking to
it is beautiful it's all there in fact
recently I installed Google trips which
is an application that you install it
says you want to hook up your Google
account I said yes in one mini second I
had all my traveler information back to
2003 right because it's all indexed
analyzed ready for Google to serve you
Google trips was just a UI on the data
based on the information they have of me
if you use Gmail you see that right all
of this is they're owned by corporations
and now with complete free access from
the government's and Google knows you
and now Google wants to know your family
- right ok Google and it's not just
Google Amazon echo Amazon knows you
Mattel
Mattel is building an Alexa for kids
think about this a kid a five or six a
seven-year-old in their bedroom the
things they say or not say is all being
analyzed and processed and served to us
for our needs
Ron keepers suddenly turned out that was
secretly keeping track of everywhere you
go it wasn't telling you that Google
Voice Search Records and keeps
conversations people have around their
phones but you can delete the files if
you want in fact a lot of these systems
that are listening to OK Google are
always listening right because they need
to listen to the ok Alexa for the OK
Google or the ok Cortana and all that
information we are hoping that it's all
safe and all sound Facebook is using
smart phones to listen to what people
say professors suggest now don't believe
this it might be fake news go contrast
it there's an application now in Russia
it's called fine face I tried it Russia
has their own version of Facebook it's
called contact ear it's vk.com and a
couple of start-up in russia create an
application where you can just take a
picture of someone immediately tells you
who that person is I tried it it works
if you have your picture on contact here
it will say oh is it this person
sometimes it finds a one-match sometimes
it finds three or four matches but
everyone I tried it found matches but
hey it's great to be able to tag people
in photos right and guess who's
interested in this technology guess
Google
police seek Amazon echo data in murder
case
think about this police want a warrant
on Amazon data in a murder case because
they believe Alexa might have listened
to the murderer there's a hotel chain in
Vegas that wants to install Alexa in
every room completely destroying that
thing of everything that you happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas
that's gone now it's on Amazon too right
oh I saw you were interested in you know
I'm not going to say what here I'll show
you some adverts for that and now we
have this beautiful thing called the
Internet of Things there's a smart
tampon right and it does need to be
stopped
LG threatens to put Wi-Fi in every apart
appliance it introduces in 2017 that is
actually a threat and I'm not even
talking about security aspects there was
a very good tweet by a friend of mine
that said the s in IOT stands for
security right there is no security but
I'm talking about you are next to your
TV you are next to your fridge and
everything all the time is now listening
to you you know George Orwell didn't
imagine this in his wildest dreams
he thought the government is going to
come and put cameras in your house why
you can just buy a TV or a fridge or a
phone and we know everything about you
and we're paying by sacrificing our
privacy for convenience it's as simple
as that oh I got nothing to hide I sell
good by being the product and helping
shape the product and we're doing this
hoping that our data will never be sold
or hacked or used against us you know
Bruce Schneier said surveillance is the
business model of the Internet we build
systems that spy on people in exchange
for services corporations call it
marketing now you go to the web I buy a
product even from Amazon and I keep
getting advertising from Amazon it's
like it's it's it's trolling me now
whatsapp user
us to receive adverts when whatsapp was
bought by Facebook they said no we are
not going to get you know completely
separate it's going to complete keep it
completely separate here later oh yes
we're going to join the databases we're
going to sell you adverts that's been
stopped in some countries I believe in
Germany it's been stopped and then just
coincidentally the other day they found
that votes at vulnerability allowed
snooping on encrypted messages Facebook
but they sell us out and they sell us
that we buy ads at JetBrains as well I
say oh this is ads a fantastic as a
fantastic how many of you buy ad yeah
yeah they say to you they give you these
charts and not only Facebook all of
these companies they give you these
charts and they're like ok you invested
a thousand dollars you generated 150
thousand dollars here like really yes
how well kind of Association bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla bla so if you invest
$5,000 you're going to get 1 million
dollars like that that sounds good
guess who generates these reports that
tell us how efficient our advertising
has been the same people that sell us
the advertising right and then recently
it came out in The Wall Street Journal
that face was an overestimated key video
metric for 2 years
oh yeah we just said that your videos
have been played more than we they were
actually played it's ok though we will
fix it it was a bug and of course you
say ok but I doesn't my I don't care if
people sell me advertising big deal ok
so I have to click on the ad and say I
don't want to see adverts of diapers
anymore big deal I mean I don't really
care because I have nothing to hide
right and I think the best way to phrase
this is how Edward Snowden said it said
arguing that you don't care about the
right to privacy because you have
nothing to hide it's no different than
saying you don't care about free speech
because you have nothing to say
essentially that is it right now in the
u.s. they're going to start doing them
what they've been doing actually in
Canada for many years you can go to
through immigration and they can tell
you to unlock your phone and they can
look at your phone and don't don't think
that this won't happen in the UK or in
Europe it will it eventually will
there's a new law that's coming into
Europe which is called the gdpr which is
a general data protection regulation
which is basically enforcing thousands
of new requirements on us so that we
stop profiling people and sending data
to people and getting data from people
implementation wise let's see what
happens because I'm not too optimistic
then there was an article about NHS
chairs medical records of 11.6 million
patients with Google as part of data
sharing agreement how many of you the
live or might live I asked my friends in
the UK I said were you aware of this
when you signed up to the NHS were you
aware that there's a data sharing
agreement between the NHS and Google
they want aware just like I'm not aware
if there is one between my social
security in Spain and Google or what
have you
now it's all for good it's all for good
of course it is until it's not the US
government as I said is starting to ask
foreign travelers to disclose their
social media accounts and this is not
something that's happened in recent
couple of months this started six months
ago if any of you have filled out and s
the form they actually ask for your
social media accounts now it's optional
tomorrow it won't be what's your github
account what's your github they actually
at least they've gone to the level of
asking for github like awesome someone's
going to see how much good open source
are right it's like if I use node.js is
that going to be viewed badly china
plans to organize its society relies on
big data to rate everyone okay they want
to use big data to rate now how many of
you have seen a black mirror yes
that's exactly what it was in one
episode of black mirror season three so
in summary what is the point of
everything that I've been ranting on
we're screwed like I tried to put a
summary in here and I realized that
there is no summary was good and this is
not an episode from Black Mirror in fact
Charlie Brooker once up one saw someone
I couldn't find the tweak but at some
point someone had tweeted and said
oh my god the today feels like an
episode from Black Mirror and Charlie
Brooker the the guy behind it responded
and said no it was even too dark for me
right so what is my point of this
honestly I don't know I'm just raising
concerns that I've been having for some
time but I wonder if we can actually
strive to create sustainable models
sustainable bottles that think about our
privacy sustainable models that think
about our well-being both from an
emotional aspect as well as financially
because that's another thing we're
ignoring artificial intelligence every
time you talk about artificial
intelligence people say oh don't worry
about it it's just another Industrial
Revolution and jobs will be shifted to
something else it's not I don't believe
it is and there's many other people that
don't there are multiple studies going
back I was talking about this I was
saying to Jake wood recently that I was
talking about this for years ago there
was a study by MIT finding that the rate
of destruction of jobs is significantly
higher to that of creation and this was
four years ago right and Industrial
Revolution was creating jobs at the pace
that it was destroying this is not the
case now the how many of you have heard
of it was called the Foxtel or something
a company in fabric the ones that
fabricates a fox foxfox tron fox net or
something the company that fabricates
our iPhones for Apple in China a few
years ago it was in the news making
rounds because people were committing
suicide they were working too many hours
and they're committing suicide they
addressed it by putting nets in the
building so that if people would jump
they would fall in Nets you know how
they've addressed it now they've
replaced 60,000 jobs with robots
60,000 jobs in China and that's just one
example right and artificial
intelligence is going to take over many
of our jobs in fact there was a very
good paper from IBM bluemix that shows
all of the different
jobs that are being now replaced with
artificial intelligence things that you
wouldn't think about like now it makes
sense but lawyers lawyers can be
replaced by artificial intelligence
doctors can be replaced by artificial
intelligence many things can be replaced
by artificial intelligence so we have to
actually think start thinking seriously
about sustainable models but a bigger
problem of course is not only jobs but
its influence now this is a paper that
you can read and you can contrast how
many of you have read this I highly
recommend you read it it's called the
rise of weaponized AI propaganda machine
true or not it is completely viable in
that it's talking about how the current
political party Republicans won the
elections by using artificial
intelligence to sway people and
influence them by recognizing what
people like or dislike on Twitter and
Facebook and then pushing certain
messages and this was done by a company
so called company in the u.s. called
Cambridge analytical ok now they don't
have data they're not sharing the
evidence but it is it is possible it
really is possible for this to happen
but the bigger problem here is that
artificial intelligence can also be
biased and in fact it's numerous papers
showing this this is an example of an
application that was but by just face
recognition was saying that this person
is a criminal this person is not and it
was actually the reverse racial
profiling all of these things at the end
of the day who is programming this we as
individuals also have biases and this is
a real big concern now combined is the
day that we get facial recognition where
any camera in any city can actually
recognize you which we already have the
software for it starts to become quite
scary especially when we as humans might
not be in control anymore
so ok but you know what is our role and
why why do I try and give these talks
here because I feel that we're not only
consumers we are
creators right we have been playing a
will continue play a significant part in
this and us and those that are coming
into this industry we are part of the
problem and for far too long I think
that we've kind of looked the other way
including myself and said well I can't
do anything about it
this is much bigger than me so you know
I'm just trying to maintain a family but
I wonder what am I going to maintain or
what my kids are going to maintain
eventually because if we all look the
other way and say this is not my issue
it's not going to scale well so I'll
finish off with a phrase from a Jurassic
Park paraphrasing it says your
scientists were so preoccupied with
whether or not they should they didn't
stop to think if they if they could they
didn't stop to think if they should and
I find too often that we make the same
decision we look at how can we
technically do this without thinking of
the consequences and a lot of time it is
not within intent I would say 90% of the
time it is not if I want to create an
application that is keeping track of
what I eat I do it with good purposes
but I don't think about how this can be
exploited in bad ways and I really
