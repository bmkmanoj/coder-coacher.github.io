sort of late on them on Thursday
appreciate it you had some lunch there
are some coffee the way on they're sort
of down low now and so I'm Gemma Cameron
I work at crop digital iMovie underscore
Jem on the Twitter's if you want to
follow me yeah works can't digitally
Manchester imma talk to you about
visualization and before we get started
if any point you decide that this talk
is not for you it is completely fine
with me if you want to go up and go
somewhere else if it turns out this
isn't the kind of visualization that you
wanting to listen about don't worry so I
put three out yesterday to see what
people thought of when you said the word
visualization and this is the thing that
kind of popped into my head is it
clicking it works a bit so this is the
kind of thing that nothing's working
nothing's working oh wait wait wait wait
it might be me
technical difficulties don't worry but
even that's not working yeah so this is
what I think about risotto remember this
this is real player this is music
visualization I apologize the short
interlude it was worth it because you
get dancing sheep
this is Annabelle the Sheep so some
people think about visualization as a
sheep rocking out to music this talk
isn't about that this talk isn't also is
also isn't about d3 metrics
visualization anything like that
so again if this talks it for you please
feel free to leave that's fine so I tell
you and this talks kinda happy lots of
stories I'm going to tell you about at
my story the time long ago when I worked
at a start-up then I'll talk few more
stories and hopefully we'll get
something at the end so a couple years
ago where it's at a startup called
Allegro networks they're a wholesale
internet service provider does anybody
know what this is it's the internet
maybe they've got more reactionary for
that that little box off of the IT Crowd
with the red button and they'll know
what the internet is made up of you have
to really shouts I can hear you that's
right interconnected networks you have
to say in a really nerdy voice I'm not
quite nailed it how are these
interconnected networks connected at
networking events this is a whole
revelation to me people decide to
connect their networks at networking
events
apparently LinkedIn turned up with
t-shirts with their a s number on the
side your is numbers like your postcode
on the internet and when they decided to
connect this networking event they go
and that wasn't me and they go around
they ring some providers they haggle
getting a price agree and then the
ticket goes on the backlog for an
engineer to go into a datacenter
and plug in some wires and manually make
that internet working internet
connection
see font is quite a long time isn't it
in the world of the internet so this
chap here and Edie he had an idea
keeping this business for a very long
time he had an idea of doing this in a
completely different way so there must
be a better way was more 21st century
kind of way to do this and he approached
me as developer because he needed some
developers help him with this idea and
he told me a story this is his dream
this is his vision imagine a couple of
people at this networking event we
decided to connect their networks
because that would help them make money
connecting their networks would help
them make money then without the phone
there and then could join up press a
button and their networks and magically
connected yeah money profit so I joined
Andy I was on my own the other
developers weren't joining yet kind of
whizzing through this story a little bit
and the other developers going to be
joining me in a few weeks so I had time
to sit down with the rest of the
business this is a very small startup to
do some analysis trying to figure out
that this is a completely new domain to
me I've never worked as you know in the
wholesale internet provider space before
so this wasn't this wasn't what you get
at home this is the company's this is
connecting data centers this is a proper
internet so to do my analysis I sat down
and listened to all the people in the
organization to get their ideas I tried
to start figuring out what was going on
what they wanted and it kinda looks a
little bit like this there were a lot of
stakeholders and allegro was born from
the ashes of a failed wholesale isp
the way that they tried to win was to be
the cheapest it didn't work for them so
the meeting we had a few people who were
investors there we had the CTO who had
the three network engineers we had
salespeople something everybody had
ideas everyone to you to hear them so
what does I do I wrote all their ideas
down every single person's idea
everything they came out with all these
people like animals I wrote all their
ideas down and then I put them on
post-it notes because our gels and what
I found is that when people see writing
down their ideas this is something that
I learned quite early on in my career
when people see you writing down their
ideas they let go so now these are no
worry dolls so in the 90s when I used to
go shopping as a teenager and we used to
go into these like hippie shops and
they'd have these these are worried
dolls from Guatemala
those little tribes that would basically
dress up match fix and you get a little
bag and you're supposed to tell these
worry dolls your worries each one gets
to worry and you tell them that you put
money you pillow go to sleep when you
wake up your worry has gone their
problem them and that's what I was doing
by listening to people they gave me
other ideas we could let go and when
they give me all their ideas I try
the reason of this is if we'd added
every single thing that you asked for
every idea that they'd had was never
delivered because I'd taken that from
them all of a sudden we were able to
move at speed what found is most
important things will always come back
and it allows people the freedom of
spaced away from the most important
thing right now so I'm going to kind of
go off in a bit of tangent and talk to
you about no bat log anyone heard no
backlog before one person okay -
hopefully from a bit of a revelation for
you so no bat log is basically I was
talking about a previous company I'd
worked out
they've had six months backlogs I'd
already come into this project deciding
that I didn't want to have about log for
the project I've seen it at businesses
where they've been completely stifled
because it had this six month backlog
who here visualizes their backlog couple
of people put your hands up do you know
how many stories or features or tasks
you've got in that backlog keep your
hand on how many 7676 yeah anybody else
had the hand up no so usually when I ask
this I hear things like 300 I don't know
876 76 is quite good because you can
visualize that most people have their
bat logs in here in an issue tracker
because that's where they sort of
scrolling away
I just squirrel them away in a bin it's
not really much different company ID
where it's at I've got a deal with
Lonely Planet and we're going to put
these longtime ik guides on their hotel
websites and they had to deal with
Lonely Planet for a whole year because
our backlog was that big we were unable
to implement that before the contract
ran out
the world we live in six months to a
year is just too long so I went in there
thinking no backlog the other thing that
we decided to do was no booked so who's
got a book tracker see you
who knows holy bugs are in the bog
tracker oh really
twelve twelve or something so you've got
seven to six in your backlog than twelve
bugs spree God's mother and this didn't
mean I have bug-free code by the way it
just means that fixing bugs takes
priority over new features it means that
you don't store them up because project
managers never give bugs priority over
new features no shiny stuff that'll get
as money or bugs both of these things is
a really good book called the goal if
you've not read it you should go and
read it and it describes these and these
artifacts you build up as waste as decay
so you think about your bugs and your
backlog is like yogurt especially bugs
if suddenly comes up with a bug today
and by the time it gets to you in two
weeks and three months and how many
changes you've made to that codebase is
that book still valid is that story that
suddenly came up with three months ago
still valid this also goes on to leave
them to no estimates and there's a great
guys up there in the middle called woody
so you should all gone speak to if you
want to know more about no estimates
following them alright the inch hole
Bamiyan slides now so what's this got to
do with visualization all right where
were we
and okay it was just me
so told me I remember that sub sub size
Tommy Owens just me three network
engineers the CTO and this guy called
Meg who's amazing do those stuff we have
no bas have no product owner nothing
like that small startup
about 15 people and I had to get share
all this information that was starting
to learn so I know going to be a good be
a would start writing everything down I
came up with a vision site Brown has
some scenarios not putting with that
logs no just just on to conference on to
wiki I've not worked for the Greenfield
project before so what's the first thing
you do want to Google Google told me to
create project board it told me to come
up with these things called user
journeys so we'll seen these before
I hadn't what's supposed to happen is
it's supposed to show you the touch
points for your user and how happy or
sad they are and you can show them
before and after I had more pages to
confluence I sent them over to my pals
who couldn't be bothered to read any of
these streams dreams of text that I'd
managed to put together I couldn't be
bothered right little they can't be
bothered reading it first stop my hand
hurts from writing all this stuff down
and gathering all this information like
why am i doing this what are you doing
because I've gone to what I need before
it's what I'd seen in other companies
it's something called cargo culture
they'll heard of cargo culture before ok
I'll tell you a little story by the way
this is a tribe in Africa who worship
Prince Philip I couldn't find another
picture for cargo culture but it's quite
fitting so what happens in world war two
is there was an island in the Pacific
Ocean that the US Air Force were using
as an airbase and became in the
indigenous people never met any
Outsiders before and the Air Force
started giving these indigenous people
packages of food some chocolate you know
canned goods
this is beautiful this is great
just go huntin anymore the sky gods come
down give us food and then the war ended
and the Americans left and these poor
people wondered where their food supply
agon wondered where the sky gods had
gone so they started to do the dance to
beckon them down they put coconut shells
on their ears we sat in the shed at the
end they'll its torches down the runway
they did the dance with the sticks but
the sky gods never came and it's a very
sad story because then a lot of these
indigenous people died of starvation
because they spend all their time
mimicking the actions of the US Air
Force to bring them food rather than
hunting and getting their food and
that's cargo culture that's going
through ceremonies I've going through
the motions but not really understanding
why and that's what I was doing and I've
seen it in organizations before because
post-its because I'd gel stand ups
because agile going through ceremonies
not really understanding why just that
equates this so I went back to what felt
right to get forget everything that I
knew everything that experienced before
or previous companies previous
businesses most grow back to scratch so
what felt right and what felt right was
the story that Andy had told me what I
was trying to do here what I was trying
to achieve was to get this information
is learning of this new domain across to
my colleagues in the most concise way
rather than using customer and customer
be the Zambian side tool for myocyte to
try and relate to these customers I
started to give them names and starts
giving route of backlog so rather than
you know two people meet and decide the
network should connect it was Internet
service provider Plusnet meet with
Netflix
oh it creates we got our networks to
connect and I had a had this idea in my
head I could see in my head this story
and I thought back to a lab that knew at
university or when he left he started to
do blogs with ultimate self generated
comic strips hi
that's what I can see that's the story I
can see so I googled and I found this
thing called bit strips and they want in
this it's really cool really cool
because you get these puppets and you
can completely change manipulate the
face and their and their facial
interactions are in a little bit more
exciting than that user journey one that
was doing the smiling happy face sad
face you get a lot more nuances in there
and as I turned it into a comic
these were actually two people that I
knew Gaza Samir played roller derby with
which is Internet service provider and
rich for some days through the works of
many supermarkets I started to bring
these people to life's really start to
to emphasize with them so who they are
each one of my comics always ends with
this there's lady talking about it after
Manchester the way contributor liked
that these comics are do it's a workshop
and but they always end in this aha yeh
moment so that's that's the that's the
killer shots that's what you're after
eventually bits tricks is gone now so
you cannot make these however you can't
go another look online I think you can
get some like Marvel once imagine iron
mum going through your story and the
sights decorate our project board with
comics and pictures and it made it a lot
more enticing than people going past and
seeing words we have some accounts
that's come around from the UK and you
get tax relief for doing research and
development and they came around and
said so what is it you're building I
gave them all these comics five seconds
later they just gave them back I said
quenching photocopiers oh yes forget it
so that's my time that was one of my
stories when I tell you the next three
was in there joined a left leg row we
did manage to deliver this by the way
weren't the first people in the world to
work think about automating network
provisioning all the bigger boys have
tried to do it out there but we were the
first people to do it we managed to do
it in three months because of the tools
and techniques that I describe Celeste
and I joined this company called bright
hotel
when I joined bright HR joined as a and
an internal startup consultant so I
supposed to be in there I'll go in ask
everybody what's going on all people at
different levels and I sort what I want
to do is try and get the development
team speaking to the rest of the
business so this is a little lab this is
a little garden in the middle of the
office and it would divide the IT team
the rest of the business which would
break that aside so started going around
asking people because it was again there
was a deadline to launch a product a big
conference noises and they had quite a
lot of time we had some January to
October it wasn't unrealistic
interviewed everyone CEO or sales people
everything like that yet we're going to
deliver slogan we find everything's
going well
great so I going to the stand-ups and we
had an interactive board
it was JIRA and it has three levels and
they were kind of focused every day on
this sort of very detailed level and
nobody who actually stand-ups knew what
was going on another site to dig a bit
deeper it kind of looked like this is a
lucky dip of tasks that had been broken
up so they put a business analyst in
charge of the project management project
management big picture business analyst
small details and what he's done is it
broken off the project into pieces into
like pages or sections split that up
into little tasks and given that to the
development team and they were just
lucky with him we're actually making any
progress I didn't really know how to
explain this to people I went to spoke
to the the UX team and they've done some
screen shots you know because design up
front because agile and I got all these
screenshots of these pages and they put
them on a wall right next to where
everybody would go and get a cup of tea
and it kicked off the pages to show what
progress is made and
in the three months equation that's
project and they had another like three
four months to go all they've managed to
do was get to the login page that was
all they've actually managed to do
because they weren't focused on
delivering a journey for a user they
were focused on all these tasks that
been split up I was seen as the rest of
the business saw this on the walls they
got scared and they came to me and said
can you help so I did there's there's
more to this story which I'll I'll touch
on later there was much more wrong with
it than just not being able to see the
progress that was being made and then I
joined a company called crack digital
well co-op in the UK we've got digital
division and this is a really cool
little project we're working on called
now cook it and it's an online free
online cookery school Danny wasn't gone
too I've thoroughly recommend you gone
through it now cooking but Cody Kay and
one of the things I did when we were
working on now cooking was to draw our
Kanban board in a slightly different way
so when we're talking about the tasks
that were on there rather than having
them in progress wait to see where they
were and kind of what needed to be done
next and you could see things moving
around so it might be that we were
killing something that's about dashboard
or something needs a bit design and that
design would then move to the front end
but it needs some back-end stuff for a
story or whatever but it just meant that
there was a nice quick snapshot that
people could see where we were up to and
when we went round co-op I started to
see a load of other stuff that people
were doing to visualize stuff that I've
never seen before
so this is a team I think it was
yesterday in Pat mapping this is a
really cool one from the air funeral
care team it goes all the way along the
board all the way on the wall in the
room and it shows you the journey of the
user and all the touch points and other
people that they were interact with when
they have to book a funeral
because that team are trying to remove
some of the paid processes and the
blockages this is another cool one call
this a tubular church Ruth Project does
anyone see me that local churches or
they start to show you how much money
they've raised so another way of showing
the progress that was being made on the
project spring cadence and that's sort
of really good job with a lot of these
and I'd never seen anything like this
before I thought this is great the road
map she'd done and it got me thinking
why do we visualize stuff and we
visualize stuff to show process and
progress we have information radiators
mapping process is trying to make it
easier to visualize complicated things
and the reason I do it is because I
really struggle to keep things in my
head and it's something that I've
learned as part of my software
craftsmanship it's like building a house
of cards like debugging and if anyone
comes and talks to me that house of
cards will just collapse
so I've purposefully given myself a
small stack and if I get too much stuff
in my head people can see me having a
visible stack overflow exception I was
literally just stand there and just go I
can't work anymore I'm broken I bought
myself a whiteboard at home and this is
something actually happened to me the
other day this is a mind map if anyone's
use these or seen these before but it's
just me getting everything out of my
head like those worry dolls get it out
there get it on the paper get on the
wall and it means I can let go because
when I get stuck in a loop ugh go right
well I need to do this talk but I've
also got to do this board for this and I
need to do this and I'll start thinking
about one bit and it would just
interrupt me I need to go work on this
and I get stuck so having it down on
there I've got something tangible I can
relate I can start doing a deep dive on
different bits I can go that's not as
important as that that's what I've got
left to do but no let's do that needs to
do this so that's something that really
helped me
so let's have a look what I did with
these user needs so this is something
that I usually run as a workshop because
people really like the comics step one
we look at story cards so a new story
cards at work
one person okay
there'll be no much about behavior
driven development and stories user
stories so they was a guy called Dan
North in London who came up with these
and these are templates so as a I want
so that you're gherkin syntax such
people use a lot of them a lot of
behavior driven development tools which
is given when them and if you can speak
to Liz who lose key know who came up
with the first G behaved BDD tool
she'll go and tell you that that was a
terrible idea so all done these
templates that they use in I think that
what they're there for
is a way to start conversations because
as developers were usually quite bad at
talking to people
people didn't really know how to start
that why are we doing this thing and
with cargo culture has gone on these are
kind of things we've started to come out
people get these and they're really
boring to look at comparison to the
comics and stuff but people don't really
know what they mean
they're supposed to be placeholder for a
conversation but what are these things
well they're stories am I in my workshop
so get people to come up with the user
story cards no one knows what they're
talking about so then get them to write
proper stories say write them is Italian
to a five-year-old give the characters
some life there's been some brilliant
ones we've had like Lumberjacks that
have had this whole backstory and all of
a sudden the come to date work one day
and chops off their arm and then he
insurance and to tell you about how
their their tool product was going to
save their world
it's a really nice way to bring these
carrot slice to give you empathy to
really understand to create your story
as a way of the week so Italy is a week
and one of the gap ended up pairing more
than guys who's working on funeral care
and even a requirement to come in to
save the mortuary that you've selected
in a drop-down and we put a message out
to the tech team to say
should this be stored as a cookie you
know how do we store these sorts of
things we still miss cookies we saw them
in session to be story on the user
object remembers transmissible why do we
need to save it what's it for
so when in had a conversation with the
subject matter expert and they explained
that this is because people will move
around to different more trees and they
need to change the selection so ok well
that's not going to be on the session or
the cookie because you can't have it on
the machine you'll have to get the user
object and then it turns out he also
needs a bit remember as we moved around
the different screens when they came
back we have to have that remembered but
we wouldn't have known to implement that
without that story without understanding
why that requirement was there and you
don't get that from one of these cards
but it's really difficult to put all
this down but you need this story you
need to call up these characters you
need to give them something before you
can go and build these comics and have
people sketching them we have people
using online tools as loads of stuff
it's really fun to just sketch them out
first to get them out your head and this
time went on I distilled this is a gin
still I shared the story and it became
my own the more I shared it I began to
understand it better began to understand
the reason we were using this stuff I
fulfilled the idea into more and more
relatable stories I helped me understand
the domain I ended up with this so this
was the thing for us as developers we
were trying to sell this is this is the
thing I could relate to so they want
experience get going down
github yes you know in isn't it
the reason is because they're having a
DDoS attack has a fire behind the
internet door what we were suggesting
doing was giving you a private door that
was the connection that is company we're
trying to make and that would solve a
lot of our problems as developers and
going through that process and on these
workshops it shows me that excited to
evolve how we visualize stuff so let's
have a look at delivery processes how do
you visualize that so the beginning of
the world we have the waterfall process
everyone's familiar with this yes get a
lot of requirements my mages making
those requirements you do the work
take them off then it all goes to QA
gets verified some other things
seven years later delivers the customer
profit yeah then the app jail manifesto
and agile came along I really messed all
this up if you distill agile right now
where it's got benefit over waterfall is
that you're starting to get feedback
from the user faster this is where scrum
comes in it chooses the first step scrum
is kind of a way of visualizing your
waterfall process but also to get your
feedback sooner you're going to do that
in two weeks prints yeah see visualize
processing board it's very much push
it's about getting stuff to go through
all these gates that you already had
yours full process then you've got
Kanban so kanbans
starts to the difference as well with
scrum and Kanban is the stand-ups
stand-ups and scrum you usually talk
about what people are working on where
it's Kanban you start to talk about the
tasks and what is stopping us it's more
of a pull what's stopping us delivering
this item and as you find problems
with your process here you can start to
end up cameraman helps you get rid of
those processes and those gates limit
your work-in-progress to be able to get
to this are you waiting on it yet have
you delivered it yet
is it done a people using it that's
that's all people are bothered about and
it's way it's accessible for anybody
who's interested in you delivering these
things to see what is going on the next
set on this evolution in showing your
working process and being able to find
the problems with it is single piece
flow so exiting programming you're going
to have a look around that you can see
single piece flow kind of a highly
functioning development delivery team so
as you remove your backlog you can
deliver the most important thing to the
user right now and if you deliver in
small enough chunks you make sure that
everything that you do you can stop and
change directions away from the next
most important thing that's being agile
that's being able to move quickly and
change direction at will at this point
you don't need any process because you
have no backlogs what you do here is you
show you visualize what you need to
deliver those those conversations you
have at your Kanban stand up about
what's stopping you delivering it
this is visualizing it this is show you
the rabbit hole that can go down as you
start to look at different tools and go
oh this is giving me a problem so while
you're sharing that information of
what's going on to anybody who's
interested in this project and no talk
of this kind of visualization be
complete without this so I've seen this
thing of beauty cannot see many gas
phases so seen it there was else think
this is a thing of beauty
so this is this is where around the
internet not too long ago I don't think
I can watch it anymore
making my eyes bleed and this is
supposed to be the tube this is
Deloitte's way of visualizing all the
many agile processes that are out there
let's get back to it so how do we
improve our processes
the answer is retrospectives and runs
retros the idea is that you you improve
as body saves you turn up the good you
start to look and get rid of those
clunky bits and you can have the
conversations during your retro about
that but if you've not visualized the
clunky bits if you can't see that if you
can't feel that paint can't get it out
of your head and share it with other
people so quite difficult to reflect a
lot back at how to improve as you talk
about these things you start to find the
problems it helps you refine and distill
the ideas helps you improve things if
anybody wants some other way to do their
retrospectives and not find their
retrospectives there is they're useful
as they used to be go and check out the
retrospective wiki it's really cool some
good resources on there turn up the good
and stealing that from you woody I love
it it's one of the biggest things that
go out with mob programming every day at
the end of every single day do quick
15-minute retro how can you turn up the
good so going back to the bright HR
story as I say it wasn't just me putting
a lot of pictures on the wall that made
us deliver helped us deliver we still
found that the team couldn't get
anything done even when we refine the
process and we started concentrating on
delivering what users wanted to do so we
can start using it testing it and we
locked him the architecture with a
lovely UML document that nobody wait to
read knowing it's in hiding one student
made my eyes bleed so we've got everyone
together and we got all our ideas of
what we knew about the architecture on
the wall and we're all jumping up and
drawing things as we stood back a look
we realized that was the problem it was
such a mess this is why it taken one guy
two weeks
two weeks of struggling to try and get a
user saved in the system logged in user
or reproduce a same system they still
couldn't do it and without us doing that
visualizing that architecture wouldn't
have known because it was in someone's
head it was unknown or maybe it was only
a UML diagram still in them all the way
to visualize and stuff you've got
information radiators so if you think
about how salespeople will talk about
the success of your project back in the
day maybe reams and reams of papers with
numbers did nobody want to read we
started getting things like this little
red Lean Startup it's a really good book
I've definitely recommended it got lots
of nice stories about how and different
companies have had done this build
measure learn and there's a lot of stuff
about metrics about learning this is one
of the things that we start up calls
sanitary metrics does it really matter
how many people on your site is that
really thing you want to be measuring or
is it Google rankings so one of the
projects we've got at co-op did yourself
plays we've been redoing the listings
for funeral homes in a more mobile
friendly format Seville got the Google
rankings so that people can find them so
it's not just Nasser of the numbers it's
also where are they on the rankings
that's their measure of success when I
say about now cook it that was working
on I made this and it's the products
that Shopify made called the dashing
really beautiful handsome dashboards and
if start that project none can get
something called Smashing but that's
what I used to visualize our project so
have the stateís on there I thought if
you can see but behind the total
visitors and the current visitors is a
little tiny graph so you get an idea if
things have changed a lot of those are
voluntary metrics but we've got the
importance to fund there which is you
know could people we're people copying
things where people completing
the course the reason it was a success
and people really like this because it
looks pretty it looks inviting people
want to have a you know see what's going
on one of the things that Facebook an
Etsy do apparently this is a story I'll
only of the week so might not be true
hoping it is but they wake up their
metrics for success before they build a
story so the a/b test the features of
eed to build it deliver it as I put it
out to half the users of the a/b testing
and only when it goes it will only go
live to everybody if the a/b test has
passed the metrics if it succeeded in
that an automated process so really nice
if that's what Facebook connect to do
and they work out that stuff in advance
it'll help you change your development
approach knowing that information having
that bigger picture I think that Amazon
doing again this is the story someone
has told me it might not be true and
they've realized that we most products
they fail because once you built it
developers and everyone built it you
then hand it over to the sales team in a
proper silo and if anyone ever notice
that sales team makes things up when we
give them the project the products we
start to invent things that it should
have done there's a there's a local
company in Manchester startup that
failed because of this the sales team
would go out whilst the product was
being built they'll go out to where
potential customers and the potential
customers are oh yeah we like it but if
it does this we'll buy it the sales team
will come running back and go right you
really need to build this thing now and
then Walmart or buy or wherever it was
an exciting creasing that backlog they
got in the way of delivering their
actual real things that would have made
this product useful and it died the
staff that failed
so what to do at Amazon they realize
that this was a silo this was like
throwing stuff over the wall and what
they did was they work for the sales
team at the beginning of the process and
they build the marketing site they build
the shiny sell the product side before
the products built so that everybody
understands what the key things are the
USP why people would want to buy that
product what that yay moment is what the
important things are and it really helps
focus yeah so when I think the promise
of this talk is to look at is there
another way so the stuff that you're
doing on your project the way you
visualize stuff is there another way for
you guys to do it because all of you in
here are different I'm assume you've all
got different teams unless you're all
here from the same company any projects
different you know all the people in
their project and the product that
you're working on it's all completely
different so stop copying saw that car
go call team look at what you're doing
stop for everything way that you know
get it out of your heads share it with
other people get it out of their heads
how do they see the world if you need
some inspiration for ways to visualize
stuff learn a little hunt around the
kept site every time I've done this talk
I keep finding more things to add anyway
no I would have listened I found this
round work you have to sell 575 coop
sandwiches to using our external meeting
rooms quite a lot of sandwiches starts
put the money into real values and I met
I am I run a lot of tech event stuff
over in the North West of England and
one of them's at Manchester and I went
to a hackathon with a guy that I run
this way and he made a hack at Leeds
hack called sausage fest and what it was
about was taking data was taking data
and putting the value of real world
objects into
ages but not just any sausages there was
premium sausages like Tesco finest or is
it Richmond middle range or was it a
Sainsbury's or as the basics sausage
that's you know pretty much just
eyelashes quite a way different way of
looking at the world the Aston Martin
you want lots of sausages and Jake one
of my colleagues coops well they have
quite a few different environments they
didn't know what version they released
them to each machine is kind of in
someone's head so he made this way of
sharing them so everybody knew what was
going on but get stuff out of people's
head people like grass as well see I've
got floored quite impressed that this
was a workshop that we did that's the
president of coop membership workshops
and this really cool fancy new place in
town and the receives our sister so if
anyone's seen these at conference before
when asked to start drawing what people
are talking about it's really creepy
because they come up as you were having
a conversation a little group and the
new wig and then they do run off and put
it onto this big wall but it looks
awesome and it was a much better way of
documenting what happened during that
that workshop rather than reams and
reams of text and minutes and agenda
co-op membership as well this five plus
one we realize it was confusing people
so to put into real value so you don't
spend 20 quid at the shop you get quid
back see you 20 P will go to the charity
and what's that pound equal to bars of
chocolates when I was on the plane
coming here I saw this map of the world
and I'd never seen the world like this
before I didn't realize that those bits
the top would touch to each other's like
that's not very crude China is it Russia
I don't know I've never seen it because
usually it's one big
like flat one or you just see it from
England and it kind of stops either side
doesn't it you don't really see that
since I'm it really interesting to see
things from a different point of view
and get some revelations from it if you
go onto our blog you can see some of the
other ways that we visualize and stuff
around carp digital well I'd like you
guys to do is to go back to your themes
and find your own way visualization is a
really powerful thing it can give you
the opportunity to highlight problems
with your metrics with your process with
the way that you're explaining things to
other people how do you see things how
do they see things gather together get
stuff out the head and find your own way
of visualizing your project thank you so
they'll go to questions you can come and
chat to me at the end if you do or you
can send me a tweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
