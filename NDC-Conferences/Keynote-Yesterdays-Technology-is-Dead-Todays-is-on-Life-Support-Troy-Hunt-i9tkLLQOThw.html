perfect wasn't it jetpacks and
hoverboards didn't quite work out that
way thanks very much for having me back
here guys this is the the third year
third time arrive come back to MDC and I
was like some of you know I'm from
Australia which is a long way away from
everywhere and what I go away my kids
sort of go well where are you going you
know what are gonna do and I have to
tell them that every time I go away in
particularly every time I come to
although its enormous ly hard work I get
very little time to relax or have any
fun the only thing I've really done here
is prepared my talks worked hard I've
done workshops user groups I can't
remember having any any actual downtime
it's never never much fun always hard
work kinda Lazlo isn't it I do
eventually fall off I don't show the
kids this otherwise they'll go what but
one of the things I do try and do with
the kids I've got little kids there
they're three and six years old and I
like to find out a little bit about the
place that I'm going to before I go and
I tell them you know this is this is
where daddy's going so I was looking for
some information around this part of the
world being sort of a Scandinavia
Northern Europe area and I found some
really interesting information about
Donald Duck I don't know a lot of you
people may not know this
it's actually about Sweden and what I
found is that in Sweden they love Donald
Duck so much they actually had to make
it illegal to vote for him is this true
found it on the Internet apparently it's
true something odd about sweetie is
there any Swedish people here oh
but my kids are looking at this and
going why on earth would you vote for
some crazy angry irrational character
called Donald and
i-i think sweden may be on to something
here that we may be able to actually
learn from across the rest of the world
hello international visitors but as i
said my kids are three and six and i was
sort of interested in in the way
technology is for them now compared to
when I was that age and I was born in
the 70s and I look back at how things
were in the 70s
slow disco apparently in the 70s I don't
remember a lot of what happened in the
70s but in the 70s people were actually
starting to get online now it wasn't
modern day internet like we think of
today but there was the concept of being
able to connect to online services now
one of the interesting things is that
back then and even into the 80s and got
part of the 90s getting online was a
process you got online so these days we
are online right so we're online at home
as we drive to the office we're online
because we've got 3G 4G all this sort of
thing and then we get there and we're
still in line so much more of a process
back in the 70s and 80s and I thought
I'd find a little bit of information I
found this interesting video this is
from a UK television program called
database and we've got Julian and Pat
here and Julian and Pat have got one of
these old press tell computers
everything is very beige in the 70s too
isn't it
Julian was beige the wallpapers beige so
anyway these guys are going to get
online I'm sure this sort of video about
what it took to get online back in the
70s the computer asking me if I want to
log on and it's now telling me to phone
up the main press l computer which I'll
now do
it's a very simple connection to make
extremely simple and I can actually
leave the modem cut plugged in once it's
done this without affecting the
telephone I'm now waiting for the
computer to answer me and asked with a
tone and then I just flick a switch on
the modem and replace the receiver and
things are starting to have the finger
starting to happen
the presto computer is now asking me to
enter my own personal password which
I've now done now there are multiple
very interesting things about this so
first of all they're on a computer but
they're on the TV right so one of the
things about early computers is that you
didn't have like these nice flat-screen
monitors you didn't even have dedicated
screens you would go and you'd use a TV
sometimes it would be color TV in the
70s and end of the 80s that's what these
guys are doing so I found that sort of
interesting you saw a reminder this is
how it used to work the other thing is
it's a very simple connection isn't it
so all you have to do is pick up the
handset and then on your rotary dial
telephone and back again and then the
computer talks to you with all those
squeals and beeps and then you hang it
up after you've got all the plugs just
right and this is what it meant to get
online there's one other thing there at
the end which which struck me as a
security guy it's kind of interesting as
well and just in case you didn't quite
see it let's let's give it a little bit
of slo-mo this is where Julian entity's
password
what you record is possible it is so
even though the computers have changed
fundamentally the one thing that we
still continually screw up is their
password so this stuff hasn't changed we
still have this problem well into today
so it's interesting how some stuff
changes fundamentally and other stuff we
just have got the same old problems same
old tech but this machine that Julian
was using here is called a pressed L and
that the pressed L was a very early
machine quite obviously and it was one
of the very early experiences of getting
online and when you got online with the
pressed L it could communicate that 1200
board now many people probably don't
know what a board is we don't talk about
a board anymore there are a million
boards in a megabit so when we think
about megabits per second and if we got
one megabit per second today we'd go
sweet crap that is still about a
thousand times faster than what you're
getting with the Presto so that's how
fundamentally different our connectivity
has changed but what's really
interesting is you look at connectivity
today and and some of the places that we
get it and the sort of speeds that we
get so a really good example is you can
be on a nice modern plane today like an
a380 and you can have Wi-Fi in the sky
which when you think about its kind of
amazing right
it's like you're flying through the air
across continents and you can have Wi-Fi
which is just magical yet some people
complain that it's crap what is wrong
with these people that's still 70 times
faster than what a press tell could run
70 times faster than what you got with
that very simple connection while you're
at home and it's really interesting how
fundamentally different our views of
connectivity have changed I'm from
Australia so our views the connectivity
aren't real good down there but it's
very very different now of course the
reason we're able to do this the reason
we're able to be at 40,000 feet doing
900k an hour and communicating over the
Internet is because mobile right so
mobile we know has gotten very big
and it's interesting when you look at
the way mobile has evolved and if we
think back to when we started seeing
mobile phones many of us can think back
to when we started seeing mobile phones
we've got a man we started seeing mobile
phones in the early 90s there's gonna be
a bunch of people in this room who
weren't born then which makes some of us
start to realize that Auto gettin but
there was this trend right so in the
early 90s we started with these big sort
of brick phones called and bricks so
they were literally the size of bricks
and some of them weren't much lighter
and then as we progressed we got smaller
and smaller and smaller and this was the
feature right like how small can my
phone be because now I can start to put
it in my pocket and they started getting
more fully featured they study getting
faster processes so by the time we got
through to the early 2000s we started
getting phones that not only could you
put in your pocket but they were
powerful enough to play snake which
meant now you had something to do on the
toilet as well right
because before you had something else to
do because before there was only like
one thing you could do in there or read
newspapers and this started to change
right we got smaller and smaller and
smaller and then we got to this period
in the early 2000s and we kind of
regressed quite a regress but on the
other hand we got even more powerful and
we got bigger and bigger screens and
this was great because as things got
more powerful and as we got bigger
screens we could do a lot more with it
and most of us you know we're technical
people for us this is fantastic like
nothing bad can come of having these
mobile phones with big screens other
people weren't so happy other people
said the problem we have now is nobody
talks to each other anymore everybody
sits there and they look at their mobile
phones and they don't talk to anybody
next to them and this is a problem that
we have never had before this is a brand
new thing but of course it's not it's
the same problem in that most of us just
like to sit here and ignore other people
same problem just manifests itself in a
different way when we think about mobile
phones and particularly when we think
about smart phones we probably think
about this so this is sort of the era
that we think about with smartphones all
kicked off with the iPhone in 2007 now
in jobs launched the iPhone he described
it very clearly introducing a truly
magical wonderful pretty amazing far
better amazing great amazing that's
basically Steve Jobs Cana right
beautiful beautiful beautiful thank you
everyone applauds everyone applauded
anything to Steve Jobs when he launched
the iPhone in 2007 not everyone thought
it was quite so magical Steve Jobs goes
to Mac world and he he pulls out this
iPhone what was your first reaction when
you saw that $500 fully subsidized with
the plan that is the most expensive
phone in the world and it doesn't appeal
to business customers because it doesn't
have a keyboard which makes it not a
very good email machine so allegedly the
iPhone was no good but in Steve
Ballmer's defense you've got to think
about where he was coming from Windows
Mobile had a good solid market share
throughout the early 2000s it was a good
device that it will and he believed that
was the way forward Windows Maibaum who
he has windows mobile phone I found him
he's over he's the guy she got a photo
or something later sent the Microsoft 11
I found the windows good but in all
seriousness obviously Ballmer didn't
read that market particularly well and
it's actually interesting seeing these
two guys together seeing Steve Jobs and
Steve Bauman because we have to look at
jobs and we say well Jobs was the
showman right like he was the person
that could excite the crowd and get
everyone engaged like no one else could
and he particularly did that around the
iPhone era around 2007 and into the iPad
urine and Jobs was very good at that but
people forget that Ballmer was very very
good at that a long time before the
iPhone even launched ladies in general
I'm gonna mean it stay there cuz he does
go on a little bit this was Microsoft's
25th anniversary in 2000 and was
enormous ly excited about this
you can still going yeah you can find
Steve online you go to you have a Google
YouTube and you search for our monkey
dance and this is what has become known
as is the monkey dance but he did
certainly get people excited
Steve's no longer with Microsoft he's
he's moved on but it's quite a sort of
an interesting era this whole time when
we started getting these mobile devices
and particularly when that iPhone sort
of arrived and we started to get this
really competitive market space around
phones and phones these days are very
competitive right like everybody is
trying to get their product out there
and they're trying to have these points
or differences but it's not just phones
it's accessories as well and there are a
lot of phone accessories out there
competing for market share and it's
really interesting when you start to
look at what some of these accessories
actually do so for example I found this
one now you know how the theory is that
we need all-in-one devices and someone
has looked at the marketplace and said
well we've got one device that does
email Twitter Facebook another device
that does perfume why is this like why
can't we combine these two things
together and have a per phone it's like
oh it's a purr fun now if you're a guy
looking at this going well this looks
really good but what's out there for me
you know this is a very feminine sort of
product you can get per phone for men as
well so goes both genders which is which
is nice they're being very inclusive if
you're looking at this and thinking well
I still can't figure out how do I put
perfume on myself with my phone they've
got this little video and we've got this
guy he's talking on the phone here he's
having business meeting he goes I might
smell a bit you know it maybe we
should fix this he grabs the phone turns
around
and then he sprays it on his neck which
is fine and then he smells his wrist I
don't know why maybe someone who
understands perfumes and things better
than me can explain that but this is a
thing that per phone so this sort of
accessories for mobile has become a
really big marketplace and of course one
of the really big things in the
marketplace for phone accessories is the
selfie stick someone recently went
around they took all these movies with
guns in them and they replaced the guns
with a selfie stick so it's like now we
got our knee and he never looks as scary
right when it's just selfing John Wayne
I like the Hello Kitty phone cover as
well I think that's a nice touch the
problem is that selfie sticks are just
bloody annoying right
they are absolutely painful seeing
people try to use them and they're so
annoying that they've started to get
banned in a bunch of places so for
example in theme parks so you go to a
lot of theme parks now you're not
allowed to have a selfie stick
it's banned which is good we support
that so with zoos a lot of zoos are
banning them now I particularly like
this shot because this guy has obviously
been so pissed off with the ban on the
selfie sticks he's taking his own selfie
stick to take a photo of it next to the
sign about no selfie sticks but he's not
selfie with that he's using another
phone to take one of the phone on the
end of the selfie stick which is taking
photo the monkey which is a nice little
little gesture on his part I guess now
what are the other things that we see a
lot on the Internet is people want to
involve their pets and everything rights
and we often think about cats being sort
of the canonical internet pet there are
a lot of people out there that want to
be able to combine things like the
selfie with their pets so you can get a
device like this there's a pooch selfie
right and what you do is you clip it on
the top of your phone you put a ball on
the phone and then the dog really
intently stares at the ball and it looks
like he's looking at the camera look at
the dog like he's focusing right
this thing works so we're involving our
pets in this way now dogs is an
interesting one too because dogs have a
bit of a history with the internet
everyone thinks it's catch this there's
an interesting sort of historical very
poignant point where dogs made an
appearance about an observation of
Internet anonymity as in this cartoon so
in this cartoon this was in 1993 in The
New Yorker
it says on the internet nobody knows
you're a dog and this was a very
important observation at the time
because in 93 there are very very few
people on the internet very early days
and what the New Yorker was saying was
that when you go on the internet you can
be anybody right it doesn't matter what
race or gender or sexuality you are
doesn't matter if you're Swedish any of
these things you can be anyone you like
and think about it back then right we
suddenly went well this amazing we've
got this anonymity we can go online we
can chat to people on the other side of
the world we can pretend to be whoever
we want to be and we thought that was
fantastic and and we got away with that
for about 20 years
and then this Evan right so now
has it about 2013 courtesy of Snowden
leaks we realized that not only does the
NSA know you're a dog they know what
type of dog you are they know which
other dogs but you sniffing I saw the
dog feed you like they know everything
about you and what we found was it
actually the opposite of what we thought
in 93 it's not that we have more
anonymity we actually have a lot less
anonymity than what we ever had before
so we're sort of coming to grips with
this issue of privacy on the Internet
and how do we deal with the fact that we
want to have privacy and be a dog or
whatever we want to be but we also want
to be able to have communications now
it's not just the NSA in government's
either so we've seen other cases where
our online privacy has been seriously
eroded so I've seen things like this
last year so this was actually Madison
and what happened with Ashley Madison is
in August last year Ashley Madison which
is a website designed for you to have an
affair like that is the only reason it's
there it's not a porn site it's not a
dating site it is there to have an
affair so they got hacked and they had
about thirteen million records of people
exposed publicly really sensitive data
so things like your sexuality your
preferences once you are in the bedroom
with the person that you're seeking all
these really sensitive things and Ashley
Madison obviously had a really hard time
of this because people now no longer
wanted to use the service and they said
okay what we got to do is we've got to
come up with a way of regaining people's
trust so how do we get people's trust to
come back to the site and create
accounts and I want to show you what
they did I've got a demo this because
you won't believe it unless you see it
so what I'm going to do is just jump
over this other machine and we're going
to create an Ashley Madison account now
when I want to prepared for this I
forgot my wife was going to be in the
audience too this is a research account
research alright so here's what we're
gonna do on Ashley Madison we got to
start by choosing what we're gonna be
and we'll try and make this a little bit
realistic we'll be in a touch mail so
you can females and then what's going to
happen is it takes us over the next page
we got to start filling out data so we
sort of FETs
this we put in a bunch of rubbish here I
don't think they care too much about
passwords after what happened to them
putting whatever we want we can be
Norwegian we'll just work in a postcode
here fat finger that that will do limits
limits limits going to be all cyber
affair
and then we just fill in I don't think
any of this really matters for these
purposes and that guy full-sized come
here come on and then we fill in some
info here which I'm sure that's a
perfectly valid email address and we go
to the next screen now the problem is is
that we've got to have anonymity but
we've also got to have a profile picture
right and this is where it gets tricky
so what we're going to do is we'll take
a profile picture so that looks perfect
we'll say that now don't worry darling
you'll see the anonymity thing in a
moment that's fine so we'll save that
you Inc now we go over here and we add
the discreet photo but this photo is not
actually discreet yet we're going to
make it discreet and this is the magic
of what Ashley Madison have created so
what we do is we position this in the
right spot and then what we're gonna do
is we're gonna choose should we be Zorro
let's be Zorro right and we can actually
oh man that doesn't work very well in
this machine what you can actually do is
you can position the mask so you drag
the mask over the eyes and then you grab
the handles and you stretch it so it
covers your eyes and then it's no longer
me you become like a Zorro that's the
answer to anonymity which is kind of
Awesome that's a shame I can't drag it
but just like go home tell your wife
you're gonna do research it will be
telling your wife because it was only
ever men that signed up to this thing in
the first place and then suddenly you
can be anonymous
alright so that's what Ashley Madison
tried to do and you know look it's an
interesting sort of approach but
I probably wouldn't suggest doing that
with your real email address and credit
card details which is what a lot of
people did and it didn't work out real
well but in terms of of privacy online
on the one hand we sort of look at this
and go well the NSA is in our things
like Ashley Madison and all these
websites are getting hacked they're
leaking all of our other things it's all
bad news right
except it's not entirely bad news
because we've got stuff like this so
anyone know what is all this having
common encryption encryption exactly
encryption everywhere and they're
different types of encryption because
when we pull out something like the
iPhone right the iPhone has got
encryption and storage so we just saw
the FBI have a really hard time of
trying to decrypt a terrorists iPhone
they had to end up paying one and a half
million dollars to decrypt the guy's
phone now I'm quite okay with that it's
interesting because a lot of people sort
of said well this is terrible
Apple's got a vulnerability you can
crack the encryption on the iPhone it's
like yeah if you spend one and a half
million dollars so I'm not worried about
that because the FBI can't guns been one
and a half million dollars on
everybody's phone I've got to just spend
it on the phones that are important to
them so I find gets it we also get it on
modern day Androids on hardware that
will support it encryption in storage
whatsapp and iMessage get encryption
end-to-end so if I have a chat with any
of you on whatsapp or iMessage eating
Crips my device that goes all the way
through the wires and the computers and
everything in between
gets to your device and then Adi Crips
which is awesome because nobody in the
middle can actually read the traffic the
best bit about all these things though
because we've had encryption for a long
time but the best stuff about these is
this everybody gets it you don't have to
do anything you just pull the phone out
and you've got encryption as soon as
that phone comes from Apple or comes
from whichever provider is putting
Android on it you get this encryption
and not only does everybody get it but
you don't notice it right you just don't
feel it like any viewer that iPhone it's
not like gee it's running a bit crap
it's got encryption like that doesn't
happen it's a really low friction
process these days and it's interesting
when you look at the other sorts of
encryption we've had over the years so
we've had things like PGP email I'd ask
who actually uses PGP email but it's
going to be like one person with a beard
and that would be it because it's
actually really really hard to do
because you've got to exchange keys you
got to have the right client it's a pain
in the ass but those devices and those
chat clients all do it by default and
you don't even notice it now that's
awesome but it also creates this odd
sort of disparity Oh show what I mean if
I was going to have say face time with
Ted face time we'll enter in encrypt so
I can talk to a teddy wearing a bra on
his head and and I get encryption from
end to end if you were say Gordon Gekko
and Wall Street and you're doing share
trades over a normal telephone you get
no encryption and I know that the Wall
Street movie was in the 1980s but it's
exactly the same now which is kind of
the reason why I put it in there so this
very sort of social easy chatting that
happens with whatsapp iMessage FaceTime
all this sort of stuff gets you this
beautiful security and all the important
things we're doing is business by
default don't because you don't
generally tend to do your share trades
over what's that so we've got an odd
sort of disparity there with the way
these devices are working and and what's
interesting is you look at these things
and these phones are sort of everyday
items like we know how to use the phone
we pick it up and make a call and now
these things are sort of happening
happening implicitly in the background
and it got me thinking about how our
expectations of technology are changing
now give you a good example have a look
at your TV and particularly if you've
got kids have a look at your TV now if
they're little kids few years old what's
going to be all over the TV fingerprints
because they're trying to drag things on
the TV they're trying to pinch and zoom
they're trying to pause the TV by
clicking on the TV because that's what
they used to so this is what my TV looks
like
fortunately not quite as colorful but
it's got all these fingerprints all over
the thing because that's the way the
kids have become accustom to interacting
with devices so for my son who's six the
first device he interacted with would
have been an iPhone or an iPad he's
never known a time without a screen that
he can just touch and do things and I
was thinking the other day you think
back to when I was his age and you think
about how I interacted with TV the big
thing that I always heard from my
parents was don't sit too close to the
TV they say you get square eyes if you
sit sit close to the TV and now we're
just trying to strap them onto our face
we have gone the other way and that's
not one TV either that's two TVs
strapped right onto your eyes which is
kind of awesome but it's completely
different to what my parents always told
me about what TV will do to my eyes so
we're sort of entering this era where we
don't necessarily know how the device is
going to behave my kids don't know what
they can touch and what they can't touch
in order to interact with and frankly I
don't either and I see other people do
this so I've got two laptops there one I
can touch the screen when I can't
sometimes someone comes up and they
touch the screen that you can't touch
and they go what's wrong with your
machine this is broken and these days
even when you go and pick a machine up
you're not actually sure what you can do
with it
I had this just the other day I had I
had a friend's machine and I'm very
carefully bending the lid back and I get
to like 180 degrees and then I'll let go
but again this one will do that that one
won't so the technology is constantly
changing and we're not actually sure
what to expect that's it's one thing for
us as adults and we've seen this
evolution of technology and we've seen
the earlier days where screens didn't go
all the way back and you couldn't touch
them it's different for kids though that
haven't sort of gone through that
transition and they haven't known many
of the technologies that all of us know
inside and out and have used for many
many many years and I thought I should
do a test
what I'll do is I'll grab my
six-year-old and I'll give him a piece
of technology that all of you will
recognize intimately and I'll see if he
knows what it is all right how old do
you know Harry six so have you ever seen
one of those no you don't know what it
is it's a floppy disk it's not what
about this that is and what do you do
the USB yeah you put files on all right
oh and did you know we used to use
floppy disks before we had USBs but
these USB sticks can now hold up to 700
thousand times northern floppy disk it's
amazing and it's true he had never seen
a floppy disk before but not only had he
not seen one I actually couldn't find
one I was looking all through my
cupboard and I got so much crap in my
cupboard I'm sure many of you dislike
cables and old drives and things like
that and I couldn't find a floppy they
asked my wife and she eventually found
one from like 2001 or something with the
university assignment so he hadn't seen
the floppy anyway but equally when I
said at the end of this the USB stick
can now hold seven hundred thousand
times more than a floppy you can get
devices like this this is a Kingston
HyperX predator now first of all is that
not an awesome name for USB Drive right
like if you're shopping for drives and
there's a predator and there's just like
just one terabyte disk you know what are
you gonna do get the predator so that is
a one terabyte thumb drive which is kind
of amazing right to fit like one
terabyte on a thumb drive but I reckon
it's actually more amazing that you can
now fit 256 gigabytes on a micro SD card
so that's a car the size of your thumb
and you can fit a quarter of a terabyte
on it you could swallow a micro SD card
and not even notice it I wouldn't
swallow the predator but that looks like
it could choke a donkey that one so
don't give that a go
so you can fit an enormous amount of
data on these things which of course has
made the floppy drive redundant right we
just don't use them anymore and that's
why I read not recognize it he had never
seen it before he didn't know what it
was but the funny thing about it is that
he had seen the floppy disk before in
fact he'd used the floppy disk many many
many times but what he didn't realize is
that every time he used it it was an
icon so kids are still using these in
the iconography has lived on well beyond
what had actually implied now of course
these days we click on a floppy disk and
it is saving on to the hard disk which
is sinking via Dropbox to the cloud and
replicating instantaneously across all
their machines but the same icon means
the same thing but the kids these days
it's got no idea what it means
now floppy disks were obviously a pretty
pretty sort of integral part of
everything we did particularly all the
way through until probably the first
half of the 2000s and one of the things
that we use floppy disks for extensively
that was for games so ever I remember
doom if you're around as a kid or an
adult in the 90s you would know doom
doom launched in 1993 - floppy disks -
1.44 megabit for Peters a lot of
webpages are bigger then the entire
first-person shoot him up with all these
virtual worlds and aliens and things
like that so it's a massive sign of the
times to see how much this has changed
but doom itself continues to be a really
big part of popular culture and indeed a
big part of technology and what a lot of
people are doing with doom these days is
they're trying to get it to run in all
sorts of unexpected places so for
example you can run doom on a Canon
Pixma printer that is the tiny little
screen on the printer and these guys got
to run that the graphics aren't real
great granted but it's a freaking
printer screen which is kind of Awesome
now the significance of this is that if
you can run arbitrary
we're on a printer that has access to
device features imagine what you could
get you print sensitive documents you
scan sensitive documents sensitive
documents it has an internet connection
you know use your imagination you could
do a lot when you can start to rewrite
firmware on a printer now it's not just
printers we have seen doom run in other
places as well
you can run doom on an ATM how cool is
that there's a couple of Aussie guys
managed to get it working wouldn't that
be awesome you go to take money out if
you want a hundred bucks you've got to
take down an alien with the chainsaw 200
bucks shotgun four hundred dollars and
above BFG remember the BFG over days so
you can run doom on these machines but
the other big first-person shoot him up
back in the 90s was quake and you can
run quake on an oscilloscope
the graphics are a bit crusty admittedly
but I had no idea that an oscilloscope
could even do that people have managed
to get quake running on an ax source
code which is amazing so there's a lot
of hacking devices to do things that
they were never actually intended to do
and really there are no limits here that
people get very very ingenious so
there's a one a little while back they
found you could run something on a
coffee machine and you know you think
about what the coffee machine like this
does right it's got the TFT screen so
that you can choose whether you want
like a latte or a cappuccino espresso
and you interact with the screen and
then it controls the unit's inside and
it creates a coffee for you here's what
these guys got it to do
alright I won't do it anymore - I can't
do like a history of Internet stuff and
I hear it grow so they got to rick roll
the coffee machine which which is kind
of cool because like you think about the
way many of us feel about coffee never
gonna give you up never gonna let you I
won't do it all but but you could get a
coffee machine to actually be rickrolled
which is really really quite amazing
people must have a lot of patience to do
this as well like to reprogram a whole
coffee machine now the coffee machine is
able to do this because it's got enough
intelligence in it that it's got micro
processors and TFT screens on this sort
of thing and what we're trying to do
these days is build more and more
intelligence into pretty much everything
and we're trying to become more
contextually aware of what people are
actually doing and this does date back
some way so he saw Clippy for example
the much-loved much-hated Clippy which
would pop up in Microsoft Office 97
through 2003 with very insightful things
like this would you like help looks like
you're trying to write a letter and
people hated it because it always got in
the way and they killed it off Microsoft
even did a parody where they eventually
killed it and said clip he's now
unemployed he's gone that's it
and that the sentiment was good because
Microsoft said let's have a contextually
aware character that humans can relate
to and if they can relate to it then
maybe maybe it will be able to help them
do their work more effectively but they
killed Clippy turned out not to be such
a good thing for people but since then
we've seen a lot of other contextually
aware helpers so for example when you go
to Google and you do a search you start
to get a lot of suggestions and now
everybody probably sees this or
something probably quite similar to this
maybe a little bit different when you
search incidentally many of these are
true as well I don't says like there are
almost as strange as New Zealanders
which is quite interesting so you go in
you do a search it finds these sort of
things but what's interesting and this
is the bit that will freak you out is
you go to your home PC connected to your
home internet sign into Google and you
do a search and then you go and get
incognito version of Google go out over
like a VPN and do a search and see how
different the results are because it
knows so much about you and where you
are that it will tailor them very very
specifically and very often it's using
information it knows about you that's
actually quite sensitive so a helper
like this in Google has been quite
useful and and look it does work quite
well it does actually help you find
results that are close to match to what
you're actually searching for so that's
Google we've seen helpers come along
such as Syria as well so we got Syria
few years back and you can talk to Siri
and ask Siri a question and obviously we
still have Syria it hasn't suffered the
same sort of fate as clipping and Siri
kind of makes sense because when you
think about it you've got this little
device which doesn't have a very good
keyboard so you can't do stuff with it
and you can just talk to it and it will
recognize your voice that will go away
and find stuff the problem is though
that Siri doesn't really work well for
everyone it doesn't necessarily work
well for me and I I find this quite a
it's not a racist thing but obviously
it's an anti Australian sentiment via
Siri and frankly I hope it's Chuck's
turn into a news and kick its bloody
Danny door down because this sort of
thing is unacceptable I still have
trouble with Siri - Siri work in Norway
- the work for you guys
whereas I just go there's a lot of
shrugging so I'm going to take that as a
yes it is problematic in Norway as well
the thing about all these though so the
thing about Siri and Clippy and Google
is that they're not really artificial
intelligence per se they're more let us
give you some contextually aware help
which is okay but we're trying to move
more to an era where the machines
actually understand what it is that you
want to do and can interact in a much
more human-like way so we're trying to
move more towards AI now recently
Microsoft had a great idea and it was a
great idea they said what we're going to
do is we're going to create a tweet bot
and we're going to call it Tay
and everybody was very excited about the
idea of creating this tweet button
they're ecstatic because tey was
actually very very good at looking at
the way people talk on the internet and
replicating their behavior so take ad
stand up there and be like you're having
a chat with a real person on the
internet the problem came when it was
actually like you were having a real
chat with a real person on the internet
and tey went completely off the rails
how she managed to combine Bush Hitler
and Trump in one tweet is it is a little
bit beyond me but she did and she would
do stuff like this she got worse she
turned out to be quite sexist as well
she learned how to swear and the real
problem is that Microsoft actually did a
really good job at building a human-like
artificial intelligence tweet bot and
this is kind of the paradox of it
because you look at this and you go well
first of all you don't really want
anyone talking like this on the Internet
second of all you really don't want it
coming from an official Microsoft
account that's not gonna be a good look
but she was good at replicating the
behavior that she saw but this is now
the problem right because you've got to
create artificial intelligence that can
not only behave like people but also
knows when they're being assholes so it
can try not to replicate that behavior
now all of this is part of this big push
to add more intelligence to everything
that we do so how can we make the
devices smarter more contextually aware
how can we make them interact with
people and one of the things that we've
been doing particularly over the last
few years is going towards this thing we
call the Internet of Things this is a
very early IOT device aha and the idea
of the Internet of Things is that we
should just connect everything up
together right it's like this is just a
normal old utilitarian device let's
connect it to the Internet and then it
will just magically be better now I
thought what I should do is go away and
find some of the things
we're creating that our IOT devices and
show them to you here now frankly I
think IOT goes very well with 8-bit
Benny Hill because it is a comedy of
devices and you look at some of these
and the mind boggles a connected
pregnancy test what precisely is the
kind I have seen how these work they are
not complicated I don't know what adding
Internet to that actually does the smart
umbrella what do you reckon that does
it's like how how does an umbrella where
you walk outside you get wet you put it
up it's like that's it I don't know what
connecting the umbrella to the Internet
is actually going to do I've actually
got no idea and the problem is is that
we see so many of these internet devices
coming out that you no longer know if
it's actually legitimate or not because
you're not sure how crazy the whole
thing will get I'll give you an example
I saw this one recently the wank Bank
the first gadget for the wearable tech
era that allows men to love the planet
by loving themselves now I'm not sure if
in Norway the word wank is very common
so here's a little bit more information
about how it works the band contains a
valve with a small weight inside that
generates and stores energy when moved
in an up and down motion
and we all know what exercise does that
move right now just plug any device you
need to charge into the USB port on the
banned smartphone laptop camera tablet
and voila you are creating dirty energy
that's terrible the thing that most
offends me is the dirty energy joke I
have seen real IOT things that are less
believable than this and and this is
what's so crazy about it because you're
just not sure anymore like what is the
point at which you suspend belief and
call the whole thing a hoax now these
are what we might call traditional IOT
devices
I mean they've only been around for a
couple of years but there's what we
expect of IOT but there's this new
subclass of IOT which is now emerging
which which is quite different to the
other IOT devices we've seen now I'll
explain it like this if you have ever
had a baby or your partner has had a
baby you may have heard the theory that
if you play music to the baby the baby
will be born smarter than if you didn't
and assumably you don't play them and
you play Beethoven or something like
that and as reasonable people we might
say okay I can get that because it sort
of stimulates the brain
so maybe what that means is the lady
sits down on a comfortable couch
somewhere you turn the stereo up
Beethoven plays magic happens maybe if
you're adventurous you get like
headphones and you put them on the belly
and you play the music
but IOT has got an answer that is much
more direct than any of these options
and this is a new era of IOT called IOT
insertable z' now in case the mechanics
of that you're sitting here going hang
on a second is this what it looks like
they do have an infographic and this
this is where we're going so this is the
subclass of IOT called IOT insertable
now we laugh at this because there is an
element of this which let's face it as
kind of amusing
but there's probably a science to it as
well and it's kind of amazing what you
can do with IOT these days some of the
guys down here we're looking at this guy
at least I never have to use it there's
an IIT for you as well and I had seen
cert of a few as well now this is not a
thermometer you put in your mouth I
cannot understand the gymnastics of how
you would use this nor do I really want
to put my phone in this region but there
is an IOT device for taking your
temperature it is a class of IOT
insertable device now what I find really
interesting about all this stuff you
know the sort of uncomfortableness
having the punt the emotionally
uncomfortableness of these sort of
devices is that they do have really
useful medical purposes and their
purposes which we didn't really see
coming and I kind of think back to these
guys I think back to Julianne and Pat
and Julianne and Pat were there in the
late 70s early 80s with their prosthetic
computer connecting to the Internet and
back around that era there are a lot of
predictions about what online life would
look like in this sort of age in 2010
2020 beyond and arthur c clarke in
particular had lots of interesting
observations that came true so he said
in his predictions that everybody would
have a computer in the home and they
would talk over connections into bigger
computers of which there'd be many in
the world but they'd be sort of these
central ones like internet servers and
he said we will also have the ability to
work from home because we'll have these
machines and they can talk over the
internet he did not would be the
incident at the time but that's what
ultimately happened he also said we have
social networks we'd be able to
communicate with other people but all of
these things are very sort of high level
motherhood kind of objectives and I
don't think that Julian and Pat ever saw
the detail of what would come they never
saw the detail of all the IOT things are
the insertable 's
and this is what kind of gets me a
little bit excited about what we're all
doing here at NDC in terms of learning
and the things we're building and I
think about what my daughter who's three
years old will see in the future so I
was about her age and Julianne and Pat
we're doing their thing with the
connections and the really cool thing is
I got no idea what she'll see we can
take broad predictions so there'll be
autonomous cars and all this sort of
thing but we've got no idea what the
actual detail will be and I hope if
nothing else out of this talk seeing
some of the things that have evolved
over time from that pulsating point back
in the late 70s you sort of realize that
we have this awesome opportunity now to
create the future in ways that we'd
never predicted and this is the best
place to start so you guys now have
three days to go and learn totally
awesome things and build stuff that we
had never expected to see thanks very
much everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
