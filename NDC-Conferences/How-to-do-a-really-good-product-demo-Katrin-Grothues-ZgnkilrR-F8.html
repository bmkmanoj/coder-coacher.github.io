going to start first of all I'm really
glad to be here I know that's hard core
developer conference so it's really cool
that also product owners get the chance
to share experiences and I'm also happy
to see so many people here and a nun
developer talk not about some languages
I don't understand these it's really
like trivial product demo and product
owner work em yesterday I have been on
the cruise on the cruise ship now it has
been this afternoon or night event and
people were telling me about that stage
you can see actually that it is hanging
here and down there is 10 meters of
nothing and then comes the the ground
and I think it's not good to fall down
but actually I'm not that afraid of
heights so but I was a little bit like
oh my god or is going to happen to
tomorrow ok but I think I hope I would
survive that ok cool I want to talk to
you about the product demo product demo
a meeting where you as the scrum team
has the chance to inform all the company
about the great achievements you you
reached within the last iteration and I
will hopefully give you some valuable
information today about my experiences
I'm not a professional speaker and I'm
not a consultant but that's good for you
because I don't have to sell anything I
get my salary I don't have to get like a
new contract of someone of you ok but
I'm also not professional speaker so
perhaps I'm not that that perfect as
someone else in this talk and these
conference today so first of all I will
give you valuable information about
second i will also give you time because
i think i won't take an hour and i
learned something really important in
working in the scrum team don't waste
peoples time at totally often have
struggles with my team do we really need
that meeting and I will so I learned
that developers time is the most
precious asset of a company has so I
guess we will be finishing earlier
and if you have questions you can ask
them directly or you can do that later I
don't care okay so let's start first
question to you who likes to go on
holidays okay i hope that and who likes
to do something like this like a nice
beach holiday just relax have a nice
hotel perhaps see something new but
really like have nothing to care about
okay also lots of people so now comes
the interesting part how do you choose
the right hotel because that's what you
want to see right on this picture but no
um sometimes you see rather this so you
come to the place and think oops that's
not what i wanted to do that's not what
i booked what they promised me and as we
know that there's lots of people
struggling with this and spending lots
of money and lots of valuable time again
on their holiday and then they come to a
place and looks like this that's where
we come in place my company which are
solid a check holidaycheck is largest
german-speaking a platform for hotel
reviews so whenever you want to go on a
early day you can check out the hotel on
our platform and to see what other
people have experienced there to check
if what the the hotel promises you is
really what it will be like in the end
we are focused on package travels so
it's not like booking.com where you buy
at the book the hotel and the trip and
the the plane and the transfer and
everything on your own but you just have
everything in one package so we have
more than four million reviews for
hotels and chips we are also the
german-speaking largest platform for
ship reviews black cruises we have 4
million holiday pictures and holiday
videos and we have a huge community
which is really really active in the
forum so whenever you have a question
like oh how much is the taxi from the
Dubai cruise and
crews platform to to the to the mall you
can ask them there and they will be
answered I guess in like five minutes I
think there are people sitting and at
home and waiting for questions and there
are lots of people active at
holidaycheck and you can also book we
have a huge online travel agency with
really professional people so that's a
little bit about the company and I work
in this company as a product owner and
scrum team so I joined the company one
year and in March last year last year so
I totally a.m. can remember my first
product demo joints printing was the
name it was on the tenth of march i
still remember that really well i was
really like 10 days in the company and
was also already there it was about
informing the whole company about the
achievements of the product teams
product department like i.t and product
and it was every step every two weeks
like really am attached to the sprint
iteration and all the company would
gather together and to get know what the
teams did in the last iteration I don't
know all the details of that meeting but
I still can remember the atmosphere we
were cluttered in a tiny little room
altogether they weren't enough chairs so
I was sitting on the windowsill there
was not enough air and it was really hot
inside and then we stared at the small
screen because holidaycheck has three
locations so we always have to do video
conference we were staring at this small
screen we were using a lousy hang out so
transmission was really bad you couldn't
see the other people and you couldn't
hear them so I cannot really tell you
what what products have been presented
in that meeting but I still remember
this one sentence from one of the POS he
was telling in front of the whole
company well you know the team did some
technical stuff it cost us like half a
sprint but to be honest I really don't
know why we did it and I was like oh my
god I had four years experience and aj
am development before so when i joined
the company i was a
product owner before and I was really
shocked I was shocked because of two
things the first thing was why the heck
is a pure not able to tell what well you
has something the team did and I'm not a
technical I'm a cultural science student
I studied geography tourism and economy
but I think I have some ideas about
techniques about technical stuff about
programming and if a day and the team
cannot explain to me why a technical
task is important and what value it
brings directly or later for our
customers we cannot do it so I expect
every pure to be able to tell why you do
the technical task as well so that was
the first thing I was shocked and the
second thing why I was shocked was the
practice really huge opportunity to tell
all the people in the company what cold
stuff the product teams did and they
should be proud of their achievements
and then they were giving such a lousy
show so these were my two weeks two
things I was coming in my mind and
perhaps to visualize a little bit I have
still slides from that time so that was
a slide presented in the product demo I
mean it is first of all it doesn't look
LA and look nice that's the one thing
but I'm as I'm Kreider like not so
emotional person I really focus on
contents and not so much on the optical
stuff and I'm not a designer as well so
I won't care that much but what does
ready mean I don't know what does X
means no idea and also the stuff which
is written there and I am a product
owner so I might have some more like I'm
a more familiar with the product talk
but imagine there's someone from the
offline marketing sitting there and he
he reads such a chart and okay what did
the team do I don't know and then what
will he do with the team do in the
future that was the future tasks slide
to give an outlook on the road map so it
wasn't really telling um and no wonder
people didn't like to attend at that
time so neither people from the other
apartments like to attend nor that the
POS really like to present it was like
going to the dentist as a product demo
again or and it's like oh it's starting
half an hour I need to prepare I need to
prepare or just put some things together
and then then it's fine so um I was in
the company for ten days then and you
know there's this small window the time
window when you'll join a new company
the small window where you are allowed
to ask stupid questions so I went to my
manager and asked what do you really
want to achieve with that damn meeting
and are you really happy with it because
I think it wasn't such a good show and
he was like where was chief product
officer at that time yeah you're right i
totally don't like it as it is like now
but I don't have any idea how to change
it but but you could do it and I was
like gosh now I have a job why couldn't
I just keep my mouth shut go to my team
work on my little product on our stuff
and don't take that huge task I was
really nervous at that time because you
know you'd enter accompany you and
prohibition phase and then they expect
like the Holy Grail now because we I
have been in a company which is quite
known for its agile development in
Munich so I expected they I thought they
would expect me to have like the blue
print out of the box here it is just do
it and everything is fine and i didn't
had it i just knew that did this was not
going to work so i was thinking how
could i get rid of it hmm i don't want
to quit after 10 days already so that
thought well just get on the challenge
try to do it and get the best out of it
so then the first thing i did was i am
like every good product on a death what
are the requirements so i went to my two
main stakeholders was the chief product
officer and also the chief technology
officer to make things a little bit more
complicated you have the product owners
reporting to the CP 0 and the devs to
the CTO but both are really main
stakeholders for the soul product demo
stuff and they don't get along that well
and they don't always agree so I had to
Claire
five of them what do you really want to
achieve with the product demo or some
some meeting like this so but I could
come up with these things first of all
everyone in the company should know what
was happening as you saw we are an
online platform so our business is
taking place on a website and we have
customers as a b2c product we have
customers using our website and
frequently they call and they ask
questions and it would be nice if even
the customer service people would know
what is on the page and also to tell the
marketing girls and men what we are
doing so that they are also informed and
can align their marketing requirements
so that was the first thing the second
thing is showing user value not only
showing or we did that product we have
now a button that's really cool yeah but
why why is this button there what should
we what is the aim what is the value for
the user also for the company there is a
second thing showing one number what is
this product driving so what number can
this product improve like is it
conversion rate is it like leads is it
just I don't know bounce rates exit
rates what is the most important thing
this product should improve and what is
really important it's not something you
can put money on but create trust when I
joined the company there was a huge
mistress in the product department from
all other departments like ah they never
deliver they always take time what are
they doing they don't know what they are
doing we know better so it was really
like micromanagement from other
departments into the product department
and also product was more like a
contractor I mean in this time people
from other departments will come to the
product on and say I need this doesn't
this and the product owner would say
okay I will do it there was also an
issue so to create trust that the scrum
teams really know what they are doing
and something which I will find
important is also to celebrate product
success often you you do something
really cool but you don't do say okay we
improved it gets got
next topic but it's all always important
to also have time to celebrate a bit but
then also important what does the
product demo does not do it's not about
discussing ux or design that needs to be
taken place before and with the your ex
and design guys for sure but also with
other departments we are not here to
discuss like is it really the right
colors is it really the right
interaction concept that's not the part
and the place for in the product demo
and it's not a place where / mm
stakeholders do the acceptance that also
needs to be taken place before or always
the core stakeholders should be always
involved deeply in the concept phase
already before so it's also not about
aligning requirements and it's not about
deeply analyzing numbers it's also
important to see if you have the whole
company there then you can't go in depth
I mean sometimes you know we are
professionals we are talking in our
language and even conversion rate isn't
telling former lots of people from other
camp from other departments they don't
know and we also have public relations
we have HR in this meeting because they
also should participate in what in the
developments so you have to explain when
you say or the conversion rate went up
ten percent what does it mean okay just
tell them okay ten percent more people
entering the booking form really put a
press the button book that's something
they can understand but they cannot
understand conversion rate or bounce
that's also heard something interesting
bounce word exit rate even product
people cannot really sometimes tell the
difference so you need to explain it in
another language and so you can you can
sum it up it should be really valuable
time for attendees so that was my secret
KPI when I started with that that
improvement count people outside product
IT attending the meeting and hopefully
the number goes up and it should also be
a pleasure for the presenters not the
dentist appointment but
thing you're looking forward to because
that is your stage for the whole team
and also for the product owner okay that
was I came up with that chart that was
also cooled one step forward and but
perhaps to sell show you a little bit
about the challenge even more and Holly
the check is around 350 employees which
is small compared to big companies like
Siemens or bush or whatever but it's
quite huge if you compared to smaller IT
commits with only an IT company what on
a production company it's three
locations and three countries it's
Germany with Monique its body coffin in
Switzerland and it's Poznan in Poland so
we always have to do these nice video
conferences we have 15 scrum teams which
is ok but we then have online marketing
offline marketing we have sales we have
key account management we have online
travel agency we have customer service
we have B to B and then we have for lots
of others and as you can see in our
nicely organized organogram we have lots
of people in lots of different
departments with lots of silos so that's
really not that easy so that was the
challenge but one really good thing I
could at least draw what does the
product demo should do and what does it
shouldn't do and that was also a huge
step forward so what did i do then I did
what lots of people do it also
developers I went on the internet and
checked out what others are doing
because I mean that's not a problem I am
the first person that has this problem
so I just went on to google and check
out what sprint review meeting and some
other stuff so then I came up with Jimdo
Jimdo does a team fellow tongue so they
gather every month the whole company and
the two founders to all the people about
the latest releases products and also
kpi's but Jim knows quite small and they
are all located in one place so perhaps
that's an idea but not not the blueprint
sure I came up with my cone
ethical but that's really like what
scrum says it's a sprint review and as
for the team and then I also saw
something interesting and home on pitch
last block he wrote that a demo can also
be like a small user test and just take
hoes are the users that was also quite
interesting but I could tell you I
didn't get the blueprint there was
nothing on the internet telling me oh
that's how you should do it as I said
I'm active in the agile software
development quite some time and I know
the PDCA from Deming so I said okay no
blueprint I need to start somewhere and
do it so plan I would draw a plan for
the next product demo I also talked with
people in the company got their
experience we have aj coaches scrum
masters also product owners from other
companies which huge experience so I had
an idea I just polished the idea and
then do execute it just do it have the
first run and then one thing which is
really crucial not only for product
development but also for internal
processes check get feedback from the
audience what did they like what they
did what did they dislike and then
adjust act so that's what I started with
the version 1 of the product demo first
of all I decrease the frequency so
instead of every sick two weeks we went
to every six weeks we have to two weeks
printed durations but unfortunately at
that time now it's changing but at that
time we weren't able to deliver new
products every two weeks first of all
the teams weren't sores fast due to
technology and yeah it was always hard
to work on stuff and second also
releases were painful so we didn't head
releases frequently and we didn't had
new products really coming out and as I
wanted to show what is um also here show
life products only that was a strict
rule only things on life no screenshots
no staging environment snow prototypes
only things on life so people could go
to their laptop after the meeting and
directly check out what was happening
and that is something i had so many
struggles especially with my CP oh the
day before the first product dame of the
first new product demo he came to me
Catherine do we really have this rule
country little bit soften it I mean
there's nothing we can present and then
I said to him I mean like product owner
to CP oh no we don't change it we stick
to that rule because otherwise we will
really like go back to old times so that
was the restrict rule only live products
then show the user / a problem and
numbers and as you saw in the first
place this is ugly charts they weren't
really nice and we didn't had a template
at that time so I created a template to
also force my colleagues into delivering
these am information as I said I'm no
designer I'm Kreider not so emotional
person strict German so that's what the
template looked like I did then myself
but it was a template which gave
guidance both to the people presenting
and to the people attending and it gave
has the most important stuff in it so
its customer problem customer value and
metrics and we also had a second
template for if you are doing testings
like a BTS or ABN tests you could put
your hair pipe author this they're also
line out shortly the different versions
are the different variants and then also
tell people what should happen what is
the aim of that or the idea if I do that
then we can increase the conversion rate
and by ten percent something like this
land live demo so that was the first run
and what I also did is I booked a bigger
room with enough chairs and enough air
and I also got some support from the IT
services so to set up more like
technical stuff so that is the feedback
wall we had a feedback wall in each
location so i was asking a scrum master
in each location to put
the feedback wall and that was standing
right behind by next to the door like we
have it here right now also like this
black no red orange and green butters
but what is important for me as the
owner of this meeting I need qualitative
feedback it was nice it was nice it's
nice to have that information but if you
tell me it's not it wasn't nice I didn't
like it.why and also I'd liked it why so
we got the feedback and it's as simple
as it is they just described masters
from the other locations just took a
picture and send it to me so that I got
feedback from all three locations what
was written there it was the template
was boring ok not surprising and it was
too much text I realized that as well
the whole meeting was too long we had
two hours and we really felt these two
hours we talked into technical language
and the meeting infrastructure sucked we
still used hangout and the connection
was really poor so that was something I
needed to take into consideration as
well so let's check what could we
achieve with the first version so the
initial version was everything was not
so nice what I think I could achieve in
the first version already was we could
at least inform the company because we
really stick to live product value and
problems and I'm so we could show also
the user value but the rest was really
like to be improved so back to Deming
act I got the feedback and then I got
back to my desk and started to figure
out what we should change and that's
what when version 2 came into place so
six weeks after some discussions with my
CP 0 again about the staff with the live
demo then also nice always discussions
with CP onct Oh should be show numbers
yes we should should we show numbers
which are not significant you know if
you are doing an ib tests and have that
run like for two days it's not
significant even if you are launching
new products you should at least have
that
one whole week better two weeks so
should we show numbers for prefer a be
test running for two days because then
it's not significant perhaps numbers are
good but then they change and there was
always a back and forth between that so
I had some discussions in between I also
went to my colleagues showed them my new
idea and so then I came up with the step
2 so we kept that but i changed the
template and I got my designer lead and
ask him for help and he was really eager
to help me because he also said ok it's
what wasn't wasn't really nice what we
had that back then so I did that I
improved the meeting structured sure so
I challenged IT services I said it's not
going to work like this we need to have
another solution and we changed from
hangouts to go to meeting which was
really really cool now because
transmission is much better and it's
also easier to share like presentations
and stuff so that was also working out
and now comes slides from version 2
first we had a starting slide for each
team really nicely presenting the the
team logo we have team logos for every
team for sure we have the holiday CI and
colors we have the canvas still with the
contents but shorter also to force the
colleagues we need to stick to what I
want to them to present and we had the
live demo again so then was time to
gather feedback again and there was
still stuff to improve but that's good
unclear kpi's so people didn't really
know what was the the numbers about and
they are what I just said which we
showed we shot numbers and people the
Papio was saying okay we have an
increase of ten percent but it's not
reliable yet because the numbers are not
significant and then the audience was
like okay so don't show it and then this
I got started again with the CPR on the
city or should we do should we do don't
ya like it is it was still too long and
still too technical so we did a slight
improvement but we didn't get the big
big step forward so again I went to my
desk and adjusted and came back with the
next version and the next version we
changed some smaller stuff we have an
improved presentation of the KPI so I
went back to my colleague from the
design department and ask him for help
until told him ok I need from some kind
of template so that the the pier the
product owners could put in their
numbers in a clear and easy way so that
all other people would understand
quickly what the improvement was about
and I had time boxed so each topic five
minutes and then we change to the next
topic so that we could also keep the
meeting as short as possible to not like
get into long talks and I also asked my
product owners to just try to eliminate
the tech talk which is not easy but it's
really important so we kept the template
and what was edit was this temperature
in result it's still quite a lot of
numbers but it's really in a nice manner
it was presented in a nice manner and
then we got feedback again and that was
the point where I thought ok things are
starting to work out because what was
the feedback then the TPS were too
detailed we didn't end we did a wrong
interpretation of KPIs why was that the
tipping point for me personally because
we went from discussing formats and
technical setup to discussing content to
discussing what was presented to really
the products which have been presented
and so that was for me the the point
where I realized okay people are really
paying attention to what we are saying
they are not just oh it's boring are the
template sucked oh I couldn't really
hear you now we could eliminate that
stuff and now people were I mean I got
feedback from from from marketing and
also from deaths from other department
from other teams you know you did it ib
tests but I think you set it up wrong or
could you can you really compare number
X with number that is it really correct
and we are digging too deep into numbers
couldn't you just put it on a higher
level and that was really a dread was I
was really so happy when I saw the
feedback walls at that time because now
we really did the huge step forward to
discussing really what was important not
the trivial stuff like the meeting set
up but what was important for this
company is are we doing the right stuff
and are we really improving or are we
lying to ourselves and I think that is
something which happens a lot of a lot
of companies it's only productions
presenting it at holidaycheck and also
my former company's product mighty where
you introduced Graham usually the fur at
first in the company they're being they
stop being transparent they tell you
what were we doing why are we doing that
what did we achieve what is the release
roadmap they really like they they they
justify why either investing time and
stuff and not and other stuff but no one
else does so I don't really know what
marketing is doing sometimes I get
newsletters because I'm also signed up
to our newsletter stuff as a private
person and I think oh cool we have new
voucher campaign going on I didn't know
that before and that's happenings in so
many companies that's only product IT
being transparent towards the company
but it's not coming back and that was
also something criticized I think it's
really it's totally true to criticize
that
and it's not only online marketing I'm
interested in but I'm also interested in
what is public relations doing for us
for example there's the international
travel meeting I'm ETB in Berlin it's
the biggest travel fair in the world I
guess and we have a stand there we have
a story we are presenting their we have
some bloggers events and stuff and I
didn't know that and it's really a pity
that because I want to participate also
on the work of the others because
everything is paying into the success of
the company so that was also a really
relabel feedback so what we could
improve because it was now really
available time for that indeed it was
still not that pleasurable for the for
the presenters but I really did a huge
step forward so I still adjusted and now
comes the the current version of our
product name we have now in place and we
are still improving on that for sure but
that was and I call it the new era
because we changed some things which are
really from my perspective huge changes
first of all we killed the template and
that was something i was a little bit
said about you know i gave birth to the
template even if my first initial
version was slightly improved but m the
the template has we had really good
reason because as you when you still
remember the fun of the first slides
where we had this ugly like bullet point
list the template should give structure
to the audience and but also for product
owners to really talk about the
important stuff like the user value the
problem and the KPIs and I was really
afraid that we would lose that now
because we could achieve that with the
template even if it's like it's not
given you room for creativity and
sometimes it doesn't really match all
the core requirements because we also
have kind of platform teams we have
featured teams so sometimes the team
said to drink a little bit to put in
through the template but still
it really it made sure that we would
talk about the important stuff so I was
a little bit afraid that we would lose
that and yeah if you have to kill your
baby it's always not so nice then we
gave the new strict rule like live demos
a live product still applies but the new
one only one number don't tell people
about the conversion rate the bouncer at
the exit rate and then the signup rate
only one number what is the most one the
one important number for this product
and if all departments present and that
was also a little bit political you know
my CP 0 and then I was asking him oh it
was would be so nice if we could also
have all the apartments presenting and
he said okay I will talk with the and we
have like many we have the product
department and the company and then we
have all the rest like marketing is on 1
and a 1 cm oh so they need to talk and
so the CPI went to the C Mon as Kate
would be nice if you could also present
see him all said okay yes then the heads
were being formed the team needs will be
informed in otra cooling down the
information and then I got the
permission to give some kind of training
so I entered I invited all my
stakeholders from the marketing
departments also from the public
relations and told them that is the
product name or we changed the name by
the way it's now holidaycheck demo to
make sure to make clear that it's for
everyone in the company not only for the
product department so I set up a meeting
I invited everyone and told them that is
the holiday tech demo that is the
information we want to present that's
the audience and would be so cool if you
could do it as well if you could just
take the opportunity to present us and
the whole company what you did and cool
stuff it's still an optional meeting and
we got some training as well there's
Florian milk some man who can really
talk well so we invited him and he got
training for the product owners and then
the big day arrived I was really nervous
because I was not sure how it would work
out with no template that was really my
fear sadly we didn't get any one from
the other departments so I would how it
works like is usually I send an email
around like 10 days before the big day
for the next holidaycheck demo asked
everyone so I'll product owners all
stakeholders do you have something to
present so I can put up again agenda
that's all I need and then I sentra man
and another room and another reminder
and then I'm like 30 minutes before the
meeting I get everyone I have all the
agenda mm points and I can set up the
agenda so I knew already that there was
no one from the other departments I also
told my CP oh that I was a little bit
sad about that and then comes again oh
yeah they didn't know that they could
and I was like okay why did they do with
this meeting but never mind and I was
really afraid about that no template
stuff but then came the big moment and
the first presentation from the first
team and what I saw was this I was like
wow that was so cool I mean you need to
have the the what the Peter prio was
telling and that was really did the
slide and he was telling okay we have a
problem we am the covino from our
customers that they can't see the forest
because there are so many words no
wooden and German saying there are so
many trees okay and then he was
explaining a little bit more what was
the problem but that was the chart and
the big advantage is that people were
listening because they hadn't read in
parallel if you have so many texts on
the slides you tend to read and you
don't listen anymore or you don't listen
so much and now there was nothing on the
slides and the people were listening to
what the pier was saying then we have
these charts or like Styles of these
charts
telling the one number and I guess that
lots of people attending that product
the holiday check demo can remember this
okay bounce rate minus fifty percent i
can remember that but going back to one
of the KPI charts where we had four or
six kpi's that's a little bit more
difficult then we also could really
improve on the meeting infrastructure so
as you can see here's little equations
this is passe none this is body coffin
this is monique and this is washer and
what shall we only have like three or
four people so they are not presenting
but they are taking part and if you then
switch on the presentation so I'm making
a little bit promotion for gotomeeting I
think there's lots of other tools doing
stuff like this but that is really
better that hangout can do so you have
here the still the video for the
locations and you have the slides and
what's also nice you can hear that was
portico from presenting you can see the
speaker that's also nice to see the
speaker not on hear a voice out of
nowhere and we have air and chairs and
room enough and my secret KPI these two
ladies this product a public relations
and this is offline marketing and they
were there and we're listening and were
interested I was really proud about that
and then we got feedback again and what
feedback was it's still only ITN product
presenting so the next demo will be in
four weeks I really really hope that we
will have more people from other
departments I also told my CP 0 to make
some promotion you know it's it's a
optional meeting so I cannot force
others I don't want to force the people
to present and there is also something i
really really like people were telling
we are too positive and i think if you
get this feedback that's a huge step
again because too positive we are only
showing the success stories in this
meeting I mean that's natural I as a
pure wouldn't go on the stage telling
all the company yeah we worked on a pro
that we spend some time and invested
money and it totally sucks that's not
something you want to do and you also
show only the positive numbers and as
every one of you know you can always see
something positive even if it's negative
you just have to show the right mmm zoom
in yeah and then sometimes you have good
numbers again am and what I really like
about that we need to be wanna be honest
to each other in within our like an
indoor in the company because we want to
learn we want to improve so even if we
have failure stories we want to talk
tell about talk about that to also have
learnings out of that and to share these
learnings with others and I think that's
really also a sign that we really moved
on and improved so that was yeah the
summary of where are we now so we really
need to involve all departments and we
need to start being honest but being
honest also means that they're don't
that they can't be a negative situation
for the team presenting some failure
story because that's also something i
experienced in this company the
long-term developers on the company they
denied to do testings they didn't you
unit tests or front like end-to-end
tests and why because they were saying
okay if the test fails my manager sees
that my coat wasn't good okay and then I
get another promotion and I was like oh
my god that's that's really something
you don't want to have in a company like
if you want to do adriel development so
it also applies to product owners and
through the scrum teams you need to have
a safe space to tell okay we did
something and it sucked and we learned
and we perhaps we learn this interaction
concept doesn't work our customers
cannot handle whatever but it can't be
that then the team will be like has has
bet has been
consequences after that so I'm also
that's really a huge step because you're
not talking with in the product IT
department but you are talking with
marketing as well and so we need to see
if figure out I'm not so sure if we
already made sure enough to have this
honesty on the whole company level off
we should start with being honest with
in the product IT department first and
then in an increase that are enlarged
that okay so that's where we are now
perhaps to just give em to sum it up a
little bit that was the first one the
initial version then there was my nicely
template then there was the design
polished one then we had the numbers too
many but at least a little bit nicer and
that where are we now we really want to
achieve improve on what we are we are
doing now and i think i'm not sure i
don't i don't expect you to take this
and go to your company and say okay we
need to do that it like this every six
weeks and we have we have live products
only and we have a nice gotomeeting or
if you if you need it i'm not so sure if
you don't have everyone on one place and
we have our prompt in there all
departments present and then we have the
customer problem and one KPI only I
don't expect you to do that but what I
wanted to tell you is if you have some
something which aren't working out well
if you think there's something we need
to improve start from where you are just
see what people do I have four processes
do I have what are my circumstances and
how can I improve on that that's what I
did that was the initial version of the
product demo how can I slightly improve
because i didn't had a blueprint and i
think no one of us has four problems
because they cannot be a blueprint out
of the in the internet every company is
different every team is different so
you need to step by step see what's
working out for you and the path isn't
always clear you cannot always see the
end and it's okay and to learn as you
saw this what what I just presented was
from March last year and the last
product demos in may so it's one year
and two months it took some time and I
really I got so much feedback I got
negative feedback and and try to improve
and try to improve so it's okay to to
have an idea to plan it to do it then
and to see that it's not working out as
you expected or that there's still
something which is missing that's
totally fine and so it's this culture of
continuous learning and I think in scrum
teams are quite good at that already to
improve the product I do we have
retrospective so you improve also team
processes but you can also apply that to
the whole company and also also managers
don't even know what was what is the
right thing in the very beginning and
the second thing is be a proud of your
achievements even if you sometimes think
that what the team did wasn't something
special be a proud of it and and create
also a nice and positive atmosphere
within the team I also remember one of
my one situation we had a really severe
back and it was going on for some time
and we really didn't know why the heck
it was happening and then there was
really by by chance we discovered the
issue and we could fix it and I was so
happy I was like yeah we did it and was
so cool and it's it was on a Friday we
have such a nice weekend now and the
deaths in my team were like yeah but we
don't know if it's really the root cause
and I could be that there is something
else for this problem but we did really
hmm we could we could solve one of the
big bricks and this problem be proud of
it and hits really they were so hmm
perhaps yeah but now we really did
something
great take this feeling into the weekend
and be proud of your work and celebrate
that with others just show on the stage
to other departments what you did what
you did what cool stuff you could
achieve it's also creating the trust and
also positive atmosphere in the company
I think these are the three things i
really want to tell you start from where
you are and improve continuous learning
and don't be afraid to fail and then be
proud of your achievements and share
that with others and perhaps some of the
stuff I told you like the six weeks and
the live demo but if it applies to you
okay that's basically it and if you want
to contact me you can I'm not their
Twitter I have an account but I can't
remember my password but I am along
singh and on linkedin and i can answer
that and i'm happy to talk to review
about I don't know product stuff later
i'm still here until tomorrow but as you
can see i also have another life so I
like mountain biking I like hiking I
liked we at lon so if anyone wants to
share experience on how to train best
for the next tree lat lon I'm also happy
to talk about that okay
and now we have 12 minutes more for
coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
