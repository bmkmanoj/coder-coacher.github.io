interest of time because I don't really
need this lies to go
just telling a little bit of a story I
might need to flick back over there and
have a look to remind myself what I'm
talking about at some point so quickly
and choose myself my name is Jim
Pelletier I'm a developer from Melbourne
I do things down there like on the alto
net user group I'm also a tech lead of a
team about five or six people who work
for a company called page on to make HR
software so what I'm going to do today
is I'm going to talk a little bit about
mob programming who's heard of mob
programming here great that's what I was
hoping for who's tried it perfect who
doesn't really think it's a good idea in
the first place you've got one person
putting their hand up great so what I'm
hoping to do today is tell you a little
bit of a story about what happened when
we first tried it in the hopes that you
might give it a try yourself because I
it's a really good experience with it so
what we did was we had a really
difficult problem we wanted to tackle we
had a code base that the team had
inherited it had a really highly
dependent object graphically or class
graph in there and a couple of really
big God classes in there as well but
we're causing us some real pain it made
it really difficult to reason about what
was going on in the code we really
wanted we had a specific problem when we
won't try and track get commits to hot
spots in the code base as well to work
out where our problems were but with
everything in this big file we couldn't
really do that so we really wanted to
break up the the code we had and we
tried to do this number of times before
I tried to do it on my own different
pairs of different times and tried to do
it
individuals had tried to do it everyone
gave up in the end normally what would
happen is you would get too scared that
something was going to break because you
didn't understand the code base well
enough or you just get plain old burnt
out trying to refactor large things and
you haven't got a clear end in sight
at some point the resolve wavers and
people just sort of give up got any like
any like I might just I'm gonna have to
use a little bit for my notes so oh I'll
just come over here we'll do it without
slides we'll go analog so a little bit
just about what my programming is about
just just for anyone who's not 100%
across it basically it's where the whole
team works on code at a time I've got
some nice pictures of our team doing mob
programming here but you can't see you
just have to imagine it we've got a
really great set up reference where
we've got to overhead so dual monitor
overhead projectors in the middle our
office so we will set up really well for
it in the first place the whole team
shares one keyboard the idea behind this
is that the programming and software
engineering is a brain bound or a CPU
bound operation it's not a io bound
operation so the more brainpower you can
throw at a problem is better than more
keyboards so the the way it works is the
keyboard that passes between the program
is usually on a timer about five minutes
the idea behind that is that you keep
everyone's brain focused on the problem
because I might have to type in the next
five minutes so I need to know what's
going on I don't look stupid when the
keyboard gets to me the person typing
also follows the instructions of the
team they don't make it up themselves
and go wandering off and just have
everyone else watch them they're
supposed to be following the
instructions of the team and the other
thing cool thing about it that we'll get
into a little bit later is it people can
kind of come and art if you tired if
you've got a meeting you need to go to
or any of those sorts of things you can
leave the mob come back into the mob
later and sort of catch back up so
that's that's how it works procedurally
and I've swapped the order around a
little bit in my slides and then of
course the problem we're trying to solve
is this refactoring so basically what we
did is we mob for about two weeks we had
a month when you would need all the real
time to to test this code because it
wasn't very well you know tested as well
and it was a tremor refactoring what I
do so I was it was completely behavior
preserving hopefully we don't introduce
any bugs I'm gonna break down this big
thing and what happened was that we got
it done which was significant because it
was done
we tried to do a bunch of times before
one of the the great things that I found
when you had five guys around the
keyboard or with a shared goal in mind
when people got tired or when people got
fed up you know you give them a hug and
we could all draw on each other's
strength to sort of keep going through
this really difficult problem so it was
great
with the specific problem we had it
worked really well the same thing goes
for the fact that sometimes you'd get to
a part of the code base that you didn't
know very well which in other times you
would have perhaps given up on it and
this can be true of any sort of problem
someone in the team though chances are
they've got some experience with that
part of the codebase and would sort of
provide the knowledge needed at the
right time for you to keep going on that
sort of thing so it worked really well
for solving our specific problem and it
was fantastic to to sort of get that
result and it's sort of allowing us to
do a lot more with our codebase now in
terms of finding other problem areas now
it's a little bit easier to reason about
but there was a whole bunch of
unexpected side effects for me as well
so I've got this great photo of my team
up here and there's there's five guys
and all standing around with different
expressions on their faces and and what
I wanted to talk about that too is that
we've got a lot of disparate opinions on
our team about how we should be
structuring our code we've got guys on
the team who sort of you know been in
the mines for a long time in this
particular codebase and they like to
write c-sharp that's sort of like just
sort of procedural code I've got a lot
of experience trying to write you know
encapsulated object-oriented c-sharp
code we've got a new guy on the team
who's really passionate about F sharp
and he wants us to write everything as
static methods and we sort of all I've
got these different ideas and pulling in
these different directions and all you
know think no that we need to be
constantly refactoring this codebase but
it's not happening and when it does
happen that sort of goes in different
directions and what we found is that
when we actually all got together around
one keyboard and we had to talk about it
that all of these styles were actually
compatible in different ways and we
agreed in different ways about how we
would start with this style here and
then refactor it to here over time and
we built
the shared agreement and alignment and
understanding about what we wanted our
code to look like we learned the we let
the benefits of some of the styles that
other people in the team we're proposing
and we saw the pitfalls and some of the
things we're proposing ourselves and we
very quickly sort of developed this
shared vision and a really great sense
of camaraderie and empathy in the team
as well we're working on code with
people for two weeks at a time every day
for eight hours breaks and stuff of
course but it's a really good way of
making the whole team start to pull in
the same direction to the point where
once we finished this work you know for
a long time I've been trying to build
that behavior in the team of constant
refactoring and what I saw afterwards
was after them PR that fixed the bug or
after the PR that built the feature
people were of their own accord doing a
second one now we're doing a second PR
with a refactoring in it and it was a
vision that the team had built together
in that time and all that was something
I wasn't I wasn't aiming to get out of
it so it was a really nice surprise when
all that stuff came out um yeah sorry
and that did start to drop off over time
again so I think there's
there is some other there's maintenance
necessary on this so whether you've got
a great pair in practice or already in
the team I think that might be enough to
sustain this sort of thing we don't have
a great pairing practice so I think
we'll probably need to periodically mob
to refresh and realign the team on where
we're going as the space we're working
in changes and as our ideas change over
time and that sort of stuff but it was
really great that it did at least did
have that bump to start with in terms of
the mobbing itself and how it worked so
I talked a little bit about the
procedural rules beforehand and we we
followed a lot of those we started with
all of those rules but the first thing
we did is that we do a retro every sorry
stand up every morning to find out what
everyone's work
when you're all working on the same
thing you don't need to do that so we
replaced it with a retro and what we
specifically retro was not a bit about
the problem we're trying to solve but
much more on the procedural aspects of
the mobbing so every day we go right
what worked yesterday what did one thing
that we found worked really well and was
super important was a five minute timer
or less if it got much under that there
was a really much greater chance of
people becoming disengaged box happening
as well as the person on the keyboard
actually starting to drive things a bit
themselves and sort of not really
working as a team we do find though that
it was very hard even with a five-minute
timer to stop that guy on the keyboard
just taking off with these and we
couldn't find a good solution for this
we it's it's just I think it's you know
it's a natural behavior of developers to
do that sort of stuff when they're
sitting in front of a keyboard so we
implemented a rule where we basically
just gave ourselves missions is to tell
people stop doing that it was the only
solution we could hey you're driving you
shouldn't be driving don't do that we
also though realized that we needed to
give that person a voice so just because
you're on the keyboard doesn't mean your
opinion doesn't matter so we sort of had
a timeout rule where you could take your
hands off the keyboard and engage the
team in discussions so that you could
still have your opinion on what was
going on you didn't just sort of get
ordered around by the rest of the team
and then we continued again once that
discussion was resolved we also found
that if there's less than three people
we called it quits because so five-ish
was the number in the team less than
half the team there and you started to
get decisions being made that would be
questioned later by people in the team
you'd start to get people taking it in
directions that didn't agree with or it
would take a long time to catch up with
afterwards and the other thing that we
do find about people coming and going in
and out of the mob was that there was
this relentless momentum that occurred
so in my day anyway I've got I spent a
lot of time you know and out of meetings
so I'm trying to get something done I'm
pairing someone on a problem and I have
to go to a meeting when I come back and
they're sort of waiting for me to come
back or they don't know how to get the
problems on the next door I'm trying to
do something myself and I'm not really
making progress on it because I keep
context switching when you've got brain
swapping in and out sort of like hot
swapping in and out the problem keeps
getting resolved and so what I find is I
go away to meetings and come back and
probably the next problem would be
solved and they'd be on to the next
thing I could sort of catch up speed up
and keep going so we actually moved
quite quickly as well I've had
experience from I've had sorry I've had
conversation with other teams at
page-off you've done this as well and
sort of different kinds of problems
where they were making their first
hammer a nap so that was sort of doing
it zero with a hammer a nap trying to
get everything up and running and
learning the framework for the first
time and they reported similar stuff
they'd estimated a whole lot of stories
to get to sort of their you know hello
world app or whatever we got everything
they needed and they got through it a
lot quicker the nice thought
using Bobby
I think that's about all I got to talk
about today I do want to leave a bit of
time at the end for questions but I've
probably used all that about a lot now
so if you've got any questions yeah
maybe be clean ah to be honest I I would
like to do another experiment where the
work wasn't like a specific problem that
we're trying to solve and do a little
bit of a comparison the velocity there
I'm still really worried about
justifying velocity to other people I'm
not so worried myself about how
productive it is but being on a
justified it's also really intensive
like it's it takes I did a bit of
planning before we did this to make sure
that we had good problems to solve and
that sort of thing so it's more thinking
about how to make it more valuable we
had five five work really well I've
heard it does I've not tried it remotely
myself we did have one guy remotely and
we sort of he works from home a few days
a week he was there sometimes and
sometimes not so we screen shared with
him we had him on a video laptop at the
front of the room as well and he could
follow along it was harder to switch
control over to him so it's sort of
really hard to get engaged
yeah yeah so just before I answer you'll
cut me off when we go on thanks person
right okay all right the the directories
we did have one person on the team who
had found a little bit challenging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
