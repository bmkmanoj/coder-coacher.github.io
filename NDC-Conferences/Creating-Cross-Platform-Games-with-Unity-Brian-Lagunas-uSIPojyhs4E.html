and I came all the way from Boise Idaho
who knows for Boise Idaho is you know
what Boise is it is in Idaho
so Idaho's on the west coast people know
where California is it's one of our
neighbors we actually have six neighbors
plus Canada so we're actually a pretty
big state but we only have a million
people in the entire state but I like it
it's small it's a little big city right
and today I'm here to talk to you about
building cross-platform games to the
unity now this is an intro talk this is
basically you've never even thought
about building games or you're
interested and you've never cracked open
unity so that's that's the target for
this talk should be fun we're gonna
actually build a game from scratch to
see how easy it is and normally I don't
say this because I don't want people to
feel bad but my six-year-old daughter
uses this to build games so just so you
know it's not that hard right I'm a
product manager for a company called
infra gist --ax anyone ever heard it
infra gist --ax we actually used to have
a little office here but we shut it down
for some reason probably too expensive
food here is crazy expensive guys geez
but I manage all these ammo products WPF
what used to be Silverlight UWP xamarin
forms and iOS and Android native Android
native iOS I'm responsible for all that
stuff if you guys want to contact me be
lagunas a 10-4 justice comm hit me up on
my blog and then twitter at brian laguna
so you can like tweet how awesome this
session is right and if it sucks just my
name's add Scott Hanselman so you know
so you just put that in there this box
cancel mitten right I'm also the owner
and manager of the prism project you
guys ever heard prism so that's that's
my baby and actually xamarin forms two
point three point one just what stable
so I'm gonna release a new stable
version of prism probably tonight all
right so enough about that let's talk
about what we're gonna do today we're
gonna talk about all this stuff we're
gonna talk about what unity is we're
gonna go over the IDE we're gonna create
a scene make a terrain
and then we do some scripting we're
gonna have a fully functional game at
the end of this write from scratch file
new my favorite and then we'll deploy if
we have time which I'm sure we will
so you're like hey what's you need oh I
know what unity is it's that dependency
injection container I use it all the
time with prism it's so awesome no
that's not it
this is a different unity this is unity
3d right so this is a IDE for building
2d in 3d games okay it's an editor and a
player which means not only do you
create the game inside of this editor
but you can actually play it as you
create it which is really cool and this
multi-platform so no matter what
platform you want to hit you could
target Windows Phone wait Windows Phone
anybody really wow I'm surprised Xbox
Playstation Blackberry okay I didn't
think about bye okay blackberry we get
the idea I OS Android basically your
idea is you write once and you just kind
of change your target make some
modifications for the device and deploy
agains it's a beautiful thing so some
really popular games that have been
built with unity call of duty strike
team drift mania Temple Run everyone
knows temple run right no who doesn't
know temple run if you've got kids you
know this game subway surfers another
one if you have kids you know that game
right so unity it's not just like this
hobbyist type thing I mean companies big
companies using to build real-deal games
okay that they you charge a lot of money
for okay so we're gonna get out of
slides and essentially like I said we're
gonna go file new and we're gonna create
a game from scratch all right we're done
with slide for the day all right so the
first thing you need to know is where to
get unity you need to go to unity 3d
comm okay then just click on the get
unity link right top right corner and
it's just cool little free version
called personal download that one it's
free it's beautiful you can do
everything you want just about
everything you need to do for your games
okay so once you have unity it's gonna
install it you can have a nice little
icon up here just
click that and it's gonna launch unity
and get this little dialogue and says
hey what kind of project you want to do
do you want to open an existing one or
let's go ahead and create a new one so
we'll create a new one and we'll call
this NDC CID okay now as you can see I
can choose from a 2d game or a 3d game
I'm gonna pick 3ds I think that's cooler
right and then don't we don't care about
adding asset patching packages now and
actually when you create games you won't
even add these now and then I don't care
about analytics in this demo so we'll go
ahead and create the project and this is
actually relatively quick now I will
warn you I just downloaded the brand-new
version last night right from the
website so we'll see if they changed
anything I did that one time and they
made a breaking change they had a bug
and was fun doing real-time debugging
okay so this is unity this is your ID
it's actually built on top of
monodevelop
so as you create your game you're
actually building on top of mono just so
you know okay you have a couple of panes
by default there's more to it but we're
gonna keep it simple today we have our
scene view now you're seeing view this
is three dimensional space this is where
you gonna be interacting with your
objects okay so for example if I wanted
to add a cube into here here's our cube
right now we're in 3d space so we have
three axes X Y and great Z is our depth
so that means we have these cool little
tools we can use to manipulate these
objects in this three dimensional space
we can rotate right we can scale
different ways of scaling and of course
we have other cool tools for scaling and
moving things around now I will say you
have to be careful when you're dragging
things around in this space because
you're in three-dimensional space and
this can play tricks on your eyes so you
think you're like center screen but
you're like 600,000 kilometers below
your view right it gets crazy
no this here
is your hierarchy this represents all
the objects in your scene okay over here
we have your inspector now your
inspector is essentially a proper to get
in Visual Studio you select the object
and then all the properties and values
you can manipulate show up in the
inspector now I want to make a note here
everything in here is essentially a
script also refer to as a component but
it's really just a script behind the
scenes and we're gonna create our own
later on then you have your project pane
this is all the assets and all the files
and everything that makes up your game
as it exists on disk ok so if I were to
come in here and create a new folder say
scenes and let's go ahead and save this
scene it's like main oops main scene
I'll stick it in that folder now I will
right-click show and explore that is my
main scene I just created so everything
that exists here will be on your hard
drive ok and then we have this game view
the game view this is where you actually
manipulate and play your game right so
you do all this manipulation up here
blah blah build my game I hit play and
this becomes active and now you see your
play you play the game the keyboard or
mouse or whatever a real-time right here
now I'm gonna show you a little trick a
little tip I learned the hard way so
let's say I hit play now of course all
we have is a cube it doesn't do anything
so let's let me just rotate this very
quick okay so let's say I'm in play mode
and then you know it's like okay I gotta
make some changes so I'm gonna come in
here and I'm gonna make some changes do
some cool things right whatever I will
rotate this one let's say we spend no
hour to just playing with stuff got my
game right where I want it and I notice
oh man I'm in play mode let me stop this
oh man I just lost like two hours of
work because I didn't realize I was in
play mode when you were in play mode
anything you do is basically temporary
and the second you exit play mode lost
okay
so the first thing you do when you
install unity make a note of this you
want to go to edit preferences colors
you see this play mode tint change that
to like an ugly ugly color like red now
I know I'm in play mode and any change I
make will be lost okay so do that
because you do not want to go through
what I went through when I first did
that okay any questions so far
no all right so let's start building a
game I thought we would create this
little island we'll throw some treasure
chests on it and we'll go look for them
dig them up you know collect the
treasure get points and win the game so
in order to do that we need to build a
terrain okay now I want to step back
just a little bit and remember what I
saved this scene I called it main scene
a scene is essentially a level think of
a scene as a level so we're dealing with
a level and we just named it main scene
so I'm gonna build level 1 if you will
okay so I could go into this create menu
and I'm going to create some 3d objects
and right down here we have a terrain
object so I'm sure the Select terrain
and I know it doesn't look big but this
thing is massive it just added a very
massive terrain object into my scene
okay so we're gonna leave it right where
it's at it's positioned zero zero zero
exactly where we want it center of our
world okay now I'm gonna start
manipulating this terrain I want to add
mountains and trees and grass and water
so the first thing I'm gonna start is
with my mountains what I want to do is I
have a nice little terrain menu set here
where I can do things to this terrain
like I can you know raise up
terrain mountains I can paint it trees
grass right we do all this cool stuff so
all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select I'm
gonna raise the terrain I can pick my
brush set different settings but we'll
just keep everything default for now and
what's to come in here and do paint
paint paint paint paint right there make
a little cove right so I'm just gonna
paint some mountains back here nothing
too fancy all right so we have some
mountains cool but they're kind of ugly
right
they're real ugly the gray well we want
to do is we want to add a texture to
these okay we want them to look like
something so in order to do that we need
to have what's called an asset right now
an asset essentially it could be a model
it could be a texture like we're about
to do it could be a script it could be
anything what we want is textures so
where do we get these assets well
there's a couple ways to do it the
easiest way and the fastest just I
actually go to unity3d calm and go to
the asset store right here top right
hand corner there are so many free or
pay if you want to pay but there's tons
of free assets that you can download and
bring right into your game so for
example if you want a zombie I just
search for zombie I want free right and
then here's a zombie character I can
click on that bring it into my game and
use it free of charge and as you can see
we have models scripts particle systems
textures you name it you can get it now
always go to the website because
although if you go to window there's an
asset store window this is so slow and
frustrating don't even bother don't you
bother coming here just go to the
website so much easier so along those
lines another thing I want to mention is
that unity is not meant to build assets
okay you're not building 3d models in
this you're consuming 3d models if you
want to build a model you'll use
something like blender Maya
3d studio max my own 3d studio max are
really expensive
even if you have a student discount I
think it's like a couple grand
but blenders free the UI sucks but it's
free and you can build whatever you want
there's lots of free models out there
but essentially you build your models in
another program and then you bring them
in to unity and compose your game from
those objects okay now unity ships with
some built-in asset packages and I'm
going to bring in the environment
package because that's where like trees
and grass and we have some textures that
exist already so you can come in here
and take everything but we probably
don't want to do that we'll just take
the environment section and import and
then this one's pretty small so should
come in relatively quickly okay that's
pretty slow actually
ouch I'm kind of running low one on ram
two in space I got so much stuff on this
computer it's time for the six month
windows wipe we all have to do that
right every six months up time to wipe
windows reload well how it's really slow
any questions so far
yeah I think got one there if you go to
the store some of them actually have the
licenses unity3d calm it's just finding
one right quick don't go back to our
zombie let's just click on him it's free
model textures we can scroll down here
see if he includes any type of licensing
information I don't see anything that
stands out at me on this one publishers
website if there's a license normally
it's included in the in the package
we're gonna look it down here if they
noted it yep no license required on this
one alright so we've downloaded our
assets
here we go environment perfect now what
we want to do is we're gonna paint this
mountain range so I'm going to come to
this paintbrush I'm gonna edit textures
and add a new texture and I really hate
this user interface because it really
makes no sense sometimes then I'm gonna
select a texture how about this one add
it boom okay it's not that great
right but it's something so we'll go
ahead and zoom on in and we can see that
we have sand
well it sounds cool and all but those
really aren't mountains what I'd really
like to have is some like a rocky
texture on the mountain so let's add
another texture this one looks good make
sure you select it right there and then
you can just paint right on the
mountains if you could tell I make
noises when I paint and when I create
things I'm just like dude right alright
so I know this looks like crap but if
you zoom in there we go you can start to
see that the texture starts to come
through okay so
you need the IDE does some tricks to
keep your IDE responsive as you zoom out
it shows way less detail otherwise if
it's showing a lot of detail all the
time your systems just gonna come to a
halt or you'll need just as massive
mainframe type computer to run it so as
you zoom out you'll lose detail as you
zoom in you'll get more detail keep that
in mind so we're going to show you
another got you later okay so we've
painted our mountain range how about we
had some some trees so I'm gonna go
ahead and click the little tree button
and it trees add one and this is another
weird things like oh well I got a sign a
tree so how about a how about this palm
tree it looks good alright so now let's
bring the brush size down a little bit
pow-pow-pow
we got trees right the zoom in on them
oops too far beautiful okay we've got
some palm trees got some sand mountain
range let's add some grass right so I'm
gonna click this thing that looks like
flowers edit add grass texture now all
these textures that I'm using they came
from the environment package we imported
oh let's just pick something down here
this one to work okay so now I'm gonna
pay some grass pink paint paint paint
paint oh oh hold on I think it's broken
mmm rage paint okay something's not
working let me see what's going oh my
God look at all that grass I just do in
my view right remember that thing I was
telling you about detail and when you're
zoomed out you don't get a lot of detail
but as you zoom in you'll show you the
detail so when you're zoomed way out and
you you're like man I'll just one all
this grass oh it's not working and you
rage paint yeah don't do that I did that
and like my entire scene just had grass
all over it because I didn't realize
when I was getting started about the
little trick so be very careful when you
start doing finer detail
paintings or grass or creating objects
in your games because as you can see
there's no grass you zoom in there's a
lot of grass because I raise painted but
there is control-z so you can just undo
that if you want see I'm done we'll just
put a little patch here and a little
patch there and one right there looks
good okay next we need water because I
want an oasis so luckily in our
environment package we got water too so
I'm gonna go ahead and select this water
basic daylight now I want to make a note
your first instinct is when you get this
model you want to drag it and drop it
right into your scene like that don't
get into that habit while it might work
sometimes most of the time it won't
because while you think you're dropping
it flat you're actually dropping it
either
600,000 kilometers above it or below it
and you won't know it until you start
zooming in it's like where's my water
where's my object so what I like to do
is I'll drag it right into the hierarchy
that will put it right there zero zero
zero and then I can just drag it where I
want it let's see even then I didn't
drag right so I'd like drug it way down
I'm not even level anymore I - 104
meters you see that okay
I got to get it right on the green there
we go
oh it's a little small so let's go ahead
and scale it up not rotate scale let me
do this
now right now our water is perfectly on
zero so it's it's basically running into
our ground as you can see it's like just
kind of weird intersecting right so what
we'll want to do is we want to bring
that up on the Y just a hair just to
like a point one just to raise it up
just a tad so we can see it all right
now know what you're thinking like wow
we're doing all this designing up here
but what the heck's going on here this
is our game view this is what we're
supposed to see when we play our game
well when I created this scene this
camera was added by default we just
never took the time to come in here and
move it so let's go ahead and grab the
camera all right and we'll just move it
we got to turn it you see that little
cone around the camera this little
outline that shows your field of view on
the camera so we'll go ahead and move
this around all right let's not be
perfect we're gonna not use this in a
minute anyways okay great
so of course if I play this nothing's
really gonna happen and right now it's
hard to see but the water is moving the
grass is moving right you get all that
for free from unity but let's make this
cooler all right so I think we're good
on the level I'm gonna call that good
for now now what we need is we need that
person running around exploring finding
treasure chests so we need the first
person character well great well I can
create one myself get one from the asset
store or I can just use the character's
package that comes with unity and we'll
just import everything so I don't want
to go through and select so like I said
unity ships with a default characters
package comes like a first person a
third person we're gonna use the first
person you go to the asset store get
characters doesn't matter
totally
- you build your own I wouldn't
recommend that because there's a lot
that goes into it because you got to
worry about jumping and firing and you
know going left going right you have to
script all the movement and these ship
with all the scripts necessary for that
alright so let's go into a characters
first person and we'll go this FPS
controller and we'll do that one all
right
automatically my camera changed again
well this first person has its own
camera on it so now we're gonna drag
this first person around we'll stick
them in the water or her right and we'll
rotate around and we'll bring it up just
a tad now that'll work and that means I
can delete this other camera cuz we
don't need it anymore
all right so now I'm gonna play the game
Oh Mouse works right I can jump I got
footsteps I'm running I'm in this
beautiful grass so just flowing in the
wind
check out this water and this is the
basic water there's more you know
there's better quality water as well
that just looks super real alright
that's cool
right we'd have to code anything we're
just kind of clicking and dragging
around right no no code yet but we have
a first-person exploring the level that
we created and we'd have to write any
code for it alright but you know right
now it's kind of boring when I play a
first-person game I like that music that
that motivates you you know get you
wanting to go look for stuff so I have a
sound package that I'm gonna bring in
and we're gonna add some sound some
music to our scene here all right let's
go sounds and see just listen to these
I asked that's not very motivating but
this one no it's not that good either
that's how bad
there you go oh yeah not in the head we
got it that's the one that's the one
we'll use that one all right so I'm
gonna come over to my first person
character I'm gonna add a component
which I said is just a script we'll call
it an audio source right down here and
then we have this little clip audio clip
we're gonna click and drag that onto the
audio clip and loop it now we play our
game all right
I'm motivated let's go find some
treasure Oh
ran into a tree so you notice that the
trees have collision detection built
right into it we collide with them and I
climb this mountain is it too steep a
little steep jump
cool all right any questions so far
okay so doing underwater you'll do a
little some special tricks but it's not
hard so when you're building a game you
got to kind of think outside the box
you'll have your top level water that's
highly reflective it looks really cool
right but then you'll build another you
know another element that represents
your underwater or maybe it's just kind
of hazy and foggy and you have bubbles
floating through it or something like
that right but you build everything all
right let's see so we got we got a
character we got some sound we need we
need some treasure and I got just the
object got a little treasure box bring
that in all right so let's go ahead and
drag my treasure box up to my hierarchy
and we'll bring it in there okay
another trick this is a very simple
scene but when you get a lot of objects
in here you're gonna want to be able to
like find that and it may be small like
tiny tiny small so the best way to do
that is in your hierarchy select the
object move your mouse over your scene
and hit the F button and it will zoom in
on that object
okay that's the easiest way to find
something all right so we have our
treasure box so I dropped it in there so
I should just go to just play the game
and run right into it right and just
let's go oh oh that's no fun
all right we don't get any more freebies
okay we actually got to write a little
bit of code now but it's not complicated
at all so the first thing we need to do
is we need to write a script but before
we get that we have to talk about
exactly how this is going to work
because we got to start solving problems
and unity now game problems which is
gonna be different than if you were
building a line of business application
right so I start thinking okay what's
got to happen what's got to happen is
when I run into this box is
got to disappear and I gotta get points
for it so let's start with the first
problem running into the box how do I
know when I run into the box so I can
execute code well in unity we have this
thing called a Collider and we happen to
have a couple different shapes and one
of those shapes is a box Collider right
and the boss Collider if i zoom in you
can see this little green outline that's
Mike lighter that I just added to this
box now if you have a different shaped
object just pick the shape that's
closest to your object and then
manipulate the Collider to fit it's best
as you can now so we have a client but
that just means I'm gonna run into it
why don't want to just run into it I
need a notification I need to know when
I run into it so there's a little
checkbox here for is trigger make sure
you click is trigger when that happens
we will be notified our script can
respond to that look I ran into
something let's run some code okay great
so let's go ahead and start doing some
coding now I'm a little ATD so I got a
OCD I got to put a scripts folder in
here now you can create your scripts a
couple different ways c-sharp stores my
C sharp Debs okay and JavaScript okay
well I'm C sharp so will DC sharp but if
you're more comfortable JavaScript you
can write them in JavaScript no problem
alright so we'll call this chest pickup
and then I'm just gonna open this up and
as you can see it's gonna use Visual
Studio as my editor so we get debugging
and all that great stuff we can hit
breakpoints to debug our game it's a
beautiful thing
okay so scripts full derived from what's
called a monobehaviour
and it's gonna stub out two methods for
you start and update start think of it
as almost like a constructor it's gonna
execute once when the object is created
okay so you're gonna put your setup code
in there and then update is gonna be
called
every time every frame okay so if you're
running
thirty frames per second that code is
being called 30 times a second so don't
be connecting the databases and doing
crazy stuff in there okay that's just
I've seen it all we have performance
problems in my game what's going on
yeah then with the opening and closing
connections in a and an update so we
won't be using that
now you remember we added that that is
trigger check
well I know because I read the docs that
in order to respond to that I need to
add a method called on trigger enter
Collider and it takes a collider okay
I'm going to show you somewhere you're
gonna spend a lot of time you need 3d
comm learn documentation you're gonna
spend a lot of time in here because
there's a lot of like hidden things like
that method like the only way you know
to do that is if you come in here like
how the heck do I respond to a collision
and they'll say oh just add a method
called ontriggerenter and you're good
okay great yeah I believe it does yes
but it's actually really it's quick I
mean you don't even know right okay so
ontriggerenter so we have this Collider
alright so what we're gonna say I'm
gonna say hey if the collider dot game
object dot tag equals player then we're
going to destroy game object whoa whoa
what what'd you just say
okay let me explain so the collider
that's what we're running into okay so
the collider has a game object this is
the object colliding with with the
collider so if that tag yokels player
then we're going to destroy game object
now this game object is the game object
that this script is going to be attached
to which is the chest so we're gonna
destroy the chest but
what about this part how do we how do we
know this well we got to tell it so
let's go back to our game in unity and
I'm gonna select our person here our
little first person now right here in
the top right hand corner we have what's
called a tag you'll use this this
concept a lot building games now there
are a couple standard tags and unity
respond finish editor only main camera
player game controller player right
there you can create your own tags which
you will but for our purposes we're
gonna use the player tag now we know
whenever this player runs into this
Collider that tag we're gonna know the
tag it's gonna be tagged player so we
know okay we're a player we ran into
this let's destroy we're not quite done
yet though all we do is write the script
now what we want to do is we want to
apply the script to the treasure box
well that's very difficult to do so let
me just go ahead and do it for you done
all you have to do click drag drop you
have plied the script okay so now if I
coated everything up right and the demo
gods are with me
there we go right okay that's cool
that's cool those not very difficult but
I you notice I had to make the boots
down myself and I don't expect people
playing my game to go poop every time
they pick something up so I need a sound
I need something that gives me that
validation that I got something you know
like oh did I get that I'm gonna go back
look for it oh where to go did I get it
right we don't want that experience we
want to know yeah we got that so we want
to play a sound clip when that treasure
chest is picked up so let's go back to
our script so we know we got a pick up
sound clip so let's go ahead and add a
property of type audio clip and we'll
call it a pick up clip and then in here
we'll just say audio source dot play
clip at point we'll use our pick up clip
and then the position this is important
transform that position now in unity
sound depends on space spatial sound
essentially so imagine you had this
great scene and you have a waterfall in
that scene okay and this is the
waterfall our screen is the waterfall so
my character walks up to it and it's
walking this way the waterfalls on the
right the sound is coming from the right
speakers in my 7.1 surround sound
because that's how I play games right
and if I character turns around now the
sound comes out of the left hand
speakers and as the character gets
further away from the sound it gets
quieter as you get closer it gets louder
right so we want to say that we're going
to play this sound at the location of
the chest so the transform this is the
property off the the object the scripts
attached to and the position of it right
so where this chest is play that sound
because you don't want to be in and have
it coming off in your right hand
speakers like what the heck did I do
right okay so now let's go to our
treasure box we're going to
liked it just collapse this now we can
see in our chest pickup we have a new
property pick up clip all I'm gonna do
now I already have a sound I already
took the time Stowers the internet
looking for the perfect sound I do not
think you'll be disappointed here we go
beautiful I'm validated
I got points right any questions so far
hmm sorry I forgot about the mic thing
do I really need a mic I just want to
ask the destroy bit that you say destroy
game object game object is the actual
player no game object is the chest right
and the collider is is the player yes
the the object colliding the game object
right here colliding with the collider
is the player we're tagged it so if we
go back to and select our player we
tagged it player right here and then our
script on the collider itself remember
that box Collider we added that's this
Collider we're gonna say what's the game
object that ran into me oh you're the
player gotcha
so let's go ahead and destroy the chest
yes this well almost
we don't want to say this specifically
because that's the actual script right
that's the the chest pickup script
itself that's the script object this is
the game object to scripts attached to
right okay close that we're actually
we're done with that
sir so if like we have books and the car
collide and let's say player collide so
like take only one scenario you can use
them all the same you can say there
everything's a player bad guy good guy
doesn't matter it's a player or you can
say bad guys are enemies and this guy
over here he's player and you'll just
code if right here if player or bad guy
right you would check before you destroy
but big is related to the person
colliding right so I thought like to the
object colliding yeah you can tag any
object any object can have a tag so
anything that's tagged anything like you
can say enemy player or enemy or you
know super bad guy whatever or bullet
that's another one when you shoot the
angel is a bullet colliding with me
then I'm gonna die right kind of thing
okay so we have a treasure chest we have
some sound that's cool what else well I
think I want more than one treasure
chest personally I mean you know we
can't just have one so when you're
thinking about you know what I'm gonna
make more than this your first instinct
is just to select copy paste you move it
right copy paste you move it let's say
you copy a whole bunch of these objects
let's say you have a hundred of them
whatever and then you realize oh man you
know what I really wish this was a
little bigger so I'm just gonna make
that bigger oh crap I have 99 more of
these I have to go and make bigger
that's gonna really suck well we don't
want to do that we want to make it easy
on ourselves right so then another
concept that you'll use all the time and
we've been using just me may not have
noticed
so what's called a prefab so essentially
we're going to make a template out of
that
treasure chest okay so I created a new
folder called prefabs and all I'm gonna
do so what's this go ahead and delete
that I'm gonna take this treasure box
I'm gonna click and drag it into my
prefabs folder it is now a template just
like that right so what's that mean that
means now when I come in here and copy
and paste this bad boy let me just move
it over the side let me zoom a little
bit I'll move this one off to the side
all right now let's say I want to make a
change I want to make this these all
bigger okay and there's a thousand of
them well now we have a new option in
our inspector under prefab select revert
apply so I make my changes and now I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply them boom
to all of them automatically right so
whenever I update the template
everything else I can apply to directly
awesome time-saver you'll use that all
the time yeah that's that's the standard
so if we come in like for example
standard assets will go like let's go
down to environment water see
everything's prefabs that's that's
that's the convention all right so now
what's cool about that is even though
I've copied and pasted and all that
stuff because it's a prefab
they all work the same and anytime I
update that script or add functionality
or do anything to that prefab everything
else gets it now I know the question in
your mind but Brian I don't wanna be
copying and pasting a hundred thousand
of those I'd rather just
programmatically create them and kind of
have them just appear and write spawn
them you can do that it's just code
you'll just write either a particle
system or spawner right because actually
I don't know if you noticed but if we
come up to a tag respawn right I mean
spawn is a concept that's used a lot in
games so you will programmatically
create these but you will use the prefab
when you create the object that way any
change you make to the prefab everything
gets it even when you're dynamically
creating them okay so we have a treasure
chest we have some cool music that's
motivating us we're picking them up we
need to keep score
we need a score so let's do score ok so
tracking scores fun and challenging to
say the least you really have to kind of
think outside the box like okay how in
the heck am I going to keep track of
score or stats or whatever it's going to
be across the game well one approach is
to use what's called a game controller
so we're gonna go ahead and create an
empty game object and I'm gonna call it
game controller and this is such a
common approach it has a built in tag
called game controller right so we
tagged it game controller great so this
empty object is it's not a physical
object that's in your scene that you can
see it's more of a think of it like a
singleton right you have this object
that's in your app and you're gonna
access state off of it you can kind of
think of it like that so I had this
object I've added to my my game and I'm
gonna use it to track state perfect okay
so I'm gonna add another script
and I'm gonna call it player stats
because I need to track information
about our player basically how many
points we're getting it's like go ahead
and open this let's see we will not be
using update at all what I want you to
start but we'll start here okay
so I'm gonna go with a score and then we
need a public void update score and two
value should work and then all we're
gonna do is say score plus equals value
simple okay now once we have that we're
gonna say that this game controller is
gonna be responsible for maintaining
player stats so we're going to take this
player stats and we're gonna drag it on
to our game controller and we can see we
have our score property here just like
we said right instead of zero okay well
now that we have this this object that's
going to maintain the state how in the
heck do we access this and are in our
other scripts like we got to think about
this okay so what's happening is I'm a
Clyde with the chest I'm gonna pick it
up i'ma play a sound it's gonna be
destroyed that's probably where I want
to add one or add whatever to my score
so that means I'm in the I'm in the
chest pick up script I'm here now so I
need to in here we need to update the
score before we destroy the object right
this is where we're at now is like okay
how do we get to that well because we're
using that game object right we can
access anything from that now let me let
me just put something here let's say I
ain't got player stats stats so we need
the object and I'm gonna save our
controller game object
dot get Oh fine so I find object with
tag and what did we tag it game
controller we got the game controller we
have the controller awesome so now I can
say stats equals controller oops not
constant force controller dot get
component of T now remember everything
is a component but it's really a script
right they call it component we want the
player stats script or component if you
will perfect we have the stats so what
that means is I can come in here and go
update score we'll add one ok make sure
everything looks good ok let's go ahead
and go pick up subscription let's watch
this score property as I pick up these
chests
oh it worked perfect okay any questions
there did that look confusing do I need
to clarify just one more time okay one
more time
so what we did is we created a game
controller which is an object that
exists in our game but it's not a
physical object it's just a state
manager if you will okay we wrote a
script that keeps track of player stats
it's like person equals new person in an
application right so we just create an
instance of that we put an instance of
that player stats script on that state
managers that game controller okay
now that means we needed to access that
information from the chest pick up
script so instead of calling like in a
in an application that you write if you
had some type of state manager you would
probably would probably a static method
call like state manager dot player stats
that score equals all right well we
don't do that here instead we get that
state manager or that game controller
using game object dot find game object
with tag and it's tagged game controller
so if we go back to unity there's our
game controller tag that we tagged it
okay so now that we have the controller
now we can get the player stats object
off of it using getcomponent
that gives us access to that player
stats information and then we just call
the update score method that we added to
the player stats here to just add to it
every time hey
two game controllers well you'll have to
do a little extra work let's go back
here there is a find objects with tab
which will return a collection right so
if you have more than one game
controller you'll have to figure out
which one you care about but you can get
them all with this find objects with tag
which we'll bring back in a collection
okay so now we have score we're keeping
track of this information as we pick up
our chests now we have to display this
information to our player right the
person playing the games like yeah
that's great we have a property but we
need to expose that we need something
like a heads-up display with radars and
bullets and health and all that crazy
stuff right well we don't have time for
the crazy ones so we're going to create
a very simple one so we're going to go
ahead create a 3d object and we're gonna
add you UI objects sorry we're gonna
create a UI object we're gonna add text
now when I added this text notice that
it's automatically surrounded by canvas
and right now you don't even see it like
Brian what are you talking about is you
add anything well let me do my little F
trick so I'm gonna select the canvas
scroll my mouse over hit F now I'm gonna
zoom out and I can see my canvas now
okay that's the canvas so now if I
select the text within that you can see
that it's down at the very bottom that
means if I look at the very bottom oh I
can kinda see something here now
yeah so let's go ahead and move that ah
there we go
right and we'll make that a zero how
about 24 and well that's we'll call it
good for now okay so essentially when
you add the UI object it creates this
canvas and it has its own little camera
and it basically sticks it right on top
of your game right it just imposes it
right on top like a layer
this is how you create I mean you create
anything you want there's some very
complex heads-up displays you can write
and you can download them free from
asset store radars and all that crazy
stuff but this is essentially what you
do this is a simple version of it so now
we're going to think okay I'm going to
update the score I got to update this
text where am i updating the score I'm
well I'm updating the score in my player
stats script here okay so that means we
need to add another property first we're
gonna go using unity engine dot UI
because we want a text object now we can
say
to string perfect that looked easy well
it is so let's go to our game controller
we're gonna see a new property score
text all we have to do is I'm going to
take the text object I want to update
click drag a sign now when we play our
game 1 here we go 2 3 perfect
easy right any questions no ctrl Z it
keeps going back yeah it goes back so
you can undo like I can go ahead and hit
ctrl Z and we'll undo that text
assignment whoops but ctrl Z is your
friend okay so let's see I got six
minutes we can do unless you guys choose
we can talk real briefly about
deployment or we can do another level
and load that level when we win the game
what do you guys want to do deployment
okay let's do deployment so we win okay
game over let's talk about deployment
first we want to go to build settings
now scenes and build this is important
you're going to want to add all the
scenes you want included in your game in
this dialog you can click and drag them
in or just add them one at a time as
they're open so I've added the main
scene now here's all the platforms we
can target I'm on a Windows machine so
I'm gonna go ahead and select Windows
and go switch platform boom I'm now
gonna deploy to a Windows Store app I
want it to be a universal I want
direct3d local machine and for debugging
c-sharp projects now here's a gotcha
Windows Store only the moment you change
and you switch this platform you must
come up
to this menu mobile input and disable
that if you do not do that your keyboard
will not work and you'll say why isn't
this working oh my god it was working
just a minute ago
what'd I do and you're gonna go through
all your scripts gonna rewrite your game
and you're not going to know you might
even switch back to a different platform
and then it's gonna work but if you're
on Windows Store make sure you disable
mobile input or your and lets you expect
to be hooked up to a phone or a
controller okay so once you disable that
then you can go to player settings now
player settings this is just basically
your app manifest information right
setting your icon your capabilities you
know your resolutions and stuff this is
your app manifest now I'm going to say
this is one time only so you'll come in
here you'll do all your settings set
your icons any type of resolution stuff
right splash images any of your
capabilities you'll select all these
we're gonna go ahead hit build we're
gonna go ahead and add a new folder I'll
call it build we'll select that well let
this run because this is going to
restore nuga packages and we know how
slow that can be oh wow that was
actually quite quick but this takes a
while what's it's doing it's now
building up Visual Studio solutions so
we're gonna be able to open this game in
Visual Studio hit f5 and debug it so
that's what's going on right now I'm
sticking all our assets bundling that
all up doing doing everything all the
magic and it's gonna spit out a visual
studio solution for us and it's gonna
take all this information and set it in
our app manifest so when I say this is
one way what I mean is when it creates
that visual studio solution and we open
it up if we go make changes to the app
manifest manually and then we decide oh
you know I need to come back into unity
and make some changes and I published
again it will not overwrite anything
okay once you publish this one time
these settings it's one way it will not
happen again so you don't have to worry
about losing any customizations you made
inside Visual Studio okay which is nice
but it can be confusing if you're
depending because at first when I was
getting started like I was updating this
this was my source this is what I was
using and I'd like make a change deploy
it's like man it's not updating what the
heck so it took me a while to figure out
that only does it once yep
you sure can because design time
designing it is not the same as
deploying it and also what's cool is so
for Windows Store it's creating visual
studio solution for Android is going to
create the Android solution for iOS it's
going to do what the Xcode project right
so depending on the platform is going to
create the project for that target even
for iOS it will create the project on a
Windows machine of course you can't open
it and compile it and all that stuff but
it will actually create the project
files for you
excuse me yeah and then what's different
about the other platforms too is you see
this build and run that doesn't work
with Windows but for like iOS and
Android you can you can just if you're
on a Mac or something you can hit build
and run it will do all this and run it
automatically but for uh for Windows
that won't work you have to go through
Visual Studio you have to build actually
well running that time this is taken
long enough so hoping it would take so
let me close this and then I think I
have yeah this is demo right here I'll
just kind of show you right quick
because it's basically times up
so the first thing you'll have to do
because this isn't obvious either is
this it's gonna default to arm and
that's not gonna work you'll build
you're gonna get build failures I think
what's going on
pisses me off right just change your
your platform here to x86 and then build
and then it will work but this is
essentially what you'll get when you
when this completes and then so you have
your app that's yes you have your
package that X manifest you essentially
build it deploy it locally and then it
see right there and then when you run
the app because we're using the personal
edition we're gonna get a splash screen
this is personal edition if you want to
pay money that goes away and you can
create your own splash screen and then
this little four gigabyte machine is
struggling to process all this and then
there's our game you see the water
everything works
right where's my score oh there it is
this was a really quick thing I did last
night just to make sure it would work
yeah and then you win right but uh
that's my time I'm actually one minute
over sorry
thanks for coming I appreciate it I'm
gonna be here so feel free to ask more
questions as I pack up and head out
thanks guys I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
