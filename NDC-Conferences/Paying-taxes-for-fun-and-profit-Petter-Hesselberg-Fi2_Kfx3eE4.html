and welcome to paying taxes for fun and
profit
I'm sure that you all fill out your
income tax returns properly for the joy
and profit of your respective
governments but that's actually not the
kind of taxes I will be talking about
today I will be talking about the taxes
that we pay as developers stuff we do
that doesn't actually add functionality
to our programs but we sometimes have to
do them anyway these are taxes that you
pay to varying degrees if you make a
tic-tac-toe program for yourself in your
basement you don't have to pay any taxes
whatsoever if you create an internal
website for your company you may have to
pay some and if you want to make a
program that sold across the world will
pay a lot of taxes so how much tax you
need to pay and what kinds of taxes you
need to pay depends on your product your
market and to an extent who you are as
well
it's a real awesome the bigger you are
the more taxes you have to pay the
Kingdom can be profitable and perhaps
surprisingly some of them can actually
be quite fun as well or at least
interesting that's what I hope to
convince you of today so it's going to
much different work for these taxes
might be horizontals or you might call
them non-functional requirements there
are all things that they do that do not
add any new functionality to your
program but if you want to have an
international market to distribute your
program abroad you need to do something
about internationalization one way or
another if you want to sell you sorry
about that I don't think I repeat
everything I hope you caught mostly what
I said as an intro but it was just an
interim just arrived that
internationalization if you want to sell
to government you almost certainly have
to do something about accessibility
because it's a requirement and if you're
a decent human being you will do
something about accessibility even if
you're not selling to government because
people actually need that to be able to
use
product.the if you want to know how many
people are using your product you might
want to have some telemetry if you want
to find out why your program is crashing
you want to lemon tree and so on and so
forth this list is incomplete partly
because the demo in Texas and non taxes
are quite fuzzy you can also a kid for
example make an argument that testing is
a tax since some of us are sort of
subscribed to test-driven development
which I do up to a point that sort of
doesn't make any sense
I'm not going to make that argument that
you could make it so let's start with
International internationalization this
is usually divided into two different
parts one is globalization and the other
one is localization and the first one
deals with how you display things like
for example dates in a format that's
understandable and expected by users
across the globe where its localization
is the process of making your user
interface available in different
languages and the two of them are quite
distinct but the border between them is
quite fuzzy especially regarding string
handling which they both sort of appear
in both of them so let's have a look at
globalisation all the formats that we
use and how different they are the
string handling is a bit of a challenge
character sets back then I started doing
is software development since a while
ago we had ASCII and episodic and that
was about it so when we did programming
the letters and all which appeared in
region alphabet did not appear in the
computer output because they simply
weren't there there was no such thing as
non ASCII characters in
year in software development actually my
development environment looks like this
Lachlan it was a stack of cards that you
cut into a card reader and after about
half an hour and huge printout will come
out the other end happily we have
advanced somewhat since then and with
regard to character sets in the solution
we have come up with is unicode and
that's probably what we're going to live
with for the foreseeable future
which makes localization and
globalization possible it doesn't
necessarily make it easy because this is
a really complex matter but it certainly
is possible the other things that fall
under localization would be date and
time timestamp handling how we deal with
numbers and how we deal with currencies
so lots of good strings first of all
it's the representation in the Unicode
the a with an accent can be represented
as a single code point or it can be
represented as an accent with a letter a
following it and it should display the
same but they are the representations
are different and that means if you do
any string processing in Unicode you
should try as best you can to avoid
every using or accessing single
character because they don't necessarily
make sense out of context so whenever
you can use strengths or sub strings for
all operations that you do then they are
ordering which is clearly culture
specific so this is an example of
culture dependent ordering the left
column is English and the right one with
Swedish and the neither of these
languages have any concept of the letter
R which we have in Denmark and Norway so
they interpret that as a ligature AE and
sold it under AE we get to the off to
Abel the ring over it the American
alphabet has no clue what
it thinks it's an A with a ring over it
which it is so it ends up with the A's
whereas in Sweden it is actually the
27th letter of the alphabet and it ends
up at the end so those of you from
Norway might be surprised that Sweden
has this character at number 27 instead
of very trip me at number 29 but in very
Suites what can you expect
mmm yes casing that's a cool one
yeah the letter I we usually have a
lowercase letter I with a dot on it and
we have a uppercase letter I without a
dot
so if you're English on the region and
try to capitalize Nils you get Nils
without any more dots and vice-versa of
course but if you try to do the same
trick in the Turkish or at the majani
context you get something completely
different you get basically have one eye
that has always and another eye that
never has adults and while I was
preparing for this I found something
interesting on the Wikipedia on the dot
less eye and its handle problem
problematically in a Turkish locales of
several software packages it has a text
not foreseen by application developers
by doing automatic upper and lower
occasion I think this is very
beautifully understated because at
Microsoft Turkish is one of the
languages that they always test first
because problem all these problems ooh
what else we have yeah
this is how you properly spell the name
of the largest city in Turkey and I
managed to avoid saying capital Turkey
then something occurred to me today
names and initials for names as you can
see these this is a snapshot from my
outlook for Android and the second one
from the top has a picture in it that's
the picture of my boss Alex drinking
beer which he usually does and the other
two they don't have pictures so we just
substitute their initials instead but
that can actually be I don't actually
know what the outlook does when
confronted with a locale where you have
instead of given name first you have a
family name first and given name
afterwards so example there is there is
a fairly well known computer graphics
technique known as song shading named
after somebody named form but that's
actually his first tank it was from
Vietnam so I'm not sure if that will end
up correctly in those locales and I had
no even less clear what they do in China
where the concept of an initial is sort
of vague a test date
what date is this it's actually not
possible to tell without context you
have to know which look how you are in
so it could be the 5th of August or it
could be the 8th of May so the dates are
hard anything that involves dates or
timestamps or time zones or calendars if
you can avoid having anything to do with
it then don't have anything to do with
it because that stuff is really hard if
you must have something to do with it
then make sure that you always serialize
and deserialize timestamps in an non
cultural dependent format and one of the
benefits of having modern you eyes is
that instead of actually writing text in
a text field and trying to parse it and
use customized widgets regards to date
input and then you know exactly what you
get and don't have any ambiguity as to
whether this is the 5th of August or the
5th Omega makes up numbers we have
decimal points in various formats we are
used to comma in Norway we have the
period in English let me have whipping
we don't group the fractional part of a
number if you write the digits of pi
then you just write a trinket after the
other but there our culture will they
actually do that and in the whole number
part we do with we grouped by thousands
and that's actually quite common but not
everybody does that as you can tell from
the example from India and there are
actually more weird ways of doing this
than you might think
and if you have whips then you have a
grouping separator which can be various
things typically period comma or spaces
the one thing we never have is it's your
decimal point it's a period your
thousand separator is not a carry it's
the other way around
and yes according to him at the decimal
point I read some places in Switzerland
Li they use the period as a decimal
point when they deal with money and the
comma when they give me any other number
that's even stranger if you ask me so
here's the list of various ways of
grouping digit you see most will be well
a to e they are grouping by the
thousands and the B and E don't actually
concern us because they're just
handwritten forms and we don't do
handwritten form some computers but the
next one is interesting we have the
concept called a myriad and in Norwegian
and English a myriad just means a lot
many but it actually comes from old
Greek and means 10,000 and in East Asia
they typically group by tens of
thousands so that in Japan you might
find digits digits a group by four but
even though they actually the numbering
system groups by 10 mm they also use
grouping by 3 when they write the
numbers as they do in China so that has
to be slightly confusing I think and
then you have this truly rare case in
India where you have thousands group at
the beginning and then you group by the
hundreds afterwards I don't know I
thought that was a good idea but that's
what they actually do so whenever you
need to format numbers you should use
libraries library methods library
functions if you have to do any
formatting by yourself they are usually
API is available that will let you
retrieve meta information about how how
the GU things are built and how which
characters you use for what and so on
and so forth
yes so that was their currencies I
almost forgot we have all the different
some symbols that we use for currencies
some are specialized symbols some are
just abbreviations like the kronor and
they end up in front of the number or in
back of the amount or with or without
intervening space the negative numbers
are specified in different ways and so
on so again these libraries when you can
use some data API so you can't next
subject is localization and localize
ability so go through how we do
localization talk a little bit about
what to localize and what not to
localize the we have what are the
pitfalls of localization where string
pasting is particularly pernicious and
it's actually possible to over localize
which I'll show an example and then you
have some particular challenges with for
example what we call CJK the Far Eastern
languages of China Japan and Korea so
this pair of characters that's Chinese
and it means Chinese in Chinese
according to google translate and what
distinguishes the writing system of
China is that it's a IDIA graphic and
they have thousands upon thousands of
characters which is quite different from
what we do and one of the reasons
Unicode came into being so you may know
that the Japan co-opted the Chinese
writing system once upon a time and
started using it so if you read up these
same two characters in Japanese they
read kanji which is the name for that
particular script in Japanese which is
basically stolen from the Chinese but
everything in Japanese couldn't be
represented by that the
I can't call us an alphabet isn't
getting your granite video Grammatik
thing so they invented something called
hiragana which is basically a syllabary
that has 48 basic syllables and with
embellishments you have something like
an eight different syllables which are
all the syllables you are allowed to use
in Japanese you can't write Japanese if
you mean something else
so a loan word such as beer you can't
write it so they change it to be really
just to be able to have a syllable that
is in the syllabary and for some strange
reason they later on made a simplified
version of the same syllabary we are
completely parallel but they're sort of
used for different things for cultural
reasons but if you look at the two last
characters of each one they're in kana
part you see that the rightmost one is a
simplification of the left leftmost one
where this is Hong Google which is the
writing of Korea
it looks like it's similar to the
Chinese system that's actually not the
case each of these books are made up of
individual letters in an alphabet and
then yeah I'm writing our presentation
of fur box right now and that precludes
me from doing a small demo I was going
to this I'll just tell you about it this
is Arabic and this is this is Hebrew so
their distinguishing feature is that
they are written right to left so
everything is mirrored and if you paste
this into a text editor for example the
one that you have in PowerPoint and you
start at the left hand side and arrow to
the right then you go like this until
you like this until you get to here and
then you pop over there
and you continue Arabic right then we go
this way let me go there we pop back
there and then go this way and over
there
so if you want to make software that
uses both a right-to-left and
left-to-right languages and can mix them
properly then you have a job ahead of
you because that stuff is really really
hard I'm going to talk about a tool
called pseudo look which is very useful
for verifying that you've done sensible
things to localization and pluralization
which is also a surprisingly difficult
subject so how do we localize stuff we
for example this is a bit of a UI from
an Android application and it has a
hard-coded string in it the button text
is says open activity so to make this
localizable we just extract that string
into a different text file and XML file
and reference it from the family UI code
so the actual resource file looks
something like this and once you have
done that you have done the localize
ability part then you have made it
possible to localize this program into a
different language because then you end
up with a tree structure like this you
have one default XML file which is
typically us English please for us then
you have in a different sub folder you
had one for Bulgarians
you have one for Catalan in this case
and then you can choose you can
distribute the whole thing so that your
users can change the language on the fly
on their computer sister
all you can package each one separately
and sell as sort of distributors to
languages that the individual users want
to have those are possible to this tree
too to localize things that are not
not strength it can be a culture
sensitive images and so on and at least
the way we do it in Microsoft we send
this stuff off to the third parties to
translate and let me get things back and
we are not always impressed with the
quality so one thing we can do is to add
comments wherever we can to make it
easier for the actual localizer it's the
one who understands the native language
to figure out what it's actually meant
in English the word update can be a noun
and can be a word and then we can
specify in a comment that this is a verb
so that the because it might get
different word in different languages
and we have another approach to quality
reference we have something like 30
different nationalities working in in
Oslo so there's always somebody who
knows some language so we have people
who actually know the domain go over the
app and test that everything is good yes
you do look that's a tool that can be
used to test test the localization of an
app so it just takes the file of
resource string and strings and mangle
it so it pretends markers to the end
start and end of each string and then
can do different stuff as well then you
can maybe change left to right to right
to left to see how that works you can do
that even if it even if you're not
actually having an Arabic or Hebrew or
whatever interface you're actually
Arabic the Arabic alphabet is not used
just for out for Arabic it's also used
for Iranian or Farsi and somewhat to my
surprise it's the first line first
alphabet ever used to write Afrikaans
which is the Dutch version spoken in
South Africa but that's completely
beside the point but it's fun
interesting
so well it looks like it's something
like this we change the resource file
where it says feedback we have taken a
couple of characters at the front and
the back to serve as the limiters and we
take these from a completely different
character set just to verify that the
application can handle those character
sets then if you want to you can mangle
all the characters in between as well
which I think it's a fun so I do that
but you don't have to it's more readable
if you don't it's very easy tool to make
and just gobble in an XML file and spit
out another one and at this point I was
going to do a small demo but since we
couldn't connect this box to that screen
we and the demo is on that box I'm not
in that box and we don't do the demo but
it's not a big deal it's I have slides
that will show what I want to show
anyway
but the digression I was going to do
before the demo is to talk about feature
flags
that's another tax that we pay which
nobody actually has to pay this is
completely voluntary but when we develop
new features we don't ship them to all
new customers all at once we sort of try
them out in a small circuit and then we
have feature flags that says should this
user have this new feature or not and we
couple that with a concept of rings that
they sort of expand we start with the
first team that gets to see the mute
functionality would be the feature team
itself two people working on the on the
on the product the next might be
Microsoft in Norway and outside and that
might be all of Microsoft and we like to
have things cook a bit in each of those
rings before we send to the next ring to
verify that we don't didn't make any
screw-ups because we sometimes do that
I'm sorry to say
and you can also target specific
audiences if we want to we can also use
this with a be testing basically we can
have a certain subset of users based
maybe on a hash of their user ID get the
new feature then you can get the rest of
the user get the old feature and then we
can if we have some lemon tree in place
we can actually see if this is an
improvement or not so that was the end
of the digression and I was going to
show you an app where I have access to
features that you don't even though you
can install the app if you like but
those features are only for the future
cream so we try impart that anyway what
can see the lock tell us you can tell us
if we have hard coded resources or under
localization the do we format strings
properly relieving the token pasting or
string concatenation if you look at the
code sample here the first one
concatenates two strings concatenates
the number with the trailing string and
that can be localized in some languages
but almost certainly not in all where's
a few if you did properly with a
formatting string with a placeholder
then you can easily change the order of
things you can have words before after
whatever do we have the longer strings
gracefully you'll note that the sudo
lock thing made strings longer than they
used to be this is actually not as much
of a problem now as it used to be
because in the olden days of win32
programming you usually had a fixed grid
where you had your layout and you did
your UI and everything looked good and
then you translated this into German and
then suddenly everything was clicked at
the end because German tends to be
longer but even so it's good to verify
that the even even with a with an
adaptable UI
to get to verified it actually will make
longer strange script because some
languages are longer the and rendering
old character sets correctly that's why
we like to have some characters in there
from completely different writer sets
it's actually possible to over localize
as well I'll show you one example of
that eventually there are some things
that you log cannot tell us it cannot
tell us if the texts are any good
unfortunately and if there are problems
with images or icons it can tell us that
either that here is an example of a
missing translation that we can easily
discover when you run this application
in a pseudo look locale because you get
all these strings that are mangled and
you can see that the include email
address string has not been mangled so
that means it's not a resource it's
basically hard-coded into the app and
therefore you have to go back and fix
that then you have string concatenation
if a different language wanted to put
that link somewhere in the middle of the
string instead of at the end that would
make translation quite hard and the
reason why this one ended up like this
is because we have a hyperlink which is
a different widget from the text widget
so if we actually want to solve this
properly which is what we ended up doing
then you have to write code that can
generate a more complex widget for you
on the fly programmatically which is a
lot more work than just putting strings
into a table but sometimes you have to
do that there is a similar one and you
can see that the number 163 should have
been part of the something formatted
inside the string if you had a
placeholder and we don't have a
placeholder in this case it's because
the
number has a different text size and in
this case below it's because the the
name has boldface on it which it also
requires to actually write code to
generate the widget with to text bits or
free text bits and get to locate the
placeholder in blah blah blah so it's a
lot more work than than this their final
string concatenation if you are Yoda you
would want to express this different
thing but it's basically the same as two
kind of for more examples here's an
example over localization you can see at
the bottom of the card it should say
actually the name of day which it
doesn't this is what the resource looks
like the four days just signifies that
formatting that we should have the main
localized name of the weekday and if we
mangle if you like I'm missing a slide
here but what happened in and would see
the look is that it mangled and the
letters inside the 4d so it was not no
longer for these it was for something
else so this wouldn't be a problem if
nobody none of the localizer is actually
change this training because then it
will still be a DB DB which works in all
languages but this chain prob will not
have been a resource in the first place
because it sort of invites trouble to
the hardcore the app name in the string
that may or may not be a problem
depending on whether you want to
translate the app name or not
if you have any questions along the way
please feel free to raise your hands and
just be aware that I you see me better
than writing you because there are
lights yes what not to localize usually
we try to stay away from localizing
server-side log messages and that kind
of things logs in general because we
sort of assume that the most sysadmin
understand english and but sometimes i'm
surprised i once installed a german
edition of visual studio with the german
edition of dotnet and it turned out all
the all the exception messages now we're
now in German so that's what was a bit
of a surprise to me but fairly
impressive
we try not to do that ok next subject is
true realization back in all days the
Windows File Explorer used to have is to
display the number of items selected
like this which I can see something to
remember it doesn't do that anymore
really used to do that and it sort of
begged me because I was young and stupid
and thought it would be very simple to
just fix it by something like this you
can just pretend an S if it was not one
because grammatically in English one is
singular
everything else is plural but of course
it turns out there was a reason they
cheated this is actually a very hard
problem
I lost my monitor but that's again what
you were here for example even in
English you have irregular plurals one
women one woman two women or sheep one
sheep two sheep try to play apply the
same rule to those examples it will be
wrong and that means you can't
generalize it the German it changed not
just the plural Casa de nom but you
might change the verb as well so I'm
that icon miss killer friend one file
could not be deleted but to the high-end
content missed Colossians I have to
change n tasted in two places and this
is just a start because you go to polish
you have one case for the singular then
you have one case for the two three and
four and then it's suddenly different to
rule four five
this has something to do with the
genitive case but I don't actually
understand Polish very also so hidden
click that's one file roughly 2000 pH
click of five files ha there and there
are many different ways of dealing with
this but the most elegant or the most
understandable overview I've seen comes
from Mozilla and firefox where they have
taken all the languages that exist and
divided them into plural rules sixteen
different oral rules and within each
plural rule you have one or more plural
form and just to show some examples of
that rule zero is what you have in the
Far East languages like Japanese you
don't really have a plural which has one
file to file a file so that's very
simple then you have rule level zero
real one like Germanic languages the
trooper English is too from the region
you have one is similar everything else
is true
but even then you can have
irregularities like in women so forth
then you have a whole bunch of different
forms of varying complexity if you look
at Slavic languages they all have some
kind of issue with 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 but they are
different issue from for each language
so you have 4 different rules for Slavic
languages and deal with they're mostly 2
3 &amp;amp; 4 but they also have some 3 or 4
different forms so that's one of them
that's even more complicated I have a
list in my bag if somebody wants to see
it afterwards the rule 15 is sort of
interesting
it's Icelandic which is with an outlier
it's exactly like Norwegian except if
things end in one it's singular anyway
except if it's 11 because then it's
plural so why they held it up there I
don't know and the one the most forms I
found was Bret one in six forms so I
don't want to learn that language thank
you very much so an example of how this
might work is in Polish then you have to
provide three different forms for every
word that you translate so we have
seconds minutes hours and days so the
form next column is singular the second
is the plural use for two three four and
twenty two twenty three twenty four and
so on and the last one is everything
else and one downside to this is that it
makes stuff a lot more complicated for
localizers they have to understand this
and that's not necessarily easy luckily
most of the strings that we have don't
have any numbers in them they don't
require pluralization so this only
applies to a small subset of all the
strings that we have in the application
then sample music this is from from the
test
testicle actually just verifies that it
has all the right chloral for everything
and if you're a bit stumped by the
string dot localized this is a c-sharp
extension method so it's actually a
static method that takes the string as
the first parameter and the number as
the second parameter and the string is a
resource identifier this is just one way
of creating confusion if you as a
programmer see I'm actually bit behind
schedule derp
next thing is accessibility that's all
the stuff we do to cater to people with
disabilities of various kinds the one
I'll be spending the most time on is the
visual one where you have people who
might be completely blind they might
have impaired vision they might be color
blind the hearing deafness and
hard-of-hearing I've never done anything
that involves sound at all so I don't
have much to say about that I can say
one small thing about people people with
poor motor control or drunks as we call
the some of the things that they can do
to make life easier is to actually
increase the size of touch targets and
things like that and that actually helps
normal users as well so that's one thing
to keep in mind let me have cognitive
disabilities learning disabilities and
focusing problems and so on and being
drunk of course and before I dive into
the visual stuff or just to show you a
short excerpt from something I found on
the net that describes your typical
developer and even though developers
tend to be pretty smart that's not their
distinguishing feature I mean it can be
bright as hell but if you don't have the
ability to absorb retain and reference
large amounts
meaningless details trust into later
experience to give it context and
meaning then you won't be very well as
developer because that's that's what we
do and by now I'm sure having you read
the entire thing and that makes
developers perhaps not the best people
to create user interfaces for people
with the cognitive disabilities so I'll
just remind you of the title of a book
by Steve Krug where the title says more
than most books don't make me think just
keep that principle in mind that can
help quite a lot okay visual
disabilities blindness if you are
completely blind then you are dependent
on a screen reader which could actually
read the text on the page to you and
that often means that you also have to
have the keyboard navigation so you can
tap from one control to the next and
that means that all functionality in
your the program must be accessible
through the keyboard interface which can
be a bit of a challenge making the
screen reader make sense can also be a
bit of a challenge I mean there is a lot
of support for this out of the box in
modern systems but even so it's very
easy to get into problems especially if
you might make a lot of custom controls
yourself hmm there's one upside to this
when you do things with a screen readers
often have to assign accessibility IDs
or something to individual widgets and
this can be reused in the in unit
testing so you can use them to drive
your your actual UI in testing which is
good I believe well I expect you all
have some sort of smartphones so a fun
experiment is to take it out and go to
settings and just turn on the
accessibility features and see what it
does to you it's quite interesting I
would recommend you try that
impaired vision that's basically a
couple of things we do with high
contrast variants of the UI for people
with poor vision and for such people it
can be very difficult to distinguish to
tell that a gray text is gray because
the system is trying to tell them
something or because their eyes are not
working properly so that's why we have
high contrast and why we don't use
animations in those cases and this is an
example of what a high contrast
interface can look like this is one of
the several standard ones included with
Windows you have one white on black one
black and white in a couple of different
colors and people pick the one they want
or they customize their own and this is
very very far removed from what my
designer grew up he doesn't like this at
all so aligning this spend what our
graphical designers did can be a bit of
a challenge and one way of approaching
that is a example how to handle borders
first of all try to align all your
design colors within the system colors
because you have the whole long list
you
hey power went out I have sound okay I
have sound that's something the what was
I talking about Ivan Justin this Laster
requires an illustration so oh yeah
borders it's kind of hard to talk about
borders without having a picture but I
can skip ahead and talk about color
blindness I was in a safari in South
Africa a couple years ago with my
brother and we've been driving around in
the new Kruger Park in an open car with
a guide and looking at lions and
giraffes and all kinds of thing wasn't
very good and then the guide drove up to
Bush and Bush had bury something so do
you have to taste this perish they're
quite good and my brother picked the
berry and the guide said no not that one
that's green it's not too right take a
red one and he dropped berry and takes
another one green and for now you might
have guessed that my brother is
colorblind so we couldn't really
couldn't distinguish between red and
green berries and the really interesting
thing is that our fellow passengers
thought he was joking they couldn't
believe that it couldn't actually tell
the difference but we can't so what that
goes to show is it's not that you can't
use color in your UI you can even use
color to distinguish things as long as
that is not the only distinguishing
feature we have to add something else
and I have slides with samples of these
but the slides are currently dark oh
yeah
yes okay let's take one step back and go
to the borders this is what our designer
gave us it is a button without a border
that's fine because suddenly the button
face itself doesn't need a border it's
certainly distinguishable from the
background but if you apply a high
contrast setting to it it ends up maybe
like this and it's no longer obvious
that this is a doesn't it looks like
some kind of text maybe what do I know
so one solution to that is to actually
add a border with a logically different
color which is physically the same color
as the button face and then in the high
contrast scenario you just change the
physical color corresponding to that
other color and you had what still looks
like a button and it looks the way it
should in in high contrast mode and
that's basically why you want to stick
with the enumerated the system colors
that you have on all platforms and then
there is a color that says this is the
board button border color and you use
that one and we can map it to whatever
else you like in your designers design
that make sure it goes back to what it
should be when it's a high contrast yeah
this is just an illustration of our car
in the Africa with our the game warden
our guide and this is during the
afternoon break this is not the berries
so here's an example of an excerpt from
the London Tube map on the left-hand
side you see this one basically uses
only color to distinguish different
lines and on the left-hand side you can
see the map as it's supposed to be seen
and on the right-hand side you can see
it as it might appear to somebody who's
colorblind
one way or the other so anybody see them
as the same
No okay good for you the another example
if you use only color as the
distinguishing features how about this
one is this different everybody that's
not almost surprising
should have been at least one in this
color month but what you do to fix it if
it's supposed to add something else it's
okay to use color to distinguish things
as long as that's not the only thing we
use okay we'll talk a little bit about
telemetry it's being used to get
feedback from users I like this feature
I hate that feature I have this idea for
new features this is crash reporting if
the something goes bad then we need to
know why preferably with a good stack
trace we do quality of service
monitoring do our say you have a
scenario like page load does it work if
so how long does it take and we can see
which features are being used and things
like that
we can use an AV testing so you might
write code that looks a bit like this
it's a c-sharp you wrap all your code in
monitoring code and so you basically say
this scenario succeeded or this scenario
failed in case of a failure and if
you're not used to see sharp i'm the
using statement it's basically a wrapper
around an interface that has a disposed
method so it does that in the final
clause so that basically means if the
dispose method is always called there
might be exceptions that you find
acceptable file not found maybe it's
that's okay or if you're trying to
download the resource over the net if
you don't have a network connection then
obviously that's not your fault and it's
nothing your program can do to fix it
well I'll just skip over that honest
implementation of the one monitor class
a very simplified one to be sure that
this kind of code is not too hard to
write that if you look at the usage you
can see that the highlighted line of
code which is the only actual line doing
anything sort of drowns in all the
scaffolding surrounding it and that's a
bit of a problem with monitors like this
especially if you have more complex
scenarios with sub scenarios and blah
blah blah you have to really hunt to
find the actual functionality of the
program so we have some people who have
been experimented that they're an
attribute based approach where you map
the scenarios to methods and you just
apply attributes instead and that's
actually much nicer
the one thing about logging is privacy
the user identifiable information is
something that is definitely a no-no and
we try really hard to keep that out of
the laws I mean it's whenever there's a
leak of that kind of sorts then the
engineer on watch is called in the
middle of the night if necessary and
told you go fix it or turn off the
service or whatever but mitigate the
problem and seeing as I have five
minutes left I have actually come to the
end of the most interesting parts there
are some some taxes that I don't think
are as fun so I put them at the end in
the hope that I wouldn't have to talk
about them and then I I'll take that one
which may or may not be a tax is this
fairly new concern but if you're used to
selling to market this is especially for
mobile development but if you're used to
selling in markets in North America or
Europe you can expect that people have
decent devices you can expect that they
have decent network coverage and so
forth that if you're selling in say
India you can expect that they have not
so good devices when the connectivity is
slow and it's usually metered so it's
expensive and they have to have to think
about how to deal with that if you want
to reach that market and that's what
Twitter is actually done by making a
custom version of Twitter which is
hopefully right which is very very small
it uses through this little networking
as possible and so on so the ideal thing
would be to have a single app that
actually adapted dynamically to
different conditions you can sort of set
parameters for what goes on here so we
have a couple of minutes any questions
if anybody wants to come work for
Microsoft you talk to me or send me an
email we live a few blocks from here and
then I have one final thought that is
that all of these things tend to be much
more expensive to retrofit them to
implement from the start so it's a very
good idea to find out ahead of time and
you start on a new project what are the
requirements because you don't want to
do things you don't have to do because
this it's costly but you can find out
what the requirements actually are then
you can plan ahead thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
