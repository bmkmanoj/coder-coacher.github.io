people than I thought would be on the
lightning tow truck so I submitted well
I actually then actually submit anything
people they need to talk about something
that actually did and what I did
recently was changing careers I used to
be a son engineer and I got bitten by
the programming bug and I wanted to try
and get to well where I am today I guess
I think is going to be of I'm going to
share some of my adventure some of age
my issues and some of the things that
actually helped me understand and learn
things as I went along so a little bit
about what I used to do as a son
engineer I used to have a brilliant team
of engineers that we used to do
installation of studios and we used to
the maintenance and we used to do pretty
much they to the ops you can imagine
that we had something very similar to an
epic which was get us to do together and
we would have several little tickets
which would be you know hook up this
book of that or fixtures or fix that so
from that to you know day-to-day
operations as a programmer not much of a
difference I used to love doing that I
just sit down put another win and just
sold the like thousands of solder points
a day and think about how to
interconnect every single device in the
studio it's very similar to your
distributed computing where you have
several boxes doing something do
something piece of information coming in
we would do that with audio so you have
some other coming into a box and it will
get changed and go somewhere else we had
to think all that front end design for
it and adapter and change it I used to
do a lot of life sounds and this is a
little bit like all the people there on
the audience up subscribe to my screen
and it makes it easier to draw parallels
between what was going to happen was
happening so we had several microphones
on stage and those are the clients or
more API and my API would actually be
the console and then we would do some
send something to a worker which will
then eventually send it to the speakers
people subscribe to the speaker's
usually by buying tickets I guess and
also I used to do a lot of recordings I
used to do anything from like little
bands too big orchestral pieces with 50
60 70 people these were extremely
expensive you can imagine paying
professional 6070 professional musicians
for a whole day bless the venue of that
size plus very expensive equipment and
again several microphones you can
imagine these are the sound sources are
your api's consumers again and they go
into an API which would be our computer
or a tape machine and then we will have
a database with a fullback database
because you don't record just to one
source capacity silly and I'm speaking
from experience on a programming world
where we just have one day to day things
can go wrong and on all of this you
usually had really really crap cold
coffee it was horrible even if you had
nice coffee and you made the coffee by
the time I actually get to drink it it's
cold because someone would come and ask
you for help or or things we go out
heater then you had to actually you know
show must go on and what was that what
was that what I was promised was
something much simpler with just a
computer in a mouse and nice coffee okay
the coffee is better and usually warm is
not as simple as it just a keyboard
minimizing just press dot and
intelligence will do the rest for you
it's not that simple okay why did I want
to do this I was working with games and
I would be news few sounds and i would
try and put them on the scene and
eventually someone would send me a
snippet okay those are over email and
you're like just paste it into whatever
file and i never liked doing that i
always want to understand why i like to
understand what am i doing what is that
code doing and I thought and I still do
think that learning what the code is
doing would help me as a sound engineer
I could develop sounds better I could
improve how I was processing them if I
understand how they were used also
unity3d was the best to ever to learn
programming it's so nice to just curl a
couple things press run and you can
press X on your control and the
character jumps and go yeah or it jumps
down
goes to the floor or you try to animate
the fan and instead of going you know
fan got x axis transform you go stand
out y axis don't transform and the fans
slides slicing the characters around the
room so you get to see exactly what your
programming and that was really really
really helpful of course I didn't learn
this until like a year later and I bang
my head really hard against the wall
until I got to that point right so how
can it be I did not do computer science
I didn't order a levels like a bit of
science I did not do integrate I was
trying to learn this after work on my
own ok let me give you a little bit of
background on something else I used to
read manuals I was I was brought up my
mentors were old-school tape machine
guys I worked with some people I work
with beetles and literally the way that
they went up in their careers was a show
up in this dude I'm making coffee and
reading manuals and once you read all
the manuals for every piece of equipment
in the studio maybe you'll have a shot
that operating one of them usually get
promoted tape operator and you go from
there so I was actually studying pieces
like this which is from a mixing console
and understanding how the signal goes
and what passes on and and I used to
draw with sharpies all the possible
paths and combinations so when people
start showing me about microservices and
it should be the computing it wasn't
that different and when I say you need
to understand where the signal is in the
room or in the console or between pieces
of equipment I mean you really need to
understand it because debugging that
it's a lot harder than sometimes evoking
distributed systems we don't have things
like that and I grabbed this off
AppDynamics reservoirs you ok so you
mistake number one I used to read
manuals like the others from for one of
the console that actually shows on an
earlier picture and I decide to go out
and grab that and I literally just sat
down later coffee and start reading it
it's was terrible and after two weeks I
would like you know what I'm not giving
up i keep going
it was even worse and and then we
started talking about pointers and I
never was a single line of code in my
life and I was I have no idea what's
going on someone suggested this okay
that made it a little bit better because
they had some code to follow along so I
was actually trying to get some stuff
but if you know nothing about computer
science and you're going why am i
opening a file sriman decorating it with
a bus so and what is all this and then I
need to close all this stuff walk it's
very very very confusing it was enough
to literally just put me off program for
a while okay it was a big fail and I
honestly felt very very very surrounded
I had had cats sorry just people
mentioning cat so I kind of had some
catch to the presentation also my line
manager said caps were cool so you know
ok pard soup there is a lot of great
information out there and I think this
was what i use and i think you worked
really well for me might not work well
for everyone but i think it's a nice set
of tips to give to people they won't get
started this book is amazing is
incredible if you never done sit the
computer science i think is a must-read
it's much smaller than the c++ one and
it actually introduces two good concepts
how processor works our memory works our
heat in stacks work and a bunch of
concerts that i might not have
understood at a time but now when i do
certain things i unconsciously refer
back to it i think i use this every day
of my life now another one that is great
as Udacity they have a lot of free
courses and some of them that page i did
a python computer science course and
basically on lesson one day went we're
going to build a search engine and a web
crawler okay cool so you don't start by
going here's some hello world and blah
you start literally by going to the
raffle and start experimenting with such
rings and arrays and things like that
and actually by lesson to your building
a little list and dictionary of strings
that you can go through and do stuff to
it
by like the end of first week when when
Chris got home I was like a quick sort
algorithm today from scratch which was
awesome but I'll never do again because
link does that for you but it's the
feeling that you're not reading a book
they'll go oh hello world and now you
can do for x equals lie and that's now
an integer or you can cast these two is
the feeling that you doing something
that's actually fun and national project
that's actually happen in real life
meetups like Chris mentioned they are
super friendly if you once start talking
go to me too speaks to your local
meetups I then I guess involved or
fallen closely London City and London a
user group there's tons of them out
there so whatever your passion is or
whatever things you want to learn just
find the right knee tub they usually
super super friendly the steam of books
so books can be hit or miss but when
they go they're really good they have
this cookbook style approach that you
can buy a book follow the cookbook
instructions you learn a couple things
and then you have funding their works
they can use as a sandbox to experiment
and they have ranges from game engines
all the way to elasticsearch to machine
learning whatever you you want they are
going to spin you with email saying 10
books for five pounds and then ten
minutes later you're going i just spent
200 pounds it's pretty dangerous Leonard
on edge is a group another another big
drop to those guys I think there's a few
in here maybe yes they have been very
helpful very approachable a really nice
bunch of people and pluralsight which
some people desk but scott allen courses
got me through my profession I just eat
I got in there not knowing what MDC was
so quick little fake google and in two
three days you have the basics to
actually go on and do some work so I've
been doing tons of course in on
pluralsight elasticsearch so I went that
it was a good place to start it was
great it's a bit expensive but it's well
worth it your employee my Ashley place
if you ask okay things were going really
well I felt like every day I was being
amazing improvement so then I decided I
wanted to learn objective-c because i
wanted to do apps and some applications
for all of you and you know all the
people who's max so oh but then if i'm
doing apps i need to learn android as
well because you know you need to have
them both platforms as otherwise what's
Luna was a point c++ because I was
really into programming and there the SP
programming and programming all the
effects and that's all using C++ anyway
so I also had to learn unity because
unity is freaking awesome and I'll so
Amazon Web Services and you know oh oh
yes piedad no and nasty but net call are
coming out so I needed to actually get
on that as well and also I wanted to
learn everything about Fourier transform
filters and the SP processing and things
been terribly wrong I tried to do
everything in one go take one or two
subjects swap between them when you're
tired don't try and just like everything
at once big something that you really
like and stick with it this was I think
it sent me back six months prolly year
of my life trying to do all this okay my
real challenges and I'm getting to the
takeaway right rut state the state as a
talk people everyone's different
communication is key not always easy the
amount of arguments I see people having
because this Kurdish cracking that code
is better than this framework is bad i'm
no framework is worse not going on
things not agreeing on how endpoints
should be that was one of the really
hard things to learn the other one is
slow processes I mean a cross-functional
team right now and I submit full request
to all your team and your team and and
register at one point as well and every
single one of them have different
processes different CI builds different
CI different pipelines different some of
them had PowerShell build scripts some
of them had Ruby build scripts it was
really hard to get all this and be able
to understand and work between all of
these but understanding them is key it
might be hard it might be overwhelming
but you'll get a
ask for help the best tip I can give
give unit-testing when I was interested
to DVD it was one of the hardest days of
my life I got home and just slapped
because I was like my mind was
completely blown you need to practice
and I actually found something really
cool i found some people teaching
programming by test first and that helps
people get into the TDD frame of mind
and literally tip like they would cover
the basic types they would have a string
integers blah and then go straight to
unit testing so every line of code he
would do would be best riven and that
was an amazing course and probably if I
get it someone to try and teach
programming I'll do the same thing will
be my test subject and frameworks
through a lot of baggage and i'm looking
at da tonight isn't anyone that works
from microsoft ahem there Ian super has
a bit of a rant on Twitter a while ago
and he went on an awesome conversation
copper a botnet to Buffy and how you had
to actually change you know I had to
change the characters to get new people
into the show and had to change the
story line to you know reboot constantly
get people into it and he's absolutely
right I remember asking what tax return
was I remember Raj coming to me is like
you shouldn't be using that return now
like I know what I'm doing some people
actually explain to me the task pattern
by saying all the previous one was awful
and what that is not really helpful it's
hard to have people that can come to you
sit down and explain to you the basic
I'll explain to you how something is
supposed to be used during work thanks
ROG by the way giving you a lot of plugs
today takeaways they're amazing online
courses they'll get you our hands on and
working on interesting projects not just
you know random strings and random stuff
they'd never get anywhere actual sandbox
projects do not respect books to not go
and buy sequel / reference books don't
pick of technologies I'm try and learn
everything at once get on get or any
distributed version control system as
soon as you can and you've mentioned
that earlier it's
it's essential these days for any work
or even open source contributions as
soon as you feel comfortable the
language get your unit testing and go to
conference room meet up people are
surprisingly super friendly and helpful
including open source projects
contributions as well do I have anything
else oh yes and start suggesting the
juniors mentor as soon as possible even
if it's onboarding other people to your
processes get them actually trying to
explain to other people because when you
explain something to someone else that's
when questions start showing up and
that's when you really realize your gaps
in your knowledge so oh another one when
teaching here we remember that they
might never come across whatever it is
that you're showing them the first time
I saw lamb this I have a heart attack I
have no idea what was going on and
people just malicious symbol under and
like spies don't know what that is and I
remember teaching someone about anarres
and they were like why can't I just go
away age because I went an age and I had
to explain that they need put DLX and it
was actually quite hard to explain so
you know they might have never cost come
across something like that and yes thank
you any questions for me or any of the
lightning talks presenters no okay I
guess I'll let you guys go and get some
food from the buffet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
