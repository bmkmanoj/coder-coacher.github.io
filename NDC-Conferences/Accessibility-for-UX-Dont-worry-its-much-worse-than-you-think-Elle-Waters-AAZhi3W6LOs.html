a couple of gifts to help you guys think
about accessibility and the work that
you do so that's one of the little tools
that we'll go through in a bit so on the
screen I have a set of escalators and
it's pretty common to see them all kind
of stacked together like this and right
now it's a still picture so if you think
about kind of the path that you take to
use escalators you might start with this
one going down right so then it's pretty
logical to think that the next one that
you go on would be this one going down
this one going up because you need both
directions right seems pretty
straightforward that's kind of what we
would expect to see however I hope that
this makes you feel kind of like
friction and there's a little bit of
discord there what's really going on
here it's stupidity I don't think that
it's a requirement that something is an
up escalator when it's installed right
I'm pretty sure you can flip a switch
and make it go whatever you whichever
way so when somebody's coming down let's
do this again when somebody is coming
down on this escalator they come over
here
the first inclination is to come down
this way they bump into someone so then
they have to move and go this way and
that's a principle that we talk about a
lot with in usability and accessibility
and it's basically the principle of
proximity that you want to group related
things together because it's intuitive
that you're going to be conducting the
same kinds of actions next to one
another in proximity
sure absolutely
and it's the same concept that even if
these were the other direction you would
expect that your path is to go down the
same way go up the same way but you're
right it's a good point too so we're
gonna do a little experiment if you guys
all have your straws go ahead and hold
them up and what I want you to do is to
close one eye and you can pick whichever
one you want and put the straw up to the
other eye and what we're gonna do is
kind of simulate what it's like to fill
out a webform if you could only see
through a very narrow kind of viewport
okay so everybody ready no cheating
don't look with both eyes so go ahead
and fill out that webform and normally I
take a photo but I'm not going to do
that food to you guys and you can go
ahead and put it down when you're done
yeah so besides us being a pretty ugly
form which we know this is actually a
form we encountered when working with a
client team it's been anonymized to
protect the guilty what are some things
that you found yourself doing when you
were trying to fill out that form yeah
did you see you were kind of moving back
and forth and back and forth and back
and forth and so when you're someone who
has low vision and you might have a very
very small viewport that you're looking
at maybe you've zoomed the screen in
very very very closely in order to be
able to see things the problem that you
came across was if you're looking at it
here right you see these questions are
you a US citizen then you have to go all
the way over here by the time you get to
this point you see the button the radio
buttons and you're supposed to make a
selection and it's not in any way next
to the question then you go back to
question two and you go back to the
answers for question two then you go
back to question three
you go back to the answers back to
question four back to the text input
field so the other thing that's
happening is you're establishing a
pattern of use so you get accustomed to
this back and forth and back and forth
motion so the very next thing you're
gonna do is to go back to that area
where you've gotten accustomed to going
and what's the first thing you see quit
so then you think okay well before I
knew about how far away the answers were
so I'll go that far and look for the
button that's maybe not quit and so I go
to the next one previous and you kind of
give up at that point the problem with
this form which can be coded perfectly
for people who are blind who use screen
readers absolutely perfectly they have
no problems they can get through that
fly through it they complete the task
move on
the problem with this form is that it's
grouping the wrong elements together
visually and so when you see this you've
got the questions grouped together and
the answers grouped together and so you
have to consider the proximity of things
when you're looking at how to create a
delightful experience for mobile users
you also want to think about that for
low vision users as well additionally we
talked about this in a lot of UX
conversations as well these three
buttons have something that we call the
same visual weight so there's no real
distinguishing characteristics between
what the primary call-to-action is
except for having to read the text which
increases a cognitive load for anyone
because you have to basically decode
that at that point so here's this magic
of CSS that we're able to do so pretty
so this is not a recommendation that
every form needs to be visually designed
this way but it's an example of showing
how if you're gonna be looking at how
you group the items together this makes
it something a lot easier for someone to
be able to use it's great for people
with low vision it's great from a mobile
user perspective as well and then if you
look as well we've changed the visual
weight for the buttons
next is very clearly the call-to-action
that you want people to take and they
can also still access those other ones
so if you want to go ahead and pick up
the straw and look through it again and
then see how much different it might
feel to be able to fill out that form
and they're still going to be some
left-right movement back and forth
that's not something that you're looking
to completely eliminate but you want
that ease of use to be something much
more significant and useful for people
so if you're going here it's more like a
this kind of experience right so that's
something we like to call the straw test
we have some UX cards that we give to
people as they're creating user
experiences and interactions for people
and it's kind of like if you've ever
seen those constraint cards it gives you
a challenge to consider something
differently as you're designing and
starting to think more inclusively so we
have those in beta lots of fun and we
use them in a lot of design critiques
with teams as well so accessibility for
UX don't worry it's much worse than you
think and my name is Elle waters you can
find me a haunting twitter at another
mind and you can email me Elle it's
simply accessible calm I really answer
emails one of the things that I'll talk
about a little bit if we have some time
it's a new guide that we put together
and if you email me it's yours and I'll
be excited to share it with you hot off
the presses so this was a question that
comes up a lot in my line of work I work
at a company called simply accessible so
we provide consulting design development
testing teaching and partnering to coach
teams on how to be able to build more
inclusive experiences so this question
really comes up quite often in the work
that we do is so why don't people make
stuff accessible and especially people
who work in a UX capacity whether you're
a front-end engineer and you work a lot
with CSS
you work a lot with creating layouts
pattern libraries and systems that have
a very you know front UI layer to them
or if you're more of a classic UX
professional and you're an information
architect or a visual designer it seems
like those individuals with sort of you
in the title of what they do should
incorporate more accessibility into what
they do so we did a survey a couple of
years ago and asked them why don't you
incorporate accessibility into more of
what you do so much like family feud we
have the top three answers here today
the number one answer
accessibility is intimidating yes this
is no good news right when I first
started in accessibility this is a
little bit like what my personal library
looked like because I thought okay I'm
really gonna get into this I'm gonna get
every book that I know about it and I'm
gonna read and read and fall asleep
reading these boring obtuse difficult
tomes of information hoping that they
recurrent not sure if they were current
and then I went online because that's
what we do as web professionals and I
found there's 203 general techniques for
testing web content accessibility
guidelines and then you know there's
client-side scripting techniques and
plain text aria flash if anybody's still
using that Silverlight if anyone's still
using that PDF why do we want to use
PDFs but you know what what we call this
in the accessibility industry a good
start everybody you talk to it feels so
intimidating it's overwhelming it's like
climbing a mountain and then there's all
those devices all these mysterious
things and the plethora of things that
people use as personal accommodation and
assistive technology in order to be able
to use digital to access digital content
and so you'll have switched devices and
you'll have things that speak to you and
things that you're able to simulate
keyboards and you might have a stylus
you
something that I thought was a Casio
keyboard when I first saw it a
refreshable Braille device which is
really super cool but it's very unusual
to those of us who don't use these
everyday and then to top it all off the
most popular screen reader has the
scariest name ever jaws so at some point
you can feel completely overwhelmed and
say I'm out there's no way that I know
how to be able to tackle this so why
should I start number to answer
accessibility is hard even if you know
what you're supposed to do there's real
work involved in doing that yes
accessibility is hard everybody has
tough days because accessibility is
measured in this binary way you're
either compliant or you're not so one
mistake and you fail right and that's
the impression that people get sometimes
you release new features and you don't
do end-user testing so do you want a
receipt yes next to the red button no
next to the green button a little bit
confusing a little off-putting to people
and sometimes we secretly hope that good
enough is really just good enough
because we're exhausted we're doing all
these other things this was at the top
of a wheelchair ramp that apparently
didn't meet code but was already built
and so you'll see the the push button to
be able to open the door electronically
and so you know instead of rebuilding
the ramp let's just put a sign that says
no wheelchairs permitted on ramp even
though it's at the top of the ramp so
somebody would have to get to the top of
the ramp to see it for wheelchair access
please use west entrance sometimes you
you just want to say can't you just give
me a pass on this so the eclipse is
happening in the United States next week
on Monday and super excited about this
we don't get a lot of good things and a
lot of good news these days in America
so this is something we're all kind of
hoping for I'm a little bit concerned I
live in Louisville Kentucky right now
and
it's in Hopkinsville Kentucky that has
been renamed eclipse Ville the point of
greatest totality and thousands of
people are coming to Hopkinsville
Kentucky so I don't know how much people
know about the state of Kentucky but
it's a little bit like the movie of the
show the leftovers if you think of
Jarden Texas and the masses of crowds
that are hanging out and and the
screaming angry people who are maybe a
little overzealous about their
particular ideologies or the set of
deliverance sometimes this is what I
fully expect there are no hotels within
about three hundred miles and almost all
of the campgrounds are rented and so I
live about two and a half hours away but
to be able to get there with any sim
length of sanity the idea would be that
we would be able to probably come a
little closer maybe stay the night
somewhere I'm a little afraid of that
I'm fully expecting the end is near to
be like on top of like sky written it's
very possible so if you don't hear from
me again you'll know at least it was
with that said I decided okay we're
gonna make this a family trip I'm gonna
find a campsite for us to be able to do
some camping the night before and we're
just gonna go native and get into this
and it'll be awesome and memorable so I
go to recreation gov I find this place
bumpass Mills Tennessee which is
actually not very far it's a part of
Barclay Lakes not very far from Hopkins
Hopkinsville Kentucky and he has a
little bit an old-fashioned sight you
can tell it was like a government site
just by looking at it but that's okay so
I decide I'm gonna type in I want to
find something from the 20th to the 21st
right I just want to spend the night
before this is the error message I got
minimum night stay required for the
arrival date selected please increase
the number of nights selected so it's
like a mystery because I don't know how
many number of nights so then I change
it Sunday to Tuesday how about that put
an extra one in there
minimum nights stay required for the
travel date selected not that okay
I'll just keep trying at this I guess
until they get something because then it
becomes like a contest right you want to
win and you're like I don't even expect
to stay that long but I just have to see
so that the error message goes away so
Saturday to Wednesday my family is never
going to allow us to do this in
Hopkinsville Kentucky area in that but
hey that's sure I'll do that nope
minimum nights stay required so finally
I put an absurd amount of time I was
like we're gonna be there a week
I want that error message to go away so
I did Friday to Friday Friday is not
reasonable because I'm here on Friday
right but whatever then I got this error
message those dates are not available
please adjust your search so what took
me probably five minutes of frustration
as a web professional who knows a lot
about the web and error messaging and
validation could have taken somebody
with a disability ten times as much so
on the up flip side of this Clarksville
RV park and campground has on their home
page we are fully booked for the solar
eclipse right there for everyone to see
it's a simple thing and it's not
exceptionally difficult to code this if
it's a heading it's just a way being
able to provide that experience for
people and they don't have to have that
extreme scenario so we often like to say
that disability is a usability amplifier
if something is five minutes of
heartache and frustration for someone
without a disability you can assume that
it's ten times as frustrating and
difficult and takes them that much
longer in order to be able to complete a
task on the flipside when something is a
pleasant user experience and it's easy
for you to use it is ten times more
pleasant for someone who's accustomed to
having to struggle through experiences
and define that makes them incredibly
loyal to your brand so I wanted to share
this with you and we were trying all
these cool shenanigans that weren't
gonna work and I'm sure it's Apple's
fault I'm fine with that
and is this on okay so there is a mobile
app for put out by MIT and it's called
Eclipse soundscapes and the coolest
thing about this is they've created this
for people who are not able to see the
Eclipse because they might have a vision
impairment or they might be blind or
they might be blind and deaf and it
gives them an audio and haptic user
experience on the mobile app of the
Eclipse and so it has all these
different kinds of things that you can
look at of these names of things like
Corona helmet streamers the different
kinds of points and the ways that that
experience may look to someone with
sight they've recreated so they say it
called call it a rumble map press to
interact with Rumble map so I don't know
how much this will go through I'm gonna
what I'm basically doing is this is the
map and I'm putting my thumb around the
Corona and then into the area of the
greatest totality
and then it's completely silent until
I'm on the other side and it has a
haptic sort of vibration experience that
gets more significant the brighter the
light they're gonna do this live during
the Eclipse as well which is a pretty
phenomenal experience when you think
about disability being a usability
amplifier it's that kind of stuff that
comes to my mind that you can go so much
further with creating an incredibly
inclusive environment the minimum level
is to just make it equally easy for
everyone but if you want to take it up a
notch consider different ways that
people might be able to experience
something so I highly recommend you guys
check this out it's a great mobile app
it's a oh s and Android both I don't
think there's a Windows app for that so
accessibility is hard because good
design is hard and we often tell people
that accessibility makes good designers
and good developers great designers and
great developers it makes bad designers
and bad developers obvious and so people
who want to improve their craft should
really look to this because this is a
way to make you incredibly skilled third
answer accessibility is not my job or
really we get this quote my work does
not involve persons with disabilities so
that would be a pretty spectacularly
exclusive kind of work that you do
because one in seven people in the world
have a disability or if you want to look
at it from say a developer of mindset
that's 15% of the world's population
versus 4.2 of internet browser users
that use IE or edge so when you're
thinking about the statistics that
you're building towards it's worth
considering if you need to talk to a
marketer it's a trillion dollars of
annual global disposable income it's
pretty significant
so 15% of your population whatever
country that you live in has some kind
of disability and they have money to
spend if you want to talk about what are
the extensible benefits of accessibility
everything you do to make something work
for someone who's blind or deaf actually
helps with findability and search engine
optimization everything you do to make
something with more accessible to
someone with low vision or mobility
challenges actually works towards
helping your mobile users as well those
two personas actually map very closely
to each other and everything you do to
make things better for someone who has
cognitive difficulties makes it more
usable and easier for everyone
Braintree recently put this out mobile
transactions are expected to increase by
74 percent over the next three years
because apparently we weren't going like
fast enough on that trajectory and so
now I don't even know it's 74 percent
more than what we're already
experiencing would be that's kind of
mind-boggling but if you're thinking
about building for mobile users this is
exactly in the same wheelhouse if you're
thinking about building something with
progressive enhancement as a responsive
site this is the same kind of approach
it all works very well together so if
it's not your job
whose job really is it so I'm gonna go
through seven tips for building more
inclusive designs this is from a user
experience point of view I know that I'm
at a developer conference but you guys
often get sort of shortchanged it's not
like you don't ever think about the user
experience and it's not just like you're
throwing forms up there and that you're
a code monkey and this kind of stuff so
we're out of respect for you guys I
think this is an important piece to be
able to put into sort of your toolbox if
you do want to go deep deep deep on
accessibility from a developer
perspective would love to have those
conversations with you we can talk about
SVG's and we can talk about angular all
things angular we can talk about react
we can talk about all those things and
discuss that kind of stuff and I would
love to be able to do that but really
this is the kind of stuff that says
the foundation so tip number one we
recommend creating what we call
inclusive personas and I'm gonna send
you guys this deck so we don't have to
go too deeply we usually go through this
exercise with client teams the idea is
that you don't need to create personas
that are your disability personas you
create the personas the normally would
for your product and you just think
about them in a more inclusive way so an
example this is John and he's 27 years
old he's a gallery artist he's a human
rights activist he makes tons of to do
to-do lists he feels overwhelmed pretty
often and he has autism spectrum
disorder so we made these for different
clients and this is rose she's a
journalist she's a graduate student she
doesn't have a lot of patience for time
wasters she uses a lot of stuff on her
mobile phone
she's been almost completely deaf since
birth and this is Mary she's 35 she's an
exceptional musician she plays over 11
instruments she's a professor of
ethnomusicology and she's looking she
just got this grant for teaching music
as an advocacy tool and she's developing
this student performance fundraiser for
World Vision for charity and she's been
blind since the age of 13 and she also
has parent fatigue which is kind of a
situational disability long lasting just
as an example this is from one that we
do a lot of usability testing with
people with disabilities we do almost
exclusively remote moderated testing
because unmoderated gives you feedback
that you can't follow up on and you
don't really understand the why of why
something failed and trying to do
something in person and try to do
something either in a lab has a lot of
disadvantages between not being able to
simulate someone's actual scenario and
environment and accommodation as well as
being slow slow slow this allows us to
be able to keep pace with agile teams
and be able to do these kinds of really
quick usability
studies so just to give you if you have
never heard a person who uses
screenreader it's a radically different
experience than people who don't use
them daily for their work in their place
so this is an example of one of our
usability testing participants setting
up TeamViewer which is one of the
applications we use so it's different
for people who use a screen reader every
day they use screen readers differently
for different for different kinds of
things but oftentimes it's very
transactional and so what they're doing
is they've adjusted so much to the sound
of their own screen reader and the
commands that are specific to their
screen reader that they get through that
so much faster and it doesn't make any
sense to someone who may be a sighted
user even if you use it for testing
which is not usually what we recommend
it's difficult to be able to have a real
experience like someone who uses a
screen reader this is Shawn he's 31
years old he's creating a micro donation
disaster relief mobile app and he gets
bored with technology very quickly he
happens to have low vision and he
requires the screen to have 400%
magnification so if he's if he's a UI
engineer in Palo Alto and you can
imagine he's looking at the screen all
that all the time he gets a fatigue
pretty easily this is Maxine she's 61
widowed she's got two children five
grandchildren she owns her own bakery
she wants to use a gift catalog for
birthday and holiday gifts for family
she's an extrovert she has severe
arthritis from years of computer
work from managing your own business so
this is an exercise like I said we don't
need to go too deeply into that but we
like to go through this because this
allows people to start thinking about
these are individuals these are human
beings these are not just users with
disabilities and so these are all the
quotes that we've taken after years of
doing usability testing buttons can
sometimes be too close together for me
and I can't click on small targets so
who might that be
Maxine yes Maxine next one I bump up the
font size on my browser to make text
easier to read Sean you guys are very
smart yes Sean and something to keep in
mind too it's not the same thing as
bumping up your browser size right the
text size is different than browser size
and the reason why people like to
increase their font size is because not
everybody is born with the exact kind of
disability they're gonna have for their
entire lives and some of these things
are progressive and it can get worse and
worse and so when people are getting
used to accommodating what their needs
are they're gonna use the least amount
of change possible in order to be able
to meet their needs so usually if they
bump up the font size that's all they
may need and then if they continue to
bump up the font size they don't want to
have the idea if you bump up the browser
size all this horizontal scrolling
because they're already doing this
action maybe with the magnified you know
kind of glass on top so you see captions
as an alternative but for me they're my
primary format so some say I'm Mary how
many say Mary some say Rose how many say
Rose
survey says Rose captions are actually
not usually readable for people who are
blind using a screen reader they would
use captions or the subtitles right that
you see on a video they would use a text
transcript if they
to go through very quickly in a text
format or they would just listen to the
audio of a video they also have
something that would be called an audio
described file that sometimes is an
add-on you'll see that Netflix and other
things and it's this incredibly
masterful art of people being able to
slide in an audio description of what's
happening on the screen that isn't
necessarily available to someone who
can't see it so ROS on the other hand
reads captions for any of the multimedia
content that she would experience I need
to use the keyboard but on serving
webpages I just can't so which one of
these people needs to use a keyboard
yeah Mary and some people will be low
vision user that will combine things
like a screen magnification software
along with the keyboard and they'll go
back and forth and they'll kind of
combine all these different kinds of
experiences but Mary as a screen reader
user has no choice this is the way that
she consumes the web this is the way
that she gets information and because
her screen reader reads from the Dom
it's all very linear the content if
she's gonna go through something she's
thinking about it in that source order
and so how something is displayed
visually really needs to match how
something is handled under the hood as
well because that's what matters for
Mary I'm worried I won't be able to use
the internet to do my job
truth is everybody right this is a very
significant and real concern for people
with disabilities because it's a matter
of livelihood for them it's not
can I just shop online because I want to
even though yes that's actually a huge
significant benefit because there's no
need to then go into a brick-and-mortar
store but it's can I actually pay my
bills online can I pay my rent online
there's some really basic life things
that we do and we start to take for
granted to realize that everyone needs
to have that
access so here's some other things that
you can read through later if you guys
want to you can download the the deck
and just different examples of what
people have told us during usability
testing and it's worth considering tip
to incorporate people with disabilities
into your design process so if you're
looking at it from a UX perspective
oftentimes people ask the question after
they've created a combination a group of
personas and they'll ask who's my
primary user and who's my secondary user
and they'll focus a lot of their designs
on these personas building it against
the primary and secondary user
so within UX there's different kinds of
practices and there's different kinds of
disabilities that can be really well
represented in the design process for
one to start with
information architects and content
strategists we would recommend their
primary user be anyone who's neroli
diverse somebody who might have
cognitive challenges who might be aging
into dementia or even someone who's a
non-native language user also accounts
for that or they might have a low
literacy they might have a learning
disability this is really useful when
you're designing for you're figuring out
what the content strategy is gonna be
with a site map and architecture of the
site is going to be and you can conduct
usability testing with paper prototypes
because these people have great vision
this they don't necessarily have any
visual problems so why not bring them
into that process when you're developing
that for the visual designer we
recommend that the primary user is low
vision user and the secondary user would
be a colorblind user those two things
really help them understand things like
layout color not trying to use color to
convey meaning
if something is a:hover like it's a
focus state you need to make sure that
that thing is understandable without the
need to be able to distinguish between
colors it allows you to think in terms
of contrast so oftentimes people who
have really limited vision have
difficulty when you say have a modal
dialogue and it doesn't really have any
kind of boundaries and so it's difficult
for them to see you can conduct
usability testing with high fidelity
mock-ups with these individuals you
could have a clickable
type and be able to do you know get
great findings from that persona mapping
for the interaction designer and so if
you're doing interaction design you're
really thinking about user behavior and
you're thinking about task flows so
mobility challenged users anybody who
might use a keyboard or people have
limited mobility there are some people
where it's physically painful for them
to do forty tab stops in order to
complete the task so it's great to use
the these people as your primary user
that you're designing for and then of
course blind users because the way that
they perceive and interact with things
is a very different mental model so you
can use have these people participate in
usability studies with HTML prototypes
but you really have to ensure that the
keyboard accessibility is spectacular
otherwise you're kind of wasting both of
your time right tip number three obvious
wins call it what it is how many of you
guys are familiar with the hamburger
menu this is like a this is like a
moment in time Facebook decided this was
an awesome design idea and a pattern
they would put out there and it caught
on and it grew and everybody thought it
was fantastic and then at some point
people decided to put it through
usability testing and they found that
lots of people didn't understand what
these what are these pancakes what are
these lines I don't understand and they
didn't know what the purpose of that
icon was for and it wasn't really
intuitively understandable so they found
their usability testing that the icon
itself tested poorly using the word menu
tested better but what tested best was
using the menu icon and the word menu
together so call it what it is make it
really obvious so that no one's confused
and having to hunt through what
interactions that you want them to do on
your app or your site tip four make it
simple and make it easy if you guys were
in the previous talk they had a great
amount of recommendations for UI
patterns and a lot of those go back to
make it a simple consistent user
experience one of the worst experiences
on the web which is also one of the most
fundamentally necessary experiences on
the web is completing a form and how you
recover from error messaging is really a
huge point especially if you're doing it
for something that you want someone to
purchase how they recover from error
messaging is a really critical moment in
that user interaction so we have an
example here and you can find it at si
TTS errors with skip links and we've run
this through years of usability testing
and there are certain features about
this error handling that really test
well the first one is if you have
multiple errors you put them in a
summary bucket at the top you start it
with a heading you give not only color
to convey that there's an error but you
also use an icon that people can
recognize a small thing that means so
much to people is actually putting the
number of errors so people know is it
worth their time to get in there and fix
all those things having clickable links
within the summary bucket tested really
really well because people can then jump
directly to the error field and they're
able to correct it this is a little bit
of a beta thing sometimes this does
really really well but it's not
necessarily like us try to true
recommendation as the other things but
we have this as well where somebody who
has limited mobility it might be really
painful for them to tab through all the
way down through a really long complex
form and so instead they can select this
and it jumps right to the next field
that's an error at field level and at
page level we recommend especially for
multiple errors on a page you should
have error messaging for both it should
be explicit should be very
straightforward as to what meet what
needs to be fixed about it so as complex
as form error messaging is the simpler
and easier to understand the better tip
5 make it predictable and make it
consistent a really good friend of mine
said it's better if you have a shitty
pattern library than no pattern library
at all and I tend to agree it doesn't
matter
you're at in that journey and process
every time I ask people so do you have a
pattern library like a component library
or a design system there's this look of
shame because you know they're not
working with a PDF style guide anymore
but everything they're doing is usually
a work in progress and so we recommend
just get started it's meant to be a
living thing it's meant to act almost
like a product and start working off of
that and again they talked about last
talk last session about the benefits of
this you're all speaking the same common
language and it's easier for people who
are using your systems to know what to
expect
tip six design and build with
progressive enhancement it's not an
out-of-date thing it's really honestly
the best way if you're gonna build a
progressive web app if you're gonna be
thinking and responsive web if you're
going to be building stuff for the
majority of people you need to be
thinking about it from a progressive
enhancement perspective this is an
autocomplete feature those are typically
pretty difficult to make fully
accessible and we just created the UI
pieces to it for very explicit
recommendations as well as challenges
that people experience and how to
actually code it we have a working
example on our site so excited to share
this with you guys we have a lot of
other examples on our site as well but
this one in particular is something that
we've been working really hard on just
because it sounds like what it's just
this one widget and yet it's difficult
to be able to make these things fully
accessible so if you guys want to send
me an email be happy to share this guide
with you
last tip assume nothing go see or in
agile terms gimbal when we did usability
testing - almost three years ago it was
when responsive web was really becoming
a thing with some of these bigger older
organizations and so we were excited
that they were actually building things
in a responsive way what we didn't
realize and we do this for a living but
it was a new discovery for us we didn't
realize until we did usability testing
we found that there are say three out of
five
screenreader users who may live at home
and don't have any sighted partners and
they are live at home alone and they had
no need for a monitor so they didn't buy
a monitor and so there was no monitor
hooked up to their computer so if you've
ever thought about how that works
windows will have a monitor right it's
still there's something I mean they'll
have a browser if you open a browser but
there's no monitor to display it and
what it does is it puts it in like a 150
by 150 pixel kind of layout if you have
a breakpoint that renders a mobile view
because of the size right
that means someone is using a desktop
with a desktop screen reader and a full
keyboard with your mobile site and that
changes things right because there's not
there's no swipes there's no gestures
that they're doing they're using all
fully with the keyboard this was pretty
groundbreaking for us to realize and
it's a reminder that you can never
really fully anticipate what everyone is
going to be doing with your content and
so it's really useful to go and see and
to do usability testing so that you can
really get that feedback and understand
how your users are using your product
final note to my developer friends like
science web standards exists whether you
believe in them or not
yeah and I'm an American and I know that
we say there's such things as
alternative facts and fake news but this
is the truth this is reality and so
we've done research on the testing that
we've done for several years and we
found that 60 to 70 percent of the
accessibility issues that we find during
tests and audits are actually
attributable back to just best practices
so you already have the power to do good
and to do things well you already know
if you're the best developer or the best
designer that you can be that you're
going to win on some accessibility best
practices because they're built in the
the web was made to be accessible
finally my favorite quote of the of the
month I guess is August delirious he's
the head of design at Pinterest and he
said disability is actually an outcome
of design so it's not the person that's
disabled it's the design patterns that
were put in place that didn't consider
that person and it's worth thinking
about when you look at the things that
you're building that you're either
designing to include or you're designing
to exclude so I leave you with this it
can be tough but you guys can go with
some tried-and-true just best practices
and these tips and you will succeed
you really will and don't think in terms
of binary accessible not accessible but
more inclusive or less inclusive and
hopefully you'll choose more so that's
my talk and I think we have a couple
minutes left for for some discussion if
you guys have any questions or comments
yes yep right
yeah yeah that's great that's fantastic
insight
absolutely I think that's great inside
so we often do think about severe
disability severe disabilities very
plainly obvious disabilities but not
only I thought was really interesting
you're pointing out the things that
change as far as with age people who are
aging into disabilities are in this room
every single one of us because it comes
to a point where when you hit about 70
it's about a 50% coin flip as to whether
or not you're gonna have a severe
disability or not and that's straight
out of World Health Organization and I
think the other great point that you
mentioned too is that people will have a
combination of things happening so I
have rheumatoid arthritis in my back but
you guys don't know that right because
I'm medicated and because we don't go
hangout skiing and you see that I'm just
a total wuss right but there's lots of
different things that may be going on
with somebody at any given time and so
considering all of this and using these
best practices just creates a more
inclusive experience and I think it's
fantastic because you know your users
really well and so you're thinking about
how big their fingers are and maybe
there's a lot of mental fatigue because
it's you know draining for them to have
this kind of career and to your point
there's some literacy issues and maybe
even cognitive difficulties that are not
classic things like Alzheimer's or even
autism or they're not even necessarily
considered in the spectrum so to speak
but they just may have some you know
lower more intellectually challenging
kind of experiences so I think that's
great
yep
yeah it depends yeah
so with screen reader users there's
three popular screen readers that are
the most common and it's typically what
we test with as well so you'll have jaws
and you'll have something called
non-visual desktop access NVDA which is
free jaws is very expensive and it has a
update every single year making you buy
it pretty much in full every year and
then there's another one voiceover which
comes natively with any kind of Mac or
iOS operating system the browsers and
the assistive technology creators tend
to partner up so if you use jaws you are
most likely to use Internet Explorer and
so they they tend to be aware of each
other's updates and assistive technology
vendors will will think about like what
differences there are an edge and jaws
created the Freedom Scientific the
creators of jaws will think about that
when they're rolling out updates NVDA
which is free and heavily heavily driven
by research and development also tends
to be more standards compliant not
surprisingly works best with Firefox
because it - kind of has that you know
personality and then voiceover users
usually will be using Safari and so if
you have a Windows system Internet
Explorer will come you know free with
that and so it's typical that somebody
might if they install jaws they'll be
using that Internet Explorer browser if
somebody needs to install Firefox
because they understand they're using
NVDA then they'll then they'll download
that and use that hi yes
that's a great question how do we find
users for our user research a
combination of ways so we have a
usability panel of about I don't know
it's upwards it's over 500 people now at
this point because it is again it is our
practice and so it's what we do very
often so we we have been sort of
cultivating these you these you know
participants for a while but we always
have to continually grow that that user
base so what we do is we'll have surveys
that we send out on Twitter and if you
have ever wanted to know more than you
ever thought you needed to know about
accessibility you can go onto Twitter
and use a hashtag a11y and you'll see
the whole community and it'll be people
who are advocates people who are
end-users people who work in the
industry and accessibility people who
are curious about specific things and so
we reach out to disability advocacy
groups just personally because we have
good relationships with different groups
the National Federation for the blind
that's usually going to be people that
are blind but they do have users who are
low vision but not many we usually go to
groups like lighthouse for people who
are low vision users the United Cerebral
Palsy foundation for people who have
mobility impairments and we ask them to
to work with this and so if you're new
to usability studies it's imperative
that I impart this one thing pay your
participants it's insulting to ask them
to do this for you for free when it's
really something that you're gaining
from a professional context so if you're
offering $100 $75 and I'm speaking in
u.s. dollar terms gift certificate or
Visa or Amazon gift card you will get
participants and we do all of the
classical things like creating screeners
to make sure that we're recruiting the
right individuals the right combination
of individuals so mostly its Twitter we
work a lot with their own clients
customers and
usability panel and advocacy groups as
well yes we do we work with the
universities it's a different scenario
as far as universities because they have
a commitment to provide individual
accommodation and so it's it's a
different scenario usually as far as I
mean it's great as far as if you were
looking for usability testing
participants but but as far as their
needs it's a different kind of challenge
with universities because they they have
learning plans and things like that for
different individuals and so it's both
needs to be a high level and broad but
also very specific to specific needs any
other questions yes it depends on how it
was done right so that's like the UX
catch-all it depends but field level
error messaging is a huge benefit to
people with disabilities when it's done
properly so there's a lot of
considerations one would be we usually
require or not require recommend that
the error messaging content is actually
within the context of the label or you
can use something that's called
accessible rich Internet application
Aria and you can basically
programmatically associate it with that
field so that tells someone who's using
a screen reader and keep in mind that
aria is really a great bridge technology
for one subset of people with
disabilities people who use screen
readers so it's not the I'll go out and
put Aria on all the things and then
suddenly everything's accessible but it
does have some really great benefits in
associating things that are sort of
inert things and creating those
relationships so that would be one thing
the other is for low vision users you
really want that error messaging to be
really close in proximity to where it is
so if you've zoomed in on the screen
it's not far flung on the other side of
the page right that's two examples
yes yes yes another favorite so there's
like things that are like the Holy Grail
right and like these things that you
love to hate them day pickers are
challenging because they're not like
native elements right you're kind of
making it up anything that's a widget
you want to consider the fact that
you're pretty much forcing people to
adopt a user interaction pattern that
isn't really ubiquitous so how people
code a date picker is not so locked down
tabs used to be that way now they're
pretty standardized sliders used to be
that way and now we've really actually
got like range elements and things like
that that do it for us but a date picker
you almost want to think of it as here's
kind of some best practices you want to
be able to use tab at the higher level
of whatever the widget is and then if
you need to interact with that thing you
would be using the arrow keys and then
you tab to get out of it or enter to
continue on we do have some on our
example site to which metaphor yeah well
we want to make sure that somebody isn't
required to use a date picker and that
there's multiple ways to do the same
thing so having a text input next to the
date picker is really the best I'll you
know the best of both worlds but day
pickers are great they're fine they're
they work well you just have to be
conscious focused management and you
have to think about where you're
actually sending a user and you want to
do some testing on it to make sure and
you want to test not just happy path you
want to be able to go backwards as well
and shift tab and and assume that
somebody's gonna be using it in a lot of
different ways yeah but we have some
examples of that as well on our site we
work with a lot of airline clients so
you can imagine tea pickers or we've
seen so many and seat maps so many but
but yeah I mean those things are usable
you just have to consider the
interaction model of tabbing into the
thing that you want them to work with
and that workflow and then once the
done they tab back out of it otherwise
if you're only using tabs for example it
becomes very complicated yes right so
there's the question is basically how do
you is there a way to automatically
detect people with disabilities using
your app or your site and you can use
that power for good or you could use
that power for evil and the I'll tell
you this is kind of a thing to unpack a
little bit people with disabilities have
a really significant concern about that
in particular because the human side of
that is are you delivering a different
experience to them because of them
having to self-identify without being
asked whether or not they have a
disability so there's a big concern
around privacy and about sort of a
lesser experience and diverting them to
something that's usually an
impossibility to keep it in sync with
the newest and hottest parts of your
application it never works when you have
this separate but equal' concept it's
never equal so that's one of the first
concerns about it from a technical
perspective not everyone uses something
that's programmatically detectable
because somebody who is using something
at the operating system level isn't
going to be detected via the browser
necessarily and some people are using
something that might be for example you
could detect if somebody uses only a
keyboard on your site but you may not
know it might be a developer right
because you guys do that and instead it
could just be somebody who's got a
modified keyboard and they're using a
stylus because they're paralyzed from
the neck down so they have a disability
but all you're able to really detect is
keyboard usage and then finally even
screen readers are kind of variable on a
desktop
Apple is a closed system you aren't able
to to get that kind of thing jaws has an
API that you can ping and be able to
detect if somebody's using jaws but it
only starts getting you these marginal
slices of things and it doesn't really
tell you so if somebody's color blind
you won't be able to detect that and
that's one in 8 min or colorblind and so
that's actually a pretty high statistic
and so you want to think in terms of
contrast and then finally there's a lot
of those cognitive challenges that
you'll never be able to get at so it's
really better to think in terms of
Universal Design and then go with the
statistics from like World Health
Organization and assume that you have
some kind of similar representation of
users unless you have been very specific
like you know you're you're building a
site and it's for a specific type of
user group that isn't probably prone to
have disabilities that's possible or
maybe especially skewed towards people
with disabilities like if you have a
site that you build for older people you
already know you're probably gonna have
a higher percentage so I would love to
keep in touch with you guys and please
feel free to email me I have an
autocomplete guide I have a modal dialog
guide and these are all from a user
interaction design but also front-end
development perspective we're pretty
technology agnostic we love all the
technologies and so if we can be of any
help definitely some mean email so
thanks very much you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
