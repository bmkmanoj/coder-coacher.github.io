consultant at burring of partners and
just to give you a bit of context for
your partners is a managed consultancy
that assists to assist organizations to
implement change across their industry
think of energy retail on that the only
reason I say that is because we're
hiring so please come join me in the
cyber Department so my background is
actually network network architecture
network security I ended up in
cybersecurity and ethical hacking and so
I come to this talk kind of in a
different perspective but I found
actually when you promote diversity not
just gender but also technical
backgrounds culture etc you're gonna
build a more resilient solution anyway
so hopefully he's helpful um yeah so the
problem was basically how to implement
privacy by design while still worth
maintaining you're maintaining your
normal structure of your success and
everything else so last year Scott helm
and I actually presented with BBC and
ITV looking at open source intelligence
so we would get in one scenario we had
up to 300 or actually over 300 targets
and in a back room with our keyboards
lit we pulled the full-on hacker
we built an image of these people's
lives based on information we found
online in one scenario we actually
talked to a woman on how using the
information that she provided publicly
we could potentially abduct her child
and so in that talk and we were looking
at that data the information that people
are providing so my very first talk ever
was on network configuration management
fast forward a couple years from
Australia to London I've spoken on
secure communications briefs response as
the ethical hacking etc and all of those
talks were geared around how to protect
data and then lastly last December so
about a month ago David Prince and I
spoke on offensive security
it was a cyber awareness program that we
implemented that was the theory was or
the hypothesis was which we later able
to validate was if we taught
non-technical users how to hack they
could better prepare protect and
understand why these technical controls
are in place and how to continue cyber
security throughout their entire
lifecycle and basically why I mentioned
all of those things is because to me
cyber security is based around
implementing a holistic approach not
just while we're gonna implement these
technical controls or we're gonna tell
people they can't do that it's actually
to be effective in the long term it's
looking at multiple different scenarios
like technology people processes and so
I've separated that into three domains
and this to me is what cyber security is
it's identifying information it's
protecting that information and then
it's educating and spreading knowledge
on why they're important and how to use
them so I'll invest with stories so I'm
gonna start with the story and then I'm
gonna apply those domains to the story
so when I was building this talk I
actually asked my friends you know what
what do you think of when you think of
privacy and ethics in the workplace and
one of my old instructors instructors
from Red River College that's by Canada
they sent me this article and basically
what it is is a developer a web
developer tells us about his very first
paid project so bill the author web
developer he got a project from a
pharmaceutical company to build a
website and basically what this article
website was going to do was create a way
to market this medication that they had
just launched however in Canada you
can't say this is the medication and
this
what it does you have to kind of find a
roundabout way of saying it so that
people still buy it um and so this
article or this website basically
presented a questionnaire to the user
and they filled in their answers and
then it would recommend a type of
medication however this questionnaire
only ever recommended their medication
bill didn't think much of it stands to
reason a pharmaceutical company is going
to pay for a website they're probably
going to want their medication
despite the only exception is if you've
currently taken that medication or if
you're allergic so he launched the
website and went live it was perfect
everybody loved it the company was
actually so impressed they invited the
entire team to a steak dinner so bill
was getting ready putting a shirt on
whatever and he got a phone call from
one of his colleagues they said have you
seen the news and bill said no because
he's getting ready he hadn't and his
colleagues said I'm actually not going
to attend this dinner and this is the
reason the medication that your website
is marketing has led to somebody taking
their own life what's even worse is that
would not be the only suicide due to
side effects of that medication and
there would actually be legal battles
over it and from the time that this
article was published there was still I
don't was called medications I guess to
this day there were still people that
were affected by it in legal action and
if you think about it was Phil at fault
I mean legally no he created a website
to his clients specifications they were
happy but ethically he never asked what
would be the consequence of creating
this website he never asked what the
side effects would be so if we apply
that to our three domains the first one
being information was there a was there
a weakness in to the recommendation of
that medication was it a
miscommunication somewhere along the
line did the client say I want this to
happen but the end result
isn't actually what they meant because
I'm sure you all know clients sometimes
don't know what they're asking I'm in
and in regards to the sari protection
maybe it was that the product was
supposed to be legitimate I'm supposed
to recommend the right medications but
maybe it was manipulated in some way so
it was they're hard controls in place to
minimize that manipulation and then the
last thing is the education I'm being as
Bill was the sole developer on this
website or at least that's how it comes
across in the article he never knew the
side effects of the medication and he
also didn't know if clients were
supposed to go to it get the
recommendation and then move on he he
wasn't sure that liked it didn't say
speak to your GP you know there are side
effects and these are what they are and
they can be quite serious so it wasn't
fully educated to the people and in fact
if you think about it bill who created
this website found out that his sister
was taking this medication and when he
found that out they discussed it and she
stopped taking it so in last year we
have been going absolutely insane over
four letters gdpr
or the general data protection
regulation whilst you might think well
it's kind of annoying and I don't really
care um it's actually going to infect
your effect your job it's going to
affect the way that you process data
it's going to affect the way that you're
scrutinized in the event of a disaster
and so let's just get an idea of what
GTR is I'm not gonna go specifically
into it I know it's boring sometimes but
let's give an overview so gdpr can be
grouped into or is supported by six
principles the very first one is that
kind of sets the tone for the whole
thing is information that is processed
must be done so lawfully transparently
and fairly I know what does that mean
laughs Lee as you can imagine means
legally but it's more than that it's
think of you can basically you have to
have a business case for why you need
this information
as well as how long you can keep it so
think of vital interest is is it a
medical situation so you need their
medical information to treat them or do
you have a contract between the employer
or the consumer and you like terms and
conditions that say I'm going to process
this information it's going to store
this long and I'm gonna share it with
these people you know you have to have a
legitimate reason and you have to you
know present that to the consumer so the
second one is transparently again if I'm
going to process your information I have
to tell you what information and
processing how I'm going to do it and
then the third one is fairly so not only
have I told you what I'm gonna do and
what information I'm going to take but I
also have to stick to that I have to be
honest and I have to actually process it
in that way I can't reuse it and through
Alico hacking we Zack we've actually
found that a lot of companies like to
collect a lot of data and then store it
off somewhere sometimes forget about it
but in the purpose of reusing it later
for other things in GDP are you can't do
that you have no legal business doing
that and so you actually will face
consequences so I'm gonna point out five
things to me that the GDP are really
will affect how you do your job and know
affects kind of the process so the first
one is when a company's breached today
typically the organization is held
accountable or should be how's it
comfortable unfortunately with GTR or I
guess fortunately the directors will now
be personally rely personally liable so
you can sue a director of an
organization and they can face fines but
they can also go to jail and the second
point and actually just to go on to that
you can use that because when people
bring the road when you bring the risk
closer to home people are more willing
to pay attention and you can get it to
get better budget the second thing is
fines so currently
if you announce that you have a breach I
mean biggest considerations that I found
with organizations doing breach response
and incident response has been well
what's the impact financially but now
not only are you worried about what the
impact financially is what the downtime
is but you can face fines up to two to
four percent of your global turnover as
well as 10 to 20 million euros whichever
is the greater and then the third thing
which really affected how I presented
this to people to organizations is
currently you have to if you have to
notify you only have to do it in certain
places sometimes especially the states
it's really confusing the minute you
cross the line it's completely different
requirements I'm Canadian I want to
clarify but but now you have 72 hours to
not only declare that you've been
breached but have mitigations that you
will put in place for next time to
minimize impact or reduce the likelihood
as well as lessons learned you have to
have a formal process to say this is
what we learned in this incident which
is something that most people forget so
not only do you have to you have to
declare it to the ICO or the legal
regulatory body wherever you are and you
also have to do it in 72 hours
with the expectation that you will
notify them the minute you're aware not
at 72 hours on the dot you hand over a
report
it's the minute you're aware by the way
we've been breached and this is what
we're doing because then it will
actually help reduce those lines the
fourth thing is you have to have a data
what was it data protection officer
in-house and this person doesn't have a
operations role they're simply there to
provide information and guidance
although from a cyber background um I
would almost say they're like an insider
because they don't report to you they
report to the regulatory body so they
can then say well you're not following
my standards or the standards that are
put on you so I'm gonna go tell
essentially I have younger siblings it
happens all the time it's awful
but if you think about it
you can't just fire them either because
they're going to have enhanced and
what's the word enhanced enhanced
employment rights that's the word and so
you have to have them working for you
for a minimum of two years you can't
just say wow you don't really fit with
the organization's so we're gonna shut
you at the door um and the last one and
the one that actually is my most the one
I've tried to get across the most and
the one that I find is really cool is
privacy by design so this is not the
minute your project is done the minute
your product is ready for sale okay
we're gonna retest it now and then we're
gonna find how to issues with it no it's
from the concept of design it's from the
minute you have that idea so when you
design a project that you're gonna put
up on github or you're gonna go do you
have to think of security but also
privacy controls from the start so you
have to implement it in your design you
have to look at as I said earlier
minimal data so only what you have a
business case to take and you have to
think of how long you can store it and
one thing that people often forget which
you've probably come across is when a
person does I think it's called a
personal subject access request or
subject access request and that is I'm
gonna call Scott and I want to know all
of the information because he's a
business he's not a person I'm gonna I
want to know all the information that
you have on me and you have to within 30
days provide that information and that's
not business days that's 30 days in
general so one month a little bit over
February however there have been
situations we had a client there was a
person or a company that they were a
private member's Club which I'm sure you
know what that is and they had a
tene probably my Muscovy know what it is
but they over to a culture of writing
rude comments on the people coming in
they were them write you a what they
thought of you coming in however what
happens when you do a subject access
access request and the new person does
that request and doesn't sanitize the
information I will tell you it leads to
very very poor reputation following and
a lot of legal work so you have to be
mindful of what are you doing how are
you storing it as well as how is this
going to affect in the future because
you'll be an under a lot more scrutiny
and the last one which you can imagine
is you can only share information with
those who require it this is in your
organization but also third parties
looking at something like the session
replay scripts I mean I'm sure you've
read I think it was in November they
were reported quite quite a lot on
organizations a had session replay on
the session replay scripts on their
website in an effort to better
understand how people interact with the
website however it also is found out
that they were giving private
information to third parties and those
third parties would you know you would
sign in to the website on HTTP awesome
however those third parties were using
HTTP to replay and it was giving
information such as your credit card
details your password somebody logging
in to get a new prescription it would
give you the details because those were
displayed it gave you the details of
their medical conditions as well as the
medications they're taking and that is
highly sensitive information but they
didn't really consider that when they
added in that third party and actually
from those articles they stopped using
them some of them stopped using it but
that was something that you have to
consider from the conception of your
idea not just at the end when a security
researcher says by the way you're doing
this and it's wrong so now we're going
to look at
Equifax and I'm sure you've all heard of
it I would hope um he may be in it uh
but basically I'm not gonna go through
this blame game I completely hate when
one person is blamed for this entire
organization a lot of times any time
there's a disaster you know somebody's
fired it's like oh it was actually all
of David's fault it was his fault nobody
else is just his in reality if one
system having one issue irregardless of
how fast you patched it can affect your
entire system you've actually failed in
the design phase you failed all the way
in the beginning before anything was
implemented as a network architects in
my background I designed the network
based on likely scenarios I based it on
the three actors I did sweat mapping I
kind of figured out what the
vulnerabilities in that in there's them
so those trends in that industry I
looked at who may want to attack my
client and I designed a network around
that and I also tested throughout
implementing not just does it work
because typically in development as well
as networking people want it to work you
know they want it to work for their job
but they also need it to work in a
stressful environment when somebody is
doing something it shouldn't be dead
that shouldn't be done um let's look at
I didn't see I'm sorry
identify protect and educate so in
identify from the top down people didn't
understand in Equifax what information
they were taking in they didn't
understand the value of it they didn't
because if they did there would be
greater budget put towards securing it
there'd be greater controls and they
would have done it effectively and
actually caught it probably a little bit
sooner than after I think it was two
months but um the other thing is when it
comes to protect
if you don't do that first step of
identifying your data you're not going
to prioritize it properly because we all
have budgets and we all have to align
with that budget and we cannot in any
way implant these highly secure
technical controls on every freakin
thing in our network it's just not gonna
be effective it's not gonna work you're
going to get reports on the most random
things as well as nobody will pay
attention to them and it's gonna cost so
much that people are just not going to
maintain it so the first step as I said
identify the second step is prioritized
around that so put in controls based on
information that you're containing and
the third one educate so it's no longer
okay or senior level exact to say you
were doing something wrong you failed at
this you did that in reality it should
be us bragging about what we can do so
one of my friends dr. Jessica Barker she
talks about social proof so you want to
say things like instead of this many
people failed with this password you
want to say this many people succeeded
in being secure the reason is because
people look at a negative and say well
everyone else is failing so why don't I
fail it's it's kind of doomed from the
start
so if you say you know this is met this
many people passed and these people
succeeded so I can succeed but it's also
kind of it's I know it doesn't directly
align with but it's similar to when you
go to an organization you go to your
boss and you say oh I failed on this all
this this breach happened or this
happened instead you should say actually
I stopped this many attacks I secured
against these many things and yes one
failed but I'm still freaking awesome
I'm still your superstar don't worry and
we in the or you in the deaf community
need to start you know you you need to
start bragging about yourself start
saying you know we can do this and we
can do that because you're familiar with
automation you're familiar with very
quick up and down cloud instances your
what
familiar with automated testing and
automated builds you you understand that
you understand putting controls so it
chooses the currently best library and
so on you know what that is so why don't
you implement privacy into that but um
but basically you need to lead the way
because you're already good at it you
already know what you're doing so just
add one thing into it because it's not
going to affect how fast you are if you
do it properly if you do it in the
design you're still going to be as
productive you're still going to be as
quick but you also be secure and so when
you're scrutinized in the future you
know you'll be like yeah but I did this
and I did that so you could be the
superhero that they didn't deserve but
they so sorely needed so you can think
instead of when something happens when
when there's a breach
instead of being oh you know I should
have done this and the decision I made
actually led to that breach instead you
can say you know it we were breached
something did fail however this decision
that I made actually minimize the impact
so I secured this with yeah I mean the
standard is this but I did it even
better and so now even though that
clients information has been taken that
information won't be affected because
it'll take them years to understand it
to be able to process it
whereas in that case you actually solved
an issue that you maybe didn't expect
but you still did it and you still
protected also meant you protected your
users so I'm actually going quite
quickly through this so the thing is how
do you actually implement these things
in your workplace and so I narrowed it
down to three there's some more I mean
these are just trying to get you to
start thinking about it but the first
one is risk assessment and privacy is
there
privacy impact assessment this is
identifying the information how is it
going to transform what are we gonna do
with it how long were you going to keep
it what is it
but privacy impact is what's going to
happen when something happens to it
what's going to happen if that becomes
public how is that going to affect our
consumers so I mean I'm not going to
necessarily care what medication
Troy hunt it takes but he might be upset
if everybody asks those just sitting
there friends is it going to affect your
ability to get alone I mean Ashley
Madison is it going to Rack your
relationship is it gonna make you feel
hopeless is it going to ultimately lead
to a couple of people actually
committing suicide I mean how horrendous
is that and how are you going to feel
knowing something you did potentially
could have led to that or something you
did protect it against that which as you
all know your Superstars and you can do
that you need to be the first line of
defense for your users you need to
protect the information but empower the
user to take back control and protect
and try I'm sorry and treat that
information with respect that it
deserves what you think is a quote I had
at the beginning and the next one I'm
looking at like Talk Talk consider talk
talk I'm after the breach he's a big
preacher big incident but then all of
those users received targeted want all
but quite a few of them received spear
phishing emails so targeted phishing
emails but how are they going to be able
to protect themselves against that
because they're not not all of them or
technical and they all of the indicators
to indicate that it was a legitimate
email is in that email because it's
already known so how could you have
separated out the information or
minimize the impact and that's the thing
I had an endpoint but it was so that one
to me kind of looks at the first domain
which is again
you know do the risk assessment from the
beginning do a privacy impact statement
because those two things together are
going to help you when the next step in
how to protect it properly and
effectively the next one is good
security principles in place doesn't
need to stop running it paste it rhymes
so you can remember it better I have to
give credit to David because he made
that up at like 2:00 in the morning but
basically as I said before you're
familiar with automation you know how to
do scanning you know how to do quick
life cycles of machines up and down
great you are familiar with implementing
new technologies however do things in
privacy first look at privacy look at
the risk look at how it's going like in
the beginning when we do the risk
assessment and the proof see impact
assessment you know look at that
when you're considering how you're going
to do this I like to tell people I mean
I speak to young people getting into
industry etc I'm quite a bit and I tie I
try to tell them how to make your
presentation or how do you make your
statements more impactful is bringing
the risk closer to home so think about
for speaking someone else think about
how to impact their life like their
family their friends their children
children are very effective when you
want to get a board to cross um
but use that sparingly um but also think
about it for yourself how would you feel
if your brother sister mom father
grandparent children if they used your
service if they used your product if you
contain if you had their personal
information in bills case in the very
first story I told you his sister was
taking that medication and she stopped
taking it and I mean the title is pretty
good indicator he's ashamed of that code
because of what happened so if he had
thought in the beginning of what
potentially could have happened because
one of his colleagues did say to him you
do realize that this questionnaire is
flawed
and he's like yeah I know that's cool
but if he had really figured out what
that meant you probably would have
reassessed how he was going to deal with
it you have experience as DevOps as
whichever sector you're in you you can
bring that into your client meeting so
if a client says I want XYZ done you can
actually say well that's awesome I mean
I can do it I'm awesome but have you
considered this or what about this and
don't say you're stupid say because
that's not effective I can tell you um
say well you know I've actually dealt
with this before this is a really good
idea and actually this although it's not
necessarily required can actually lead
the way because media portray breaches
all or present breaches all the time and
they actually help to motivate people to
be more secure as somebody that
advertises themself as an ethical hacker
I mean yes a lot of times I do get
things like how do I know if I'm being
stalked how do how do I track my
girlfriend unfortunately getting a lot
uh-huh how do I access this person's
account can you access it for me that's
a notice that um or young people asking
is my personal information public or my
nude photos public however because of
the media it's also led to organizations
saying I want to implement privacy into
my life cycle I want to implement
privacy from the beginning to protect
not only my users not only in eternal
people but also my clients and if if
they already have that motivation then
it's really not as it easy but it will
assess and you saying well what about
this idea because you've seen it before
you know what's gonna fall oh it's gonna
fail so you know use your knowledge and
the last one is oh actually I was gonna
mention one thing about that one you can
use things like frameworks to measure
against such as ISO twenty-seven 101 I
think and so just as an example I'm not
saying y'all have to learn with that but
you
there are things that exist out there
and they are going to be continually
dealt developing as a May because
everybody has to align with GDP dollar
so
align yourself with a standard and try
and work against that one other example
I had was in my last organization we
dealt with a lot of very sensitive data
and had a highly like huge impact if
that ever got out and due to the nature
of the work that I did which was ethical
hacking and open source intelligence and
building a pretty picture of our clients
or the malicious actors after them etc
if that information got out it would be
devastating but if you got into the
wrong hands as well it could be also
toast stating and I don't want to I
wouldn't want to impact people
negatively because my goal my passion is
to educate and protect so what we did is
we actually we created a board of ethics
and when something didn't quite seem
right or didn't line with what we wanted
it's in line with how we wanted to
direct our organization we brought it up
to the board of ethics and whilst you
might think well I mean that's a lot of
work but but it's actually hugely
beneficial because if I raise an issue
and they assess well actually that's
acceptable it's not a big deal I haven't
wasted time because the group's already
warmed the proud of the process has
already been practiced and they know
what to do and sometimes it did lead to
alternative solutions but having a kind
of a independent view makes it more
effective because you're like can you
sanity check this because it to me this
makes a person sense to you it might not
at all it's just it just happens that
way and the last one is educate well
it's important to tell your consumers
legally it's important to tell your
consumers what information you're going
to use it's also important to realize
that top execs sometimes are so far
removed that it's not their fault they
don't understand it's actually they just
they just can't they don't get it and so
it's your job to inform
how many people in the stream outside of
this conference have attended at formal
secure coding practices or
yeah okay okay now look at actually your
extended teams you know you get it okay
I mean you care about security that's
why you're here but look at your other
teams especially people that don't get
it bring the risk to them help them
understand and as well as that will help
you follow the trends in industry it
will help you keep your threat map
up-to-date and you can actually connect
with other people
conferences are a great way training
courses are a great way to see what they
do in their place and maybe you have a
very similar scenario and they've said
they've dealt with before so they can
help you and they can advise you
I mean sometimes don't listen to some
things to say some things apply so as I
said we need to be the first line of
defense for our users our consumers we
need to empower those users to protect
themselves but also treat the
information with the respect that it
deserves we need to say no when
organizations want to put in our terms
and additions the remove the ability for
us to sue after we need to stand up when
our IOT devices have never been tested
for exploitability
and we need to say we need to say
something if we market our products or
our solution as a hundred percent secure
when we know very well that no external
person has ever viewed that product I'm
not saying this is going to solve
everything
however by protecting those who cannot
protect themselves and by bringing the
liability back to the manufacturer we
can actually work towards creating a
more secure and safer world
pretty sure that was quite short but
that's okay now you guys have to ask me
a million questions including that is my
parish any questions so you're asking if
somebody is presenting your research as
their own yeah that one's a hard one
because I mean yes all the information
that belongs to you is is yours however
there are some times where there's
reasons that they can could take they
can keep it such as like back home at my
first position as assistant min was an
accounting firm and legally they have to
retain those files for I think it's
seven years that can be held up in court
so it has to be on a certain format so I
could I mean I'm not needy but I could
ask for it and I could say you have to
delete it and they would be able to
delete the information that they can
delete but not what they legally have to
retain that make sense
I I do have an issue with that I I mean
again I like it it's good it's a
motivation to do it but also I don't
think people should be yeah they should
want to do it you my my goal
yeah they don't that's true because I
remember you pretty sure you've
presented one times or wrote an article
about how you know Dropbox has the
option to use 2fa but only 1% or
something use it thankfully I use their
I checked double-checked but basically
I'm my goal is to motivate people to
care about their own information because
sometimes they don't know they have a
right to privacy sometimes they say on
you know only only a bad person needs
privacy but that's not true and before
one of the versions one of the versions
back on my slides is I present why
that's not true and that's looking at
things like when somebody I'm not going
to name that has X YZ pills in his face
which if you attended his talk you
though but he said that you know
transgenders are too expensive and I'm
like okay you can't do that that's not
that's not ok and I'm not saying they
have to be private it has to be private
information but that's still using
information against you you know it's in
Cairo I believe they yes it was Cairo
they used Grindr the police use blinder
to target men using it if you don't know
Grindr is a dating app for men that are
interested in other men it's not legal
in that country it's not any legal but
they did use it to round up men that are
interested in men gay people or gay men
I guess and they targeted them and then
they arrested them and I'm sorry but I
do not want to be in the power jail in
taxes for men pretended to be a male
looking for another male and came to
that other man's house the fifth man's
house and verbally and physically abused
him and then robbed him and it could
have ended even worse but
even that is terrifying I mean how scary
would it be to then go on their next
date knowing that it could be for a very
burly men that are afraid of their own
sexuality to target you you know like
don't know if I actually answered your
question sometimes I get into rants okay
basically you have to motivate people
outside of being like oh financial also
motivate them saying this is your
information you have a right to it and
this is how you do it bring the risk
closer to them so they understand when I
do personal privacy talks I talk about
children family elderly parents etc
because parents especially parents care
a lot about young people and their their
right to privacy and their right to be
safe but again we are hiring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
