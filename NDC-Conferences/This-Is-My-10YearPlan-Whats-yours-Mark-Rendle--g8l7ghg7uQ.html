you're not allowed to copy it because
it's awesome no so yeah this is it very
simple straightforward nothing kind of
particularly complicated I did a talk at
the south of the day that was just a
fire hose of really complicated script
commands and everything this is designed
for the last slot of the day so you can
just kind of go yeah all right let's do
stupid stuff but basically I've been
doing this now profession not speaking
at conferences but programming for a
living since 1990 which is 27 years
that's actually a lot more than half my
life and when i first started my first
job they sat me down at a thing called a
wise terminal which had a black and
white screen and a keyboard and it was
attached to tendon 286 and there were
eight developers working on the pendant
286 and we used to write C code with SQL
embedded in it and then it would get the
lunch time and we would start the build
and we'd run linked overall our C code
to make sure that it was probably going
to build that's what lint was originally
for not working out with your JavaScript
has got the semicolons in the right
places it was actually if I start to
build is it going to have a big chance
of working and you know then over the i
think in 1995 I started doing windows
and client server and all that sort of
stuff and the internet was just popping
up and we had kind of mosaic and then
the first version of internet explorer
and so fast and far add that and things
just keep accelerating and accelerating
and accelerating if you said to me back
in nineteen ninety but in 25 years I was
going to be able to watch netflix on my
phone on the train I
I said what metrics but but you know I I
now actually things are really
accelerating because now i can download
quite a lot of the stuff off netflix on
to my phone which is got 128 gigabytes
of storage by the way and that tendon
286 that had a three hundred megabyte
hard disk that was that tall there's a
five and a quarter inch disk but it was
in a thing roughly the size of a toaster
and 300 megabytes means life huge we're
never going to fill that up and now I've
got a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes
in my phone and and I filled it up
mainly with video of my kids this is
yeah that's what it's for and so I'm
very kind of intro and the other thing
is I've just started a kind of
consulting business which I have very
very pretentiously called Rendell labs
and the idea is that I do all the kind
of research and play with the new stuff
that's broken and I cut myself on the
sharp edges and then I come and give
your company the benefit of all that
wisdom and by the time it's actually
ready to use I know all about it and
everything else but my wife's coming
going so what's the what's the 10-year
plan and I don't know where we're going
to be in 10 years final I still going to
be able to make a living charging around
the place explaining to people how to
run net coring docker and actually at
the rate that enterprises adopt things
yes I probably will will I be bored out
of my mind yes so what am I going to do
what am I going to do to keep myself
current over the next 10 years and you
look around at the arguments you've got
at the moment on Twitter and message
boards and read it and wherever else
from the things people are going should
we be using angular or react for our
front-end and people angular going
angular's brilliant and you just
declarative and all this sort of stuff
and the react people are going yes but
performance and vanilla JavaScript and
everything else and there's me going
they're not the same thing functional or
oo that just shut up just both you know
both they are both good use them for the
right things there
try and use functional to build a
Windows desktop application because the
things on your windows they're objects
all right just get over it they are web
or apps are we building websites or
should we building apps to put onto
people's devices so that they can access
things just fire an API and so forth and
these all seem really really important
but then if you take a step back and
look at the stuff that's coming out and
the stuff that was released kind of over
the last couple of years you start to
think maybe just maybe none of that
actually matters because we live in
interesting times and I'm not talking
about the fact that the tango man has
just taken over the most powerful
country in the world although that is
interesting a man whose entire knowledge
of the world of technology is the single
word fiber which you know he got from
CSI cyber that that's what he thinks
it's like that's what he thinks the NSA
actually doing but no I so my they
released the Amazon echo I have to be
very careful what i call it because
there's one there they released the
Amazon echo in the UK last year and I
ordered one and then I got home and I
said I've done something naughty and I
was kind of like a border neck I wear
any achievement yes I are canceled mind
then you can be in trouble I'll get away
with this one and so now we've got this
thing in our living room and you can
just say look shut up play a queen
playlist or play some feel good music
and she'll she'll work out what you
wanted Michelle generally do it although
one time we did ask for feel good music
and she decided the best of Radiohead
was what we were after in a card is that
what makes you feel good so there's that
and then vr went mainstream last year as
well and you can buy things up
ironically roughly the size of a toaster
and stick your head in them but if
you've tried oculus or the v's it's
astonishing the the thing is the
graphics still look like it still looks
like a computer game but the
the movement tracking and the latency
it's rock solid and you do you feel like
you're there there's a brilliant clip of
video on the internet of a snooker
player and they put him into a virtual
snooker thing like this and he had the
the Q like this but he was so convinced
that he was there he tried to lean on
the table and just went flat on his face
because there was no table there but
that's how convincing it is and just
when everyone was going all VR VR VR
Microsoft that their windows 10 kind of
event of some description a couple years
ago when oh one more thing and announce
follow lens and then magic leap we're
going all hollow lens but in a pair of
sunglasses and with amazing turns out
they have no product at all but it's you
know this is this is where we're heading
and so if that's the world we live in
where we don't where we interact with
computers because they're making things
float in front of us like Tony Stark's
laboratory and we're talking to them or
gesturing at them then really angular or
react it's no so I'm kind of working on
this basis and this is a very optimistic
talk I am assuming that we're going to
make it through the next 10 years and
that we're not all going to die of a
disease or a I'm kind of hoping for a
zombie apocalypse actually I am I am
fully prepared for the zombie apocalypse
in my will I said I want to be buried in
a crash helmet no just hope for me then
but no so i am quite optimistic and i'm
optimistic about how this technology is
going to progress and how our use of it
is going to progress and everything and
I do think that in 10 years time
hololens will have become something like
a maybe the larger oakley sunglasses
that you were for cycling but you know
something light like that that you can
wear without feeling like a complete
GIMP so these are my predictions and by
predictions I mean stuff I made up the
other night but i think is going to
happen but this is where i think
technology is
focused and the things that are going to
produce most interesting developments
and the stuff that we really need to
stay on top of over the next 10 years
and the really obvious one is AI so
that's been going for a while back in
the 2000s of the noughties or the Nauts
or the or whatever you call them the
blue beat Garry Kasparov chess and at
the time lots of people said well yes
chess is a finite game but a computer
will never be for you Minh player at go
which is a much more complicated game
and then last year alpha mind popped up
and beat the world's best go player for
four games out of five and actually
people were congratulating the human
player that he won the one game that he
did win and he was kind of like and
actually that meant more to me beating
it in one game than winning any of the
championships are pinning before it's
it's insane and we have these things
that wall teller all sorts of
information Alexa what's the weather
going to be like tomorrow she thinks
we're invoking blessings old that we've
moved but yeah that that device their
cost me 50 pounds actually cost me 45
pounds because it was five pounds off in
John Lewis and and it's just it's on
that it's like the computer out of Star
Trek it's like Jarvis the biggest
problem or about kind of some of the
problems I have with it later but that
is you're just thinking I can ask there
anything i can look anything up to the
back end of that and I can get it to
respond to questions and it can start
telling me really useful things and so
you think about what we can do for CEOs
or you know the the map people don't do
real work basically people who just
receive information and then fire people
based upon it
but we went from a situation in the 80s
where there were typing pools full of
secretaries of good type and the
managers were just dictate letters and
then word processing came along and it
became easier to kind of writer think is
the point with typing was if you made a
mistake you had to start again so you
had to be very accurate once word
processors came along you could just
about pick something out at this very
slow speed and then you could send it
off and then now we can do dictation and
you can just dictate the letters and
pretty soon you're just going to be able
to say to your computer can you tell
fashion such or can you ask how many
machines I've got running in the cloud
or can you ask how many threats were
detected on the network today and
actually get these things so they don't
even have to be asked they can just know
the kind of information you're
interested in and pipe up like Jarvis
dozen I meant sir I am detecting an
intrusion at the moment if this thing
did detect an intrusion she would have
to wait until you asked her this what
there's a thing to remind you to take
your keys when you leave the house this
is an app that someone has made for an
elector for her and but to make it work
as you're leaving the house you have to
say have I got my keys which is sort of
missing the point but that's going to
get better and you're going to be able
to get her to just join in and tell you
useful stuff so that's one thing that's
coming along and then also we're getting
more natural user interfaces that is not
a natural user interface that is Windows
10 it's better than windows 8 and 8.1
and actually it's better than windows 7
once you get used to its foibles and so
forth but it's not a natural way you
wouldn't expect when you were talking to
your doctor for after kind of stroke
little squares on these plummy to get
him to tell you whether it was a cold or
flu or the zombie apocalypse and so
we're moving towards this natural user
interface where people can just ask for
the information that
want or it can be presented contextually
as as they interact with the world
around them for a long time people have
said that the best software is the
software that you don't know you're
using the software that can just think
about some of the the fitness bands that
you put on you just stick it on your
wrist and then it sits there and it does
its job all day and when you'll near
your phone it uploads the data to a
health center and then you can get
alerts from that and you don't have to
do anything you just kind of like
wandering around and do anything and you
get an alert from your phone going Bing
and it's your fitness thing telling you
that you should probably get up and move
around a bit because you've been SAT
playing forza horizon for the last four
and a half hours so yeah we're moving
towards computers that just trying to
help off their own back and there's no
hang on that's wrong it's not our it's a
are did anyone go to the Halloween that
I'd like my jokes there are just for me
so did anyone go to the hollow lens talk
or they're doing hollow lens but there's
a thing on the door down there that says
hololens demos or whatever and then you
walk up to the door and it's a stakeout
filming in progress so I'm hoping
tomorrow but yeah you know ugh when did
we last year Pokemon goat came out and
you could walk around anywhere with your
phone out and go or any Pokemon a year
and then it with a and you touch it and
then it switched to this mixed view
where you could see what was there and
then little yellow thing floating in
front of it waiting for you to chat all
that in and it was actually clever
enough to kind of work out where the
ground was and make it look roughly like
the ground type ones were on the ground
and the flying ones were flying and
everything and what I want to know is
why isn't there a doom version where I
can just walk around with a chain gun
going like that on the underground that
would be I'm guessing probably some kind
of guidelines
that that's the sort of thing that the
Republicans would just be all over it's
not guns it's phones that kill people
but yes this is answer at the moment
you're kind of holding your phone up
like that and there's the microsoft
hololens one other thing when they said
hollow lens what are your ideas for apps
for hololens I kind of immediately when
all what you do is you go to google maps
and then i changed it to bing maps so
that they would retweet me and you draw
out a route on your bing maps and then
it uploads it to the hollow lens and you
go out for a run and it puts coins along
the route so as you're running a long
it's going thing Bing Bing Bing and then
in-app purchases so that if you're more
of a sonic the hedgehog fan it'll change
them to rings or if you're a pacman fan
then they'll just be little round dots
and the sound effect will change the
walker walker walker and if you turn
round there'll be four ghosts chasing
you and you and and yes and then they
went as brilliant islands doesn't work
outside but you know this is first
generation technology we are ten years
past the iphoto is the iphones 10th
anniversary last and you think that
first iphone you couldn't write apps for
it it was like 2g it took them two years
to come out with a 3g version so it is
incredibly slow it had like 16 gigabytes
of rat of storage if you got the really
expensive one and you look at what we've
got in our pocket these days there's
more computing power in a single gets a
samsung galaxy than existed in the world
before nineteen eighty it's just in the
same and so you then extrapolate that
the hollow lens functioning now you can
pay two thousand eight hundred pounds
and microsoft will send you one and and
this is the first generation technology
where is that going to be in 10 years it
is going to be would it's going to be
like 20 years before contact lenses and
30 years before you just get your eyes
removed and replaced with better ones
which point we're into black mirror
territory but I'm going to be dead by
then anyway so I don't care but you know
in 10 years time I do think you'll be
able to buy a pair of reasonably
fashionable sunglasses or at least
hipster sunglasses and have the world
around you just being augmented so
that's happening so as the people who
are driving all this revolution and
making all these innovations or at the
very least running along behind them
going don't leave me behind what are we
going to do to make sure are still
skills they reasonably current what sort
of things should we be focusing on
learning so I've got to move my thing
there so I can see what's coming up
so
I broke in it get there we go so yeah
first thing and I think this is probably
the most important is learn about
machine learning so everyone get up off
and go and listen to the dotnet rounds
huh you know you want to be in there
you're just kind of going why did I come
to this no machine learning five years
ago it was really scary it was just
neural nets and to write a neural net
that performed anywhere near decent you
needed to write C code and and it was
all scare memory management and all this
other stuff and you had to understand
the underlying principles of neural nets
and modes and waiting and finances and
whatever else was going on there but in
that intervening five years it suddenly
become incredibly easy there are cloud
services that will do the heavy lifting
for you there are libraries coming out
that are still insanely confusing
actually but they do make applying
machine learning techniques a lot more
straightforward and as the people as the
really really smart bopping guys with
the PhDs and the post doctorate research
and everything else build more and more
of this clever stuff and just bung it
into as your and AWS and Google Cloud
and wherever else and just expose it as
API is that we can use then we have to
start going okay how can we take that
and apply that to our systems so I had
an interview last week with a company
and he was saying would talking about
security and security baselines and so
forth and he said how do you think we
could apply sort of the developments in
in artificial intelligence and machine
learning to security and I thought about
it and one thing I source of was when
people are interacting with a system
people pipe at different speeds they
will type certain characters closer
together there will be less of a pause
you can identify the person who is
typing on a system
just from the way they're typing and so
if somebody's logged in to your virtual
desktop infrastructure or to your
application just by applying a machine
learning technique to watch how they use
the system and then detect if that
suddenly changes and this is one of the
things that machine learning is really
good at is a normally detection you can
just go tell me if something looks wrong
and it will just go all this this guy's
suddenly and so you can go right either
we have a malicious actor who's broken
into our system or he's drunk and either
way we need to do something about that
but there's lots of ways the machine
learning whatever your field is whatever
your vertical market or your area
specialization is it's going to become
something that we're all expected to
understand and to be able to apply when
we're building software to help people
do their jobs or have happier lives or
be more healthy or whatever and it
doesn't have to be scary
you want to get into AI stuff now you
can do it really really easily you can
just go you can google Alexis skills kit
and it will take you to the elixir yeah
go away go away okay and seriously build
it so I wanted to just check before I
came up on stage and when it's
incredibly easy I thought I'm going to
see how easy it is to build a custom
skill as they call them for this thing
and so after my talk this morning I went
and sat in the speaker's lounge and I
spent 30 minutes building my own custom
skill just to see if it is you go to the
browser and you create a skill and then
you follow literally like one page of
instructions and you download a sample
thing from github and you change it to
put your values in there and so forth
and then you upload that an AWS lambda
function which just runs a single note
so you don't need to spin up a server
either sort of stuff you just upload it
and then you link the skill to the
lambda and you can get it to do this
alexa ask happy thoughts to say
something nice alexa tell happy thoughts
to inspire me because that's toffee
alexa ask happy thoughts for some
inspiration so yes I I'm not going to
try and publish it for the general
consumption because I'm very good at
being horrible to people and now she is
too but yeah that took 30 minutes and
I've never done it before and I haven't
done a lot of stuff with AI and the
really impressive thing is certainly
from Amazon's point of view
the easiest way and obviously their
instructions they use an AWS lambda to
hook this up oh no I won't because I'm
on separate screens and everything and
it will just be too confusing but you
can create the skill and you can point
it at any endpoint at all so you can
write something a stick it in as your
functions and write it in c-sharp become
like C sharp and put that in an AWS
lambda but more importantly you can
write a full-blown asp net web api or
whatever web framework application that
you want that processes those requests
that are turned into text for you by
amazon's artificial intelligence and
then you can process it so i can write
just essentially it's just an extra
controller and an extra action on my
pre-existing api's and i will be able to
create a skill that can answer almost
any question in the world as long as
it's a question that i cannot find the
answer to by looking at all the
information that's available on the
entire internet and then turning it into
something that you can use and because
you can do that that means that you can
use stuff that's in a zero like the
microsoft bot framework and the
cognitive services and there's some
bunkers stuff in cognitive services I
went to the talk earlier today about
service and it was very interesting
stuff about server listen as you have
functions on AWS lambda and so forth but
actually the most interesting thing to
me was he's doing the guys doing a kind
of buy bottles of wine website and they
let merchants upload their own pictures
of bottles of wine so that they can
represent them and apparently that they
were having a problem where some of the
pictures weren't of bottles of wine I'm
not sure what they were off but I'm
getting kind of a chatroulette thing was
going on and then there were others
where those it wasn't the same wine that
they said it was asked like a really
really hard problem to solve amazon
provider as
service thing called recognition with a
k in honor of Donald Trump and with with
this API you give it a picture and it
gives you a list back of the things that
are in the picture and it's you know you
should give it a picture of a there was
one of his screenshots was a guy riding
a mountain bike down a hill and it went
rocks rocks mountain bike person helmet
and it was just like and you know eighty
nine point five percent chance that this
is a healthy and so on and so he could
put the pictures that were being
uploaded in and just pass it across to
this API and see if what came back had
the words bottle and wine in it and
apparently this is incredibly reliable
and is very very good at picking out the
pictures that don't do stuff and so
that's great and Amazon are doing that
recognition thing and then he wanted to
be able to make sure that the bottle in
the picture was the same as the wine
that they said they were uploading and
Microsoft in their cognitive services
have an optical character recognition
and this is something that's been around
for as long as I can remember when the
first scanners appeared and they were
like a dpi or something ridiculous and
you'd have to just fix everything
whereas now you can get a letter and
just put it on your scanner and it's
actually got more impressive than that
there is a phone application that you
can point at signs in foreign countries
and it will translate them for you
because AI is now good enough that it
can pick the text out of any image and
so once he's ascertained that he has
been sent a picture of a bottle of wine
he can then take that same picture and
send it into microsoft cognitive
services API and it will send him back
the text and so if this person says it's
a bottle of châteauneuf du Pape it will
say does it have the words
chateauneuf-du-pape on the label because
if it doesn't then it's probably not
that it's probably a bottle of
Morrison's Prosecco and you know this is
in the same for
five years ago if someone had come to me
and said what we want you to validate
all the images that being uploaded to
Arabs like our what they say they are I
would have gone right hire some people
and and apparently get them some serious
counseling because Microsoft are
currently being sued by somebody who is
suffering post-traumatic stress disorder
from all the crap they've had to look at
that's been uploaded to various public
services and that's horrible we can get
machines to do that and we don't go too
far and give them feelings as well then
that's a horrible job that computers can
do for us and those people can go and
and do something more pleasant with
their time so yeah and tensorflow so if
you are cleverer than me then go and
look at tensorflow because that's a sort
of step down from from those two things
closer to the metal it's a framework for
building your own AI stuff and they've
got this custom chips that are designed
to run tensorflow algorithms and apply
beat learning algorithms over massive
massive data sets and and you can get
down and dirty with that you don't need
a master's degree in AI and a working
understanding of assembly language to be
able to do this anymore so I'm mucking
about with the skills care time mucking
about with the bot framework having
spent half an hour doing that my next
plan is to try and build something I've
been trying to convince my children that
in the 1970s there was a cartoon called
captain Spang and the monthly bum please
and so I'm going to write a skill for a
lexer that provides facts about captain
Spang in the monthly bum please and then
I'm going to use that to prove to them
that because who's read the wasp factory
I'm kind of doing that with my kids they
were going to grow up thinking that
because I am evil I'm disappointed that
I didn't have twins because I wanted a
control group
but yes so so that's my immediate that's
the stuff that I'm kind of like if I
don't know what the hell's going on with
all these bots frameworks and cognitive
services like in the end of by the end
of the next two years then I'm going to
be struggling to get people to pay me
what I like them to pay me I'm going to
have to at least have a vague
understanding of what's possible and how
to do it and how much effort it is and
so forth so I'm trying to stay on top of
that and then there's the the you icing
and all these kind of people talking
about people glued to their phones and
glue to their tablets and my kids have
got like iPads and everything but I
think at some point over the next 10
years you can basically just forget
about screams for the vast majority of
human beings so not for us obviously
because we're special no because it's
going to out and I may actually be wrong
and you may just be able to say amazon
echo ask visual studio for a customer
relationship management application and
one will just appear on your desktop and
we'll all just be able to go and play
but for the majority of people who
actually resent having to use their
their screen my in-laws my parents my
aunt is a raging technophobe and I had
to upgrade her they finally stopped
supporting windows XP and so I had to a
grana thought well let's just skip all
the in between the stuff I'm just going
to put on Windows 10 and cheapen using
outlook express and I've had to teach
her how to use outlook 2016 and and pay
for her office 365 subscription but yeah
because she is she doesn't want to
interact with a computer she wants the
things that doing that can bring her but
actually sitting down typing things
using a mouse all that sort of stuff she
can't use the touchpad to save her life
she can use a mouse but she can't use a
touch pad
just like washing me going like this ago
I don't know how you can do that I kind
of like it's because I'm not 73 but yeah
and so if you say to her and then she
came to my house and my shoulder the
Amazon echo and she was like that
brilliant I want to get one of those but
then I when she found out it was always
listening she got scared but people are
going to get used to that but we are
going to move to a situation where
people are interacting with Jarvis
they're interacting with their voice
control devices I can tell this thing
home to tell the Harmony hub to turn on
disney junior and and it will
entertainingly i can also tell it to
turn off the TV from the other room
where the other echo is because they
both can control the same harmony hub
that's lots of fun yeah so you're going
to get people go they're not going to
have to worry about their calendars
because they'll just be able to say what
we're doing today and it will tell them
can already do that they're not going to
have to worry about their emails because
they'll just get told that such-and-such
want something and you won't have to
read through all that awkward hi how are
you long time no see we really should
catch up for a drink sometime anyway can
you supply me a personal reference my
job application because you'll just get
a thing goes off in your ear and we go
in that scrounging bastard once or
another reference for a job application
you're clearly the most important person
he knows that's me being the scrounging
bastard by the way no one has ever asked
me for a personal reference except that
one guy and that was a character witness
in court and and he went down anyway so
that wasn't but ya never turn up to be a
character witness stoned is my major of
advice on that one so there you go to
learn nothing else too though you've
learned that but yeah and and then we
idea that the things the computer can
show you are going to be constrained so
these little rectangles is just going to
become increasingly ridiculous when
computers can just project stuff onto
your walls or make stuff float
in space in front of you and just
generally be all around you and just
ready to help all the time why are you
going to go on there's a part from maybe
playing angry birds but even angry birds
you know i'm looking for a day when
actually the way you interact with angry
birds is the pigs are all over there and
you've got a full-size catapult here and
you're just kind of going like this and
then letting go I'm so building there if
they're not working on Angry Birds VR
then they're idiots they really really
should be so yeah so get about screens
and forgetting about screens means
forgetting about iOS versus Android
versus bring guns mobile and it means
forgetting about web versus apps and it
means forgetting about angular versus
react and you know obviously you gotta
keep your hand in for the next however
long it is until these things disappear
and for some of us you know there's
still going to be a thing but it's it's
going to become increasingly less
important so don't lose sleep over these
arguments about which phone operating
system is going to be the best or which
presentation framework which is the best
way of putting pixels up on a rectangle
because the pixels and the rectangles
are just going to be going soon enough
that's my theory like I say I am just
getting more important though than
though the user interfaces that we're
designing on a rather quaint little
rectangles is we're still going to have
to be building api's api's are going to
be important because without a way for
whatever it is we're interacting with to
get that information then they're just
stupid if if this isn't on Wi-Fi it
can't do a damn thing there's nothing
clever in there at all apart from
something that watches for the word that
wakes her up and then it just records
the sound and sends the sound over the
internet to the cloud and the cloud
process is when you get a response back
and then it's got a speech synthesizer
it's literally two chips
and and a power supply and obviously a
small part of Skynet but Alexa are you
Skynet
Alexa are you skying it that's what she
would say isn't it but yeah everything
is handled by an API and all that cool
kind of machine learning cognitive
services and everything else they are
api's and so regardless of how the
information about stock or stock prices
or how much of this you've got in or how
much of that you spent this much month
or whatever else is going on however
you're presenting that information to
the people who want to consume it at
some point there is an API involved
something is going to have to go and
talk to a computer to get it to present
that information and so we need to be
able to design good ap is that run
really bloody fast that don't crash
because if that is steering somebody's
car then you can't really go are throw
the server crashed and so did you so
yeah this isn't going away so all those
arguments we're having about restful api
is and hypermedia AP is and everything
those are really important you should
totally still keep having those in all
capital letters on Twitter because
Twitter is the perfect medium for
arguing about complex technical concepts
like correct API design don't stop
because then what would I do all day if
I didn't have those tweets to read but
API design is not going anywhere it's
going to get more important and just how
we see realize the information at some
point Jason's going to stop cutting it
or right because the stuff that's going
down is going to be actual speech with
inflections and emotion and trying to
convince people that things were alive
so this this is something we should be
focusing on rather than than the front
end stuff so carry on obsessing about
that
and in a related sort of way and I know
I've just said forget about the screens
but who's building applications for
phones specifically okay who's never
built an application for a phone wow you
should okay two reasons one is really
easy now you can just use visual studio
and because microsoft acquired xamarin
now its built-in you have to pay those
eggs orbit and fees there and if you
don't if you know sir c sharp developer
then just get called over or ionic or
something like that the reason that i
think mobile dev is important and
something that we should be paying
attention to is all these future devices
all these future interactions that
people are going to have they're going
to have them everywhere when microsoft
do reduce the hollow lens to a pair of
really nice sunglasses those are going
to be communicating possibly via elon
musk's gigabit everywhere internet but
more likely over 5 or 6 g which is still
not going to be great and so what mobile
dev teaches you is how to create an
application that needs the internet in
order to be at all useful and can talk
to the internet out and about and over
really crappy connections you know if
you think your website loads fast at the
moment then go into the chrome developer
tools and throttle the network 23 g not
not to sort some one thing do it to 2g
and if you do it to 2g then it just
won't load it will just go now given up
it's quite clearly not there but just
fossil it to 3G and you'd be surprised
how long even what you thought was quite
a fast website can take to download and
so by doing some mobile development now
you can start to understand the
constraints that we're all going to be
operating under in the next 10 years and
also it's fun and it's nice and easy and
you never know you might put something
in the App Store and become a
hundredaire or
something i did a co-op editor that ran
on the first Windows Phone and I want an
enormous cash prize from red gate and
then I was very surprised when Microsoft
sent me a thing saying we owe you five
hundred dollars where should we send it
I was kind of like really people bought
it so yeah parently they did but anyway
yes it's fun xamarin is great Cordova is
okay ionic is brilliant ionic too
especially with with angular and so
forth so have a play with those just so
you can get a feeling for how these
things work and don't say or can't think
of anything to write there's just tons
of stuff you can come up with all the
time any time you're somewhere and you
think oh I wish blur there's probably a
way you could write an app that would
make that wish come through that was so
cheesy mark Alexa ask happy thoughts to
inspire me
you will be very true okay I'm put the
source code for that is you hon see ya
and and go back to basics right so that
I think that's a Raspberry Pi of some
description if it is it's got a
raspberry on it we got I got one of
these for my daughter for Christmas and
she's doing she's scripting minecraft in
Python and she's using sonic PI to make
really quite impressive music actually
I'm kind of going couldn't can I can you
send me the script for that she's going
from you connect my pi to the internet
then online but this is it's a tiny
little thing and she was having so much
fun with it that i subscribed to the
magazine and the magazine comes with a
PI 0 which is literally like that big
and it's designed for you to build your
own tiny little Internet of Things
devices but I don't like the term
internet of things but we are going to
have to cope with it and so you're going
to have to get used to writing code that
runs on very constrained devices with
slow processes small amounts of memory
occasionally connected all that sort of
stuff and so I think we are going to get
back to a point where we're worrying
about kind of managed versus native code
and can we really afford to waste all
those CPU cycles and all that memory on
having a garbage collector or should we
be doing something like reference
counting and so forth so I think that's
going to be a big driver in in the near
future as well building things for the
much smaller devices than we used to and
then there's augmented reality now short
of spending 2,800 pounds on the hollow
lens or something similar there are some
slightly cheaper ones coming out that
they're not going to be as good I i just
find it amazing the number of articles
I'm saying on channel 9 and speakers at
conferences and so forth talking about
how to program hollow lens and I'm kind
of like who who was allowed to buy a
hololens I'm not allowed to buy
not allowed to buy a new laptop let
alone this weird visor thing so working
out how you can skill up and stay
relevant in a world where you're just
making cartoon characters appear in
front of you and bounce around the place
you're kind of going there that that's
tricky I'm not sure how to do that but
think about what augmented reality
actually is this is yeah I got the
slightest wrong way around this is a
vision of augmented reality I think this
comes from a Microsoft slide deck but
this guy's basically got his is hollow
lens thing on there that's not a TV on
the wall that's just pretending to be a
TV because if you've got something here
that can display 4k images that look
completely real then why do you need a
big ugly 80 inch black rectangle in your
house you can just make the TV appear
wherever you want it to be which means I
will finally be able to achieve my dream
of lying on my back in bed and watching
television horizontally and and not
getting a crick in my neck and waking
myself up snoring and he's got a recipes
thing on these cupboards there that's
kind of floating around there and this
is obviously he's planning is holiday or
it's the weather in Miami or within Maui
or something like that and he's got his
vacation to do list on the fridge and so
forth but this is its life if this is
where we're headed and I'm kind of
optimistic but it is then this is a
video game it's a video game with kind
of real interactions and real
information and so forth but the
principles for creating this are going
to be the same as the principles of
level design everything else one of the
first demos that they showed for the
hollow lens everyone was kind of like
going well that's kind of yeah you can
sort of put your your auto cad model of
a motorbike and then put it on the on
the
thing of them Oh minecraft and and you
can walk into a route when the hollow
lens will go flat surface flat surface
flat surface flat surface minecraft and
then and you can even like I'm not
allowed off the stage you can even go
and like put TNT blocks around things
and then do whatever it is you do in
Minecraft that makes a TNT block explode
and blow a hole in the wall and it
actually is worked out where the wall is
and it's matt an exploded image on for
there and so I'm thinking I'm going to
need to understand the principles of 3d
and how to make objects appear as though
they are moving in a 3d environment I've
got some vague notion right now that
moving objects around in
three-dimensional space involves
multiplying vectors together not
entirely clear what vectors are or how
you multiply them but I know it's got
something to do with it you rotate it by
multiplying by minus 1 or plus 2 or
whatever and this this or we're going to
have to note we're clearly going to have
to be able to do this in the same way
that I currently understand Cartesian
coordinates so that I can precisely
position something on a web page that's
a lie have you tried precisely
positioning something on a web page but
you know you can say it back when I had
my TEDx 81 it was print at and then you
could make it appear at a certain column
and row on the screen that's nice and
simple this is much more complicated but
you're going to have to have a vague
understanding so that when your user
reaches out and goes like that you know
how to rotate whatever it is you're
currently showing them so my theory is
learn to build games so i have
downloaded unity 3d I like c-sharp a lot
can you tell unity3d lets me build games
using c sharp and theoretically if i
built something that i actually wanted
to release i could give them a fairly
small amount of money and i could
release it on phone
tablets and everything else but unity3d
already supports both the leading VR
systems oculus and sting VR and it's
supporting hololens in the near future
and so but in the meantime I'm learning
how you put a box on the screen and get
it to rotate and so forth and actually
it's not as complicated as a thought
mainly because there's a really good API
in unity where you just say rotate it
this many degrees but you're still
learning the fundamental principles also
building games is fun and playing games
is fun and when your wife comes in and
says what are you doing I thought you
were working you can go no no I did this
is my game this definitely isn't
dishonored 200 you're getting good yeah
so yeah learn to build games and
immunity or whatever you want to use but
we are going we are gamifying everything
we are trying to create a world where
the experience is like a video game well
that seems to be what we're doing anyway
oh it make me very happy if that's where
we are going so there you go that's that
piece of advice and then by the end of
these 10 years the other reason for
building games and learning to build
games is the in 10 years time there is
going to be mass unemployment because
these artificially intelligent machines
and robots and the fact that augmented
reality visors mean nobody needs
televisions anymore which immediately
does away with anyone who works in
building televisions but also anyone who
works in logistics actually anyone who
works in logistics is pretty much
screwed because we've got self-driving
cars now and self-driving cars you're
kind of like going all that's that's a
bit dodgy ah I still want the steering
wheel there just in case the server
crashes but the thing that the big
companies and Amazon and people like
that are much more excited about his
self building trucks
and something like ten percent of the
workforce are employed in logistics in
some form or another and their jobs are
going to be replaced by robots and
whilst I am sympathetic to their cause
in that it's going to suck because
they're going to be one of the first
casualties before we just get used to
the idea that humans are born to a life
of leisure or watched over by machines
of loving grace at the same time there's
a slight kind of hat because I'm
guessing that we can program the robots
to stay in the bloody crawler Lane
rather than pulling out to overtake each
other because there's a point one mile
an hour difference in speed and when you
finally get to pull alongside this guy
goes or slow down and so but yes there's
a whole load of jobs that are going to
be done by machines are going to be done
by robots or they're just going to
become completely unnecessary to be
honest you're going to get to a point
where you're going well why bother
decorating when I can just make things
appear the way I want them to appear why
bother trying to solve poverty when I
can just get all the poor people on the
street overlaid with characters from
Disney cartoons no hang on that's
slightly sociopathic I shouldn't have
said that out loud but no I I am it's
weird when I was a teenager and in my
twenties I was a socialist because I
didn't have any money and then I got
money so then I became more kind of
fiscally conservative certainly but for
some reason thinking about this stuff
has made me socialist again and but
socialist in a kind of technological
utopia way because if machines are doing
all these things and the one percent or
the naught point one percent or whatever
have laid everybody off and replace them
with these machines then why do we need
money at that point and the one percent
are going to have to go well nobody's
got a job anymore so I can't sell the
stuff I was selling so I guess what do
we do give it away for free or
you know we are icelander experimenting
with a universal income Switzerland are
talking about it and always talking
about it various places are talking
about it and then there's the people who
are currently going on but I have a BMW
and you only have a four okay it's not
enough that I have a BMW you have to
have a worse car otherwise I don't feel
good about myself but we are going to
get to this situation of having a BMW or
a Ford is ridiculous you're just going
to walk outside of your front door and
go I need to go to the station and a car
will just pull up and you'll get in and
it will drive you to the station and
then it will go off and carry somebody
else around the place there won't be any
taxi drive all this sort of stuff and
there is this going to be massive
unemployment because we won't need to
work we won't need to get up and
mindlessly go off and do things for 40
hours a week for other people so what
are we going to do with that time play
games maybe have conversations and talk
to each other and create art and do
things that currently we just think
Irish I've kept trying to write that
book or or I wish I could make that
movie that I wanted to make or all these
sorts of things so when I say mass
unemployment I'm saying it in a really
hopeful and optimistic way in that I'm
hoping that it's probably going to come
around the time that I was going to
retire anyway I find that's the way that
my life is generally panned out you know
when I got to there was clubs that I
couldn't get into until I was 25 years
old and then on my 25th birthday they
changed it to 21 and it was like yeah
okay but some but yeah so learning to do
things that are more fun and more
interesting and more creative and more
artistic isn't going to hurt if at some
point in the future it is possible to
say Alexa visual studio for a CRM
application we're safe for now what's
the half-light so yes anyway that's
that's my 10-year plan hopelessly
optimistic probably it'll be very
interesting to come
mihir 2 NDC London 20-27 and be standing
up here and going well I got that wrong
didn't I yes anyway I for one welcome
our new robot overlords so yeah I hope
that's given you some stuff to think
about and I hope some of you are going
to hang around for the evening we've got
a pub quiz that I'm doing with Dylan BTW
and we're giving away an NDC ticket to
the conference of your choice and stuff
and drinks and music and all sorts of
things are going on thanks very much for
listening to me and please remember to
drop cards in bowls on your way out of
the room thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
