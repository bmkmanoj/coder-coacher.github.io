UX patents for web developers so let me
start by introducing myself I'm Nicole
and I'm a UI UX designer I'm also a
design teacher at lagoon which is a
coding bootcamp that teaches web
development in 9 weeks and I'm Georgia
Brown I'm a full-stack teacher and
consultant so as a designer and a
developer we spend most of our time
looking at some new expert practices and
teaching developers and so today we're
going to share our knowledge on
front-end and UX best practices so the
term user experience has been getting a
lot of attention lately but not a lot of
people know what it actually is and how
important it is for their product so
imagine your app is a glass of water if
your app is glass of water no matter how
simple it is the first time you're your
user uses this app they clueless about
what it is how to use it and that's why
we need to guide them throughout this
app experience and create a memorable
experience and user experience is all
around us and to prove this let's talk
about the Metro the Metro is a
combination of so many user experience
principles combined together to make the
user happy for example it's a
combination of process guidance of
typography choice of colors simplicity
simplicity consistency even contrast and
they do a lot of testing so it's really
similar to the web and the point of the
Metro is to make the user go where they
want to go as soon as possible and this
is why it's similar to the web so user
experience on the web is also a
combination of so many UX principles
combined together to make the user happy
so it's about interaction design content
strategy information architecture and a
lot more of UX principles but why does
user experience sound hard for
developers well the difference between
them is that development is a deep
understanding of the machine so it's
everything related to how things work
how the
functionality is implemented and
developers do what developers do is that
they make sure that everything works the
way it's supposed to be now
the designers the difference here is
that is the deep understanding of the
people and this is the key difference
between coders and designers but a
developer must think about the Machine
first but the people second so we need
to get inside the minds of the people we
build for and with if we do that we can
create more powerful products so the key
here is to become more user centered how
can we become more user centered so
there are lots of things to do you don't
have to be a designer to have a user
centered mind step what you can do is
you can work closely with designers more
and try to join these user usability
sessions create wireframes and
prototypes with them you don't have to
actually design just joins these join
these sessions in order to understand
the users mind and what you also can do
is that learn some best practices and
that's what we're gonna do today so
we're going to show you some best
practices that we believe are the most
important things to consider as a
developer I'm going to show you some
your ex tips and dad is gonna focus on a
technical part of them so let's talk
about the first thing nowadays everyone
wants their thing right now at this
moment everyone is so distracted and
they have so many things to do and they
want everything to load extremely fast
so we need to do what we need to do is
we need to create a reliable web page
load so this is what we need to do one
out of two people expect abate page to
load in less than two seconds and the
reality is that 19 seconds is the
average load time for mobile websites on
3G so that's why this is really really
horrible we need to work on that
especially on mobile so yeah how can we
approach a page load performance I'm
going to talk about a couple of things
and the first one is being code
splitting I
the system one of the most important
things you can do especially right now
in 2017 and instead of going very
technical I'm going to first show you
the motivation and the motivation is if
you go to most websites nowadays if
they're shipping about 800 kilobytes of
JavaScript then you're looking at
approximately 8 seconds of parse time on
mobile so if you want to be fast on
mobile there's no way we can ship big
files big JavaScript files so again
instead of being very very technical
what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna show
a use case for uber uber comm so what do
become did they focus on one of the most
important business metrics they have
which is they want users to request a
ride so the way they did it they have
only three scripts that are deferred so
they don't block page rendering and they
load one after the other and the only
way less than to 100 kilobytes and those
200 kilobytes allow users to request a
ride this is the baseline so they load
the most important scripts for you to
request a ride because this is what 90%
of users go on uber to do
so they've immediately prioritized this
while at the same time they've lazy
loaded all of these bundles they're a
lot but imagine what we typically do we
have one javascript file that contains
all of this but why do you need to ship
add password the JavaScript as part of
your default experience it doesn't make
sense to ship a lot of JavaScript that's
not being used so instead what they do
they prioritize giving you the ability
to book a ride and then in case you need
to go to the settings they lazy load or
they request the settings to GS if you
need to add payment which was somewhere
over here if you need to add payment or
app password you would add payments etc
so you only need the job you only load
the JavaScript that you need and lazy
loading and I mean code splitting is
about also called prioritization so
first of all we talked about the
critical code it depends on your
business and uber scenario critical code
is the code that
to request a ride and then the way I'll
think about it is you have secondary
code or secondary of secondary
importance so this could be for example
the sidebar so I think the sidebar is
something very important because most of
your users will click on the sidebar so
this is something that Omer can improve
because they only lazy load the sidebar
once you click on it but the way I would
do it for example is I would first load
the most important JavaScript to request
a ride and then as soon as I have idle
time our load I will load the secondary
JavaScript which is the one that allows
me to open the sidebar and then third of
all you've got the infrequent actions or
infrequent JavaScript this is for
vehicles SVG add password promo code all
of the things that you may not use
immediately so that was for code
splitting and I'm also going to talk
about interactivity and this is a very
important metric because a lot of times
you see content on the page but you
cannot interact with it let's take a
look at this example it loads very fast
and you see I have those icons here but
I cannot click on them the reason behind
it is because the JavaScript that's
responsible for these has has not been
prioritized so not doing code
prioritization properly here why because
we have again a big JavaScript bundle
that's running towards the end and once
document the document is ready then we
will add the event listener and it
doesn't make sense for the user it makes
sense for us developers but users will
say I have this in front of me why can I
click on it so they will become
frustrated so the way I would approach
this there are many ways this is just
like a typical example you can do in the
head I would start by loading minimal
stars that are very important for the
app shell the options just the technical
term for the content that you're going
to see the first few couple milliseconds
on the page so if you open the Facebook
native app you have the nav bar or the
header and then you may have a sidebar
this is the app shop so I would in line
the most important CSS here and then for
the rest of my CSS I will preload it has
anybody used preload already yeah ok
great so
you preload them as in you send a
request to load these in the background
without blocking rendering it's very
important not to block rendering and so
you just do link rel preload give it the
itch RAF you have to say that this is a
style because you can preload fonts you
can preload other things as well and
once it loads you change the preload to
style sheet this only works on Chrome
right now browser support seems to be
getting better but it needs a bit time
so that's why you can at the same time
inline the load CSS polyfill which is
very tiny so that's what they had and
now in the body what we do I would have
the app shell here
you could also potentially have
server-side rendering it is important
but it's not very very important if
you're shipping a lot of JavaScript this
is a message I want to stress a lot
because even if you're doing server-side
rendering but you're still shipping 700
kilobytes of JavaScript and this is your
bottleneck and then you end up with
having a page that looks nice but it's
not being interactive so I'll say this
is kind of optional you can you can only
do it should only do it if you have an
optimized experience and then I'll be
loading the scripts just like uber did
with defer you could use async if you've
got one script but I'm using deferred
because I've got multiple scripts and I
want to guarantee the execution order so
I want to make sure that the common
JavaScript runs first and then the index
runs second
so you can see there's a theme here
which is very important which is to ship
less and less JavaScript and if you want
to ship less and less JavaScript there's
there's a couple of things you can do
you can take a look at source map
Explorer this tool will help you realize
what kind of JavaScript files or
libraries you're shipping I've used I've
used this and then I realize that I'm
shipping the handlebars loader to the
front end although I only need it for
the back end for example I only needed
to have to be able to require a header
require a footer but I ended up shipping
like 50 kilobytes of unused code this
may also help you realize that you're
shipping the entire lodash library
whereas you only need a couple of
functions I also recommend that you
embrace modern frameworks because you
want to have less and less vendor and
then if you start with a big vendor file
like 200 kilobytes for a framework then
you don't have any Headroom anymore and
most importantly code splitting which we
already called feedback is one of the
most important aspects of user
experience and if you want to know what
feedback is very quickly think about how
your iPhone vibrates when you switch it
to act to silent or when your car signal
sounds when you unlock and lock it and
the other day I was in Germany and I had
this on the traffic signal and I want to
turn it on and I remember that two days
ago when I turned it on
it gave me feedback earlier it gave me
like a smiley or something so I tried to
do it I clicked on it and it didn't do
anything
it didn't tap when I click on it didn't
give any feedback under my finger and it
didn't give any signal it turned out a
German friend told me the other day that
the button is actually just under it so
this is what feedbacks shouldn't be so
if you want to know about feedback the
the steps of feedback the first thing is
a person takes an action and then this
action has one or more effects and the
effects of this action are presented
back to the person that they that made
the first action and this loop is
repeated regularly this is what we call
a feedback loop so there are lots of
ways in context to show feedback
and there's also a lot of aspects of
feedback so one factor of feedback is
speed so the problem here is that
sometimes the longer the wait for
feedback the more frustrated the user is
so here
imagine a button and when you click on a
button if it doesn't get feedback
immediately you feel like it's not
responsive so the solution here would be
to tighten the feedback loop by
presenting effects as soon as possible
and try to make this effect in under 100
milliseconds so to start this feedback
and under 100 milliseconds no matter
what the animation speed is another
aspect is context so context is really
important for feedback so the problem
here would be that sometimes feedback
presented without the context isn't
effective so imagine a loader or a
Windows file copy dialog if you're
waiting for something and that doesn't
give any feedback doesn't show you
what's waiting what what are you waiting
for it's not really effective so the
solution which would be to show how much
is left for the user to get to their
goal how much is left or how much it's
done the third one is motivation so
think about subscribing submitting
sending something when you do that if
the feedback isn't connected to the
users true motivation maybe it doesn't
work so what we can do is we can give
reward or or something to that tells the
user that you reached your goal and this
is the type of feedback as well
so here it's MailChimp gives like hi-5
thanks for submitting your campaign and
one common way to use feedback is
progress indicators so it's a very
common way to give feedback and show the
user that we're doing something and
you're waiting now but if you think
about it it is easy to implement but it
doesn't give any sign of progress the
user is usually uncertain of what kind
of happened how much is left and what's
good what's the next clean is all about
and it's actually perceived to be slower
than the actual time so what we can do
to fix this problem is to use skeleton
screens skeleton screens are now a big
trend that everyone
like big companies are using so this is
what a skeleton screen is licked and
recently starting using it and what what
it does is that it makes people focus on
the content that's going to be next
instead of waiting so it's actually
perceived to be faster than than the
actual time and it tells users what to
expect as type of content next so it's
also perceived to be faster and it's
like a gradual loading of the UI so it's
progress progressive loading now when
you don't have any content to show let's
say you have like you don't have any
files to show in the next screen it's
important to be prepared for this
because there's no guarantee that this
request will be executed successfully
and we need to work on how we can handle
this failure so what we can do is we can
inform the user when there is nothing to
show using something called an empty
state an empty state is a state where we
show the user that this is empty but
what you can do is this or just tell
them in a tag line in a sort of neutral
background that you don't have any
content instead of just showing a white
screen and you can even get the user to
act with a call to action you can either
either use your main action or something
else something that says here's here's
what you can do to fill this page now a
problem in feedback is that sometimes
when you tap on something and especially
on mobile the feedback that it's going
to show is sometimes delayed and this is
a common problem on sidebars on mobile
and one reason for this could be
initiating animation and sending
analytics at the same time which may be
the reason for this lagging so if you
take a look at the code behind this it
could be something as following you find
the burger menu element you're adding
front listener on click and then you
initiate side bar that's open but at the
same time you send an innocent analytics
request but it turns out sometimes it
may be it may think make things slower
because you're sending an xhr request
and at the same time you're using the
main thread to do css3 animations
sometimes it may be store where you have
to test
is not like a guarantee that's gonna be
slower but what can we do in those kind
of scenarios what we're looking for is
we're looking to defer non-essential
work because what is essential what is
not essential opening the sidebar
immediately is essential but sending it
analytics requests is not critical so
how can we do that we can use a new Web
API called request either callback which
accepts a callback function here and
this gives you small chunks of work that
the browser will only run when it knows
that it has some either some idle time
so if the browser isn't doing anything
the background it knows there's there's
idle time it gives you small chunks of
work that typically happen just before
the visual sync so just before the
browser's going to render something on
the screen and you want to make sure you
don't go over-budget a sample example
for this inside the either work function
you get a deadline object and you want
to check if you still have time
remaining and I've I have like a simple
tasks array here so instead of sending
analytics I'll be pushing the analytics
request to a to a tasks array so here if
I still have time remaining and I still
have tasks to process I would do the
idle work here and if I still have an
overflow of tasks so if I still have
tasks but I don't have time remaining
then you would schedule the you schedule
the either callback once again this may
seem a little bit complicated but this
is a scenario that works in a lot of use
cases if you're only doing it for like
one analytics request then you could
probably skip most of it consistency is
also very important to experienceable
we need to always keep the UI's simple
and consistent throughout the app and
the benefits of consistency is that
first having inconsistency will force
the user to think more and to learn a
new language whereas if your app is
consistent your users will learn how to
use it very fast and this will also
eliminates confusion because they'd be
able to understand it very quickly from
the first impression and also if you
have predefined components that are can
Sisseton throughout all the app you will
actually save time and money because
developers will be able to use these as
guidelines for them throughout the app
and consistent consistency can be made
through a lot of things for example
visual consistency can be made from
something called a star guide if you
create a style guide with designers at
the beginning of your project like put
something like the logo the buttons UI
although your eye components you can
think of everything that you are going
to be used all over again in your app if
you do that at the beginning of your
project you will save a lot of time and
you will create a consistent app so it's
like a guideline across the product so
if you want to know more about about
style guides there's sty guy dot IO they
explain definitions of style guide and a
lot of examples their consistency can be
also made through voice and tone so the
language and the tone you use throughout
the app is really important to be to
make it consistent so it influences how
your users perceive your product so if
you want to be funny and friendly and
try to keep this consistent if you want
to be serious and official try to make
that also consistent and another also
way to make a website consistent it to
use family or patterns so try to use
patterns that are as familiar as
possible to the user don't try to create
new components that weren't there before
and usually have to learn it all over
again so to do that you could use
something called patterns comm PT this
one so this is a website where you could
see a lot of mobile design patterns and
you could just get inspiration from that
we always have to consider that the user
might lose connectivity while they're
using your app so that's why we need to
make our app work offline so let's take
a look at this example on whatsapp on
iOS about a month ago when you sending a
text and you go into the metro for exam
and you lose connection you can't really
keep texting anymore
you have to stop because it's offline
where as an Android it worked
normally now the good news is that they
fix this on iOS but before they had a
really horrible experience because you'd
have to stop using this app because it's
offline and this is what we need not to
do so we shouldn't break the users
experience and showing them this offline
state so instead so don't break the user
experience also here's another example
you're scrolling through a website and
you're offline but when you're tap on
something just gives you the offline
dinosaur
so not only if the the phone is
disconnected but also if the internet is
slow this might happen so instead we
need to inform the user when a change of
connectivity occurs so here's the in
this example on Instagram if you're
offline and you tap on the heart it
gives you a message that you're offline
but your likes will be updated when
you're connected so this is a better way
to show the user that they're offline
and you can also give the ability to try
again when you're offline so if you have
an offline state if you have an offline
message you can just try again and go
back to watching cat videos and what you
can do also is to give the ability to
make available offline and this is
especially for data like video if you
have data like video it makes sense to
download something for offline use so
let's see how we can do this so I think
this kind of functionality gives the
user tremendous value when using your
app because they can decide what to keep
offline and they can decide what to not
download offline especially for
commuters for people that travel a lot
they can just use your app make
available offline and then they know
they can reuse it later on and you think
it's kind of complicated to do it but
actually it's not that complicated
because of the cache API has anybody
used the cache API I think there's at
least time who used it but they didn't
know because if you generated the
serviceworker the serviceworker uses the
cache API behind the scenes but the good
news as well is you can
use the cash API from your window from
the main window so let me show you first
of all this is all based on progressive
enhancement so you want to make sure
their support for caches and window
before using this feature if there's no
support you probably want to hide the
button and don't show any of it so let's
assume we have support for it and I also
need you to know about the fetch fetch
API who use the fetch API it's just like
a modern xhr replacement so imagine it
is like jQuery AJAX and you're reading a
certain article slash article slash one
and then if you do that then you get
back the response and what you can do is
you can open a new cache I'm gonna call
it articles cache a best practice would
be to call it a v1 articles cache
because later on you might you may
decide to use v2 or have an upgraded
version and then once you open this
cache this is a little bit similar to
local storage except it's based on
promises and inside of it what you put
is request response pairs so key value
request and response and request in this
scenario is slash articles - 1 and then
the response is the entire response so
you fetch something from the network and
then you put the response there's also a
shortcut for it you can simply do cache
dot open and then inside of it cache
that ad and then the ad will perform a
fetch request inside of it so that's
like that'll make it a couple of lines
shorter so once you've done that once
you you read once you've read the
article and you put it in the cache the
next step is how do you decide to show
if this if you want to show the button
this is available offline or make it
available offline so you have to ask
your cache let's open the same car so
cash to to open articles cache and then
you ask it if it matches articles one if
it matches article one if you get a
response then this is where you can show
that this is already available offline
so you can show button like show me this
article or go to article if not then
this is where you want to show them make
available offline and then inside of it
you would have the code from the
previous slide if you're dealing with
multiple articles on multiple items you
can also do another approach
can get the keys for a particular cash
and then loop over them and then imagine
if you've got 10 articles you could
disable those that are not available
offline and enable those that are
available offline so you can do this
because cash keys here will be an array
and then you could loop over them so
that's for how you can make something
available offline and another important
aspect of making things work offline is
service worker and service worker is
simply a script that runs in the
background and sub completely separately
from from the web page and this allows
you to intercept network requests so
this is what laid foundation for
features such as the ability to make
something work offline receive push
notifications or even do background sync
so why should you do it in short on the
other sorry on the left you can see
something without a Service Worker it
simply fails whereas on the right you
can provide a custom offline experience
so it gives you tremendous power as
developer and another thing you can also
do for online offline is you can tell
the user when he goes online or goes
offline if you take a look at this
example as soon as I go offline the
entire app is doomed so I know I can
still use it but I'm in kind of an
offline mode and again you would think
this is rocket science but actually the
API behind this works on ie 8 I'm
serious it's it's been there for a while
but nobody used it because it doesn't
make sense to use it back then it's
simply a an event listener that you can
add on the window only which is either
you can check for online or you can
check for offline and then you could
call some custom methods and if you
build something that works offline which
could be a progressive web app if you
build something that works offline you
have to manually check because you may
your users may open your app on their
offline so you want to manually check if
the navigator that online is false which
means they open the app and they're
offline and this is a capital L so if
they are offline from the beginning then
you would trigger the offline mode now
what can you do inside the offline mode
function so first of all you can find
the matter theme color which gives the
theme color in the browser
then give it an affine color like for
example gray so this is a nice way if
you had a progress progressive web app
on the home screen to show the user that
now you are offline but this is still
working and then on the body you would
add a class offline and let me show you
how you can make this in a nifty way has
anybody used custom properties and CSS
now it's the time to use them they work
across all browsers even edge which
allows support where it's a couple of
months ago so imagine we've got two CSS
variables or custom properties one of
them being the primary color in the
scenario it's red and the other one is
offline color and what you can do is
once you add the offline class to the
body you can flip those values so the
new primary color will be the value of
the offline and that's the way that's
how you can make how you can dim all the
colors in your app just simply because
the user is now offline so that's a nice
indicator to tell the user that now you
are offline
have you noticed on mobile that the
scrolling always lags it's not really
smooth let's see it in action
Oh in slow motion
so how can we make a smooth scrolling
like that so the problem here was
actually solved by by new Web API not
really a new Web API it was just an
argument which is called passive event
listeners so whenever you're dealing
with touch events you most likely want
to make them passive passive event
listeners you want to pass in the third
argument as passive through the reason
behind it is because this is a touch
event and because the user is able to
cancel it
scrolling will be slow this is kind of
an API bad design so when you have a
touchmove event the browser has to go
through the entire touchmove event
before it can actually start scrolling
why because you can call event prevent
default any time during this touch event
so the browser cannot simply start
scrolling immediately because you may
call later on prevent default so the way
you can solve this you can simply pass
passive through and that's a declarative
way to tell the browser this is a touch
event I'm never gonna call prevent
default so you can immediately a
short-circuit the entire thing and
directly commit this to the GPU so you
can directly start scrolling and even if
you call prevent default is simply gonna
be a no op so I'm gonna have any any
issue it's not gonna have any effect
there's an another thing that's that
makes scrolling much faster on the web
which is intersection observer is
anybody used it intersection observer is
a new web api that allows you to ask the
browser about the visibility of a
certain item compared to another one or
more generally compared to the viewport
so you can know if this element is
visible on the screen or not and you can
know how much of it is visible through
the intersection ratio and you may think
this is not very important but this
makes it possible to do an entire set of
new features you can do lazy loading of
images much more efficiently
you can do infinite Scrolls efficiently
without having to do expensive Dom
operations inside the scroll event and
another use case you can do this kind of
if you have a video that's playing and
then you scroll out and the video
becomes outside of the viewport you can
show a mute button here so it's very
tiny but it has a lot of
for a lot of impact on the user
experience and here's how the code
behind it looks like you create an
observer as a new intersection observer
and then you get back a list of entries
in my scenario because I only have one
video that I'm only interested in the
first entry and then for the mute button
I only want to make it hidden if the
video is paused so I only hide the mute
button if the video is paused or it's or
the video is showing on the screen so
once the video is outside of the screen
the mute button will be invisible and
then finally you want to observe using
this observer the video alone this works
on Chrome I think Oprah and maybe
Firefox doesn't work on all browsers so
you may want to load a polyfill if you
want it to work everywhere we always
assume that all our users can see and
use a keyboard and mouse etc but there
are actually 49 million people that
suffer from disabilities for mobility -
hearing - outside so to find
accessibility it's when a sites content
available and fully functional by anyone
so its refers to the experience of users
who might not be your typical user there
are lots of types of disabilities they
are non-physical or temporary and
sometimes something not being available
in a country is a disability so there
are lots of types for example it could
be a broken arm could be a shaky train
it doesn't have to be a permanent
disability it could also be dyslexia
autism a DD etc and when you see all of
these types of disabilities you realize
that designing products only for people
who have perfect vision perfect hearing
perfect cognition seems incredibly
narrow so I'm gonna give you some
practical aspects for creating
accessible websites so there's something
called web content accessibility
guidelines put together by accessibility
experts and they say that an order for a
website to be accessible it should first
be perceivable so just because you can
see it and doesn't mean that all users
can perceive it it also should be
operable
the user should all be able to use the
components and navigate throughout your
app for example you should know that the
hover effect doesn't work without a
mouse for example and it should be
understandable the user should
understand the interface and see it
consistently without any failure and it
should be robust it should be able work
it should be able to work with any
robust tools and screen readers for
example and if you want to do like a
checklist for your website there's a
cool short high-level summary of what
you need to implement to create an
accessible website in order for all your
users that the in order for all users
can access it so it's web AM dark so
here are some tips but very basic tips
that we already know about but tend to
ignore them for example the focus it's
where a keyboard event go in the page at
any given moment and a well implemented
focused strategy ensures that everyone
using your application will have a
better experience so focused items are
often indicated by a focus ring and this
design depends on the browser so we need
to understand this and we'd to be aware
that some people will use the keyboard
instead of the mouse so elements like
text fields buttons and select lists are
focusable by default but things like the
image or paragraphs that are not not
necessary to be focused because users
cannot interact with them and also the
elements order matters the Dom order
matters because for example let's say
you have three buttons and for some
reason the first button is floated to
the right you need to remember that the
user went tapping tab on the keyboard
they will see this button first and it's
at the end of the line another thing to
consider is also off screen content when
you have content that is not currently
displayed on the page and it's hidden
away it's still gonna show as focus so
if someone is using the tab tab tab
it's gonna disappear from the page and
then go back again so to solve this you
could just display the sidebar for
example if it's not visible on the page
then display it as none there's also
text alternatives we all use them but we
might forget that we're doing this for
disabled people so this alternative
allows us to specify a simple strength
to be used at any time the image is not
available so and also the screen readers
read these text alternatives so we need
to provide a useful text that explains
what's inside the image now for
decorative images for example let's say
we're using this SVG I can search icon
here if the screen reader reads this as
search icon
they will also read search input before
that it's going to be redundant so for
these kinds of decorative images it's
better not to use any alternatives just
keep it as an empty string so if you
want to know more on these best
practices for accessibility the best way
to do it is on google web fundamentals
slash accessibility where you could also
do an accessibility review so we always
think that the desktop is the majority
of our users and that's because we spend
most of our time on desktop and laptop
coding or designing but actually if
we're not making our mobile visitors
happy we're disappointing the majority
of the users that are using our app and
actually mobile users are growing and
growing every year and they exceeded the
number of desktop and laptop users and
surprisingly 7 and 10 users per for
mobile websites over mobile apps across
devices so that's why we have to invest
time to work on web apps and to make
that the experience as native as
possible so if you've been following all
the patterns that we told you about it
may make sense for you to consider a
progressive web app because it simply
gives you gives your users and
experience that's more engaging for them
they can get back to it from the home
screen they can add it to the home
screen first and it just makes more
sense for the user again assuming you've
followed most of the patterns and you
have performance in mind
and with all the patterns that we've
talked about it makes sense to
continuously test on real mobile devices
there is no alternative for this because
we what made what may take fraction of a
second on your macbook pro can take up
to five seconds on a real mobile device
so you really want to test things where
your users gonna use them not where
they're being developed it's like
building a car but that's driving it
only in a racetrack you want to test
drive it on real roads and make sure to
use light house this is an amazing tool
that gives you a lot of insights
regardless if you're building progress
wall up or not this gives you
performance X ability and best practice
metrics you can compare your results you
can see I mean in the best practices I'm
sure we all forget at least fifteen or
twenty eight like there are the link rel
No opener which may give performance and
security issues I never ever heard about
it except when running through light
house
so this is a Chrome extension and as of
the current chrome chrome 60 you can now
have it in dev tools so just right click
inspect elements go to audits and you'll
be able to create an audit it's also
available as a node module so you can do
continuous integration with it you can
get performance regression reports out
of it there's also a nice tool in chrome
dev tools that recently launched called
code coverage which has live code
coverage so if you go to a website and
you start recording you will see in real
time the amount of JavaScript that's
being used and the amount of JavaScript
that's not being used and then same
thing for CSS and this is where you
realize code splitting is very important
because if you go to any website that's
not optimized for mobile for example
just Trello comm you will have a huge
red bar just like maybe this one 90% of
something is not being used because
we're just shipping jQuery for example
or we shipping a library that's only
going to be used on the second page so
this tool will also give you tons of
insights also make sure to use
throttling features and chrome they got
a bit simplified in the latest version
so
all of these are now slow 3G and fast 3G
because sometimes things like a loader
will not show up on Wi-Fi and your users
may be always on the go so you want to
test with at least fast 3G or sometimes
slow 3G and it's also important to
measure things and I'm going to talk
about this from a different perspective
I'm sure we all use Google Analytics
right know so I'm sure most of you use
Google Analytics it's just the script we
add and then we completely forget about
it but we can actually use Google
Analytics for us developers as well to
measure page timings has anybody used
those page timings so you get these by
default and they're nice because you get
average page load time average reaction
etcetera even average server response
time and the nice thing about it is you
can drill down based on browser and even
based on country now for browsers you
may figure out this is this could be
because of a certain polyfill for
countries I don't think you can do much
except for CD ends but there's also
another interesting part in Google
Analytics if you have a custom metric
that you're interested in you can also
push it to Google Analytics and then
have all of the graphs immediately for
it so you don't have to code the graphs
you just send a timing metric in my
example for example on my website I have
a video and I'm interested to know when
the video becomes ready to ready to play
so this is a certain metric you can you
can I mean find and then send to Google
Analytics and then you will have all the
graphs for it automatically
when we code or design our own product
we're often immersed with the code and
we tend to forget that we're doing this
for users we tend to focus on all the
features and technical problems but what
we shuffle what we should focus on is
also how to sell our product so a
persuasion pattern is a way to persuade
the users into taking actions for
example curiosity if we create we create
more when teased with a small bit of
interesting information so reveals just
enough to tease users into taking action
to reveal more and this will keep them
hanging on so here's an example UX pin
plays on curiosity with a dimmed video
of their application in the background
working and when you see it working
you'll be it's like it's like they're
teasing you with a small bit and
interesting information which will make
you click on that but hunger on that
button another persuasion pattern is
also scarcity scarcity is when something
has a limit and if something is being
scarce we perceive it as more desirable
and more valuable and so this will
prevent customers from taking time to
think to do an action and instead
pushing them into making a decision
immediately a great example of this is
Groupon they introduced online coupons
with the strong use of scarcity effects
they use time-based Varsity by letting
these be valid only for a certain amount
of time so this will push users into
taking action another one is social
proof we always consider the actions of
others in new or unfamiliar situations
so if we show proof through static
statistics or facts to get the
first-time visitors to do something to
get started and we always have a common
tendency to adopt the opinions of the
majority when we're not feeling safe so
in example about Trump so an example of
this is when we show users that join 300
thousands users or on Facebook when they
say eight users like this for example so
we use it when we want to ease decisions
for the users and assure them that
they're not
if you want to know more on these types
of persuasion patterns there's a cool
website called UI - patterns calm and
they have lots of these persuasion
patterns so I'm going to end this talk
with something called a dark pattern and
if you want to know about dark patterns
think about this pop-up that comes up in
front of your face while you're reading
an article with a huge button subscribe
and a tiny tiny league that says no
thank you I prefer to stay an uneducated
ignorant so this is a dark pattern and
the goal of the dark pattern is to
increase the company's revenue but it
should it should be completely avoided
so a dark pattern is a trick used in
websites that make you buy or sign up
for things that you didn't mean to and
the difference between this one and the
persuasion pattern is the persuasion
patterns only persuades you into taking
some actions but this one just tricks
you in it and this is the key difference
so here are some examples for example
here it says it's not too late to save
money upgrade with a huge button and
continue without saving money at the
secondary button another one is not
exactly free Wi-Fi if the user is forced
to sign up to marketing info so to use
the free Wi-Fi please subscribe to
receive news you have to check this in
order to use the Internet another one is
nasty little dark pattern on the exit
page select the marketing channels you
don't want because you usually tend to
to uncheck the things you don't want but
here you have to check them you won't
notice this and you'd have to so this is
what how they're tricking you and
another one is also to show you that the
dark patterns are not only on the web
but they're everywhere public parking
four dollars each 10 minutes it's
horrible so if you want to know more on
these types of dark patterns is a great
dark pattern org website and they have
like a wall of shame on all these
patterns that they see and this take
screenshot on Twitter so that's it I
hope you enjoyed this talk and let us
know
if you have any questions make sure to
also follow us on Twitter thank you any
questions we have some time so you're
talking about dark patterns I'm not sure
if this really is classified as that but
what's your opinion on like prefilling
an option for a user so like checking a
box and making them uncheck it instead
is that bad practice so you mean for
example if you have a have a forum and
something is checked by default yeah and
it might be something that I want to
turn off on Adobe does that when you
install reader now yeah it really
depends on how exactly it's very
specific if you have something for
example if you have if you have a
unsubscribe forum for example and let's
say you have the first one is why are
you Sun subscribing and the first one is
I'm unsubscribing because I don't know
the reason that they don't want you to
want to check and they check it for you
or something this would be a dark
pattern but it really depends on the
scenario okay thank you
okay so we're around if someone has any
questions Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
