2 war stories now what we're going to
talk about today is the lessons we've
learned building and teaching angular 2
now what a lot of people come to a war
stories talk what they're looking for is
the things we didn't like about the
framework or the things that we thought
were different but you're not going to
get that from us today because we
actually have loved working with angular
to the idea of today's talk is to tell
you about the lessons we've learned and
to get you to ask to know what the right
questions to ask are and to come down on
the right decisions so I'm Adam
Stephenson I'm a solution architect at
ssw and I've been building angular 2 in
and dotnet core since they're both in
early beta which has been lots and lots
of fun but the favorite part of my job
is that I run fire boot camp and so we
again we've actually just released a
six-week part time online course on
angular 2 and i'm really loving taking
students on the journey and taking them
from older web technologies or from
desktop technologies and get them using
angular 2 in production cool hi everyone
my name is duncan i'm a software
architect at ssw and i'm one of the
mentor mentors at five bootcamp online
and I've been pretty lucky over the last
few years almost solely due angular 1
and 2 got about been involved about 12
apps that are in production over that
time and been really lucky with Seaver
to travel around the country teaching
angular 2 to hundreds of other Ozzie's
all the way back to alpha versions of it
about 10 months ago and more recently
got a chance to go over to utah to go to
ng-conf which is like the biggest
angular conference in America and and
travel around a little bit there with
some of the teachers over there and help
present at some of their workshops so
hopefully we can share some of that you
know knowledge from you know teaching
and shipping angular 2 with you today
excellent so what we're going to talk
about today is we can talk about what is
angular 2 and why should care we're
going to talk about frameworks and talk
about angular and react and how to
upgrade we can talk about get your head
around module loaders and build systems
we can talk about typescript and why
that's awesome and about the right ideas
to be using we can talk about CSS
frameworks and widgets which is actually
surprisingly complex and then we're
going to
all observables are xjs and redux and
this is where the rubber really meets
the road and our goal layers to get you
over the learning hump of getting
through some of the the toughest
concepts that you need to get your head
around in modern web development so why
should you care so before we jump into
angular 2 let's like take a quick walk
down memory lane and have a look at kind
of the history of the web and it all
started in 1995 when Brendan Eich wrote
javascript in two weeks which is kind of
crazy because it's now running the web
and our servers and in 2002 we got xhr
requests from the outlook team at
Microsoft and this was pretty cool
because now we no longer had to do page
refreshes but you could kind of argue
that you know Ajax NHA xhr requests
didn't really get awesome until Google
Maps came out in 2004 and people were
kind of like had their heads blown off
when they saw what you could do on in
the web and then 2006 we saw jQuery come
along it was like the first time we saw
in a Microsoft and Google and Apple all
agree to use the same framework and it
was kind of about the same time we saw
people start lighting and dumpster fire
in our front ends and writing heaps of
spaghetti code as well which was an
interesting time 2008 we got the chrome
browser and the v8 engine things started
getting faster and I'll you know people
were getting more ambitious with what
you could do in the front end we got
node in 2009 we saw JavaScript on the
back end but more importantly the front
end got a package manager the node
package manager which is you know the
predominant thing that a lot of us
across lots of backends are using for
our front-end package manager 2010 we
saw knockout for data binding and now
it's kind of been knocked out and then
we got angular in 2010 as well version 1
so it's now about 6 years old so they've
learned a hell of a lot being the
dominant front-end framework over the
last six years but it's definitely
getting a bit dated and for that reason
in 2013 we saw react kind of come on the
scene you know they were solving some of
the problems with angular 1 when it
started to scale got a bit slower and
has had a fair bit of traction we got
typescript in 2013 and that was only for
the Microsoft guys none of the cool kids
thought it was cool until angular 2
announced that they'll be using it now
they think it's brand new and it's
really cool and then this year we're
seeing angular to come out and we're
so seeing acma script 6 become the de
facto choice for the language and that's
the biggest upgrades of language in six
years so it's huge it's a big change but
what we're not seeing here is all the
other stuff in JavaScript we're not
seeing all the different libraries that
have kind of come up in the last couple
of years you know you've got system jjs
and react ember and aralia and broccoli
and branch and web pack and so many
things that it's coined this term
JavaScript fatigue and people are
getting burnt out trying to keep up with
the pace of all these new libraries so
it's a very interesting space at the
moment there's a lot of churn so angular
is a JavaScript framework right well it
used to be you know it with angular 1
the Google team described angular as the
superheroic JavaScript framework its
goal was to be the best of the best
JavaScript frameworks with angular 2
they've got a lot a lot more of a lofty
goal it's a development platform for
building mobile desktop and web
applications so we're able to so the
goal is that that you'll be able to
build iOS Android OS X Linux and windows
apps as well as well web apps all using
angular 2 but what was the major problem
with angular 1 anyone speed yeah it was
slow if you're trying to build really
big complex app so you're trying to get
your app to run on a mobile device you
could you hit all sorts of performance
issues and that's been a key focus of
the angular team so angular 2 is super
fast it's got optimized code generation
your HTML templates are turned into
highly optimized code we've got
Universal which renders your initial
view on the server side so it's
downloaded just in HTML HTML and CSS
into the browser and you get great SEO
we've got code splitting so you're not
downloading the whole app the first time
you hit the first page you're just
downloading it in chunks as you navigate
throughout your application the reason I
love angular to them that my team's love
it is it's massively productive so the
component model meat makes composing
applications really easy we've got the
templates in plaque this template syntax
which is really simple and powerful
we've got typescript which make gives a
strong type for our JavaScript and the
angular CLI which makes you know does
code Jenna
raishin which is great but what we love
about it is it makes our build process
much much much more simple the big thing
about angular compared to some of the
other frameworks like react is it's
actually a complete framework so it
gives us nearly everything we need right
out of the box rather than having to go
and choose a whole lot of other
libraries and bring them in so includes
routing testing internationalization
animations accessibility and it's a
production build tool with the CLI so
angel is the most popular framework what
we're looking at here is a graph of
google trends on search word key history
for the top angular frameworks so down
the bottom you can see ember aurelien
backbone and they're really you know
they're much less popular than something
like react so you can see that reacts
much more popular and angle is much more
popular again now popular you know why
is it a big wise popularity a big deal
and when you're talking about frameworks
well the more popular frameworks are
going to have more community involvement
there's more blogs there's more
libraries to support them and you know
that they're going to be around longer
because there's a bigger community
behind them so and that's a big deal how
long is your framework in the last so
this is not so much a 101 talk today but
we're going to have a quick look at what
you know makes up angular 1 and then
we're going to jump into a you know the
areas that we found are the most tough
shipping angular 1 and people who have
the most trouble learning so to kind of
have a brief look at what is angular
architecture and in particular its
component architecture just going to run
you through that quickly so it all
starts with a component so a component
is where we put the logic that's going
to drive our HTML views and on top of
these components we put on metadata and
this metadata lets angular know that
this is an angular component but this
metadata also does some other things and
in one of those things is that it glues
together this component with a HTML
template and when you take this
structure here you could all you could
say that it's a module and you're able
to export this module and then import it
into other parts of replication and
reuse it and this is a pretty big deal
because then that's how you can reuse
components across your application so if
you've got properties on your component
in your compare
logic and you want to share them with
your HTML template then you'll be using
property binding and then if you've got
events that are being raised in your
HTML template you want to communicate
those back down into your component then
you've got event binding and then we
might want to insert other components so
we can reuse them so we can do that as
well or other directives and we might
also have some reusable logic that we
want to share across our application so
we put those in services and then we can
use angular's dependency injection
system to inject those services into our
component so this is kind of the core
parts of component architecture we call
this the beauty of angular 2
architecture and we've got some pictures
of this in our books will talk about
later so once you have one component and
then you've got two components three
components for hundreds of components
and it starts to build up you end up
with this component tree and it's an
important thing to understand with
angular 2 it's a big difference so
imagine at the top of this tree we have
an app component and this is where we
put all of our initialization logic for
angular 2 and then underneath this for
example we might have a to-do component
shown here in red and also read in the
browser here and all this component does
is just be the parent for two other
chart the children component that I'll
show you in a second and it just puts
this title on the page so underneath
here it might be the parent for a child
component that we call the to-do list
component shown in green and all that
does is just render out a list of to
do's and then we might have another
component and it just has a simple task
of being an input field and it can
capture another to do and add it into
that list so you end up with all of
these different components you can reuse
everywhere in trees and this becomes
important because it makes communicating
between these reusable components much
easier it allows us to be able to do
much faster change detection with
strategies like on push which we'll talk
about later and also it allows us to do
advanced routing we are able to do
things like code splitting that Steve I
mentioned before so angular 2 itself is
pretty easy I never hear people complain
saying you know data binding or making
components or doing routing or doing
dependency injection and services that
are complicated but angular 2 makes you
confront modern web development it makes
you look it in the face and there's a
bunch of stuff you've got to learn so
some of these things you're going to
have to learn is typescript you're going
to have to learn to do a bit of reactive
programming you're going to have to
understand our xjs and you're gonna have
to have a pretty good understanding of
modules and module loading and module
bundlers
and all of those sorts of things that
come with akma script modules and
angular 2 really embraces modules it's
one of the first frameworks to really
embrace it and we're going to cover a
whole stack of this stuff today so in
summary when we're talking about angular
and why you should care we think this
component models are big deal because of
the whole composability we we think it's
it's going to be very furry very fast
and this whole cross-platform story is a
big deal we think you're going to be
much more productive it's much easier to
learn and it's actually a real joy to
use and we think you're going to write
better applications so we think you're
going to be much more ambitious with
what you're going to try and write with
these modern frameworks excellent so
let's talk about framework choice so
it's a big decision choosing what
framework you're going to use for your
next project on your team the these
frame the decision you make is going to
affect your team and what you're doing
for the next couple of years but it's
even a bigger decision than that when
you're choosing a framework for your
team you're actually making a career
choice and this is what you're going to
be a special this is what you're going
to be a specialist in so you've got to
choose a framework and it's going to end
is get this decision is going to fix you
for a long time so really out there
we've got three choices angular 1 react
and angular 2 now should you use angular
1 on new projects today well we think
you should only use one angular 1 if you
already know it and you've got an urgent
deadline yeah why is that every line of
angular 1 you write today is technical
debt so if you think about it if you
spend the next six months writing
angular 1 code that's six months of
angular 1 code that at some point you've
got to upgrade into modern web
technologies so that's a really big deal
so but what about if you've already got
an angular 1 project well most people
think there's two approaches they can
either rewrite or they can do an upgrade
now you can actually put angular 1 and
angular 2 in the same project using the
update upgrade adapter now while this
sounds like a great idea we don't think
you should do it so it does let you
start writing angular 2 today
but it's a huge refactor you've got to
change your application significantly
and there's a big performance cost
because now you're actually downloading
the angular 1 framework and the angular
2 framework and you've got a big
learning curve what we think is a much
better idea for projects that are doing
an upgrade is to start writing your
angular 1 like its angular 2 so you're
going to introduce a module loader
you're going to start writing typescript
and what a lot of people get wrong is
you don't have to change your whole
project a typescript you can just for
the next javascript file you make you
can just do that in typescript and start
writing type script in your application
and you can start writing angular 1.5
components now the benefit of that is
its low risk your learning angular 2
concepts as you go along and it's a
faster path down the track when you do
rewrite the downside of course is that
you are actually still writing angular 1
now when people do there's a lot of
people out there at the moment going to
their bosses and saying I need approval
to rewrite our application and what
they're talking about doing is doing a
big bang rewrite we're going to take our
current application and we're going to
maintain it but we're actually going to
go and rewrite the same functionality
from file new project in angular 2 and
that sounds fun you know and you end up
with a nice clean project but obviously
there's some Dylan salads it's high-risk
you're maintaining an existing code base
while you're embarking on a 12 or 18
month Pro project to go and rewrite it
again and all you're doing is recreating
the problem the boss doesn't want to
approve it because he knows in four or
five years you're going to come and ask
for another big approval to go and do
exactly the same thing again so what we
think you should be doing is rewriting
your apps into smaller applications so
what we want to do is we want to say
well we've got this new module we were
on we want to write let's extract some
common shared functionality like
authentication and then we'll keep our
existing angular 1 app and we'll just
start writing angular 2 in new smaller
applications and that will stitch
together now so what this does is it
lets you start writing angular 2 today
it's much easier to get approval for it
and you you're not perpetuating the
problem yet there's no more Big Bang
the downside of course is that there's
DevOps overhead okay so that you've got
a little bit more complexity but we
think it's definitely worth it in the
long run and this has actually been a
really interesting experience for me the
last for angular applications i wrote
are all smaller applications that are
all deployed separately or start to look
exactly the same but they come together
to form a bigger application and they
definitely had some DevOps overhead and
they had to write another authentication
service that could use tokens to be able
to manage all that but they're in this
prime position now where they can start
writing a fifth parts of this
application and it's just going to be a
greenfield project and they're going to
do it in angular 2 and they don't have
any rewrite overhead or big banger E or
any upgrade strategies they're just
going to be able to just go off and cut
their teeth doing angular 2 in a green
field which is kind of you know a bit of
a mental shift in the way that we've
done it in the past so if you're kind of
sitting in our King our you know I'm
thinking about what it looks like to
upgrade my project or I'm thinking about
what the migration strategy is you
probably should also throw into that mix
of kind of starting to think you know
maybe I should start also considering
the way we architect our applications is
there a chance here that we can start
thinking of some different strategies so
we're not looking at such a big amount
of energy just so we can start moving
our existing code so in summary writing
angular 1 is creating technical debt and
if you are going to upgrade its three
times the effort to migrate slowly but
as much safer and you should what you
should be doing is consider rewriting
your application into several smaller
applications now we get asked a lot I'm
about to start a new project should i do
angular 2 or should i do react now as
the chief architect of SS w adam kogan
i'll say he'll say we most commonly use
angular 2 today but both are going to
get you there we're not here to start a
fight between angular 2 and react
they're both good frameworks but we're
going to let's have a look at some of
the differences so in reactant uses jsx
so you take your HTML and you actually
embed it into your JavaScript component
some people like it but personally it
doesn't feel right for me
reactors only a library so when you're
building a react project you go out and
you choose a different routing you go
and get it you go and get another
library to do routing you go and get
another library to do animation so
reactors just a library it's not a full
framework react introduce the Redux
pattern which we love and that really
simplifies complex state management so
we love that they've introduced that and
popularized that and it's backed by
Facebook angular 2 on the other hand has
separate HTML components so it has
separate HTML templates and JavaScript
components it's a complete framework so
you get you know nearly everything you
need right out of the box it uses
typescript Thor strongly typing your
JavaScript which makes refactoring easy
and gives you compile time checking it's
got a larger community which we can see
is already getting you know massively
popular and already generating massive
amounts of content and it's backed by
Google and Microsoft so why do we use
angular 2 at SS w well which is angular
because our clients are comfortable with
angular you know we've been building on
angular since it was in beta and we had
government and in really large
enterprises coming to us going we know
it's in beta but we want you to start
these projects for us because they've
used angular for years they're
comfortable with the brand and they
trust that it's the way going forward
you get less churn because javascript is
a full framework it's not a library that
then then you need to go and choose
other libraries on it means that you
what what you're doing in angular today
is going to be very similar to what's
doing in angular next year or the year
after you're not you know your devs
aren't getting JavaScript fatigue from
constantly you know needing to update to
the latest routing the latest latest
routing library for example and it lets
our team's focus on delivering business
value they're not constantly checking
out these latest things what they're
focusing on is actually just using the
tool to actually deliver deliver value
to our customers so this is that one of
the other really common questions we
asked when is it going to be ready well
angular 2 is ready now we're building
really large government projects I
really large enterprise customer
customers clients on it the only thing
we're waiting on is the offline compiler
and the offline compile is a big deal
you know it's a big deal for being able
to bundle your application for
production but even for that we're only
waiting like it's right around the
corner so in summary angular 2 is ready
now both angular 2 and reactor will get
you there but we like angular 2 for our
enterprise apps so let's let's talk a
little bit about modules and build
systems because it's a pretty big part
of angular 2 and it's something that
takes a while to kind of start thinking
down this road so one of the problems we
had with angular 1 is that you know we
had to do this initial download of the
entire application we had to kind of get
the entire thing down for initial load
we couldn't do it in parts and for that
reason we had these time-consuming build
systems we had several hundred lines of
gold to try and crush down the size of
our initial download so we get them
smaller but we still had pretty slow
loads and you know not uncommon for some
of our larger applications take five
seconds on that initial load and this is
where modules and the new xmas crypt six
module syntax and module loaders and
module bundling can really help us
because not only can it help us optimize
bundling down into a smaller package
that can help us make multiple packages
so that we can just ship down what we
need for the home page and then we're
out to another section then we can
download what we need for that other
section so that's called code splitting
and it's a pretty big deal for what's
coming in angular 2 so JavaScript was
pretty simple before but now it's not so
simple a lot of these front-end
frameworks it's not just angular 2 and
you have to have a build system now
pretty much and what if I wanted to do a
hollow world and angular 1 I could do
this I could just have the angular
libraries a single javascript file an
index page and then I was off and I mean
this is not an enterprise application
but that's all I need it if I wanted to
do the simplest thing right now to get
started with angular 2 I would use the
CLI and I'll download this and it's only
three hundred and fifty megabytes and
forty eight thousand files and most of
that you're not going to put in the
browser tin your node modules and see if
I was going to talk about that but you
know it's a it's a different world with
the rune right now and this whole module
loading is kind of a big part of it and
if you haven't you
is you know aralia with your SPM or you
haven't used reacts with the module
banner or you haven't used angular 2 of
the module bunda you probably don't know
that you don't know that module bundling
is a thing and that you don't just put a
script tag on your index page and you're
in for a context shift in the way that
you think and build your applications
it's getting a bit trickier so what are
all these this module stuff we're
talking about what is it so in egmore
script 6 syntax for the module would
look something like this imagine I have
a math file and inside of there I've
just got one function it's called a sum
function it just adds two values
together but it's got this export
statement so I can export this out of
this file and I could import it into
another file using an import statement
like this so I've got to calculate a
file and inside are there i'm using this
special syntax to say import some from
math and then I've got availability of
that it's this is not rocket science but
what you can do with it is pretty cool
because now we are saying I've got these
files and I know everything about my
application I know everything that's
going in I know everything that's going
out with is imports and exports and I
can start to form like a dependency
graph and then we can start to do some
cool stuff so imagine I've got this
javascript file or a typescript file it
could be and i'm importing into that
another type script file and another
types good file and a SAS file and then
one of those other files is importing a
CSS file and so on and so on until your
application looks really big and messy
and then you've got this dependency
graph but you know everything that's
happening it's no longer just a script
tag on your in your main HTML page
you've kind of got this understanding so
you can pass that to a module bundler
like web pack or the system jeaious
builder and it can bundle it for you in
a much smarter way into a small bundle
of assets and you could do just one
bundle for your old application or you
could start to split that into multiple
bundles and then you can this is how you
can achieve code splitting where you
download just what you need for each
section of your app into the browser at
one time but we kind of got a couple of
things that need to come along for
angular for this to happen or kind of
got a couple of challenges in angular 2
at the moment we do what's called
dynamic mode so we're actually compiling
our templates in the browser so who can
help me out here in the audience who you
what do you thinks the downside of
compiling in the browser it's going to
be slow yeah not only do we have to
download this compiler we also have to
wait for it to do its compilation so
this is
this offline compiler that's coming is a
really big deal it's like the last big
thing for them to say you know we're at
version 1 and it's rtm and everybody is
a green light so in angular 1 it
currently runs in the browser we make an
xhr request we get a HTML file and then
we pass that in the browser and we
register at with our JavaScript and we
make some Dom and then we've got
executable angular code so that's what's
currently happening but this is not so
good because we can't run it on the
server and we can't run in a web worker
and a bunch of other stuff so this
offline compile the way it will work we
get that same HTML template but now
we're going to pass it on our server
with node so this is a command-line tool
that you can use kind of like the
typescript compiler if you've used that
you go tsc in the command line you can
use it this one will be NGC and you can
use it so once we've done that we'll
have this ABS Act abstract syntax tree
and we have this executable JavaScript
and it's all been done on the server so
we just have to pass that JavaScript
straight down nothing needs to happen we
don't need to get that compiler down
there as well so at much smaller
downloads much faster execution and then
we've got angular 2 ready to go in the
browser so this is great we've got this
offline compilation but there's a lot
more to it for building your
applications with angular 2 now so we've
also got inlining modules who are tree
shaking what minification and this tree
shaking is a pretty cool idea so
basically it's just removing your dead
code so if you've got a you know if
you're using only half of the angular 2
library and there's things in it you're
not using then you can't reshape those
out and remove that code that you're not
using so you have less the download to
the browser so what Duncan's saying is
that out for a build process it's
getting really complicated so when we
actually a packaging up application we
need to copy fonts we need to compress
images we need to link our typescript we
need to compile our lesson sass into CSS
we need to compile a typescript into
JavaScript we need to minify it bundle
it then we need to run our unit test and
end-to-end tests and now we need to
actually run the offline compiler do
some tree shaking and then build our app
in two separate bundles holy moly it's
getting really complicated and
time-consuming to
roll your own build process I've got a
bunch of war stories about this so when
we started angular 2 we were building
and bundling it like we did angular 1
we're riding 700 line gulp files who's
done a 700 line gulp file yeah it's not
fun so there's there's heaps of things
that we were doing wrong here and we
hear them across all around the place
one of the complicating factors is is as
Duncan showed is that file new project
in angular 2 has 50,000 files in it and
that's because you're downloading all of
your your dependencies Indian node
modules folder and then fried tech on
our test server we're just copying that
node node modules folder across and that
worked fine but then what we shifted to
production we thought is this really
right no so what we did was we created
another file and we included in that
file just the files that needed to be
copied to production when we deployed
the node modules folder and I know
there's some of you out there in the New
Orleans going you idiot why didn't you
just use web pack and we'll come to that
in a bit but there's what we didn't get
was is that we didn't have a basic we
didn't have a good understanding of
modules because you can't just copy
angularjs you know to you to your
production server anymore angularjs is
going to input five modules at each of
those five modules might import another
ten modules so we you can use a gulp
file and use the system jayus builder
but you need to understand module
loading and your build process needs a
module bundler so you can go along and
you can get it working using gulp but
it's a lot of manual work um so a lot of
people were telling us go and check out
webpack that's going to solve your
problem but there's a lot of work
involved in web pack who uses web pack
yeah web packs powerful but you've still
gotta roll your own build process and in
most companies who can I see how many of
those guys are arrogant how many if we
got out there yet quite a few look being
a lot of those a lot of companies
actually say it's so involved we want
you to specialize in it you'll do
web pack guy and you're going to be
responsible for the build now being the
web pack dies and the coolest job in the
world but hey you still heaps cooler
than the Crystal Reports guy and then
the angular so what we're all really
super excited about is the angular CLI
and the angular CLI also has this
ability to bundle our app for production
but so there's been this whole
contention webpack of the angular CLI
what's the go well we've told you don't
use gulp because modern tooling is going
to save you a lot of work and it's not
recommended unless you've already got a
big investment in it word packs powerful
web pack 2 is coming and includes great
things like tree shaking but as complex
and you need to you know you need to
bring in the web pack guy and if you're
already using already using it we think
you should stick with it really the
choice is has been angular CLI or web
pack but the great news is is that the
next version of the AO the angular CLI
is actually going to be using webpack so
you no longer have to make the either/or
decision which we think is great so
let's talk about the angular CLI what is
this thing I'm talking about well you
can use it it's a command-line interface
that you can use to create your
application you can use it for code
generation it'll make route services
pipes and components it's it's made in
conjunction it follows very it's made in
lockstep with the angular style guide
okay so it implements all of the best
practices and it makes scaffolding your
you running your unit tests and
end-to-end tests super easy but the
thing we love it for most is the the
great way that it can build our
application for production so this is
this is what building and bundling an
application using the angular CLI looks
like we can jump out to a terminal and
we can type ng space new space CLI demo
so that's the CLI command to create a
new project and we're going to call it
CLI demo we run that it goes through and
creates the files for our application
then it goes down
does downloading all of the dependencies
from node package manager now I go in
I'm just going to change into that
folder CD space CLI demo and then now to
run that up and actually run that
application I can just go ng space serve
it's going to serve it on port 4200 I
can open that up in my browser and I've
got a running hello world angular 2
application following all of the best
practices pretty cool but now I've
actually going to go to go and write
some code so let's say I want to go and
create it to do component you can see
here I've opened that I've opened the
application up in Visual Studio code now
i can jump out to the command line and i
can just go in g space generate and I
tell it I want to generate a component
and I'm going to call that component to
do so I'm going to do ng space generate
space component space to do now what
that's going to do is that's going to
generate the files that i need to
actually create a to-do component so
it's generated the HTML CSS the
components typescript file and file
feiteng the unit tests so i can actually
go in and have a look at in the source
folder which is where we put our code
you can see that it's put that into our
application for us now if I wanted to
build my application I can just go ng
space build and that's going to build my
app pretty easy hey so we've got guys
who are using this for our enterprise
clients right now so I can have a look
and you can see now I've built it I can
go up and before I was looking at my
code in the source folder I can go in
here and I can see in the disk file der
it's actually taken my type script and
compiled it to JavaScript and it's
generated my map files because the dist
is the folder that I can deploy out to
the server after my different
environments but what I'm really
interested in doing is I want to do all
of those extra bill tasks I need to do
to get my app into production I'm going
to do the minification I want to do all
of those extra tasks and all i need to
do with the CLI to do that is to call mg
space build again and pass at the dash
dash prod parameter
so it goes through it bundles it it
gives me the statistics on how big my
output is and now when I go and I have a
look at my dist folder of what I'm going
to distribute to my servers you can see
that all of the JavaScript files that
say the map files have been removed the
jar the JavaScript files have all been
optimized and minified and now they're
in mange is pretty awesome what's even
cooler is once the offline compiler
drops you won't even see HTML files
underneath the to do folder because even
those HTML files are going to be
compiled into highly optimized
JavaScript and bundled in as well so you
can see the difference between the
production build on the left where it's
all it's all minified and it's all ready
to go straight to a production server
and the one on the right is what we
might deploy out to our test server so
we can get easy debugging so that's a
lot of power from the angular CLI we
love it because it follows the style
guide it updates with angular so as our
angular's updated the CLI updates it
gives us offline compilation really
easily it's a community project but it's
actually being led by the angular team
and it means that our dev spend more
time actually building and less time
configuring and doing plumbing there is
it you know there there's a few catches
it is still invita it doesn't have full
time staff like angular material does
and it dick takes your dick takes your
architecture and naming convention so
it's highly opinionated and I like it
because it's very vote it's very verbose
naming they've got very strong opinions
about you know how you structure your
folders and you have to follow all of
that and there's you know always people
have opinions about these things but you
know we think we think it's amazing and
we think you should definitely be
checking it out so in summary if you've
got an existing build system you should
stick with it use the CLI for your new
projects and watch the seal life a web
pack and the offline compiler so let's
have a quick talk about typescript and
ids because it's good it's another big
part of angular 2 so one of the
challenges of writing really large
JavaScript applications is that the code
has become unmaintained well if you've
got hundreds of thousands of lines of
JavaScript or you're like the azure
portal and you've got millions of lines
then this can become quite difficult to
refactor because you've got no type
checking and then it becomes risky if
you want to have to rename a variable
across maybe a hundred files you don't
really want to be the person who has to
do that because you're not got a perfect
assurance that you're changing a string
and that's actually caught the right
spot so this is where typescripts come
along and helps out a lot and type so
it's going to be the default thing for
angular 2 is the language of choice now
I'm not going to go into type script in
detail here if you haven't seen it
before I highly recommend you check it
out but what I'm saying here is there's
a choice that the angular team are
trying to give you a choice between
typescript but you can also use a couple
of other things you can just use vanilla
JavaScript bs5 the last generation or
the current generation of JavaScript or
you could be using dart but I still to
this day haven't met a single developer
who doesn't work at Google who uses done
so we're not going to talk about that
I'm just going to talk about normal
JavaScript and typescript so the time
skirts is going to give you the strong
typing it gives you amazing amazing
refactoring and amazing tooling but
another big part of it is the choice
behind it is angular 2 is actually being
written in typescript so it's kind of a
you can see there's a lot of greens on
the Left there's not many reds on the
right it's pretty much everybody's using
it I haven't seen a single application
in angular 2 at the moment that's in
kind of development mode or has been
deployed that is used JavaScript yet
I've only seen typescript I haven't seen
anyone pull it off doing the other
supposably it's the aim that you can be
able to do all these things but I
haven't seen it yet all the docs all the
third party libraries everything else is
in typescript so you're going to be
fighting an uphill battle if you want to
go against it and implementing the last
generation of JavaScript if you want to
use es5 might sound kind of cool but
it's not the framework is totally not
designed to use use it like that it's
built with using the next generation of
JavaScript in mind so using decorators
and other language features will be
super verbose why not use it I can't
really come up with too many strong
points there's definitely maybe some
fringe cases maybe you want to you know
you're right on that one to two percent
of you know fringe people who want to
use a different compiler you want to use
language features that are coming out in
like a couple of years time and you want
to use Babel
as you compiler maybe but really going
to be fighting an uphill battle so
there's not much really here to say but
most people at the moment are using
typescript but one of the one of the
actual surprising war stories is
choosing an IDE so there's four main
choices we'll talk through these so one
of them's Visual Studio code which comes
from Microsoft's or one of those big
benefits is that it's got amazing
typescript support straight out of the
box and it's it's kind of halfway
between an editor and an idea it's more
fast and lightweight it's getting a lot
of popularity Adams another one fast
lightweight you can get a plug in to use
the typescript in it it's pretty popular
for angular 2 as well now to my surprise
visual studio is not very popular at all
for angular 2 i've done some development
for angular 2 in it i didn't find it too
bad there's a bunch of extra config you
can do to make the typescript stop
complaining but a lot of people actually
every person I know who does it as a day
job with angular 2 has said that they
don't want to use visual studio for
their angular code and they're using
another editor for their front end in it
and and visual studio proper 2015 for
their back end and you think that would
be a lot of overhead but it's actually
not too bad to do two different ideas so
that's kind of surprising and there's a
team that we're involved with down in
Canberra they're building this really
awesome 34 inch this application
designed for a 34 inch monitor in
angular 2 and they got three front 10
teams they mandated they all use visual
studio as their i Dae being a nice
government project and they just loosen
that up and said they can use other
things but they've been screaming for
ages that they just want to get out of
visual studio I'm surprised it'll come
around but right now it's not so fun so
the other ones webstorm which has these
really cool features like things like
import statements you're always running
import statements with angular 2 you
have to go in put this from this and
input that from that and you end up with
like 10 import statements or even 20 or
more in some things so website has this
ability if you're just saying a variable
and you have an importer that you can
click on it and it'll go and put the
import statement for you it's pretty
crazy and then there's other features so
you can write HTML for your inline
templates inside your type scripts file
which i think is really cool i wish i
had it in Visual Studio code so there's
some really cool stuff in webstorm that
you don't get in the others but i don't
really like the big bloated ideas so I
don't like the ones on the right I tend
to like Visual Studio code and just
maybe I'm a tiny bit slower writing
imports
but there's a lot of personal preference
here but watch out if you're using
visual studio at the moment so in
summary for typescript and ideas it's
not a big story here I think at the
moment you want to be using typescript
and keep your idea that's using for your
back-end but make sure you're using one
that's got great support for typescript
on the front end and works well with
angular 2 and doesn't give you too many
red squigglies and lots of config so
another surprising thing is CSS
frameworks and widgets is a real pain in
the butt right now you know if you want
to build a really good you I you know
you have a pretty strong dependency on a
component library either a third party
one or one you roll your own but I don't
really ever want to roll my own because
I want to write value for my customers
so having having a good component
library something where I used to none
of us right now would probably have any
trouble getting a good date picker but
if you've got an angular 2 project you
might actually realize that it is a bit
of a trouble finding a good date picker
that styles really easy because it's
early days for a lot of the components
and the other thing is six months down
the road of writing an angular 2 project
it's not going to be easy to strip out
your component library and stick in
another one so it's a bit of it's only a
temporary thing for a lot of people
right now with angular 2 but it's a bit
of a challenge and it comes up almost
every single person I talk to who's
doing angular 2 at the moment so you
don't want to have to pull out your
library in six months or 12 months of
development into an angular 2 project
and put in another UI library so you
kind of got two big choices or two big
paths that you can walk down one is
material too so this is an built by the
angular team it's material design
specifications and it's all about
getting really good components it's not
just the look and feel it's about having
material components built for angular 2
and then the other choice is bootstrap
it's being you know the dominant way of
doing and styling your website since
2011 I'm sure a lot of you have used it
and seen it and we're really used to it
and it's pretty awesome so these are
your two parts but they don't work too
well together so there's lots of
libraries coming out at the moment
there's prime energy there's wijmo
there's kendo UI which will be ready
September ish we've used a lot of that
with angular 1 the semantics you I
there's angular material that i just
mentioned there's materialized
conversions into angular 2 there's vaden
components who do polymer components
that you can use in any or two
there's ng to bootstrap there's ng
bootstraps there's fuel UI and there's
ng lightning so what I'm trying to paint
the picture here at the moment is this
heaps of people pouring truck tons of
investment into this because they all
got benefits from angular 1 and all of
these libraries will be amazing or a
then you're too but right now it sucks
because none of them are finished and
you're going to put kind of build
yourself into a dependency on some of
these so we're kind of looking is
there's these two directions so why
would you want to go down the material
two paths the material to path is we
think is going to be the default you
know material one at the moment is super
popular for angular 1 and we we think
it's going to become the default for
angular 2 there's full time angular team
members who are working on this project
it's not a community project even it is
community contribution so it's heaps of
energy behind it it keeps pace with
angular 2 so this offline compiler
they've already got commits they're
ready for it they're going to be one of
the first people that will integrate
with it and there's first class
integration with angular it's built for
angular 2 not regular one not for any
other library just regular too but it's
definitely a fork in the road you can go
left or you can go right with this
decision with bootstrap or material too
because as soon as you put bootstrap CSS
on your page it conflicts and it won't
work I've watched some of our students
we've got them doing a task to build out
of material to application and then they
kind of extend it they bring in
bootstrap and the whole thing blows up
and they thought it was their Co but
it's just the CSS they don't play well
together did it in material one it
probably won't in material to either in
the end so I'm talking about the
components here not just making it look
like material and it's far from complete
it's in alpha so there's no drop down
even there's no date picker I always
pick on date pickers it's the first
thing I look for so it's really early
days if you go down the bootstrap path
it's really well it's proven you know
that you already saw there's lots of
people are going to be supporting that
the styling it's going to be easier
there's going to be lots of third-party
component libraries for it and and
there's also going to be non angular
libraries if that makes sense so we
currently have a project we're building
in angular 2 and the clients really used
to get in kendo grids we might not be
happy making them but they really want
them so they've got these kendo grids
and we want to be able to do that but
there's no angular 2 components for it's
an angular 2 project so we're just using
their JavaScript version they're like
they're raw bindings with JavaScript
rather than
having angular directives for it just
yet and that's working fine but it's not
as nice as having you know something
that's built to work with angular's
binding syntax and it doesn't work with
material so you're not going to be able
to you know go turn around and start
implementing material two components and
you're probably going to have a
dependency on one of these two or both
of them jquery and bootstrap CSS and you
also got to watch out a little bit this
offline compiler when it ships in the
next couple of weeks is going to change
your build chain and if you want to be
able to use it not all of these
third-party component libraries are
going to be up to speed just yet so
there might be a small lag before
they're ready for you to use the offline
compiler as well so it might hold you
back for a minute so in summary for CSS
frameworks will whip we're going to go
on on the left side here we're going to
say that we we're going to start using
material too and we're going to pay a
heavy cost for it because there's a
whole bunch of components of missing so
we're going to go and find those other
components and we'll probably need to go
to a couple of spots and style them up
so they work in here and we're going to
pull them out as material to puts them
in so this is a more ambitious way of
going we're going to pay the cost up
front so we don't have to pay the cost
later but it's not a black-and-white
decision and going down the bootstrap
path and using another vendor is a
totally suitable way of going as well
but this is what we're going to do on
the next projects this is the part that
hurts people who's doing observables are
in our xjs in their angular 2
applications who had some pain yeah this
is this is the area we're taking you
know bringing teams on to angular 2 and
teaching students that they really
really struggle but won't reduce feels a
bit like this you know and why is that
like why why is it such a big deal will
model web apps are composed of
asynchronous of events and async code
can be hard to write hard to refactor
and hard to read them too hard to debug
we deal with race conditions exception
handling is hard you know there's all
sorts of things that go wrong when we're
riding async code but reactive pro the
whole goal of reactive programming is to
simplify async code
and our xjs is the javascript
implementation of reactive programming
now our extraneous is baked into angular
2 if you're going to do angular 2 you
need to know our xjs it's used when it
when you're doing forms it's used when
you're making HTTP requests and a lot of
people don't spend enough time getting
their head around it and they find that
it comes back and it causes them a lot
of pain so my goal here is just to get
you over the learning hump now according
to the definition reactive programming
is about applying the observer pattern
to streams so that's a lot of China and
that's I'm going to start off with I'm
going to explain the observer pattern
pattern and we're going to talk about
streams so the observer pattern says
this let's create an observable and we
might make this a particular observable
of type person and what we want to do is
instead of polling that person for
changes we want to be notified when
particular things on that observable
change so what we do is we go and create
an observer okay and we say this
observer is going to watch the name
property on this observable and whenever
that name property changes and events
going to be admitted that tells us how
the name changed and now it says John
Smith now what one thing a lot of people
miss is you can actually have more than
one observer so I could create an
observer for mood for John and I could
create an observer on the shirt color
for this observable another thing that
people miss is that if you don't have an
observer for a particular property it's
not being observed so we don't have an
observer around John's wait for example
so he could go and lose a whole heap of
weight and no one would notice poor John
now let's say I took my observable and
let's say that I had an array now what
we can do in observers is we can
actually apply different functions so
let's say my observable was an array I
can go and apply count function and the
value that's going to be emitted is the
value for on the array that I have of 14
7 and 9 I could apply a filter and say
just give me the values that are greater
than 5 so I'm getting seven and nine and
I can also change these operations
together so I can chain aware operation
with a cow
operation which because there's more
than there's two values greater than
five that's what would be emitted now
what happens when my observable changes
is that then that observer will emit a
new value cool so we've talked about the
observable we've talked about
observables let's talk about streams
imagine that I had my array but instead
of actually having an array imagine I
was just drip fed my array imagine that
I was given each of those numbers in my
array is someone clicked a key press on
a calculator you I so instead of having
that array up front imagine that I get
the number one and then my operations
applied and then I get the number for
doesn't meet my filter so nothing
happens when i get the number seven i'm
in my stream of numbers that are being
emitted that are being emitted i'm
applying my operation and what i'm
getting out is a new immutable stream so
I've got one stream of values coming in
i'm applying an operation and then I've
got another stream of numbers coming out
now the cool thing so that can continue
on but the cool thing about streams is I
can chain them together so I can have
these values coming in I can be applying
one operation then I can go and apply
another operation and I've got another
stream of numbers coming out so that a
canonical example of this is the type
ahead and this is a great example of
where our xjs makes the code much
simpler to work with so what I've got
here is I've got the search text field
and we want to use we've got we've got a
search text field that we want to use as
a type ahead now we can get the value
changes observable from the text field
now we can use the debounce operator to
only emit a new value after 500 seconds
of inactivity then what we can do is
call distinct until changed to only emit
the next field value if the value did
actually change then we can use switch
map to map the text field values into a
new observable of HTTP search requests
and the cool thing about switch map is
it only emits values from
most recently projected observable so
this code would have been much harder to
write without RX jayus pretty cool
awesome miles on after this talk and
he's actually doing more on our xjs so
in summary modern web development is
asynchronous our X Jess takes some
effort to fully understand but it
simplifies writing async code and our
exchange is really important for you to
learn because it's baked into angular 2
okay see another one of our challenges
with angular 2 is is managing state and
it's not so different a design for
managing state than angular 1 and that
comes with some problems so when we
started to get bigger applications you
know it becomes time consuming to manage
you know complex state management on
your page if you've got some component
or several components that all need to
manage share that same state becomes
tricky to do so in angular 1 will do
things where we might jam that state
into using UI router but I kind of like
a router that just routes and there's
not a state management tool as well we
would have all that information that
stayed in a service and then would have
this awkward callback system that nobody
likes to be able to push out the changes
to everybody else or we'll just
broadcast events everywhere and all of
these things works but no one agreed was
the code I hated the most it was the one
that got refactored and disagreed about
the most and state management was
awkward and we we also end up in this
place where states being changed left
right and center you don't know where's
changing what and you end up in this big
bowl of mutable soup and one of the
things I'm really excited about is the
Redux pattern and being able to help
with this problem with state management
for angular apps so the Redux pattern is
a way to implement a predictable state
management container and you can see I'm
using a little R to reference the Redux
pattern whereas a big R is the Redux
library which comes from the react
community areas quickly run through what
you know the basis of Redux is so Redux
all kind of revolves around this idea of
having a store a single spot where you
manage all the state for your
application so it's a single JavaScript
object and it's where all of your state
will go so imagine i've got a user
object I've got to manage the state of
that user across my application I want
it in the menu I want
in the footer and this and this object
has an email so i can subscribe to the
store and get that state and i can get
that user object and i can get its email
and put it in the view what I'd normally
want to do is if I update that email is
I'll just grab it in my component or my
controller and I'll just update it on
the spot but Redux is a bit different
what I'll do is our dispatch in action
so dispatch in action and these are the
particular words that Redux pattern
would use and this action would say can
you update that email on the user and
the only place where you change state
because states immutable is in these
special functions called reduces so the
reducer would take the user object with
the aim and the email information we
want to change make a new user object
and update the email on that and then
that would flow through to the store so
the state in a store is updated and
because we're you know observing that
and it's flowing in a one-way direction
then that state flows down into our
views so if we take this Redux pattern
and we combine it on to what stevo's
been talking about with our xjs and we
make a library that's specifically for
angular 2 we end up with something
called ngr xon Gerak's is a new library
that supercharges the Redux pattern with
our exchan chi ater between Redux and ng
RX so ender x is a tool that will
revolutionize the way you do development
and your applications as well and this
is a pretty audacious statement to make
but so far is pretty true it's
interesting most people who start using
this guy ha my god you know such a
different way of thinking it's such a
different way of writing my code but
it's so much simpler and I can't believe
it's something I'm learning now that was
definitely my experience because I've
only started learning that this in the
last few months of using ng RX so I got
a quick demonstration of what it would
look like so imagine you've got a music
store here we've got an albums list page
I got four albums on the page and at the
bottom here I've got this recently
viewed items so if I wanted to get the
state for that recently viewed items I
just have to ask the store because the
stores got the state that I want and
anywhere else in my application can go
get that same state from the store so my
code would look like this I'd say this
stop viewed items equals this store
select viewed items pretty simple and
anyone
else who wants it will get the exact
same state just by doing the same thing
so it becomes pretty easy to share
around your application your state so
then down here my recently views because
i'm subscribing to it because it's an RX
chess observable I've going to then have
my single viewed item so far but let's
say I go look at another album I want to
go look at the men of workmen at work
album so I navigate over to that page
when I navigate there I can dispatch an
action so it's all about going hey store
can have some information kind of my
state and haste or can I dispatch an
action to you update so say this dots
store dispatch and I'd pass it an object
with two things on it one is the action
I want to take here it's called type and
the payload of what I want to update so
here I'm dispatching an ad viewed item
action and then I'm going to pass it the
album so it'll update that the state of
the viewed items with this album we're
looking at pretty simple and that's the
beauty of ng RX so because it's an
observable i'm subscribing i'll just get
updated straight away or anywhere else
on the page that's subscribing to will
also get updated so now i'll have two
albums on the page now can hear you
probably all thinking right now but
where do i persist this to my database
so you got a couple of options here you
could say what I'll do is I'll dispatch
oh not dispatch but I'll persist this
information to my database and then on a
successful call back from my database to
say that it's got that data then I'll
dispatch this action so that's one
option so you update database then you
dispatch the action the other option is
you could say I want a more responsive
UI I'll dispatch the action to to the
store so my states updated straightaway
and then i'll update my database and if
it fails then i'll roll back the store
because this is one of the benefits you
can roll back and forward really easy
because you've got all your stayed in
one place and everything listening to it
will roll back as well so so it's pretty
cool stuff and there's some there's some
pros and cons to using it so we'll roll
through some of these now much easier
state management i think you've seen
that it's you've got all this pretty
cool tooling around you've got time
travel debugging you know you can do
undo and redo functionality really
trivial it's much simpler to build and
rationalize about your application
performance can become much better
because you're passing up some of your
kind of change detection to observable
so you can say
angular can you use a different change
detection strategy called on push and
just skip this part of my component tree
don't check that I've got it covered so
things can get faster it's much easier
to test these reduces which is the only
place you change state and so it changes
your testing strategy or pure functions
they take in a user object they pass out
a user object they don't have a HTTP
they don't have all your injected
services that you're doing in your
component so you don't have to mock all
these and put them into your unit test
all you have to test is that email is
changed and did it change correctly so
unit testing becomes a real real
pleasure for your front end and it's
getting a lot of traction it's really
interesting you know a project that
we've just started at the moment is
using ng RX the big project are
mentioning for these 34 inch monitors in
the last two months is picked up ng RX
and two other really big applications
that the my mates i've got running
outside of us have moved into doing it
in the last couple of months so it's
really interesting watching the traction
these bigger applications we're all kind
of merging towards going let's actually
pick up some of the stuff from react
community let's start having a better
state management's kind of story so why
would you not want to use it it's
another dependency it's another thing
you've got to learn and there's a lot to
learn in angular 2 it might be overkill
for a simple application if you don't
have much state to manage on your page
and you're happy just to post back and
get that state again and you're not
sharing it around you know you might not
want to use ng RX for it and you're all
in with our x jayus that's probably the
big deal so you're going to be jumping
into our excess you're going to be doing
a lot more work with streams and all the
operators that you saw Adam show you and
the way that you compose your
applications in the way your structure
your state's going to change so your
application structure will look very
different and I think for the positive
that's a lab solutely will help but
there's a deeper story and will come
actually guys we're really on close on
time so we might if you if we can take
the questions after that would be
awesome but the answer is yes yes so so
I really like this quote from our mates
7 who's on the angular team and he says
maybe it's not an if better when so not
if people should use it but when do
their applications get big enough and
more complex that they should start
looking at using it so in summary for
observables RX jess and redux we think
you should invest the time to learn RX
jess don't just let it sit in the
background of your angular 2
applications and and not use it it's
quite powerful or help you out in many
ways we think Redux is great but we
think ngx is amazing and we think you
should be considering using a few bigger
applications that are going to have more
complex state cool so where to from here
so I'm just going to point out so this
is the agenda for our six-week online
boot camp and the interesting thing to
notice here is that we cover all the
basics of angular 2 in the first three
weeks and this is this is really
important to notice about angular 2 is
that angular 2 ZZ to learn but there's a
lot of complexity around learning the
best ways to do modern web development
so in the second half of the course is
where we cover angular CLI and angular
and material to doing payments
authentication how to do testing and
then how to do Redux and mg RX so we'll
be around outside if you want to come
and have a chat about that but that's
it's a really interesting indication of
where the complexity lies in modern web
development so in summary we had a look
at what is angular 2 and why you should
care about it and what are the different
options for frameworks we talked about
how important it is to get your head
around module loaders and build systems
we talked about ideas and I ID a choice
and typescript the sub the challenges
that are currently around CSS frameworks
and widgets and then hopefully we've
helped you get you know over the
learning hump a bit with observables are
xjs and redux now we've actually
published a book so if you're interested
in having getting a copy of
little book of angular to come up
afterwards and have a chat and we're
going to be outside here at the ssw
stand if you want to come and ask us any
questions but thank you very much for
coming and learning about angular 2
you'll see us around the conference come
and say hi thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
