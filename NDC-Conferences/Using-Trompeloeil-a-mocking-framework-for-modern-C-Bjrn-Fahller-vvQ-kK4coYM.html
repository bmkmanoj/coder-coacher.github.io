the felon and I'm going to talk to you
about using some player mocking
framework for modern C++ a bit of
background before I start I work in
Stockholm for a company named net inside
where I developed embedded software for
communications devices in modern C++
complaining is not my job
it's a hobby project going has to have
hobbies Cyril this is one of them I've
been working on it for about three years
I think I don't remember exactly when I
started some player is used at not the
inside though and it's kind of cool that
they let me travel and talk about my
hobby project I think this is known fact
a a long long long time ago I was a
teenager I had a summer job here in Oslo
who woulda known work for the Norwegian
geotechnical Institute that was before I
was into computers very much from play
the name is always an issue for
surprising reasons here's what concise
encyclopedia says complain is a style of
representation in which a painted object
is intended to deceive the viewer into
believing it is the object itself so it
can play is not for a visual deception
literal translation is trick the eye or
deceive the eye this actually makes
sense from a testing perspective a
mocking perspective because when you
write unit tests you want to test your
your unit in isolation cutting off all
dependencies that this is trivial if it
is a lease closet doesn't have any
dependencies but if it has a lot of lot
of collaborators you don't want to
involve them too in your test so you
replace them with moxie of you
deceive if you like the object being
tested into thinking that it's operating
in in a world that looks the way you
have described it in your test so when
you write your test code you're in in
effect painting a picture for your unit
being tested and you verify that you're
given behaves according to that picture
so I think that may the name from that
makes a lot of sense for a mocking
framework some examples of Trump layered
this is what you get if you go to
Wikipedia page on something for some
reason they do not mention mocking very
words it's a search
hashtag from play on say Instagram or
Twitter you find a lot of street art
also some finer arts like the boy
escaping from the frame some are
amazingly subtle I really like the
portrait to the right I don't know if
you can see the fly that is painted on
the frame below the pocket there is
great when it comes to mugging in C++
the basically two schools of mocking
frameworks because thus one thing that
C++ does not have that most other
languages does and that is reflection so
one school uses knowledge of how to
interpret debugging data compiled into
your binaries to find out how the data
structures are laid out a popular
technique from there is to create their
own vtable representation redirect the
vtable pointer to to their the table
then you can intercept any calls you
like very handy from a secret language
perspective that is so undefined
behavior it's difficult to imagine the
other technique is work within the
language and then you have to compensate
for for this lack of reflection in other
ways and
typically that is done by or the
pre-process so their macro heavy from
toy belongs to the leather kind it stays
true to the language to the best of my
knowledge anyway there are no deviations
or any undefined behavior its equals of
14 it's implemented in a single header
file it's about a little more than three
and a half thousand lines of horrendous
macros and template black magic it's on
the boost license so at least from a
legal perspective anyone should be able
to use it if they want it it's available
from Kona the package manager and it's
adaptable to any unit testing framework
at least I think it is this adaptation
is important if you go to the github
page or you scroll down below the source
code you find this documentation the
first link is integrating with unit
testing frameworks when you click on
that you see this text that says by
default from toei reports violations by
throwing exceptions many modern
frameworks do that but I find it to be a
little bit troubling that's why I
strongly suggested to use an adapter for
your unit testing framework because if
you think about it your mocks are by
definition called by your units being
tested so if they throw an exception
that exception will flow through your
code that is being tested so at the very
least this particular strain on your
code that you really really really
shouldn't catch that exception because
then they have sort of defeated the
whole purpose below this description is
a list longer than that one with some
popular unit testing frameworks you
click on it you get a code snippet of
ten fifteen or so lines that you copy
pasted into your test program then
you're done if your favorite unit
testing framework isn't listed please
write an adapter it's not difficult and
it is documented how you do so and when
you have done it
please submit a pull request to
documentation in the cookbook so that
others can take advantage of that unit
testing framework - I'm going to tell
you about how you use some play by
following an example in 2004 Martin
Fowler wrote this blog post mocks aren't
stubs the ID behind that blog post was
to set the terminology straight what do
we mean when we talk about fake what
what do we mean we'll talk about mocks
what would mean when we talk about just
doubles in general but he used an
example in that blog post that was a
whisky store and your to implement an
order clause and the order Clause uses a
store and to be able to write tests for
the order clause we mock the store so
back to from play how to mock something
you begin with writing a source code
file and you include from play dot h PP
when that compares you have really done
the most difficult part you have spelled
it correctly and then introduced some
type in this case of struttin in my mock
and what you want to mock the only thing
you can mock in from players member
functions so this make mock one funk and
the function signature means is are you
familiar with Google mock by the way
some people are nodding yeah this should
look quite familiar it's the same ID I
couldn't choose and the same macro name
but I elected not to because that could
be confusing so you make mock a function
name and a signature and the one in make
mock one is because the number of
arguments to this function is one
so this makes a mock inclement ation of
the function funk that that takes a
string or value reference and returns an
int I found that many modern frameworks
even today have difficulties with some
modern constructions like our value
references or move on the types like
unique pointer compare is not one of
them it's written in C++ fourth secret
of 1440 prefers 14 a problem with this
approach though is a boy who has not
done made this mistake so you know the
drill you have template code with
horrendous constructions hidden behind
macros you get a thousand lines of
completely incomprehensible garbage like
that function signature does not have
two parameters in make maneuver okay
that is comprehensible and that is the
full error message from D purpose 5.4 I
made a quite an effort to trap these
easy to make mistakes and make sure that
you get a helpful compilation error
message that that directs you to what is
wrong and gives you a short message that
does not have a lot of unrelated
nonsense in fact there is a test suite
of currently 37 test programs that do
not compile and I ensure that they fail
in unexpected ways with good information
back to this one very common scene idiom
in writing just with boxes that you
implement to an interface a pure
abstract base cloth this of course works
well it's not by anything is required I
will show that later on but when you do
please add override it will send you a
lot of headache and here by the way is
that code duplication that I mentioned
in the beginning that we need because of
the lack of introspection it really
shouldn't be necessary to say make mock
of this function because it is already
known by the interface but the language
is the way it is I don't think that this
is a horrendous problem there are other
things that are more important but this
is a drawback and there's currently no
way around it given the way the language
works if you want to stay within the
language back to modern flawless example
here's the example that he is examples
of course in Java but the idea is saying
somebody I would start with following
his example more or less exactly and
then a little stops improvising around
it deviating as we go so it's idea is
that we have a store we can clear it
inventory for an article and we can
remove some quantity of an article from
the store and then we have an order
clause we can add certain quantities of
some article as you wish and then you
can fill the order with the store so a
usage could be like this code snippet
here where you have an order clause you
add 50 telescope that is actually his
example I guess it really likes this
which gives his turns get and then you
get a store from somewhere and you fill
the order so doing this in front play
the created glass mock store that he
inherits from the store that make
Mauck and you've mentioned that what
consulates for making a constant member
function the name of the signature and
override since we're implementing to an
interface and making up to the full
remove assisted us to parameters and
then we can write tests in this example
I'm using the catch unit test framework
reading but by filner she can talk to
him down in the deep brain space if you
want to is also talking later today in
catch you may use your cache is actually
quite naive in here he will tell you a
lot more interesting things but for
these examples all you need is a test
this expressed by saying test case and
the name as a string and then you have
the test body so here I have a test case
feeling does nothing if stock is
insufficient so create an order plus
order object we add 51 telescas to it
get a mock store and then we'll play
some expectation to say that I want
inventory to be called now with whiskey
what happens here is to begin with the
reason we can place this expectation is
to begin with that store is of a mock
type or rather that inventory is the
most function in a type and that it is
possible to call store dot inventory
with whiskey because whiskey is a
control store and control store can be
implicitly converted to the string so
this works and you can make an equality
comparison to see that they are the same
it creates an expectation object right
here in this scope it doesn't have a
name that you can know but it is a local
object and this parameter whiskey is
copied into that object so if you change
the whiskey variable to point to
something else this will not matter it
has its own local copy if you want to
have a reference to just call it with
stress
and then it works equally well this
expectation of the ethics placed first
in the list of expectations for the
inventory function in that type in that
object and this expectation must be
fulfilled by the time the expectation
object goes out of the scope or is
destroyed which it is when it goes out
the scope and here is where Trumpler may
need to report errors during destruction
because the expectation object is
destroyed it sees that wait a minute
this expectation this requirement is not
fulfilment violation report so that is
also one of the reasons you really want
to use an adapter - for your unit
testing framework to report errors
because showing an exception in this
point is well stirred terminated so
let's make a smallest possible
implementation of order that actually
compiles and it didn't compile buying it
returned missing for non-void function
and that is the full error messages
nothing else many unit testing
frameworks just to return a default in
this case I found that being explicit
requiring you to say what it should
return does reduce number of WTFs over
time because the code is much more
explicit it may increase the frequency
of WCS early when writing the code but
after half year when you make a change
you're really happy that is it that it
is explicit now actually seeing errors
that were hidden because it wasn't
obvious what the test code actually did
require
so we are the returned 50/50 here is
actually any expression you can write
well whatever you like as long as the
type of the expression is convertible
you could call random probably a really
bad idea that we could so with this
change we can compile it and it says at
one time obviously with the message
expected store that inventory whiskey to
be called once actually never call which
makes sense because the implementation
of order was just nonsense
so let's improve the ordered class
substudy
it remembers the article and one we call
SIL it actually calls inventory and that
works so let's write another test
feeling removes from story it's in stock
I'm still using modern folders example
by the way so here we have exactly the
same as before that patient expectation
a requirement that the inventory is
called return safety and a requirement
that remove is called you may note now
that these two are added to separate
lists there's one list of expectations
for inventory and there's one list of
expectations for remove so from from
place point of view these expectations
are logically parallel we don't care if
inventory is called before remove or the
reverse which often makes sense but in
this case it's kind of weird isn't it so
we can change that we can add a sequence
object to impose an order this is more
or less exactly the way that Google mock
works by the way you have a sequence
object and you for every every
expectation where the order is important
you say in sequence and the name of the
sequence object
and the way this works is that the
sequence object must see events in the
order they appear in these in sequence
modifiers and you can have several
sequence obviously like if you want to
describe sequences that are themselves
important but logically and related to
each other and you can also have several
sequence object in one dot in sequence
modifier to sort of join them and say
here is a common point and then we can
split again so by doing this we all have
ensured that they are calling in the
proper order the test fails because we
haven't implemented the call to remove
so let's do that remember not only the
article but also the quantity and ensure
that when we call feel it cause remove
provided that the quantity returned was
sufficient and everything works yay so
that was model for as example as as far
as he took it because his only intention
was to show what do we mean with a mock
and that shows for all the well here
let's extend I'm a big trouble by this
interface really if they buried doesn't
work at all if you have several orders
that are working in parallel to one
store perhaps over a network you have
raised on inventory and remove what if
we want different types maybe we should
think a bit more generic strings as
articles are really good for testing it
makes everything clear but perhaps the
real implementation we want to use some
other type and they would really want to
know Victorian to design but feels like
1990
let's do it a different way let's work
with concrete types templatized on the
article type and we have a reserve that
is just say I want fifty Tallis girls
and it says you got twenty sorry and if
you're really disappointed you just
cancel those twenty because how much fun
is just twenty telescas or if you have
to be this they'll remove $20 gift from
the store that's fine and a convenient
type alias for the test you may note now
that we're mocking a class template some
mocking frameworks have trouble with
this others use different syntax just
because it's a template not here it's
all the same and to reduce typing a
little bit let's create a record type
that has both article and quantity
because we always work with them as
pairs so now we can see a slightly
different you situation where we have a
store from somewhere we create an order
object that refers to the store and if
the return value from add is what we
wanted then we feel the order otherwise
we just give up or something order
something else whatever so let's load
some other test add returns to return
the mount so I create an order object
from my mobile store and paste a
requirement that it's called with a
record of 51 telescas this won't compile
because there is no equality comparison
operator for record I could implement
one but let's have fun in that
so instead use the underscore wild
carding in namespace from place the
underscore it's a matter for any value
of any type so you could use this for a
unique pointer or value reference or
whatever works fine so replace a
requirement that reserve is called which
anything which is not really very useful
but then we can constrain it and say
with I guess that should really have
been when but I made a mistake I guess
and then we have a dual and expressions
of describe the constraint one thing is
see now is I'll just go one underscore
one even these in which here the in this
expression you refer to the parameters
of the call by the positional name so
I'm just going on it's the first
parameter underscore two would be the
second if this had two parameters now
I'm just going to as a compilation error
but that way you can build up you or
express whatever you like in that are
using the the parameters to the code
just by their positional lens and you
can call functions in there which is
actually implicitly done here because
we're comparing the two string article
operator equals cost char store
and then at the end I use a catch
assertion so this is knowledge from
placing is a captured certian to see
that the return value is indeed the one
it should be otherwise the test fails so
implementing the order class template
which is now attempted I saw on the
store type the constructor remembers the
store and the add function calls Reserve
and returns whatever we got from there
and this works you may notice that I
feed it now and didn't show you the
failure but you've already seen those so
nothing new there so we can create yet
one test field removes the reserved item
so the first part is exactly the same as
we saw before no difference at all but
then the second scope with the
requirement to call remove this is an
anatomy that is very typical of tests
written in from place if your test
involves several steps you get one local
scope per step where you set the
requirements expectations for what
should happen in this step first and
then a trigger event and then the new
scope with its requirements and the
trigger length and this is also one of
the reasons that sequence objects are
really usually not needed there are
situations where that there are
absolutely necessary but both of them
you just get this natural sequences by
by these scopes if you have very many of
the issue you probably have a design
flaw but also code with foul smells
needs tests so there you go in this case
I place a requirement if we move is
called with safety even though we call
add with 51 because we in the first step
record the reserved call returns 50 so
we ensure that it is remembering the
right thing remembering what was
returned from reserving not
remembering what we asked for and doing
so I need to improve again the order
class better have a another map of
reserved items and I ensure that ad safe
what would what the result was and then
field just reverses the identity in
reserve and call because remove on them
and this is of course that's fine so we
have more tests destructor cancels the
items you may have noticed on the
previous slides that I cheated on
actually leaf memory because I didn't
want to run the destructor debatable
technique I know
but again the same first scope identical
and then just expectations that Council
is called and we said to run the
destructor nothing new implements the
destructor and everything works this
getting bit boring ah sorry multiple
asset in same or combined so we have one
scope for the first remove and one
reserve and one scope for the second
reserve and it's not there's so much
repetition with doing the same with the
same the same the same the same I hate
that absolutely either one possible way
to do this get away from it a little bit
is to say a local instead of required
call a lower call is anywhere between no
calls at all and infinity or well
unsigned long long marks I guess we can
approximate that with infinity and we
just return whatever was asked for then
we're going to have two calls to add
right after one another
perhaps a little coal isn't great
perhaps it's better to say that I want
this to be called exactly twice because
we we know we make two calls to add and
just for completeness you can say at
least twice or at most five or even
anywhere between two and five I've
actually never once used that but I'm
sure if I remove it somewhat will
complain I guess there is a need maybe
and then the requirement to remove these
50 because 50 is assemble 20 and 30 and
that sort of work shouldn't it and what
is this hex dump hmm when from plane
must report an error for a type it
checks if there a print function in nine
states complain that matches this type
if it is it's used if not is there a no
stream insertion operator if so it is
used it's not exactly if this a a pair I
know how to bring person left currently
first Kalmar second right curly it's not
a pair is it at two four if it is tuple
left currently elements come element
come element come element right curly if
it's not it is it something that has
begin an end is so less curly elements
come element come element come all right
curly and it does this recursively so if
you want to print a map a map has a
beginning them so let's curl the
elements come element every element is
pairs or less curly element comma
element and session let's see again
everything and if all that fails it does
a hex dump of the memory region occupied
by the object and of course everybody
can read telesco than in yellow County
so this uses a short string of demise
ation for falsehood string let's write a
print function small thing just in nice
bass drum type print that takes an
Australian reference and your type and
do something that makes a little bit
more sense this can actually be useful
even if you do have a no street
insertion abrade because the might be
information says your object has some
cache that cache may be important in
tests to understand what's happening but
it may not be something you'd normally
want to write so with this we see
instead this failure that was an
unexpected call to remove 30 Taylor's
gifts when there was an expectation to
call remove 50 all right that was
embarrassing okay easy to fix and
everything worked I think still that
there was unhealthy amount of repetition
in the tests that I wrote so I want to
be able to express a mock store on a
higher level that has some intelligence
on how to behave so I want to create
this mob store and say this is the stock
of whiskey's that it has and as long as
calls are made to it within the rules
I'm all right with it and if it's calls
are made outside the rules report it and
it doesn't have to handle every possible
situation because the observations can
still handle exactly like before but if
it manages the bulk of important
situations then we can save a lot of
code code repetition things that are
tedious if we actually want to make
change the effect several tests
obviously it's not required to handle
several parallel orders because it's not
deal it is the order Clause we are
testing itself no not not the mock and I
think it should suffice to have an
object that keep track of what stock is
and manipulated and has a map of what is
reserved by the order class so we can
manipulate these
and then it also has the required
expectation so we know what is allowed
and what is not allowed so how do we do
that
I can have a stock with reserve type
that takes a store a mock store and
under stock and has these maps but how
do we handle the expectations allow coal
it's no good because it must be
fulfilled by the end of the scope and
that is when the constructor runs out
you don't have much use for that there
is named a local name the local gives a
unique pointer to it from play
expectation so now it's now we combined
that expectation to something in this
case a member variable e at the bottom
so now this expectation stays alive as
long as our stock with the reserve
object is live and then I can refer to
the member variables in the width
constraint so I say that as long as it's
called with a quantity that is greater
than zero because we don't want to call
reserve nothing that doesn't make sense
and call with something that is in stock
we handle out of stock situations
different they are in other cases and as
a side effect when this happens we
manipulate the store we decrement the
the available stock and increment the
reserved quantities and return what was
asked for and with this I can write the
test differently I'll say stop with or
serve 50 taels guess that is all we have
in this store and I can refer to the
store in the risk
I can researchers reserved items in the
constraint now LR here is an
intentionally ugly seeing is a
construction similar to the secret of
course that they are they're ugly
because they are visual warning local
reference means that they refer every
name referred to in this constraint that
is local variable it's actually referred
to by reference so there may be lifetime
issues here so we must ensure that the
variable s lives at least as long as
this expectation does in this case it's
perfectly safe require color it's
destroyed the expectation object for
require call is destroyed by the end of
this local scope and s is in an otoscope
so it's perfectly safe
so we can do that and now I guess I just
exposed a little bit of what happens
under the hood here that this macro
expands into a lambda expression among
other things and if LR changes the
capture to be a reference capture
instead of an a copy capture so a little
bit of a crack here in the facade I
guess but there you go
this works fine if you're a little bit
on the paranoid side maybe worried that
maybe for whatever reasons feel calls we
serve we serve this load to be call
because we have an expectation on it
from this stock with resolve objects and
I can override that by explicitly saying
for vehicle this must not happen this
creates another expectation object it is
placed first in the list of expectations
for call to reserve and
when there are several competing
expectations for the same call they are
tried in the order they are found tried
in the list in the reverse the order of
creation so if the Bitcoin was created
last therefore its first in the list and
this one is completely unconstrained
it's it matches anything and it is
forbidden so if there is a call to
reserve here we will get a failed test
so that's good and this is also a
pattern that I've found useful perhaps
not necessarily with forbid call but
that you can early in your test and
patent the test fixture you can set up
the default behavior for how you want
something to to act and then in a local
scope you can override that and say in
this context I want it to behave this
way instead
for example this location call will fail
or whatever perhaps a better way the is
instead to just let our stock with
resort be on a narrower scope this means
that we obviously came up with 30 B the
map called reserve in here because it's
dead and gone a matter of taste I guess
I've been told kittens make
presentations better so they are so we
want to be able to order several
whiskey's so we stock up with both both
telescas an urban add a few of both and
then we want to ensure that what is
renewed when we call field is exactly
what is reserved for each of them so I
have enough again the LR with to ensure
that it is the expected quantity and
that is exists there to begin with and
as a side effect I remove it from
from the map probably better again to
not use a low but please say times two
because we know that there are two
whiskeys in there and perhaps I should
have added a requirement an assertion
that after this then this map really
should be empty I should have erased
every elements but I've run out of slide
space I guess so question is this an
improvement for readability depends I
think if you try to widen the scope and
see a longer test suite with the same
repetitions going over and over I think
it does for this toyish example
debatable but generally speaking I think
it is okay no for something a little bit
more advanced evil product manager comes
in with the new requirement it must be
possible to get notifications when we
tried to order something that wasn't in
stock at least not to the extent that we
wanted to so we've been disappointed and
this should be an optional parameter
Osten function parameter to add and we
want the implementation that add to
request a notification when the return
quantity is lower than the requested
quantity okay add this extra parameter
that we're not using yet just to ensure
that we haven't destroyed anything add a
notify function and convenience type
alias and I should slow down now because
a lot will happen on these few next
slides
so as place a requirement that notify is
called without them
and I cannot really do much with a
callback to ensure that it is the right
one when the callback is expressive as a
state function but I can say any and
then as a side effect I can save that
parameter that can be the function call
back in a local variable so I use LR
side effect to actually refer to this
local variable so that I'm changing its
value then I call ad with a lambda that
operates on an another local variable
lambda is a boolean that sets it to true
and since I'm adding 11 albums when they
only turn the stoker really should get
this to happen and to ensure things or
find a call it and then I check that
this local variable this boolean called
is now true it's obviously fails because
I haven't implemented yet
but that is okay it is compiled so we're
on to something I can add some things to
to the head function so if the quantity
returned was a disappointment then I
call the stored of notify with the
callback so a great and shouldn't that
have worked it should have ended ah so
the fix worked but we broke another test
Oh
interesting okay TDD works we capture
mistakes good I can fix this easily but
let's take a step back and try to look
at a bigger picture this stock which we
serve it might be prudent to allow cause
to notify as long as they are within the
rules that is that is not called with an
uninitialized function did you know that
you can compare stood function with a
null pointer if it compares the equal to
null pointer existed function that just
not what call anything it's default
initialized
when we have tests where where we really
want to check things with its notify
like the one we just wrote we can have
local deviations like I said earlier we
did it's a good idea I think to state
defaults that works for most cases and
when needed you say that in this context
I want a different behavior so we have a
default that just checks on it plays by
the rules just for completeness a
different way of doing the same exactly
the same thing is to use a mattress in
9th place from play n E is not a not
equal mattress you can use it as the
parameter so you just say here we allow
cos to store notify with any whiskey and
anything that is not equal to the null
pointer comparing has 7 mattress is not
equally equal less than less equal
greater than greater equal and regular
expressions you can actually if you want
to you can negate a match it doesn't
make any sense whatsoever for the first
six but for regular expressions it can
actually be easier to say instead of
trying to reverse in invert a regular
expression it can be easier to say match
is not this regular expression so you
just resort invert it with operator not
the exclamation mark if you have really
messed up your design you may have
overloads of this notified function with
different signatures where the second
parameter is actually equal comparable
to the null pointer I've actually seen
such programs for real if you have that
you can disambiguate the caller say it's
this one
when you need this really think about
your design it's
it's not healthy but like I mentioned
earlier also programs with souls and
health needs tests so doing that it
still fails because we haven't done
anything about the problem with but we
have an a different error message as we
see that there was no match for this
call with my pointer but there was an
expectation for another call so you see
the bug it's on the highlighted line we
should only call notify when we actually
have a call back that is not a default
constructor one so now everything is
absolutely fine so now it's time for me
to wrap up because I don't have time to
talk about more advanced stuff it's one
thing from play I have if you go to the
github page click on documentation video
you will find a cheat sheet the cheat
sheet has its actually to pay to a four
pages print them out pin them to the
wall next to your screen and here we can
see pretty much everything that I've
talked about today so you've seen how to
use make mock and make cosmic with a
name and a signature and optionally an
override to create multi member
functions you've seen how to use require
call allow calls for beard core and also
the name diff counterparts where you get
a unique pointer instead of a local
object that leaves spin with the local
scope you've seen a brief introduction
to in the sequence you can do a lot more
with sequences than our show but you you
would please seen it and you've seen how
to use dot x to deviate from the default
of being exactly one call for require
call you seen how to use width and the
conditions to constrain calls that are
otherwise wide open
and side-effect to manipulate data and
return to get values with any expression
I have not shown you doctoral but I
think you can figure that one out it
seems that in all these you can use
positional names for the parameters
underscore underscore two etc and then
the LR versions of them local reference
where you manipulate local variables by
reference he'll be a dragons be careful
with lifetimes I'm not showing you very
much of page two but you've seen the
underscore matter that match is
absolutely anything at all there is a
typed version of it's a macro of any so
you can say any int again if you have
overloads that would be ambiguous with
just the underscore and you seen how to
use it not equal and I mentioned
disambiguating that one to is needed and
a briefly mentioned that you can use the
exclamation mark to invert amateur
unfortunately I haven't had time to
describe how you write your own matters
it's it's not difficult at all but given
that I have seven minutes left or of
this lot there's not a chance I can do
that you can also actually if your
parameters to call our pointer like a
roll point or a unique pointer of shared
pointer or anything with that can be
referenced with the operator store you
can actually use matches for that and
say star equal five meaning that this
pointer when the referenced must be have
the value 5
in the rare case when you need to have
control of lifetime of objects in your
test when for example if you give your
unit under test amok and gives it
ownership of it and it is required to
delete it at some point you can use this
convenience with horror movie time Death
Watch and required destruction or name
required destruction again debatable if
that is good a sign of good design if
you have that but again sometimes you
need to test code that isn't great this
is not needed but it is a convenience it
makes life easier and that is pretty
much it I'm here the rest of the
conference going home on Friday evening
catch me if you want something I can
even show you how to write custom
matrices if you buy an idea here's where
you find the complain and here's how you
can spam me should you want to do that
and there is time for questions if you
want
when I say thank you for your attention
and don't forget to write to paint weird
pictures for your programs thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
