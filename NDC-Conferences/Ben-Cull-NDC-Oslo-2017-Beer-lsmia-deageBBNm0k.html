the brewery now it's a nice small little
brewery out in the middle of this
gorgeous scenery and we can be brewing
4000 litres of beer and so I have to do
some quality control and you know just
make sure everything's up to standard
there okay all right how's it going
Achmed here's all hey guys and here's
the goose Mia Barea hopefully I've got
that right with a couple of the owners
and brewers and I am really excited to
take you through the process of this 500
liter capacity brewery and so let's
check out exactly what we need to do to
make some beer these are the tuna juicer
for supporting and
little maybe smells warm in here at the
other familiar on that mobi and here and
this one is a pale ale of virginity and
this is the CIPA for this from your body
more so much on the air Michaela don't
appear robust two weeks of conversation
how are we thinking here and it moved on
to the köppen houses of the from the
first with the ephram's pina colada and
command was before the trial exempt
order so you show me more than ability
true releases my curation room so after
a couple weeks of fermentation yes I
want to put them on some CMU license
more level to mature probate so I just
settle down do to clear up a little bit
and then and I was also 10 tastes severe
see we're sort of reached its potential
to I thought carbonation process awesome
mostly something about to happen
you can still welcome here they've got
all that fresh fruit in it and for
everyone at home if it's flat at this
stage but it's still flat and kind of
warm it's still delicious and very fresh
ah
alright know where we headed now what
now we're going to be a combination room
and awesome well there's a padlock on
this point of that the words in the
region text authorities cement so this
is where we put the cake and then we've
got some line hence we can pop in like a
full batch Wow
two degrees Celsius these are very very
evil we do that for all the
two beers right me you can put a very
low pressure on and get it smooth and
nice combination or ultimate how long do
you leave the tag on the combination for
roughly four weeks roughly freakin
awesome this is so called suicide story
I actually had 10 of these cakes back
home in Brisbane and I had a kegerator
which is basically a keg refrigerator
kind of not unlike this but just a
family size fridge and I had six steps
across the front of the bridge and I
could fit in my speech kegs all at once
and so that was just the greatest thing
about so being in here and having you
know a whole heap of tags into the
exciting really cool literally so any
season in June quad and so the beef is
gonna be ready son yes it will go be
ready by the animate and then just be
here the bottom left and then yak should
be antastic
so we're going to be tracing these
pretty much straight out of the tank
yeah
I can't wait thank you so much show me
around breweries mean an absolute by the
I'm really excited for you and I hope
that things everyone thank you very much
to you please - all right that has been
the us memory and I will see you in the
next video Cheers
