years so one thing to note is xamarin
forms is not xamarin devran the platform
has been around for over five years six
or seven years xamarin the platform
which is different traditional as we
call it that's basically a a very thin
wrapper over the native API for them
right whereas then reforms is an
abstraction on top of xamarin which is a
UI toolkit abstraction and that was
released about two years ago so would be
about me I'm a demo VP community blogger
been blogging for about two maybe three
years you just talk talking about
xamarin and doing our different
presentations and open source stuff so
have a team where we do xamarin all day
night wade into the night for some
client projects oh that's just the way
it is sometimes and so we also because
we do so much demo work all day not we
have some sort of byproducts that we try
to open source and give back to the
community as much as possible so the
first one is a fresh mvvm so it's like
nvm framework for some reforms so this
framework had its origins when they were
informed was first released and I
started working on that for every
project that we're doing in demon form
thoughts all those inputs you can go and
have a look at it and and plight of a
kit was a component that we try to
develop it like a commercial component
and it didn't really work out that well
because we put so much effort into it
and not enough people were using it so
we decided we better open source so more
people would use it so that's open
source as well fresh essentials for them
reform so you can see we primarily do
that reform that's all we do and that's
why our components design reforms fresh
essentials is the essential stuff that
we use in every project so what's new in
dem reforms it works which is like a
funny thing to say because debatably two
years ago it didn't actually work I mean
it did work if you had to actually make
it work
if you just took it out of the box and
started using it the Android would have
lots of performance issues and they
didn't predict the outer type of app the
people we're trying to build with them
reforms they really felt people were
just going to do like proof-of-concept
applications but people saw it and they
loved it and they wanted to use it for
their commercial applications and
consumer applications so they really
didn't predict any of that so people
started using different forms sort of
words amber and thought this is the way
to do things because it was so easy to
get started and then this sort of stuff
started going up around the web so
you'll see some reddits and stuff like
that but it's good news that it actually
works now so we can get rid of all of
them it's good i feel going through some
slides old slide deck so they used to
use a couple of years ago and i'm so
glad that I'm actually able to get rid
of these now that's really good so then
reforms the apps that we build now
there's no way we could have built them
two years ago endeavour informs plus
buggy much less buggy so I did a
calculation there's 1500 bugs resolved
you can look it up on bugzilla which is
pretty cool I mean it's available word
that they both should have been there in
there in the first place but at least
they fix now which are good it's more
performant so we tend to find that it's
five to ten times more performance than
when it first came out which I can give
you a demo of jumping to a demo here so
what I've actually done how many people
have used xamarin or their own forms
before it's a couple of people okay so
if you can see over here over to the
left I've got my summer and formal
solution you can't actually see it
changed
if you can see over to the left here
I've got a demo forms solution here so
you can see here I've got an iOS project
I've got an android project and I've got
a portable class library so the portable
class library is shared between my iOS
and my android project so this is
primarily one anywhere you want to keep
most of your code with the demo
application and so what you can actually
see use if I go into my packages what
I've done is I've gone back to their own
forms version 1 point 0 just to sort of
see if I try to build an app in 1.8 has
it actually going to look so if i run
this application now simulated running
so you can see as I'm scrolling there
you can't even actually see the images
dropping frames so that's Thurman forms
one point oh I did the same applications
with the latest version of them informed
so you can see for jumping to my
packages version 2.3 which is the latest
stable version examined
so you complete thoughts mover one thing
is this you can get even through de if
you're there's a third pub third party
library that you can use called FF image
loader which I'll bring up them another
slide if you're going to be using some
reforms on Android then you want to use
FF image loader but i'll talk about that
damn track so one of the things that
makes a lot faster is the ListView so
recycling so what that actually does
that when you have a bunch of cells you
know in a long list in dem rate it'll
actually cash the cells that you've used
previously and it will just update the
binding context so it doesn't have to
recreate the whole view it just relays
out the view where it actually needs to
relay out of you so when you change the
binding context if you have any bindings
it'll just update the label it won't
have to worry about creating a whole new
views and so you can get huge
performance increases of that so you can
see the ListView creation strategy
retain element is the traditional way
and the new way is using a recycle
element by default it's the traditional
way which is the retain element so you
need to make sure you actually update
that in your left so the data template
selector its enables you to have
different types of cells in LSU's so
generally if any application you're
probably going to have at least
somewhere and it's probably going to
have multiple types of views in that
list so this actually allows you to use
the cell recycling but with different
types of views so so you can see here so
just so you imagine your your chat
window or your messages window in the
iOS you are like an incoming message
view and you've got an outgoing message
you so here when it's coming in I've got
the incoming data template and then when
exactly what about the outgoing data
template then we'll compile them this is
a big one so
tamarin forms one point oh it actually
took you down one put it into the
project and then at runtime it was like
prising and phoning it now with Emily
you can actually have it turn into IL at
compile time that's faster smaller app
size because if you're not embedding
orders Amal and you can see the demo
arrows at our build time so at the
global level you've got you can turn on
the demo compilation options compile so
that'll happen for that whole assembly
and then if you're having issues you can
turn it off at the class level so in
general we founded about five times
faster it really depends because all
device specific so every get different
results on all different devices and
different numbers and that you put in
bit just on average about five points
after it does increase you build time
but it's not very big it's 15 seconds
the average app so this data each thanks
to Matthew who works on a toolkit called
em prata it's kind of like your
resharper epidermis video on the mac
very early days but it looks like it's
going to have lots of potential so if
you're using chemistry or a matter
recommend checking it out so let's
actually have a look at what I've done
in our code to improve the performance
so this is the fast application and a
demo before you can see here I've got to
list view and then I'm actually changing
the list education strategy to recycle
element so previously this is the only
way that you can do it put it into the
constructor but now you can actually
also do it via a property on LSU and it
will work one other thing that I've been
able to get that performance increase is
the compilation and you can also see
that i'm using the data template
selector
that's these things here a lot of the
biggest things that I personally like
enzyme reforms what's changed because it
enables me to develop apps that i can
use as consumer facing applications
there's other things that i'll go over
but these are definitely my favorite
things because performance is important
so just give a demo of some of the
things you can actually build with them
reforms
to the tap is a well pretty much a
consumer-facing application that were
that's fully built in summer and forms
oh you'll notice here actually this is a
list view more i was talking about the
data template selector so this is using
the thermal compilation the data
template selector and the cell recycling
when it's actually a little bit laggy
because of on my phone actually saw it
because it's go after the big screen a
little bit laggy but um this is probably
about as far as a push semoran forms I
mean anything I get anything more than
eating lots and lots of animations you
probably want to go the traditional
route but if you want something that
sort of standard consumer application
and their own forms is probably good
choice
one thing you can do as well if I take
it offline should still work
so that's more of a consumer-facing one
we do lots of business applications this
is a an app that allows people to learn
how to sell better so they record
themselves to this whole view here this
is all them informed down here that tab
bar even though Eddie's native
components and it looks and feels
natives it is actually cross platform
between iOS and Android am primarily
most of it's in dem reform or the whole
thing has em reforms but the dairy is
where you can actually include native
fights like I don't know if you can see
down the bottom there that's actually
the camera view to actually seeing
what's coming out of the camera and
that's all the whole viewers them
informed but that's the choosing like a
custom renderer so I delete this old
video so you can see here is actually
going to start recording me that hard
the sales guy trying to do my pitch when
this is recording me and then I can stop
that it's actually recorded meet editor
still down informed that's a native view
within their own forms and it's done
through a custom renderer so I can keep
that and submit that to my boss and see
if I've done a good sales job so this is
both those apps you couldn't build with
earlier versions of demo them informed
so sometimes if you go back and have a
look at some of the old rated posts what
their own form doors back then and what
it is now is in the same so there's one
about what else is new
so the open source and this is a big
thing for a lot of people could you
people want to learn how the platform
works and I want to let dive into the
code a lot of people said that we're
going to fix lots of boats but a lot of
people haven't done that but at least it
sort of reduces your risk of having a
closed source software that you sort of
have no idea of what's going on any
don't know what happened to xamarin what
am I going to do at least if it's open
source at least you've actually got the
code to be able to use it in compile it
and it does reduce the risk a lot and if
there's any features you want to build
them and are open to people doing pull
request so this is a pull request that
happened just the other day it actually
allows you to do our label here that is
a native UI label whereas on the Android
it's a text you so you actually have to
do native embedding of native controls
directly into your down in the
cross-platform way which is really cool
so hopefully they'll approve that pull
request so there's a new application
class so these methods here on this
application these are portable so they
actually work across iOS Android and
Windows so when the application stuff no
matter what platform it is you'll get
that event when it sleeps no matter what
platform it is you'll get that event so
one of the thing is you can actually
change the main page so here were about
this main page just a bit like an arrow
which is like a love an area and then
I've got my main part of the application
i can flip that around by just by
setting the main page and it will reset
that so if we actually have a look at
this application here so you can see
where I've open this application over to
left here this is the portable class
library works file with an Android and
this is my own application here so you
can see every monster on sleep on a
resume methods
so there's a new gesture recognizers
just recognizes are a big thing when
you're building native native apps
because you want to be able to have that
interaction with the user without having
them to always tough you wanted to be
able to use the whole screen to interact
with your apps so we'll always have the
tap now there's a long tap I'm at an SAP
and if you don't know what it is it's
actually when you put your finger down
and you move it around the device and
then pinch as you can see here it's when
you're doing the pinching and zooming so
I actually got a demo of that we
some are actually doing it with my
finger he ever stood with a mouse but
you can see if I had my finger and I was
able to move things around I'm actually
getting all those events and that's
actually still of them are forms you an
exam reforms image and I think this if
you look at it there's actually no code
in the native area that's all
cross-platform code so it should still
work on Android have to catch two
different android / fingers crossed
okay we'll come back to it later so I
guess if you've done them all before you
have your favorites like your behaviors
and triggers so when Zen reforms
especially those features learning
permitted but they are now
so you can hear I put my um numerica
validation behavior so I've got a
behavior on an entry element when it
detached I have an event that I attached
to and when the text has changed and
then when it takes to change they
actually check if it actually passes as
a double and then change the color then
on my own content page here I've got my
label and my entry and I'm am but entry
door behaviors I've added my arms the
numeric validation behavior so we should
be able to check that one thing you
notice is I'm on iOS so the reason that
we primarily use iOS or a lot of our
development is just to hold build time
and debug time is what quicker than
using Android so yeah so if i put in
numbers now it's all good then 1 i'm
putting letters it's going to break it
so control templates are something that
they are introduced is that 12 months
ago and so it's a reusable container
template so basically it's car like a
master page so you can see here you've
got like your header area in your foot
area and then you just change the
content inside so that will always stay
in apple OS day and then the content and
the different pages will change a bit
like you master page
so you can see in my application class
here which is like my main part of an
application I've got a control template
which is the teal template inside that
template I've got a grid it's all set up
and what you notice is is included
content presenter so what actually
happens is when you apply that control
template to control it'll put the
contents of the control on the inside
and then it will always wrap that same
control with what you put around the
content presenter so this is kind of
like the master part of it and then the
content is the inner content so you can
actually swap that around so this is the
teal template down here with a backward
template which basically just changes
the color but it's still the same sort
of setup with the content presenter and
then once we go to the home page you can
see energy content view here we're using
a control template which is the teal
template and then what we're also doing
on the fly when the buttons click for
actually changing the control template
between the Aqua and the teal template
so it's just run that
so you can see at the top there so that
that grieves the whole control what's
actually been produced in the end what
was in the the template is this head
apart and the foot apart and then the
club champ on the inside has been
changed and then when I hear the change
theme it's just changing the content and
the top and the bottom so fix the demo
forms will have the context of custom
renderers so you have your own pcl label
or whatever control you wanted that you
would have in your common library and
then you have a custom renderer effects
are like a lite version of that which
you can attach to it so you can take any
control and you can create an effect
they were attached to it and you can
have multiple effects on a single
control but and then you can modify them
the natives part of the whole love the
whole control so it's optional /
platform so it's not done by our
inheritance so when you have a customer
enduro normally you're inheriting from
one of the built-in custom renderers
that Darren Foldes provides to this
allows you to basically attached
behavior to control but on the native
side so it's not doing it on the PTO
side especially during I'm an 80 side so
you can see here this is a an entry
element and then I've got my effects
property there and what I'm actually
doing is resolving an effect which is
disz amarant the border effect and if we
go into it you can see on iOS I've been
heritage from the platform effect and
then when it's attached I've got access
to that control which is the native
control on iOS and then I updating the
powerful color and the border width and
then when it's on detaching it's getting
rid of that too that that can you can
have multiple to a control so you can
have multiple effects applied to a
control where you can apply one effect
to multiple controls so it's more of a
composition rather in here by then
urgent so these were nice move
improvements these are probably one of
my favorite is all rather than the big
features i'm going to put out because i
use these little ones every day select
scroll to a think just having that is
something that you kind of really need
especially in a mobile platform being
able to get the position of the x and y
on a scrollview ListView temporary
enhancements something that you'll
probably have to modify or most projects
header and footer use that every day and
Puerto refresh it's kind of like just
really essential things that the
platform really needed which is good
that they put them in for some of the
preview features so some of these have
been in preview for a while so it won't
be long before they actually come out so
the carousel view not the carousel page
says amerand forms and it first came out
had this included carousel page the
carousel page didn't work that well and
they said don't use it use the carousel
view so the parrot careful page was
really slow it wasn't virtual eyesore
didn't have the cell recycling and
whereas carousel view does so it's an
embedded careful you can have the
carousel view anywhere because it's a
view and not a full page you can have
five of them if you want to and and it
supports the templating fully
customizable and it uses the resource
wing of the fed so we can have a look at
the carousel view
you
you can see on this monkeys page several
have this thing with monkeys I actually
have some monkeys if anybody after your
question or just comes up to me later
and I give you a monkey a blue t-shirt
but all the t-shirts that I have a
really small for some reason so yeah I
don't ask them we can get any teacher
they actually are very small small with
that so you can fit into that said you
can have it I don't even know this after
that looks like a kid shirt maybe you
get one for your kid if you have a kid
yes yeah
definitely is the preference thing I
think if you do it in code you're more
likely to do lots of dynamic way up
which is probably not a good thing you
want to kind of keep your design your
layer if you design layout in them or
they're probably going to be a lot more
performance and if you're moving
controlled up and down and doing what
the dynamic stuff the thing that that I
like about zamel and most people you'll
find used em all because then you come
back to it it's so much easier to read
if you when you're right I didn't see
sharp it's all right when you come back
to it and read it you just like what is
going on here whereas that moves
actually good to read actually we
definitely use them all I even prefer
pumping even more declarative than them
or like camel or something like that in
xamarin maybe one day but definitely
there's no real disadvantages or
advantages apart from there was
performance issues in the past using
zamel but because they do then we'll see
there's no issue there anymore but yet
we I used to do C sharp because it was
easier to the huddle the intelligence
but after i started using down one
coming back to project so i never went
back so yeah definitely recommend them
so do we um yes so with this carousel
view here for choosing us because of
using the cell recycling you've got like
an item source here you're using it an
item template with the data template
and here at carousel view
so one of the other things that I really
looking forward to but it's in preview
at the moment I was going to give it
down all of it but all my all my demos
were working so to actually get this
working you need to update amorous to do
to the preview release which I was a bit
too scared to do just before this but if
you if you do upgrade to the newer
versions of Dentistry you can have a
exam or previewer so it actually behind
the scenes that they're actually almost
running the application and then just
putting the view there for you and so
that'll work if you have dynamically
injected things and things like that and
it'll work in your application while
it'll take things from your application
class so really looking forward to that
something that we don't have so it's
just a preview it's not a designer I
don't know what plans they have for a
designer maybe they will maybe they
won't haven't heard a little bit of it
so Apple Inc's for both iOS Android I'm
not sure about Windows actually have
their own uplinks implementation so if
you send a web link you can actually
make it open in a native application so
if see this has evolved them run and
it's actually a web link the way they
set it up is when it comes in it
actually opens the native application
actually why I'm there this is deserve
an evolved conference app this app is a
great example of what you can do in them
reforms I'm actually have the app of my
device all I'll give you a demo over
later that they set up appt linked in so
actually it works so it comes into your
portable class library so if we have a
look at it up here and the app link so
this is in the portable class library so
it's actually working on iOS and Android
and that app link is coming through and
then once you get the link you can
decide what you actually want to do with
it but we'll have a look at the I'm
going to ball that
for data pages so basically you can take
and as your mobile service or as you do
a data source or adjacent data source
and have my key contacts application or
contacts functionality already sort of
set up for you so the view to be there
the list you will be there the contact
will be there and the same for events
and there's other things that they'll be
adding to it so this is preview so I
don't have a demo of it but it should be
good for the rapid prototyping I mean
this is not we don't actually use this
personally a lot for some reforms
because usually we actually get divided
a done by a designer I'm not probably
care more about the performance than
this but if you are doing rapid
prototyping and this is probably a good
option or if you just want to build out
something really quickly then this is a
good option themes as well so they've
got a light theme in a dark thing so
these things actually they're still in
preview but you can download them and
you can use them now so you can vote yet
so like I said a light theme or a dark
theme there's a few different views that
come through with the scenes I mean it's
still early date so doning know exactly
how many different things are actually
going to bring down with the team but
and should be good this is a good one
native embedding so sometimes you have a
different forms application and if you
have some sort of needed component you
want to put into your zemin forms
application previously you had to create
a custom control and then the custom
control renderer now you can actually
just take a native component and embed
it directly into the control hierarchy
of them informed so here this is a fab
button that you'll see on Android in
this case is just would put the input
straight into the damn reforms control
hierarchy and the same with them this
selector here to dress me in bed native
controls so you can see here on Android
with the so this is a sa native but it
says Amerind Android which we call
natives because it is very close to the
native layer so this is
fab button the fair buttons down here
you can see it's been added to the same
reforms control hierarchy even though
that fat button is a native view there's
not many can do is then reforms at all
see this so you notice on that double
click on this it's not a portable class
library what this is it's a shared
project so share projects are a little
bit different to portable class
libraries in that portable class
libraries are their own assembly and
they have department or own assembling
you can send it to someone a shared
project basically means that that
t-shirt file needed test is compiled
with the iOS and Android and it becomes
the same assembly so being a shared
project you can actually use still use
your compiler directly if it's Android
or fourth iOS whereas you can't actually
have this type of compiler directories
in a portable class library because it
becomes its own assembly whereas this is
actually compiled with the Android or
iOS so you can see here if it's Android
we're creating our new sub button
setting the image and then adding it to
the demo forms control hierarchy device
you jump into that button there you'll
see that this floating action button
when you jump into it is actually a any
Android native control but then when you
actually have a look at this stack layup
it's a demo form special a up so it's
really cool to be able to have those em
reform control toolkit and then just
embed a native controlling to it as well
and then you know to teach its iOS it's
a UI segment in control so you know
something to iOS if it's got you I in
front of it so we create a figment of
control and then we add it to the
control hierarchy so this has done with
a shared project but you can also do
this with a ppl you just have to set up
your hierarchy inside your native
application and then grab it from the
pcl
and what I might actually do is show you
the above application
ok
so this above application it's 11 sauce
created by James Monta mango from samer
an evangelist so it's a really good
example of an application that you can
build seeking through your your event
this I'll showing you the app links to
set up so you actually play around with
Apple Inc's it's got push notifications
and the majority of the code is actually
shared there's only a little bit of
native code in there I've actually
integrates with the calendar as well so
if you if you're thinking about using
some reforms and I recommend you
checking that out and bonus tips them on
Android what Android in general has an
issue with images because for some
reason you want to take any PNG image or
any image you give it and it converts to
a bit map which like really ballooned
that their memory usage in your
application and demo forms is actually
makes it even worse because it's an
abstraction on top of them and Android
the way you actually need to do is you
need to take your and your image and
make it this small as possible so you
need to resize it and only actually put
into Android memory as much as you
actually need to see and FFM is loaded
will do that for you it will manage your
memory your performance it also actually
catch the image for you xamarin plugins
so you've got a sermon provide plugins
that you can use there's a bunch of them
that you can use and there is another
thing that you can use them form of
support xlab but that thing has just
ballooned out with lots of things either
only need their own plugins there are
individual components that work in a
portable class library so this is one
API the connectivity API for example you
can down put that into uni get in your
portable library works on iOS and
Android automatically and it's just a
single API and the only pro
at once so if you're doing our mvvm in
different forms which is probably a good
idea most people tend to recommend it
it's a open source tool kit quarter
propertychanged it will save you a
little time implementing properties and
use the dialogues is a great one that we
use pretty much in every summer for ins
projects because then reported a few
user dialogues but usually what most
applications are going to need to
interact with the easy and need to show
some dialogues so that's why these are
dialogues we recommend other things that
well we use them all day so I guess
opinion is bias but every project we do
we do it in fresh it's probably one of
the first German forms that nvm
frameworks probably one of the best
glide over kid slide of a kit you can
make some really cool stuff with but
it's a little bit fiddly to get working
but if you have a look at it and you
really want it then they'd have a look
at it you can do popovers and menus and
slide it in from the side and fly it in
from the top and my pressure central is
also something that you can probably
look at so that pit actually one more
thing is I was so happy that I was able
to get rid of these slides from other
presentations that I've wanted to burn
them again although on so I guess any
questions little bit of time
so determine forums people are always on
their answering questions I think it's
probably better than stack overflow but
the community's great others lots of
people doing open source stuff it
actually has foundations in latinum 10
and open source so the people that are
actually really into xamarin come from
open source background already so
actually I founded more open source than
like traditional net but yet jump on the
forms another question there's a
built-in yes so it's the native api's
derma forms has a mapping the component
but if you're doing serious mapping
stuff will probably grow out of that
pretty quickly the one that comes that
reforms is really good if you just want
to put a map in with one little like one
of the spot but if you're doing serious
mapping then it's the native API that
you can use fireworks and Android
depending on application if the whole
application is a map then maybe you want
to use them reforms because you're going
to be using the native API for Android
and iOS most of the mapping tool kits
actually a work on xamarin as well like
if we got a knave toolkit which is the
mapping tool kit they work on Dameron as
well so there's the the google map
there's one by our new tech but i can
probably have a chat to you later if you
have any questions yeah so it's the
depends on how tos you are so but if
it's serious and I'd probably recommend
looking at just what what actually is
available in a native API
so it's not in some forms but because
xamarin so anything that you can do in
an objective-c project or Swift project
with iOS you can do in xamarin iOS and
that's the same with Android so anything
you can do in Java you can do in android
as far as in-app purchases you still
have full access to the native API so
you still implement it but you just do
it via an abstraction so you have like
nothing then we're actually working on
like a light key component for in-app
purchases which means that you won't
have to do all the sort of legwork but
at the moment if you wanted to in app
purchases you basically just what you
can go to determine documentation look
at how they do it for Android and then
look at how they do it for iOS and then
you create like a interface and then you
can access they to the inner purchases
actually one of these apps housing that
perches I can bring it up so we do the
in-app purchases on iOS so I'm already
subscribed but what that'll do that'll
if I'm not subscribed it'll go access
the app store it will bring down the
price and it'll let me do the payment
and then it'll jump into the native
payment gateway so we just had an
interface that we set up in iOS and then
we pass the interface back into the
portable class library which some
reforms users so it'll be like I in-app
purchases get me my price and then it'll
be I in app purchases make payment so we
only had to do that for iOS or um the
iOS and we didn't even need a table at
for Android because we need it more
questions you Yuri sharp yeah no I
haven't actually done a lot of that but
I know that in the go one of the
founders or the CTO of xamarin he
created that library and well I don't
actually can't speak for it personally
but I definitely look at it because it's
cross-platform whatever you sir yeah I
think if you're going to do them and you
can probably go have a look at that
another question
yeah well for iOS and Android that is
what xamarin is because they have the
abstraction on the native UI kit whereas
for windows you don't have to do
anything because C sharp already works
so you end all any like portable
libraries that you create any like
application frameworks if you can use
them on a c-sharp net server and then
you can also use them in your portable
class library for iOS and Android and
then also on your Windows Phone then
reforms works on uwp and Windows 8.1 so
oh and I think it's going to work on
Darren Mack soon as well so that some
people working on that so you can do
them informed so we do their own forms
where it works on iOS Android and uwp so
so you go and potential on a Mac here
iOS and Android like the first two
platforms that are probably the most
supported uwp with the market of
purchase is going to get bigger cool is
there any other questions little bit of
time I think
yeah well we actually are finding that I
don't have Windows Phone but eww peer
the Windows platform is actually getting
bigger because they're telling so many
tablet devices and actual desktop
devices for windows so I guess what your
question is that what should we do is
Windows Phone or xamarin yeah there's
some people still doing it like we have
requests there's enterprises that are
still using Windows negative like
they've bought surface tablets for the
big operations department we're actually
developing for windows yeah so it just
works the same with the mouse and
keyboard it's obviously the gestures
well so if you think about Windows uwp
it's got the gestures in there but then
there's also a mouse and keyboard
component that you can use and that's
the same with like an iPad pro so
generally they're just import outputs
that I do work if it's a keyboard and
mouse then obviously your gesture based
and they don't have gestures and that's
not going to work so I guess you have to
think about that we find that we just
have to test on all the devices is going
to go on and just make sure that it
works any more questions
how many people are like nobody's using
exam or has anyone actually started
using them run yet okay people thinking
about using it I guess that's why are
you here did you look into them on form
before we'd yeah get mono touch yeah
yeah yeah so the the pricing was
definitely a big block up that puts a
lot of people from using it but now when
it's freaking actually if you've got a
msdn license then you can actually get
the enterprise version included but
there is actually a fully functional
free version now so a lot of people are
going to start using it and when people
good when people use a platform because
it actually when something doesn't work
for more people to complying so it's
good
yeah yeah they they were a start-up so
good so we're trying to like make it
makes make money so they can impress
their investors that now Microsoft just
want to fill the cloud so we get them
run included for free there's a dimmer
and free version of them run a studio
it's the same I think it's the
communities you so you can plea make
them run application to put them into
the store on the community edition but
so you there's a community this is a
visual studio Community Edition which
you can do apps in and then there's so
much to do community edition that you
can do apps in and then there's at the
enterprise edition so it never there was
other thing that they have like a free
version a starter one but it was too
restrictive you could basically putting
use it so now now you can use it if you
just want to develop apps in your locker
independent software developer or fe m
sdn then you can already included so you
have to worry about anything else and
you're hopefully with the microsoft to
purchase again around proper development
and I'm assuming that's going to happen
and they're going to deliver more
features which is good
yeah so I was that four and a half years
ago that I started with the Harvard
application I managing jquery mobile and
Cordova and I went to her boss and I
showed in the app and he's like this is
 and then I went and try to fix it
now to Gretchen was like this is still
 I think we did like three or four
times and then a couple of colleagues
said look at this you can do like C
sharp and it's like all day you're like
that's nothing to work and then like he
actually came back to me but whatever I
built I'm like you suck and then after
that I wanted them running and I never
really was back because it always works
I mean apart from what it doesn't work
it's still like it what you can actually
deliver it in the end is actually a good
application and that's why I took the
downward n even if you using down
reforms or it can fall over a point you
always have the option either informed
to do everything natively so you can
have a full native page if you want to
so you can there's no point in using
different forms where you'll get stuck
and you won't be able to get yourself
out of trouble that we've done a mapping
application before whether pretty much
the whole which started off using the
derm forum perhaps thinking it was going
to be good enough and then we realize
that the api's I'm going to be enough
and we basically just took the hold our
own forms page and built an aviary for
iOS and Android so we could get
ourselves out of trouble there was no
way that we got stuck somewhere so we
left I we use it primarily just because
is always a way out you can yeah so you
can you can have different forms for
like ninety percent of your app and then
have a whole page which is well like an
80-page with the native API and using
native controls that you get from and
the github and then you could have 50 50
you can really just mitcham map mix and
match it how you want to know one thing
is one other thing we actually we've
done a little bit is actually because
it's the natives you can you
the native web view controls which is
essentially you can have a little bits
of web implied is the reforms
applications so we build an application
that's got native API it's got their own
forms API then it's got HTML api's but
you just picking the best part for the
job at hand really yeah if you if you
want to get a zimmern like application
close down you can get it down there's
always going to be like a little bit
more like if you do out of the box i
think like an iOS is going to give you
like what under five megs whereas under
xamarin forms by default is but under 12
Meg's so but when you start putting
images in your applications it just
ballooned out and that will happen on a
native iOS project anyway so if you want
to keep you up so small you'd have to do
that natively anyway you have to think
about that and you can actually do that
in summer and as you go through and if
you read how to actually reduce your
outsides you can do it so there it but
there is a little bit of overhead but
not enough to make you worry about it
really
yeah the shared projects they actually
take your code and then they compile it
into the same project on iOS and Android
please use compiler directives see if I
guess if you can have like that native
embedding example where you can have
lots of native code and lots of native
iOS and native Android then the shared
project is really good but we use
portable class libraries because it
makes us think in a more platform
specific way and because if we want to
actually get some native features we
have to create a dependency and we have
to do the interfaces and everything so
actually forces us to make even that
component reusable component so then we
can put it up to the app verbs and you
getting reuse it against it makes you
think in that sort of portable way
whereas if you're doing the shared
projects you're so easy just to go on
right native code and then it'll just
you don't think about it in more of a
component eyes way really so I want to
compose down it just compiled down to
the native areas let's have a look this
is the medium fitting yes so what
actually happens here is you've got
these compiler directives and because
they see here where it folds the
androids project among our compiler
directive in there and at the Android
codes when this actually can poles down
and I have a look at it
it is this may detest droid and that's
that just the one assembly that all that
code compiled into but if I opened up a
ppl that native test would be its own
assembly and you could use that another
components but this is that the same as
file linking sometimes we use it so the
example of when to use the share
projects is the file API is not
available in the portable class library
to the file access checking of a file
exists but if you use but the API
for.net is the same so you can still use
the the same API in the shared project
and but it just compiled in the Android
them in the iOS rather than compiling
into its own portable class library that
can be I can give to somebody in making
use but we don't do a lot of shared
projects and less business systems
reason for it we just when we go and
create a new project in demo form you
can have the option here to use the
shared library primarily we always use
portable class library but is the reason
we need to do is a shared library then
we'll jump into a shared library
yeah i think the portable path ya need
we would still keep the portable class
library and then just add a shared
project for the stuff that we need to
have shared but a lot of the time you
don't even need a shared library because
what you do is you just put it into your
iOS and Android project create an
interface and then put it into your ioc
container and if on Android if you put
it into RFC container that's your
Android implementation on iOS you put it
into container and that's jar with
implementation of that feature and
picked up to that time yeah that's it
thank you very much for coming up who
wants some demo monkeys come one come
with like some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
