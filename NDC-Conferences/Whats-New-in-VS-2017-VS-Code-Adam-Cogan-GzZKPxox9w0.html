vs code I have a bit of a plan to go
through a little bit of history and then
I want to talk about my favorite things
in visual Co and visuals geocode i'll
talk talk about various code and visual
steer and dotnet core and i've kind of
put this session together talking to a
lot of the guys in my office about their
favorite features we didn't have
complete consensus on what was cool
there's lots of good investments in
there but hopefully you'll walk away
with a few good tips all right
so very quickly a quick trip down memory
lane 2002 well we don't use any of it
the only thing we really cared about was
end unit came out back then 2003 we
don't use any of it we we still use
resharper 2005 well what did we get that
we care about well we got generics I
think we still care about that and get
was created in 2005 by Linus 2008 that
was the year of the iPhone and Android
we thought MVC was super important at
the time
I guess link is the big guy it was also
the time X unit came out as well alright
so 2010 we got well I always remember
this from last year but how many people
in the room play around or have played
around with f-sharp okay so I've got
about a quarter of the room and when
I've asked that question other countries
you basically get zero
I always find that amazing so so we've
got F sharp which you guys would care
about and we got Intel eat race which
was had a big promise and 2012
well we pissed off all the developers
with our black and white we got new get
that was pretty important we also got
Microsoft embraced open-source unit
testing so is the first time they kind
of backtracked on their original idea
that we wouldn't
that they wouldn't just include n unit
next unit in the box that instead what
they would do is they would write their
own MS test and that was kind of a you
know kind of not the optimal decision
that they made which we've learned about
12 years later so all right so the first
time I go to some non developer tool as
well to help developers but really this
this product hasn't really taken off
other people you know the UX designers
have taken over they use Macs and other
apps which are all pretty cool it's kind
of sad because the way that most stuff
do this is they take they create kind of
a cool brush they put it in the
expensive SKUs and you know normal
people can't can't afford them except in
Norway I know like you know I love about
Norway is the fact that before I had
come to Norway I had only seen five
Tesla's in my life and the first hour I
was here I think I've seen about 30 and
we at that point in time we didn't even
have 30 in Australia so I bought the
number 12 Tesla and that's like a big
deal in Australia but here's like a taxi
or something but but in normal countries
these type of tools were in the ultimate
version and they were very expensive so
it didn't get traction other companies
will create tools like this make them
free get a user base and then start
charging so but I still love it but you
know there's other there's other tools
around and we got typescript in 2013 and
of course we've got Visual Studio calm
which was enormous how many people use
visual Steve calm for their source
control I get a show of hands you guys
are shy it's like this and it's hard to
count okay
who loves Norway all right
that's most not everyone who's not from
Norway Oh quite a few
okay who's from a long way away
what's a long way away annoy straighten
alright so yeah vigil stare calm is huge
typescript was huge and and Microsoft at
this point in time in 2013 start talking
to Linus and that becomes an important
part because we know that marks up have
pretty much switched everything to get
now okay so those initial conversations
were super important and even Windows
have switched to get so that's Brian
Harry blogged about that recently that's
a big deal who is still on tfv see yep
just a few not too proud of that who
don't get everyone okay even more than
loves Norway great that's fantastic
alright so Microsoft started releasing a
little differently rather than at 2-year
release cycle they started doing small
things you know an update one we got get
support like this enormous you know
update to we got lots of stuff coming it
wasn't just bug fixes of there's lots of
cool stuff coming update 3 we got pulled
over and update for you know it just
kept on coming released major ok
and I'm when they release this everybody
that I knew used octopus okay and this
release manager kind of did they did a
pretty good job eventually took them for
you guys and we pretty much do all
almost all new projects on release
management how many people here are
still using octopus wow it's huge in
Norway two-thirds of the room who's
using visual she release just less than
a quarter right awesome okay so and then
we got Roslyn
it was a big deal we've got code lens a
big deal we got asp.net 5 which got
renamed to a speed on that call and you
know that was all pretty good update one
we got go to implementation update to so
you can see a lot of this stuff
starts coming around it's strange to
think in 2015 was the first time we had
auto-update extensions it feels like
we've had it forever update 3 we've got
the VSDs marketplace really really
important like super important I've been
pleading for that for many years and so
had a lot of other MVPs we've got this
nice little thing I like it you know you
just type a class looked it up a light
bulb
Microsoft invented this idea with the
light bulb or they well they thought of
it and then you see that light bulb and
then you click this guy and then it will
go and automatically find the latest
package and then you it'll show you the
code it's about to change and then it's
in alright so what's in 2017 well we're
going to find out during the session all
right
so a little about me I am a Microsoft
Regional Director there's a couple in
every country around the world i I am
well known because I crashed at Tesla
the first Tesla now I should be clear
this post was just to scare my wife and
it was done on the first but it seemed
to get me too much notoriety yeah I
guess that happens in Norway all the
time doesn't really yes study in
Australia that was big big deal in fact
um I recently I recently had a pretty
bad motorcycle accident and a lot of
people thought I was joking you know I I
broke four ribs I busted damaged my
kidney my liver had a bleeding spleen
and a collapsed lung and that was like
two months ago
and now I'm here I'm only coming because
I'd already paid for Tough Mudder and so
so I'm going with Jacob's the guy runs
in DC and Martin and a few other guys
and yeah we'll see I haven't done much
exercise I had to sleep sitting up for
like a month
oh yeah well generally I don't have
enough exercise that's a known fact but
anyway I'm still here and I'm not riding
motorbikes anymore alright as my little
girls alright so let's go through the
user gripes one of the biggest
complaints you guys have about Visual
Studio too much memory slow set it
crashing it's pretty stable doesn't
crash a lot depends on your code there
you go all harsh one
there's a lot of crashing alright okay
well I'm going to walk you through the
biggest user gripes that our on user
voice we all get ten votes right and we
use our ten votes I wish I had more than
ten votes because I have a lot of
complaints but I mean I'm inside you
know the mics are proteins and I see how
they work they really do care about user
voice so I am going to encourage you to
use it but here is what I took I took
the the big ones everybody complains
four thousand votes about a build server
they just want to go to build server not
install visuals to you and I'm just
going to tell you very quickly that one
is done alright they know that they've
got this this build agent zip that you
download you install it instead of a
three or four hour task it's a say 15 20
minutes alright so let me take you
through a few others I'm actually not
sure anyone cares it's a one-time piece
of pain but and there are some
workarounds at the moment you know in
the earlier versions but they weren't
legal so people didn't want to fold them
okay so some people want this they want
we have transforms on web content they
want on any config file and other people
say they want on any file at all I
reckon this would be very scary like you
know this would remark stuff give us
gives us this and I won't tell you just
yet whether they did but it feel like
I'm like you know sequel server triggers
you know when you're trying to debug
something and the last thing you think
of is there's some weird trigger running
on some table this is Eric must be weird
anyway non nullable referent types is
another one people want it's a lot of
votes they're bringing Universal apps to
Android iOS some people when they see
the word universal app so does glaze
over
better people don't like this object
reference not set to an to an instance
of an object okay enables a more
debugging I'm not sure I don't get this
but it's very popular request we don't
have HTML debugging like like that but
anyway we make the installation visuals
to your lightweight and fast okay that's
a big one
give it some type of task major to find
out if free sharp is slow or something
make solutions load faster in general
don't show us this dialog box
stop your dependency on IE all right
anyway I've given you I haven't given
you the mall but I've given you a range
of the top ones and we'll walk through
and see which ones they gave us now what
I'd like to do is go through my number
one thing and my number one thing is
dotnet core who is building a solution
for production at the moment on net core
full hands full
I can I can only see to keep your hands
up to four five six so hardly anyone I
think this is something I'd love to see
change I think naturally you will we
have been building pretty much all our
services on on dotnet core let me run
you through a quick recap so people like
it because it's faster they like it
because it's cross-platform you can use
your Mac they like it because that you
can deploy it anywhere on Linux they
like it because it's open source of all
these reasons which is your big one who
whose is their biggest one is it because
of performance so maybe a third whose
biggest one is the you know developing
on a Mac or so just two three hardly
anyone who cares about that they can
deploy anywhere that's the big one all
right so that's more than half the room
and who cares about open source being
the big one that's quite a few all right
so it's like almost it doesn't alright
great so this is what last year when I
came here we we went through
what the story was at the time and there
was this is kind of what I said no more
serious proj it's all about Jason we
don't want XML anymore
forget about web content we use config
Jason and we're all cool now
no more packages config we use packages
Jason or cool ok so all right so then
Microsoft made this blog post and I'll
just say basically said when we started
building dotnet core and
asp.net Court was important to have a
project system work across Windows Mac
Linux worked in editors other than
vicious geo the new project Jason format
was created feedback was from customers
was they loved it but they also one of
their projects to work with existing
dotnet code they've already had so in
order to do this by making dotnet core G
it takes a lot of words to actually say
you know we're actually switching back
sorry about that we could have had much
less words anyway
we come in here this is how we do it web
CS proj and we go web config and just
the normal fierce proj okay so if you
learn all that stuff forget about it
okay so if you open your new project
this is what will happen you'll open it
up and it will say hello reviewed
project and solution changes no please
these projects are either not supported
or need project behavior impacting
modifications to open this version of
Visual Studio Projects not displayed
require anyway basically what they mean
is I don't even see the word sorry here
but you just press ok and you're good to
go
if you want to do a command-line you
just go dotnet migrate and it's just a
very simple one-time fix and we're back
where we started
beautiful and last year I said about we
have this runtime DMX and we have this
version means D nvm and we have this KPM
package major that's all you need to
know and you're good to go and the way
it would work is you come here you would
download the DN vm you would install the
DN x you would restore the KPM and then
we would use DN x to run the app ok so
that's been renamed so we now have Dean
X is now dotnet run DM BM is dotnet
upgrade isn't as simple and KPM is
dotnet restore so let's have a look at
how we do it now dot net new dotnet
restore dotnet run okay so let's go
through here dotnet new it creates a
project using the template dotnet
restore and it will go and restore any
of the packages in the template and then
it's just dotnet run and this is a
console up and we should get holy world
great bingo
so it's just create an app DotNetNuke
and you see a folder with all the files
from the template then you will go
dotnet restore and we'll just look at
all the packages you NuGet packages in
your CS proach and then dotnet run so it
will run the project and we're good
that's exactly the whole kit and
kaboodle now when you're doing it for a
web project let's talk about a web
project okay so we go dotnet new - t
that's the template web dev restore and
dotnet run exactly the same except which
template you're choosing sound good so
far alright so under the covers the
webserver is not old good old is they've
made one called kestrel okay so let's
have a look here dotnet new - t web and
that will go and create the project
dotnet restore and that will go and look
up the the NuGet packages and dotnet run
and it will kick open the kestrel web
server it will start executing and it
will go and request all the resources
and we should be good to go and that's
the entire process so dotnet core is not
that intimidating I hope you can see and
you can see heaps more about that during
this awesome conference
so that then you pop open a browser and
we're good to go this is what we see
first time okay so what was involved
well we we create the project and these
were all the files that were created
this time so based on the template you
can see this is a web project you see
all the web stuff okay doc never store
restores all the all the stuff based on
then you get packages and then dotnet
run will use the kestrel web server and
you'll just open up a browser and run it
so if you look closely at what was
happening before we have a home
controller index action being executed
here then we see a CSS HTML file being
served here and then we see all the
static stuff all the CSS all the images
all that stuff and not that not that I
think anyone ever looks at what's
happening there but that's that's
essentially what's happening all right
so the new version coming up you will
just be able to pick up your phone use
Cortana and say create me a dotnet core
app okay and the version after you'll
just be able to think of it another
that'll be next year and I'll just
create alright alright nobody tweet that
okay it's n be able to just over alright
so here's the story it's fast super
super super fast it runs on Linux
Windows Linux and Mac and it's it's very
simple to run all right how many people
think that the investments in this
worthy and think that you might use this
for your next project to build the
services all right all right
that's a 90 percent of room thank you
sir all right for a very special thing
now what we need so I'm just going to
tell you a couple of things and then
we're going to do a Tim Tam slam so I'm
needing six volunteers apparently it's
very I tried this last year but I spent
most of the session just trying to get
six people to come down ok so there's
going to be some very nice Tim Tams I'm
I just just throw a few just ignite whet
your appetite all right there we go all
right oh look good catch so start
thinking now you've got to choose what
you're going to do your front end in
this is going to be controversial you've
got to choose angular or react whether
they're the two big ones or you might
want to choose view or aralia have I
missed any no Wow okay capture everyone
okay so in Australia angular and react
pretty much have taken over or called
all large projects Enterprise projects
my experience is well I've got a company
of about 40 c-sharp guys or web guys and
I think generally even though we'll do
angular or react I think naturally
c-sharp guys just like angular it's it's
strict the type you know the type
typescript is natural for a c-sharp guys
they don't they like the dependency
injection they like the module way it
works they just generally navigate to
this it's backed by Google it has
multiple things in the box like you get
routing straightaway you get unit
testing in the Box you get validation in
the Box everything just comes react if
you like CSS a new like HTML and you
like JavaScript and you think that's
kind of how the web will work you will
find it confronting to do react because
you've got this JSX and you've got to
basically throw all your HTML and it's
not natural HTML etc that goes through
that that said reactors are much better
platform to use on an existing project
you know in a multi-page application it
works nicely if you're going to do
office development if you're going to do
any office 365 extensions I don't know
if you've seen all the new stuff that
they've just released with the
communication sites and all that
sharepoint stuff and it's it's pretty
nice and all those extensions are in in
reacts view is huge in China we have a
China office and everybody in China
talks about view it's a fastest growing
thing Alibaba
you all know Alibaba I hope that is the
biggest thing in China they do
everything on that Jack Ma is loved by
everyone like the Richard Branson over
there and they are heavy influences of
you okay so it'll be interesting to see
which way you go and then you've got
nice ones like aralia just don't have
it's an elegant solution simple done
nicely it doesn't have a lot of market
traction all right how many people here
go with them for the next project will
go with angular can I just see the
percentage who goes with end gone for
their next project so two-thirds who
will go with react to their next project
no the third who will go with you not a
soul or one okay interesting and aralia
aralia well alright so we've got less
than I know maybe an eighth or something
so that's a that's awesome I will just
mention to you that talking like going
something non mainstream like aralia is
potentially dangerous only if you look
at like the numbers the numbers
themselves are if you just look at
angular in the last month 1.5 million
downloads and that's not counting
angularjs that's just basically angular
for now then you've got react the whole
kit and kaboodle 4.5 so it's huge you
got view half a million that's not bad
and you got aralia and that's 25,000 so
pretty tiny
anyway alright I just want to mention
saying I have been coming to Norway for
some years and Norway to me was Oslo
and I had only seen odds like all I'd
seen his Tesla's everywhere that was my
memory and for the first time when I
came this time I went down to Kristen
sands and Christensen is a town down
south you kkona kkona know but it's a
long flight to here add another couple
of hours waiting the train station and
getting on this train down and I was
traveling comfort class okay for comfort
I do like that you use K instead of C
much more user-friendly and it took me a
while to realize anyone see the problem
with this who sees a problem one person
sees the problem and only because I
pointed out to him right it took me a
long time on the train before I reals
what was going on the trains I know this
is not strange for you but I've never
seen it or heard of it the trains pull
over and then another car train comes
the other direction there's any one
train line last night like you've got
tells us everywhere but you only have
one train track
I was trying explain this to Adam
Stevenson last night they have a train
the train has one track and at first you
thought I was talking about inside the
carriage and it was like you you didn't
see see the problem I said no one the
train goes on one track only like you
know are you just as surprised as me
because I see you mean like on a
monorail so they put the train on one
rail going and the other one no there's
one track Steve Oh like you have to put
a lot of faith in the in the train
driver that he will remember to pull
over I couldn't sleep
it was Carol and I was in come for
Christ I'm right at the front and that's
the most dangerous place to be
anyway I didn't like it anyway all right
so I need six volunteers very quickly
can I get six very very quick all right
one gone yes yes come on quick quick
quick quick
oh we got one
okay I need some more quickly I need
some girls and you kind of done a Tim
Tam slam before okay yeah yet chocolate
it's worth it we got another one quick
now I'm going to tell you the rules ah
we didn't get glass they didn't give its
life we might be able to see this very
easily okay but here's the deal this is
Tim Tam slam I need two more quickly so
this is what's going to happen in
Australia this is how we drink coffee
this is our straw okay I'm going to can
I just can you just put it over there
okay
so you're allowed you're allowed to
that's it okay and you've got to drink
as much of the coffee as you can here is
the deal can I get two more come on come
on
okay Norwegians are so shy why is that
oh yes I got one thank you thank you
awesome so this is the instructions very
quickly this is your straw you bite the
corn off and just make sure it goes all
the way through and then you go the
opposite ends and you invite the other
corner all right now the deal is you can
use two but you've got to drink as much
coffee as you can now be aware that's
hot coffee it's going to when you suck
really hard it will fill up very fast
but you can't let it go because it'll
drop and then you'll lose so you've got
to fill it up real fast and you're
trying to mouth it will explode in your
mouth not a big explosion nothing bad
all right you ready okay don't start yet
all right you have to be on the other
side we need to watch you okay don't
start Oh
cheating going on there he's preparing
and then they can't drink yet you ready
okay ready get your get your coffee
ready you can take the lid off now I'm
going to be measuring how much coffee
got drunk ready set go
you can have two I've done the whole end
he's going to be set that's not going to
work
is possible it's technique let me tell
you are we on he's taking too long he's
gonna lose it
she's eating this is such other there's
a mess there he's going to have a bad
day when he goes home to sees wife all
right all right he's lost it and we have
a winner
yes we have a winner I don't know how
you did did you drink it oh that's very
impressive all right you won
congratulations all right and second
place and I have a few for you guys all
right there you go and can take that
home yes you can keep your coffee
awesome there we go that's all that's
the only human we get in Australia and I
bet they're our best biscuits I brought
the most expensive biscuit so you have I
got to tell you I there's a couple of
things I have loved about Norway you
have it's a great idea you have hot
bathroom floors that's a great idea I'm
taking that back to Australia I'm going
to see if it takes off I really think
that's an amazing idea don't know
whether you guys thought of it but that
is just incredible you know the other
thing I love you have a chewing gum
which is licorice flavored who would
have thought of that yes I've had some
fun down and Christy Christian sand all
right now you now you've chosen your
framework most of you chose angular and
a less of you chose react and then third
place was aralia
so you have to choose vienna use vs code
or visual studio you can choose either
people do which way which one are you
guys primarily using beers code or VF
2017 who says vs code primarily okay
well not even a Nate's maybe who's using
Visual Studio is their primary own okay
90 cents all right cool maybe more
so let's talk about this so beers code
isn't isn't totally mainstream yet but
it's getting bigger and bigger I'll just
walk you through it basically we have no
tape comes out in 83 and then we get
notepad plus plus that took a while and
then we get sublime and then we get Adam
and then we have this Microsoft
surprised everyone and they give us vs
code preview and then they give us the
open source on github really surprising
and then they give us an rtmp for a
couple years this is staying to get kind
of mature if you have a look at this
these these are the numbers you can see
that notepad plus plus is right now this
always frustrates me when people show me
this do you see the problem see the
categories when people give you good
friends they have to change the
categories so you change it to
development tools and you will see which
is reality sublime is huge and you will
also see that not vyas code is catching
up real fast real fast so here is the
story you have these front-end
developers okay
there are usually pretty handsome dudes
they they don't want vicious year they
are not going to wait a couple of hours
to it install but they didn't want a big
fat thing because they use Mac's anyway
so it's not going to work so they are
very comfortable with all enterprise
languages javascript and HTML all right
angle and react now and they've got a
lot of power for what they can do okay
and they're very handsome now what you
probably don't know see that guy
everyone thinks be some hipster this is
the most hated guy in Australia this guy
dumped our Kali Minogue okay maybe you
don't know who climbing ogres but she's
beautiful she's never been able to find
a husband of proper standing and here's
some nasty English cat all right anyway
we've got dotnet developers okay garnett
developers they know that visual studio
is slow it's not a big deal they use
windows they care about productivity and
tele sense navigating code code lens
they're not giving this stuff up they
want nice debugging that's where they
sit okay and you
not impressed so let's walk through this
you've got front-end developers they
notice a light bulb broken they cover
the light bulb with yellow paint and
they tell the backend that the light
bulb is now working just during the day
now this is my experience and this is a
genuine experience I go and talk to CIOs
and CTOs probably every couple of days
around Australia and every time you go
to them all they want to talk about is
front-end technologies they're
mesmerized by angular or react and all
the discussions around that and whether
you know where all this sits and how
they should be doing it they whatever
we're talking about we are going to
probably be gone in a few years time and
we'll be starting again those services
with the ones that they give a
disproportionate small amount of
headspace is what they will have years
later so I consider BS code this part
and I consider Visual Studio this part
and that's how the conversations should
be going in my mind more time spent on
the architecture it's very sad that it's
not the case
anyway you can see front-end developers
are getting more and more popular it's
just a fashion thing in my mind but you
do want to get your front-end right but
you want to care more about your
services let's talk about vs code it's
very lightweight it has lots of
languages got gilt get built in heaps of
extensions which make it awesome and
it's got all necessary stuff for
intellisense
drop peak debugging etc how many people
here are actually using vs code for
their c-sharp stuff not a soul
okay interesting so just for front-end
development right good I think that will
change so there's not a soul in the
entire room when we talk about this in
the years time we'll see what happens
but you know vs code it's super
lightweight you can you get all your
intellisense
it's I would say as good as visuals to
you in that sense you can quickly peak
you can right-click on here and you can
peek down don't you go into other files
looks quite nice let's talk about the
experience here's the experience
we're going to go file new project okay
farm you project I'll call it project
awesome okay here pops all the files and
that is just you know we've been through
that before with you know the templates
so what do we want to do we just want to
write run the file now so let's let's
press this little button little green
button boom Wow first decision I have to
make a decision here what environment do
I pick
I'll choose dotnet core let's go through
and it will in the background just add a
couple of files launch Jason so you'll
see these launch Jason and task Jason
you'll see if you look closely all this
stuff got added so let's have another go
I don't know what it did it just did
some stuff
let's press that little green button
again you ready click and goes hello no
task runner is configured yeah oh sorry
so let's configure tasks runner so you
click on that and you go which tasks
runner well I know grunt is dead
gulp maybe close got that core choose
dotnet core okay so I'm not really sure
but let's give that a go okay let's
click this guy and ready bingo oh error
launch Jason must be configured that's
weird
you put that file there not me okay
so I'll open launch Jason who who who is
new to various code and can see what the
problem is one go we've got a hand put
your hand up if you through the problem
okay we got one so the rest are just
looking it's just you've got to have a
look here you'll see that the default
file is here so they should you know
autofill that correctly but anyway
you'll open the launch Jason at that
point in time and you'll start looking
through it you'll go whoa what's going
on here alright so there's the path I
better fix that up what else is here
we've got this order launch the browser
we can see well we've got a Windows and
OS X and Linux all looks pretty cool so
you'll learn a little bit about launched
Jason but then you get back to your work
after reading a few blogs on that stuff
and now we're ready to go forward so
let's update that path is now the right
dll project awesome dll and lets you
want to give this another go let's press
it one more time
quick run debug download dotnet core
debugger in command part so now you have
to find where the command palette is or
know the the right keystroke so you
close that and that is control shift P
you'll open this thing and you're right
download dotnet Cordy bugger great and
here we have it's downloading something
called Omni shop an omni shop I always
think this is awesome because this
wasn't created by Microsoft this was
created by a guy in Manchester his
name's Jason Emerson and he was a
developer at a company and just throwing
c-sharp code every day and he decided he
want to do his own little pet project
maybe a little startup so he goes home
but he said to me I did not want to feel
like I was at work so I built a Linux
machine and I made it look and feel
different so when I got home and I
started coding I didn't feel like I was
at work so he starts using vim and he's
because I cannot do this without
intellisense so I know a lot of normal
people would go back to visual steer but
this guy said I was right and rutan
intellisense
plugin so he wrote this intellisense
plug-in I can't imagine how long about
took Bowie writes some intellisense
plugin and then he read some blog of
someone using Emacs or something and
guess gee I wish Emacs had visiting
because I've written it you know what
I'll do I'll put it on github and I'll
let you use it as well and he wants to
call it
c-sharp everywhere but he's very
creative so he makes it the everywhere
the other way around and then he looks
up what everywhere means in Greek he
calls Omni sharp there you go he makes a
github project and from that point when
you put things up and github that they
make a life of their own and some dudes
in career who didn't even know start
making it work for sublime and it
becomes this awesome extension that
everyone's using their mics up here of
it five years later David Fowler and you
might see him around the truck this week
he gets hold of him and says you know we
want to use that thing too and it's kind
of a bit covert because they wanted to
use it in via code that I hadn't told
anyone about that so they kind of get
him to work on it in the Monaco
environment and then he changes the the
code of the compiler to Rosslyn at that
point and anyway that's how we got you
sorry about that transit engine all
right show you a you get this Omni
Sharpe thing and now we're ready to go
let's press it again you want to get
give it a go what work bingo so you're
pretty happy will it step into the
debugging yes it'll step into the dark
bugging and it's all good so now the
breakpoints work and so it's just the
same as this you just jump through a
hoop and the second hoop and a third
hoop and a fourth it right so let's try
that again so first to the dotnet core
environment and then the TAS run and
they update the DLL and download the
dotnet quarter bugger and we're good to
go
fantastic all right how many people here
are running the insiders version ends up
1 Delta 2 3 ok not many anyway
I encourage you to change that this is a
preview of version this the experience
is better in this it's a warning warning
only for real men ok it changes everyday
this is not for everybody
so let's go through here let's open that
let's do the exact same experience we
open it as soon as we open the c-sharp
file it goes automatically without doing
anything you don't even notice it it
says downloading package omni sharp now
you know what omni sharp is that's
happening it just auto detects all that
stuff and it knows we need the dotnet
core debugger as well downloads up it
gives some warning can I add some extra
assets to your project you
I guess so alright so you read that and
you go yep so it adds over on the
left-hand side launch Jason and tossed
up Jason and you'll notice remember
remember the problem we had with launch
Jason so if you look over here do we
have the same problem note you can see
that in launch dock Jason have update
the DLL to be the right name and auto
fills the part and it just works all
right
that's the insiders version and that's
just an example of the current thing so
you've always seen the old version just
some months behind be aware you can run
them side by side so I know there's only
three people here using it I would
encourage all of you to have been cited
version and the other version installed
all right and there's only one hoop
isn't it awesome
yes anyway all right so in summary it's
the in size version nicer experience
bleeding-edge daily releases and then
you need to grab the right extensions
now grabbing the right extensions makes
your react day or your angular day much
better okay
so how many people here are convinced
that they are going to be running this
code and the insiders version all right
3/4 most that's good let me tell you
about the right extensions
now you can Adam Stephenson and Duncan
Hunter have a whole session on all this
stuff so you can go and see them talk
about all this stuff I'm going to tell
you very quickly so you don't have to go
to the session all right these are all
the extensions you need angular language
service the typescript snippets the
angular 2 inline the switcher the
bracket peg colonizer colorizer alright
all these things eats them and just grab
the slides you're good to go
in addition who knows Johnny Papa Johnny
Pappa he's awesome you've got a follow
this guy he create an extension to get
all those extensions so you don't have
to know what I just told you just grab
be an angular accentual z-- who already
knew of this put your hand up you knew
three people
okay so this is awesome okay absolutely
awesome all right let's jump into 2017
2017 this is my favorite okay so let's
just do what we just did in 2017 file
new project and we choose asp.net call
now please ignore I don't know how much
stuff do this you see this icon like
most guys in mind in our company it
wouldn't matter what it said if it has a
VB icon next to it they're not clicking
anything no no it's just a little bug
but anyway so you click OK and now we
come into this web application Martin he
didn't laugh because he will actually be
still tell all this all right so are we
coming here and we create this project
this project that you're looking at is
exactly the same as what we just did
before this is the same files generated
by dotnet new - T Web it looks identical
except well there's a couple of changes
I guess Microsoft put some special
folders here and myself in visuals - you
hide things see this dot vs that's like
the secret settings they don't show you
I don't know dotnet developers don't
want to see that stuff and the villa's
code stuff is hidden and ya know if you
look from the bottom up it's the same
look anyway all right so so time to
debug let's try f5 directly missile work
oh just works ok that's visual stare for
it anyway drops into the debugging and
it's all good now
you might think why do people choose
vicious year and it's because there's so
much richness if your boss says how you
can you just deploy the azure police and
you don't you've never done that before
if you're envious code you've got a
world of pain working on all the right
command lines if you're a dotnet
development never done it you just come
in here and you go I don't know where do
I go publish I want to choose Asia are
there it is I click a sure does that
work create the profile what does that
mean oh this pops up or I'll just take
the defaults whatever that is bingo I've
just deployed look at the URL I'm just
deployed to Asia that's just an example
this
so much richness in vigeous year so
that's why I still think it's important
to do your c-sharp side and visuals to
you anyway that'll that'll probably
change all right so let's talk about my
second favorite feature here and that is
open folder inverse code you can go file
open folder okay that's normal right
it has taken visual co-team 16 years to
give us this file open folder and nobody
in always even impressed if I was doing
this in America everybody would be
cheering and you know oh well alright
okay
hide the police alright anyway you can
do visuals here for more than c-sharp
these days you can do it for all
languages and you just install the right
workload you're good to go
alright so let's go through this we've
talked about dotnet core being awesome
and open this folder I thought was
awesome you guys didn't think as awesome
at all but anyway let me go through my
next ones and these are the next ones
I'm going to run through I want to talk
about a quicker installer I want to talk
about lightweight solution loading
better intellisense better debugging
JavaScript and type script debugging and
chrome live unit testing code styling
okay and lots of language extensions and
I'm included heaps more in my
powerpoints for you alrighty so let's
talk about the quicker installer we have
this so you just you just install you're
good to go and in minutes you're up and
running depending on the workload so you
choose your workload most people will
choose I guess net or mobile or whatever
you're choosing and it's just a grouping
of components and you might choose uwp
Azure and web dev as an example and
you're good to go so I am going to say
one of these things here that where they
had 1900 votes
make it more lightweight put some
investment in the installer itself I
would consider that done but I'm curious
how many people here consider that done
and it's a great experience now
most a who's still not happy anyone
still not happy no one okay all right so
the other thing that's like
inconsequential but the updates are
rolling out quick have you noticed how
quick they are to install now now
they're extensions and stuff like we're
talking minutes and all these updates
that are coming regular are really good
I'm really impressed anyway all right so
the next one getting up and running
quick you get a fresh machine you
install Visual Studio
now you have to go through and install
your favorite extensions most people go
and get resharper productivity tools and
web essentials so we have this new
roaming extensions major so this will
basically in your login you keep all
your extensions so this is kind of how
it works in 2015 they gave us the
settings and the themes and the text
editor and your team Explorer stuff
would come through now the extensions
come through as well so they're kind of
rounded this feature set off I think
that's pretty good
next one people whinge about Visual
Studio taking too long to load and open
so want to one of Prague's that I'm a
programmer off is something called time
Pro it's a just a time Shing up which
allows you to enter your timesheets
in one go it pulls through everything
through from CRM or Salesforce or Visual
Studio comm and all that stuff
so this is kind of it's been an old
projects been around for a fair while
it's got 39 projects in it and when I
did the test in Visual Studio 2015 you
get 11 seconds to load and 36 seconds to
load the solution all right that's so
this is just my my testing my examples
so 2017 is it faster to load vicious
year 5 seconds so more than more than
twice as fast to load the solution is 26
second seconds all right all good
who's happy without improvement ok
all right quarter so hard to please I
have a bit more there is this little
thing here which is not on by default
you have to turn it on
and there's a couple of reasons it
probably wasn't on by default when it
was released it didn't fully work with
resharper and live unit testing and
things like that and there are cases
where some extensions are built but
don't work with this so I'm going to
tell you most of those problems have
been sorted out in the updates there's
pretty much one or two to go but it's
pretty good I'm going to tell you to
turn it on and let's look at the
performance now so I told you the 11 and
36 seconds and it went to five seconds
and 26 turn that feature on and let's do
it again
with that on it loads in five seconds
identical no difference to lows okay and
to load the solution is 15 seconds
that's that solution so that was for me
58 percent faster done process so just
turn that thing on and things will be
faster all right now the what kind of if
you if you open up solution and very
quickly open a folder it's not loaded
you'll see you know this Ajax style
loading alright okay great
so I am going to save for this one this
one is done alright so let's talk about
performance
so there's dodgy Chrome extensions right
what do you use for when you've got a
dodgy Chrome extension or a dodgy page
or whatever this guy okay
anyone ever go to this yeah if you've
got dodgy coffee that's a big deal in
Australia we have our own little app
it's called Ben hunter I came here tried
Ben hunter doesn't even work in this
country
nobody but bothers locking the quality
of the coffee here yes doesn't matter to
you guys alright anyway I think we have
too much time on our hands Steven
alright anyway what do you do if you've
got a dodgy
Visual Studio extension well you come in
here help me visual shear performance
why is this in the help menu it's just
the right menu I would have put this as
vicious to task manager or whatever and
it should be in the Tools menu yes
should be this is like going to Spotify
and going rock and roll
I'm finding Britney Spears okay alright
so choose that and that's what we see we
see if you know what I thought I would
see when I when this feature came out
because I often go to a lot of Deb's and
say won't you're running reach up I just
turned it off I had some is it something
with slow on my machine so just turn
that thing off okay and they're usually
the older guys that live before
resharper existed and I had to even like
Photoshop this up we notice the
extension resharper because I thought
this was going to be what would happen
but it hasn't for me as it happened for
anyone else so it has happened for some
okay but the only one iota typically you
have seen is you look at you open
vicious view we notice that a tool
window error list is slowing business
year and I haven't even opened a project
anyway I find that hilarious when I see
Microsoft exposing their own sins with
their own tools anyway so I would say
most of resharper you know I I don't
know the resharper guys but I assume
they're pretty happy with this feature
because there resharper is not being
blamed for things that is not its fault
I'm sure they don't mind being blamed
when they are being when they have got
performance issues but now they're not
so I'd say that's done all righty so
let's talk about better intellisense
refactoring and code analysis we've got
intellisense
we've got camel case matching now match
highlighting so if you just type you
notice that ets so I didn't have to type
amp time suggested so it just ETS let's
try that again
the ETS so you've got that camel case I
think that's kind of nice you've got
match Highline so if you can see the
difference here when we pop open the
intellisense see the intellisense and
see down the bottom we've got all the
filtering to the interfaces the methods
of fields you know so you've got that
does anyone actually use that yet see
when use it notice one yeah okay but
anyway we've got in
filtering on an intelligence now and
there's lots more stuff all the all the
new c-sharp 7 features just magically
give you assistance so I'm going to
consider this well
this were this has a thousand votes on
it I'm going to say half done and the
reason I say half done is I can't say
it's done until I can say you don't need
resharper anymore and that's not reality
alright so better DevOps and debugging
so we've got to run to click we've got a
exception helper and a better null
reference message so there's lots and
lots of cool stuff in here I just want
to show you this run to click stuff so
in the past you would set a lot of
temporary breakpoints hit f10 okay so
you click this f10 f10 f10 f10 f10 f10
yeah finger is now getting sawed with
f10 is everywhere and then you'd set
where you want your breakpoint to to go
to you come down here and this is kind
of the the typical way of working
alright so let's move forward and use
run to click so you won't need to worry
about you for getting breakpoints now
you just see this little green thing you
just click where you want it to go to so
let's have a go of this so it said a
little green thing you click there and
you go run so just run straight to it
you can inspect the variables you might
want to click somewhere else and then go
run it it's a nicer experience I think
alrighty so that's a summary no more
hitting temporary breakpoints you click
where you want and yeah who likes that
feature and thinks that they will use
that feature Wow alright that is awesome
that's almost everyone in the room ok
now I want to just tell you I've got a
few more things
I've got about five minutes to go let's
have a look here we have this see this
dialogue I actually never thought there
was a problem of his dialogue and I
never heard Mike stuff ever talk about
being something that they would invest
in but if you have a look at this it got
simpler I have my own suspicions that
some intern came in and said I
just looking at the stats you know did
you know that not a single dotnet
developer in history has ever clicked
any of these troubleshooting tips we
should we should make this simpler you
know the only thing they ever do is they
they copy the exception and then they go
over the Stack Overflow and search so
it's I think it's a little bit of a
story you know I wrote a I wrote a ten
page letter because I didn't have time
to write a one page so all right so
let's move on this is the new one and
it's much simpler I have a belief it is
almost perfect it needs one more thing
that's all I need and I believe that so
much I went and created a church second
revised suggestion so and look I had one
vote but I went down to Kristen's and
and they all they all believe this is a
good idea look I have 93 votes it is the
most important thing on user voice I am
just going to I have already tweeted it
but I will tweet it again for you guys
here's my oh can you reach it okay hello
Norway support my stack Oh actually I
should go stack overflow a stack
overflow suggestion for Visual Studio
there we go I should do business
together again all right all right
that should be good there we go I forgot
the hashtag sir
oh I'm not cool enough to the hashtags
people use hashtags just try hardest
hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag
all right so let's let's finish up I
just want to mention a couple of other
things wiki this is nothing to do with
anything
but Microsoft have always liked a good
wiki if you ask me in Australia you know
it's the land of bless Ian everybody
uses
once myself had one with with in
SharePoint it was an awesome Microsoft
bought this wiki agile extensions so
this thing which was built by a third
pay they bought and now they have a team
inside Microsoft working on it it's
pretty good but it's in Visual Studio so
it's you know we're using it we're
liking it I would encourage you to use
it but what I have done recently has
anybody who disliked user here hands
over your slack well I didn't expect
that eighteen room who's the Mike's of
teams user okay four or five our company
switched to Mike's up teams and it is
really good I am shocked
I should just go the team's just very
quickly but if I was to go into
somewhere this is risky but we'll go
somewhere so we're doing an internet if
you come here
so it's we've stopped using Skype and
Skype the business so we're using this
but it actually has a wiki in it as well
my tip for you is don't use the wiki
because they also have this notes one
and the notes is actually OneNote and
this one works offline on your mobile
devices of course because OneNote and
it's it's really good yeah so we've had
a great experience with this thing I'm
really surprised the team that developed
this is really switched on oh I've got
to tell you a tip I was just talking to
Adam Stevenson this morning didn't know
he opens incognito window you guys open
incognito because he one type of his
personal authentication details into
Visual Studio comm or something he
didn't know about started sorry to shame
you Steven I shouldn't do that but see
this he didn't know that you can come
click on this and many your different
users like this but who uses this
feature one two three four five six all
right the rest of you this is the
hottest tip of today you don't open
incognito ever you don't need that you
just have one set of cookies essentially
your personal and one for your work and
one for like we have an info account and
all that stuff anyway there you go
there's a hottest tip of today anyway so
so what do they miss well they didn't
give us these transform things that I
mentioned before they didn't give us
that one they didn't give us the non
nullable reference types they didn't do
anything to do with Windows 10 Universal
apps in this case they didn't give us
sam'l debugging okay so in summary I
think we've seen a fair bit we talked
about a hit some history we talked about
how cornet core is and vicious geocodes
you've got lots of cool extensions there
and I took you through my favorite
Visual Studio 2013 features if you want
to get in contact with me I'm happy to
receive emails if you want the
presentation or stuff like that just
send me an email it also be up on the
bit on the site I've got some links I'll
put in the PowerPoint for instance some
important links I care a lot about
DevOps and stuff so a lot of them and I
relate to that we run a fiber camp six
weeks online if you're interested in
that you can get it we also run SSW TV
which is free so tweet your favorite
feature support my stack overflow thing
I have some posters on the links I've
given you to download all supporting
DevOps now so that was the old one it
now supports DevOps all right
thank you guys
