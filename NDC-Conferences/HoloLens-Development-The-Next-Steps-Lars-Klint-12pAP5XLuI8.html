went all quiet on your own must be three
o'clock we better shut up that's amazing
just a bit of disclaimer does anyone
here come last year and saw my talk and
hollands oh cool alright because this is
not quite the kind of a continuation of
that so I won't really be talking about
much I talk about back then so that's
good for the rest of you yeah tough luck
I will do a bit of a quick overview in
it so I live in Australia and it's a
nice place I don't know if anyone's been
there who've interest-rate anyone anyone
yes one person it's quite nice and we do
like visitors
you know tourism is a big part of
Australian economy which is why we have
appropriate warnings for our visitors
now has anyone here ever seen a drop
bear alright because if you said yes you
would have been lying because you would
have been dead they mainly attack
tourists which is why we kind of put
these warnings up for some reason they
understand what the tour is what a
tourist is now I realize it's summer in
Oz oh yeah if you have anyone ever
experienced an Australian summer right
yet a couple of people because it kind
of looks kind of like this right and you
you just get used to it I mean I'm
Danish by birth so I the first four days
of over 40 degrees is kind of annoying
and then you just can't get used to it
right so another thing that most people
don't know about Australia is that we
have snow no this is not no way this is
about 90 minutes from my house this is
what it looks like kind of right now
anyone knew that and you can go skiing
in Australia it's kind of cool but we
have everything including drop is so
today I will go through some of these
things so I'll just do a quick overview
so that we know kind of where we are get
a common starting ground okay I'll talk
about something called the hollow
toolkit and how that can make our life a
lot easier if we do want to develop for
the hololens we talk about gestures and
more sort of India
gestures voice commands which is kind of
a crucial element that people forget
about as in spatial audio and then we'll
talk about spatial mapping and then
finally testing because no one likes
doing testing see hum right and ones
that yes and testing for whole ands a
little bit different it's not that
simple because we can't really do unit
test and that sort of stuff so I'll show
you kind of a few tips and tricks and
how we can test violence which is as
important as any other software
application okay um if you have
questions and I know in the region
audiences love to ask questions it's
your favorite thing please just raise
your hand or yell out or you poke the
breeze guy next to you or the Australian
across the next aisle just so they can
ask the question for you okay I'm going
to keep going at you until you start
asking questions by the way and if you
are on the Twitter's if you follow me
I'll you know magically tweet more
information about what I'm talking about
as I'm talking about it okay I have an
implant here that goes straight into
Twitter alright so a quick overview of
what we're actually looking at so as
anyone here developed for hololens has
anyone built just anything basic app
whatever might be one times two okay so
that's like two or three people okay
cool this is probably good then I go
through this there are five main things
we need to know
the first one is gays gays is kind of
where you look it's not your eyes at
your head right so your head is your
mouse cursor which is very confusing to
start with but as you move your head
there's a cursor in front of you in the
hole and experience that kind of moves
with you right
that's called gaze it's how you select
things how you look at things how you
interact with certain objects or
whatever might be the next thing we have
is gestures there are essentially two
gestures one is blooms car like this
root kind of like a flower and that
closes the app or it brings up the Start
menu and the other gesture is like this
tap that's doing to you to know and
this is tap right this is not tap this
is not tap you know that's not that
what's that just that you know simple
don't try to make it harder than it
should be the third thing in this in the
input which is called ggv because it's
gaze gesture and voice is voice commands
and it's incredibly powerful it's really
really really accurate because most
people will maybe not have bought one of
these because there's stupid expensive
still so you are stuck with the emulator
and energy works just fine for the voice
recognition is through the mic on your
computer so it's not a representation of
how it works in this the voice
recognition of the voice commands on
Holland is incredible it's the best I've
ever seen so that's something to bear in
mind and it's part of your input right
because it might not make sense to have
you know tap tapping gets boring real
quick let me promise um so you might
wanna have gestures our voice
recognition or voice commands you can
always say select it's the same as tap
you can always say a something that's on
the screen it's kind of like see it say
it so if there's a command that's you
know a global under button or under Neos
every movie window you can just say
remove you don't have to tap on a right
and it's a nice shortcut and then you
have custom cards as well which we'll
look at in a little bit the fourth thing
is sound spatial sound it's using
something called the head related
transfer function which we'll get to in
a minute but sound is really important
and it's very easy to implement and very
hard to get right so we're going to
spend some time on this as well and of
course we have spatial mapping this is
what makes hololens hololens without
spatial mapping there wouldn't be any
mixed reality experience at all okay so
we look a lot more that as well and yeah
I know you kind of sitting there going
yeah whatever just show us this thing
working am i right against the way okay
so that's the fundamentals of hololens
development as those five things you
need to have in your experience for it
to make any sense to be convincing to be
engaging to be immersive even have
questions okay
I'm going to go get questions you're not
going to get out I'm going to close the
doors okay
now the first thing I want to talk about
is this thing called hollow toolkit and
the whole toolkit is it's like your best
friend when you make when you make
Hollande's or mixed reality applications
it's essentially what is a github repo
as you can see there there's one for
unity one for visual studio so in case
you hadn't so I didn't mention that but
you use unity to create your model your
scene and then you export that into
visual studio to do any kind of coding
and deploy it so that's kind of the
workflow whole toolkit has come from
Microsoft so it's an open source project
now by Microsoft and they used it
predominantly for these two games now I
keep saying these anywhere again that I
don't think Harlan's is a gaming device
at all the thing it's for industries for
education it's for healthcare but the
best mixed reality experiences we have
right now are games right and these are
two of them one of them is called
fragments and it's where your memory
detective that needs to find memory
clues and it essentially Maps you of
room using spatial mapping and it shows
clues as audio-visual your voice
whatever might be that you would expect
in a normal a normal experience and
their memory fragments that's why it
games called fragments right so you see
memory fragments that you need to reduce
and decipher the other one is young
conquer does anyone ever play conquer
back in the day a little squirt in its
ear that's good there's a couple of guys
here Congo's a little squirrel guy the
one that's jumping around there and he
collect gold coins and he does stuff at
his solves puzzles but in this case he
jumps around your living room alright so
he'll jump on your furniture and he'll
chase coins underneath your couch and go
behind everything and you know come out
the wall would be a zip on the wall
eagerly and it comes out like it's
really cool alright so how do they do
all this this is where the hollow
toolkit came in
so they realized that they needed
certain things over and over and over
again to build these Holland's
applications when you do spatial mapping
you just get a grid and we'll get a lot
more into spatial mapping but you just
get a grid it doesn't tell you where
your couch is doesn't tell you where you
throw is it doesn't tell you where your
ceiling is you got to figure that out
yourself
so the asobo studio is in Paris I think
in Paris but certainly in France and
Microsoft came up with this toolkit they
could identify walls for you can
identify couches based on saying out
there's a flat surface with another flat
surface that must be somewhere you can
sit for example so in the fragments game
the commander-in-chief or the top lady
will come in and sit next to you on your
couch right all the goggles you know I
heard a story the other day I was crying
I didn't know this would happen but they
were playing fragments in an apartment
where they didn't have any chairs or you
know sofas where they were playing it
but they had this kind of kitchen bench
thing that they would normally just kind
of jump on and sit on like no Micah do
you sit there right that's what you did
the character came in and jumped on this
thing to see it because a parent that
was the only place you could sit so it
works really well there's a few more
features in it there's a project set up
so if every time you create a new hole
in the application that's a bunch of
stuff you need to go through like you
means to set the background is black
because black is transparent that's
where you don't render it you need to
set the virtual reality capability you
need to there's a whole bunch of things
in settings that and it's like a
checklist and you forget half of all the
time
so they just made a little shortcut to
set it all up for you there's lots of
tooling like I said around spatial
mapping how to deduce what things are
there's a sharing library so part of the
story with Hollande's which is not
widely used because you need more than
one expensive enough to buy one but
there's a sharing experience where you
can share experience with Holograms
holographic experiences through a server
and if there's a bunch of tooling that
allows you to do that easier and then
there are a hundred thousand million
scripts each or the next accountant
there's a lot of scripts and these are
scripts that allows you to do all
different manner
things shortcuts to something people
have found out how to do it could be you
know put your assets putting curses on
the screen you know putting other visual
assets on the screen or audio or
anything like that there's lots of
different kinds of assets and scripts in
there okay so maybe we just have a look
at what how it works thing so I have
unity open here now generally you want
has anyone ever seen units before okay
excellent there's a few people so this
is the point where you see I can't see
unity okay come on geez here we go okay
th people so unity is for those who
don't know is is a game creator game
design engine it's used traditionally
for 2d and 3d games because Holograms
are 3ds hologram overall and experiences
are 3ds this has become the de-facto
tool that you use so you can use other
tooling but you will probably end up
sitting in the corner rocking because
it's it's so integrated now that it's
almost impossible to use anything else
okay so the thing you would normally do
is you go to assets here you import a
package and you just say custom package
before this you would have downloaded
this unity package from the github
repository and this I've handedly placed
here on the desktop Jolla toolkit the
unit's package now I'm not going to do
it now because it takes a couple of
minutes to important everything so I've
already done it but it is what is it 96
megabytes of things that you might want
to use
so I've imported it here it gives you a
new menu up here now it's a little bit
small perhaps but I cut me in a bigger
because unity so have configured buttons
here apply whole and seen settings so
that's what if I click on that it'll say
move camera to origin because the camera
and unity is it is your eyes in a whole
lens world so normally if you're
building a game you'll have the camera
of sort of pointing at your player so
you can see it from the outside it's
kind of third-person hololens is always
first person because if
you've tried if you place the camera
meter to the left of where the users
looking oh boy they're going to throw up
all all your living room it's very very
confusing you know camera case the black
so I set transparency updating your
clipping planes so there's something
called near clipping how close do I get
to Holograms before they disappear
before they're not rendered anymore the
default and unity is two cloves for
Harlan's it's like they're in your face
which may be okay in some scenarios but
by default Sony's and and then update
the field of view and you can apply
those and so on and these are things
that you will normally go and spend time
figuring out which menu was it in
because you want to do it when you start
a new project right now you configure
something else in project settings
Target Windows Store you WP this runs
Windows 10 by the way in case you didn't
know which means it runs with Universal
Windows platform apps which are the very
very clever apps that no one gives a
 about okay there's also what my
windows phone runs yes I'm one of them
but it's important because it allows you
to build stuff that runs across Windows
10 platform and your target and you said
and yeah other settings that I won't
going to now so because it has that the
whole toolkit has that which is quite
cool it saves you a lot of time but then
also down here is all these assets
massive amount of assets so I've just
chosen scripts and cursor here for
example if you want to have a cursor so
you've got to build it yourself where
the user looks in your app doesn't come
free but almost does because this script
short so you can have you know mesh
cursor or standard cursor or an animated
cursor it comes with all of these
tooling for free and you can see that on
the right hand side you can see the
script that you otherwise will have to
write right so might not fit exactly
your purpose but it is adapt but it
saves you heaps of time it's if you're
building anything for hololens
use this okay any questions for whole
toolkit not all once please okay really
so you know everything about it now good
ok yes
so yes so question is its runs Windows
10 so is it not tethered I guess is the
the question yeah so now that there's no
wires coming off it
if you ever done a virtual reality
experience like oculus or something like
that you need like a nuclear reactor
next to you to run it right it's
massively power intent of computing
senses and there's a big plug that comes
into your head there's now that this is
it this as it comes full of computing
device yep see you got question sea-ice
broken yes good question actually yep
so see if I'm not sure I have internet
connection but there is so is there a
way to download this easier that that
package that unity package doesn't come
out of the blue like that
I think it's hello blue to kid if you
search for hold tool collect toolkit as
your website's my good friend Jimmy
angstrom from Sweden has built and an
automated thing that just updates it so
every time there's a push to a new
version on get on github it pushes out
the the unity package for this in just
downloaded so there's not an actual
package manager you probably could set
up some sort of build script or
something if you want to it's not
difficult alright so that was how I'll
talk it today keep that works alright
the next thing is gestures so we talk to
gestures is bloom in the tap but you can
extend the tap as well so you can do a
hold which is hold your tap and you can
sort of hold it that's a different event
that triggers in the framework if you
hold it if you don't let go you can do a
manipulation so that's again kind of
hold and start moving either vertical
vertical or horizontal to deplane and
that becomes a manipulation and then you
can do navigation which is again a whole
and kind of a 3d navigation we've had a
joystick and 3d cube type thing right so
you can move it in all directions
so those three also come for free you
get those out of the framework and then
usually the question I get is well can
you build your own gesture yes yes you
can please don't there's two reasons for
that
one is that you need the raw input of
what the fingers are doing and then you
need to decipher that yourself and that
will probably drive you insane
I'm imagining it's a bunch of mathematic
that I have no idea how to do the other
thing is that how do you educate your
user and saying hey there's a new swipe
gesture or a new whatever gesture it
might be how do they know and why would
they know because every single other
hololens app will only have tap and
bloom and holes and whatnot alright so
yes you can I haven't done it I don't
plan on doing it but yeah you can so
okay let's have a look at gestures you
can see it still okay so this is a
Microsoft example from the second level
tutorials called Astro man he's the guy
that was on the opening slide as one and
Astro man is a guy that floats in space
there you go very exciting and it has a
bunch of character comes with it I'm
just going to show you where it
implements the different new gift
gestures that you might not have been
familiar with so in here there's a
gesture manager and this these are
scripts that I attached in high end
unity to the different elements right
that's how you kind of make you to talk
to your scripts is you
I'm just going here to see it so I have
the script here I'll just grab it and
drag it up to whatever object I want to
put on and I just let go and that's it
is now attached right and then that
becomes a script that's initialized when
that object is initialized and it's
refreshed when that object is refreshed
and so on so this script is attached to
a part of astro-man
and in here we have a good of it on a
wake
so this when we're waking a astro-man
we're sending out a bunch of different
events and this is my aim with this is
just to show you that it's not very
scary if you've done any kind of c-sharp
development this should look quite
familiar they're just standard events
that you bind to and that you attach an
event listener to right so if I just so
that share a bit more so we have a
tapped event which we knew before so
that triggers this event we have it
navigation start an event and so on and
so on right if you go to one and say
navigation updated events I'll just hit
f12 and get brains goes yep anyone come
on there we go oh that was nice not
useful
I think someone screwed up my shortcuts
so we go to implementation ah lovely
then okay I know it's Danny somewhere
okay so here navigation updated event
all we're doing is that we're rotating
astro-man essentially right so we're
setting is navigating the true so we've
got a flag saying we'll be navigating it
up and then we're just setting this
navigation position to the relative
position which we get from the event
right so the event is telling us where
we navigating to in 3d space so it's
tracking all that we're just getting a
unity object which is the vector 3
object and that's the relative position
just said that this is how easy it is
like once you get your head around some
of these object types and constructs
it's really not a lot to it the hard
thing we'll get to that that's designed
everything implementation is not
terribly difficult of course I say that
now and you start approaching go mom
but there's always things that kind of
ordinary but generally there's nothing
magic to it it's c-sharp code and it
looks kind of like you would attach
events to wind farms right just seeing
it which ones will ooh there you go so
there's that's navigation at all of them
I like that they have a if you can
continue as and hold the whole starte
hold update and hold end or cancel the
same of navigation and manipulation and
I think that's hard questions anything
because it's kind of simple and I'm
building it up and there was much to it
all right let's have a look at Esther
man how he does it now the MU now is a
little bit small because the resolution
and my computer is quite large and
because Windows 10 dpi is stuff like
that if I press the start button a
windows button here brings up the Start
menu and I'll show you that on Holland's
as well and that has I've deployed a
little app in here called model Explorer
which are Astra man that's last romantic
and we'll place it there so that's the
emulator if you hadn't seen that already
the emulator is the closest you get to a
physical hole and survives for that
owning one and that seemed to a crash
dragon
it has spatial map that's not working
it has spatial mapping it has network
indication runs hyper-v so it's kind of
a zone machine it works almost the same
as a Hollande's but of course it's much
more fun to have a real one right you
can load rooms into it that you've met
with a physical device you can log into
a Microsoft account you can deploy
things to it it works kind of like a
real device I'm just trying to apply
that again any questions on this
emulator anything yes
yes yeah so the up so you mean the in
this case astro-man
yeah because they the script is attached
to him yeah so you get you that's
tomorrow you're kind of interacting with
yeah
okay let me just try this again and it
doesn't work then you wait for him okay
no not ever I don't know what I'm not
going to debug right now
it worked about an hour ago okay it's
not that interesting I'll show you on
here anyway so it'll be better okay so
the next thing we want to talk about
really to do go there we go
is voice command and as I said the voice
recognition on this is really good
really really really accurate it's not
perfect absolutely is not perfect but
it's the best I've tried on any device
you can do pretty much anything with
voice commands there's a lot of how
should I put this there's a lot of easy
ways to make it not work very well but
once you get it right once you get the
speech design right you kind of yeah
this is the hard part the speech design
is what I struggle with a lot because
you how do you make your users aware
that there's a voice command how do they
know to say a thing right what actions
can you actually take through speech
because how do you know how do you
figure is it everything like is it every
single tap thing you can do you want to
do that as speech or other things you
can only do this through speech kind of
what how do you define those and you
need to really think about these things
if speech input a good option for
completing a task like doesn't make
sense and it does if it saves you you
know six taps or whatever then it's a
good thing how does the user know when
speech is available obviously they say
it see it say it so if you label things
and they can see it there will be more
inclined to say it but you need
sort of tutorial or training mechanism
to let your users know right is the app
always listening because by default that
is so are you going to have voice
commands that only work in certain
circumstances then you need to kind of
think about that and what phrases
initiate an action or behavior because
it's really easy I have to do a workshop
on harland's as well and we build this
thing where you shoot balls and blocks
and if they fall down and we implement
voice commands and it's very very easy
to think you should use shoot so you
just go choo choo choo choo choo
pinnacle particular tool but is too
short because different dialects say
differently like the Norwegian earrings
are different the Danes English and so
on or the English English or the real
English which is Australian and you much
more likely to get a good response if
you say shoot ball because it's two two
three four syllables it has context and
it the voice recognition will pick it up
much easier what's the interaction
dialogue because sometimes you might
want context something can only happen
if you've done something else again it's
an education issue but it's also a
programmatic issue right if you need
context between your voice commands and
its network connectivity required I
always put that on there because as you
develop you always have network
connectivity and then suddenly you do
some voice command that requires it it
goes but boom no the whole length does
not require connectivity to to do the
voice recognition but your command might
do something ok so I'm just going to
give you a quick demo here yeah now bear
with me for a second while I open a
different solution that will work and
will deploy that to the emulator now
this is the other tutorial that
Microsoft does it's called origami this
is where you start it's a kind of
starting point but I'll just I'll show
you the voice command in here because it
I know this one works I hope and this is
a kind of a maybe an hour's worth hour
and a half worth maybe if you just go
through the toy real quick and that
gives you a good understanding of how
you start building for Hollande's it's a
little bit rudimentary but that's ok
let's be
so let's deploy this second once a
couple up as anyone does any kind of
voice recognition work on the Android or
iPhone or like have you tried
integrating with Cortana on Windows 10
no yeah and experience the hard thing is
making your user again so I was this
gentleman he said he's done it with
katana but getting someone to say that
specific sentence you need is hard the
education part of this is really
difficult and I think we're here so so
we can deploy it to use the holders up
to the emulator so we're going to start
up the emulator again or load it on
there so this is origami and paper
folding it's very exciting
I'll see this works it should work with
the mic on my computer let's see I'm
just going to see what we just wait on
this so this is kind of a you know Plan
B here because the other one didn't work
and something like katana works as well
if you ever done any integration work
with Cortana I've done a couple of
presentations on it you'll find that
it's whoops not that it's exactly the
same made that you need voice command
definition files and stuff like that to
integrate your hololens app to katana
and you can use katana to launch your
app and everything okay so we've got
origami on here just place that there
wow it's all broken I'm guessing the
emulator has done something wrong okay
is it often a problem it can be I mean
ideally I would restart it now but that
would just boil the hell out of you
because it takes a little long you're
just going to take my word for it I'll
do Roy's commands when I put this on in
a second so it's not like going to be
self but yeah the emulator is is
reasonably stable normally and I started
it up and test it all before I got up
here for obviously and now doesn't yeah
I can't do anything about that let's
talk about spatial audio
and then we'll get to the cool stuff all
right
so spatial audio is one of those things
that get neglected because audio is hard
although for this device is using
something called the head related
transfer function and it's really easy I
always have to know this there's nothing
to it this is what I what I found on
Wikipedia and it's a bunch of
mathematics that I have no idea what
means I think on the right there does
this circle which recommends r1 r2 of
the ears or the head of a person and
then the sound is that the green line
right but that's as far as I got
what it means is it's a binaural
algorithm that measures how sound should
reach your ears let's and right
so if I have sound wearing to Holland's
and I have a hologram over there to my
right the sound I hear will appear as if
those sound to my right it's really
accurate if I turn my head and look at
it it'll appear as if it's in front of
me alright so the sound is in super sync
by it's very very accurate and very very
convincing but you can screw it up no
problem if you if you want to with your
audio design and this I like this slide
much better because that kind of shows
what happens as in you don't have to do
any work to implement head related
transfer function you just drag an audio
file onto your 3d object mmunity and
hooray you're done which is why
designing for it is much harder it's
again like voice we got to talk about
design of audio because this is
important ideally we already know how to
implement it now because it was the talk
last year there are a few different
elements that you need to take into
account grounding so grounding for audio
it means that the audio that you apply
to something should tell the user kind
of where it is right if you go to see a
hologram and if you can't see them you
still be able to cognitively know where
it is that's the idea with grounding so
if I'm you know got a safari whole lens
experience and there's a line over I
want to align them it's not looking at
it I want to know
so the grounding of that with audio is
very important user attention if you
have say in a game again I'll come back
to games because
easy to explain you need to use
attention to look at something to you
know a clue or an enemy or whatever
might be you can use audio to guide them
right you'll instinctively look at a
sound that's over there when you can't
see it that works very well then you
have immersion which is a big part of
this obviously you want realistic
physical sounds that match the object
that you have to make the merge the
immersive experience as convincing as
possible and then you need interaction
design so you need to understand how
people interact with audio and this is a
whole other talk audio is terribly
complex and really difficult to get
right something that I personally just
don't like a low that is background
music especially on these Holland's up
because it's there all the time you
can't escape it right and it just gets
on your nerves and it's loud it's
overpowering you just I just can't have
it so to me something like background
music is just no no I'll have
environmental sounds sure a car passing
or whatever it might be that's fine or
wind blowing but please don't do that
with the music it just gets some people
as usual well that's a nice tune here
for two minutes if you do it for two
hours no it's not nice it's just really
really annoying or your tips use gas
mixing which means highlight objects
when you look at objects give them a
sound and so now if you don't have
haptic feedback so if you look at
something maybe good people kind of know
I am looking at it you know just some
sort of feedback and audio whoops sorry
the means of that audio haptics is yo
you know why just sit sorry
and then again immersion you need these
sounds to make people feel like the
experience is convincing you want to
convince people that what you showing
them is real that's the whole idea
that's why we can see the real world
through it right ideally they wouldn't
even know that their digital assets of
course you know but the experience is
like you forget and they just become
part of the real well that's your aim
okay questions on audio before we get to
the really cool stuff yes
poor audio and well the audio is only on
your ears so it doesn't actually do that
so sorry the question was how do you
take into account if there's like an
echo normally like with a closed open
door and sound travels and all that sort
stuff you can't really do that unless
you program for it maybe yes so if you
close the door there's a muffled of
sound it doesn't yet like it doesn't
have that capability yet but that's a
good point because that is part of what
I hope is being worked on because we
know when the door closes right because
we've got spatial mapping right we know
where things out now this is the cool
part this is kind of what I was now
rushing towards well not really
spatial mapping is a bunch of triangles
a whole lot of them like a lot I did a
mapping of my living room slash kitchen
kind of you know combined area type
thing and I'd spent maybe 15 minutes on
it just walking around looking at
everything and I explore the model and
it was about 400,000 triangles pretty
detailed right it's not like I tried in
January
I tried mapping a toy character with
Steve's that said no that didn't work
that becomes a blob right it's not that
accurate but it's accurate enough so I
can easily see where everything is and
I'll show you in just a second so they a
few different things you need to know
about spatial mapping and how you use it
because if you don't have spatial
mapping you have not got a mixed reality
experience simple as that and the reason
it's kind of glazed paths in comparison
to the other four elements you know gaze
gesturing voice and audio is that this
kind of almost comes for free like
you're not meant to understand how to
calculate a 3d model or anything like
that but it does allow you to do
something like placement so placement of
things making them real making them sit
on a table like if you have a valve the
flowers you put him on the table but you
can place things on
this is on the wall right here you can
put your net fix view on the wall and
resize it you can place things around a
pollution which is a really fancy way of
saying hiding stuff so you can you know
where couches are you can have things
run behind the couches underneath chairs
on top of chairs whatever it might be
right
occlusion can hide part of a hologram
and you can see that quite easily if you
play something like you know the
hologram app you play something behind a
chair something it disappears when you
can't see it in real view it works very
well as part of this convincing
experience right
oops sorry by the way we we have physics
we want to make sure that models look
like they would behave in the real world
right this whole thing of ragdoll effect
and all that kind of this the tracks
from it like you don't want to have over
exaggerated physics or well maybe if
you're doing a moon landing kind of
experience yeah maybe you want to have
people jump around funny but it's
unlikely so make sure that the physics
of this is adhered to and you apply
appropriate you know laws of physics to
your to your elements because the
spatial mapping will allow that
navigation as I said you can run around
conquer exactly does that he runs around
your living room he runs behind your
furniture he jumps on your chairs and
you know he goes everywhere because he
knows exactly where things are um I
really want to show you how this works
so okay let's have a look so this is the
developer portal looks like this and now
I'm going to look like an idiot I mean
I'm going to put this on it's not a good
look all right
so give me a one second watch it flies
up so I now is trying to map your
surroundings and I go to start menu so
let's close that so if I map here so I
can tap anywhere and it'll kind of
automatically try and map the area right
I'm just going to go away from the light
of it because it gets confused with the
light there you go
okay so if I do that in front row I'm
tapping on you who you like that if
occur the 3d view here you can see this
thing in here removes with my head right
let me see yeah
so I can zoom in on me route map yeah
lets me come in so look down from above
a bit and then if I click update here
magic happens yeah does the model are
just made alright so I haven't met very
much so if I just spend two minutes or
two seconds just going around here
because the the range of this is about
five meters so I have to kind of move a
little bit towards people and then
eventually we'll have more people mapped
none of you will play a couch apparently
no okay and I just click update again
right again so now we got a bigger model
and this is now 24,000 triangles so
24,000 different elements for this and
this is what you get for free is kind of
it's not instant I guess it really maps
everything it's sort of every 10 seconds
or so without me doing anything so move
over here it should kind of you know
texting and this is kind of what you
have to to build upon so this is why I
say nothing works unless you have
spatial mapping now in here and the
tooling there's a few different things
you can do I could do a first-person
view let's make you see we're looking at
which is nice for testing things so
there's my computer obviously and
there's something called spatial anchors
which is how you anchor elements in real
world this is probably a good point just
to explain how the coordinates work for
this device now I'll show you a lot more
of this in just a minute all right let's
see I'll shoot up and stuff there's
a core so for virtual reality you have
one coordinate system if you ever done
anything virtuality you kind of live
within this coordinate system of the
world that's where we play stuff you
know exactly where everything is you can
place things in relation to each other
and all that we're not that lucky with
Oh move down we're not that lucky with
hololens right because we don't know
exactly where we are it has to map the
space first so we have one coordinate
system so 3d coordinate system for what
the spatial mapping is but then because
it's not hundreds inaccurate
what if I place say I play something on
the chair
next year now see Congress's do I need
to make sure that conker keeps sitting
there next to you as I move if I move
around and the character starts moving
or fluttering the whole experience is
out the window
it looks like it's not real so in order
to do that you place what's called
spatial anchors on your elements and
they anchor the objects own coordinate
system to the world coordinate system
using the spatial model all right I'm
glad I didn't have to program this part
it is very complex but it means that you
have physical objects that you bind
digital objects to so they stay with
that object and this is really important
it's really important to make sure that
this works correctly and that's kind of
what they spent five years doing because
as soon as you have a character as I
said before that starts you know
drifting or flickering or doing anything
that doesn't look real then you've lost
them all you make people throw up or
even worse mmm all right any questions
for spatial mapping that's a good
question so you can derive objects from
this model yes you can get that data out
the whole toolkit allows you to do a
bunch of these without you having to
code it so that's where as my walls
where as my floor ceilings furniture
doorways stuff like that but yeah you
can I mean know how to figure out where
a person is because they always look
different right you know there's
different sizes sitting standing leg
over one other legal and all that stuff
but yeah you can yes is there any
interaction with GPS I had this question
this morning and I was I suddenly wasn't
sure I don't think there's DPS in it
because I don't see why I would use it
the thing is though if I place a
spaceship in here and then the model
doesn't change the room doesn't change
over the next two months I come back the
spaceship is still in here it'll know
where that was right it has a world
anchors which is part of unity but it
actually not sure fast GPS I don't think
it does anywhere else yep
if you're sharing the view with two
Holland's they don't share the 3d model
as far as I know they share the
experience so to do a sharing experience
you need to have a server that all the
holo lenses talk to and that server kind
of distributes the experience and where
people are as well and I have not tried
it because again it requires more than
what Harlan's but I've talked to people
that done it about eight people that
works really well yes so is there a
real-time update of the environment as
in their continuous mapping is that we
asking it's not live live because I'm
guessing the battery go just drain
really fast but I'm it's something like
every 10 seconds 20 seconds maybe if you
sort of calculate every 20 seconds
you're probably right which shows why
sometimes it happens that when people
walk past you and it Maps right as they
walk past you get this sort of ghost
effect and there's it's mapped something
that's not there so that does happen
here but it's not it's not a habit life
see you can ask questions yeah good yes
if their limit to the size of the
spatial mapping maybe memory not that I
know of my house is reasonably sized
it's can country Australia which is
build and bigger and that was no problem
that was about a half a million
triangles to foreigners out and
triangles or something
it's quite large but I'm sure there is a
limit I just don't know what it is all
right cool so and before we get on to
the testing so the real cool thing which
I'll show you we do the testing because
no one cares about testing it's really
you're supposed to yes I do yes GP on I
know it's Friday afternoon I just won't
be as well testing in hololens is bit
peculiar it's a little bit interesting
because it's not like testing normal
software normal stuff a 2d software if
you test your web app more you test your
libraries and you
intubation tests and they're all run and
all that you can't quite do that yes you
can you answers to your larger business
logic but what about the actual models
and everything that you do
so there's another set of testing which
is called environmental testing and this
is I would say equally important
something like it doesn't do well in
sunlight it's not really outdoor device
because sunlight kind of just screws it
up
UV and UV makes chaos that maps with UV
sunlight does UV doesn't work so you
want to Maine to do it inside but
something like what about a dimly lit
room it doesn't work very well in
complete darkness but a room like this
is really good except for the lights
going the bright lights so you've got to
test that Demi like what if you have red
light what if you're really really
bright light everywhere whatever it is
that the environment is that you might
want to use this app in sound ambient
noise spatial audio make sure that you
actually can use the spatial ready
efficiently this is I would really
emphasize the sound testing users
they'll move in mysterious ways and you
get short people tall people you know
you know get people with four fingers I
don't know no people different right and
they use it in different ways so make
sure you put it on different people's
heads and begin to move the head
differently up and down in sideways and
everything and then the physical
environment because we live in the real
world right we don't have a virtual
reality world where we can you know make
even meet it is just the real world so
what about curved walls how do you deal
with curved walls is that going to work
what if you have a flat thing that needs
to sit on that curved walls that going
to look ridiculous
all these sort of things that you don't
have during development you really need
to take care of in testing and then
there's a really cool tool that is
relatively new called perception
simulation and I'll give you a quick
demo of it but it is essentially taking
over either the emulator or the real
device you can use it on both and
simulating the perception of the user so
what the user is doing and seeing
nothing and moving how they're moving
and what they what they're doing so I'll
show just what that looks like because
this is a really neat tool and
I have not still not seen anyone use it
properly or for any apps but I could be
wrong so let's go to perception
simulator hint it's really quite simple
you import a couple of dll's here
there's a perception simulation manual
dealer that needs to be part of project
not a reference and then you have a
couple of references here the perception
simulation manager interrupts and a
perception simulation rest the intro
obviously you can communicate with the
device you insert the device IP which is
from the emulator in this case let me
just check because the emulator does
change once in a while so just make sure
that's the right one before we do
anything so I click on the tools here I
can look at the network and I can see
that my IP is that and that looks a
little bit different doesn't it did you
run to your name see it's different from
that so we'll just know I couldn't taste
it oh there we go we paste that and now
I have a access point to my emulator I
don't need any credentials for them you
just open because it's on my machine
anyway and then we've I scroll down here
we said I would bring a bunch of steps
so this is your manager so we get the
envy of the manager of the perception
manager human right-hand perform gesture
so essentially I'm doing a gesture which
is home I'll do that twice and then I
rotate my head so I'm looking in some
direction then I perform another gesture
finger press finger reach that's a tap
right and so on that's all you can do
this what this means that you can do the
exact same thing over and over and over
again which you can't do with a human
because everybody you can't do the same
movement twice that's impossible so this
is a really neat tool for testing your
app with a predefined set of actions and
gestures so if I run this I'm going to
be quick though it's going to fire up
the console up
it's sick to distribute so okay and go
it brings up the mess I'm not touching
anything takes top menu down moves tips
and so right you get the idea
it's really easy to use and you can use
it on the physical device as well then
it takes over the input that you would
normally give it they will come from you
and that's it never done very simple
thing really but it's really powerful
and you can set this up and automated
and run it on some machine with emulator
and whatever you want to do okay any
questions for that testing does it make
sense how yeah you think so is there
insist or you're saying is there no unit
this or is this a unit test it could be
although you need to set up the start
and same every time obviously but you
could have that as starting the app
every time so you could have it as unit
says yeah that's the closest I can find
that comes to unit test yeah anyone else
yes can I get the image from the Holland
on to my computer
in what sense as in screenshot can you
screen okay not off the bat you can off
the physical Harlan's has the webcam you
can take pictures with but not really
emulator yeah anywhere else you just
want to see it only yeah no all right so
the other magic thing that's in this
developer waddle is and you may have may
not see mr. song turned on again okay
I'll see if it gets it should be sound
on everyone if I got it mixed reality
capture here I can do a live preview now
I need to say this is sometimes a bit
buggy and it will freeze surprised lit
please let me know if it does freeze and
you can't see it okay but is me alright
about a two-second delay aren't maybe
you should so let's just do something
so open up the holograms belongings over
there I'll try and keep my head still
because it's I can easily see what I'm
looking at but you're going to look like
it's all just a flaky okay did you do a
special you go now you like spaceships
okay and there's something I wanted to
do yesterday oh sorry
you guys stay can you do that again that
lovely now it's got googly eyes right
you get I'm gonna bring some runway you
guys idea right now this is kind of not
actually mixed reality because I'm not
interacting with the physical
environment so let's do something that
is and this is always anyone tried
rubber raid none one person
okay just places anyway so Robo rate is
probably the best immediate example I
have of percent of noise or no sound on
this sound person please
you can't hear that Kenyan okay cool
okay
take a look at the wall all right I'm
scurvy good to do okay see if you can
find a little bit shiny this bit here
not just good onion I'm going to scream
no you're not yep sorry all right this
is very meta alright so just trying to
scan the room now and figure out where I
am right don't start it again again we
can do it over here I know there's no
idea this is a bit sorry I'm making a
mess of it there we go so now I'm just
scanning my environment so it knows
where I am this is always a boring part
of a game is this cutscene intro alright
now we can start it
and I can look through the wall as well
someone saw the flat pays so you don't
actually have sound do you can't hear
anything
no because it's quite loud in mind can
we get any sound on it all from the
computer there is sound okay I don't
know it it's fully on full bore up there
okay so now we what happens is that the
loads everything I'll just a comment
about that
I accidentally exited it by doing the
hand gesture that's right we'll just
start again because the more intensity
is over there just go back into it okay
so that's loading up the shields and
theorem is magic commentary and now
robots are kind of come out the wall
with this brace yourself and then it'll
point to where si yeah it's going to
break whoa it comes out the wall and now
shoot this shoot your truth you get the
idea
it doesn't because the room wasn't very
good for it but you get the idea
does that make sense that's what mixed
reality is like it maps the physical
environment right all that's the going
mm-hmm its computer just put it in and
that's the physical environment and then
lets me play with the physical
environment with digital assets if
you're not doing that you're doing
augmented reality right or even virtual
reality so it's really important that
this is at the front of your mind when
you start building an app mixed reality
is interaction between physical and
digital reality right any questions for
this because that demo was a little bit
meta yes that's right yep mm-hmm
so how does it know that there's a flat
surface there cuz I just it's it look at
a wall right and as soon as I started
looked at a wall that wasn't shiny again
this is kind of reflection doesn't do
well it's found a surface I could place
it there and that's because well the
hollow tool could let you do that at end
of five walls but you can also do it
with the data you have for spatial
mapping say or if there's you know if
the triangles are certain direction all
of them in a certain area then that
becomes a wall but it will do it in real
time it will keep updating the model as
well anyone else no this is useful I
just can't get any response the best
prototype software is set for a game so
my favorite of these is so I say I don't
think it's a gaming device but when you
have five minutes to commit someone how
cool is that's a good one right if I had
a lot longer there's a company that
builds you know these stairs that
disabled people have these elevators
disabled people have on their stairs
right they go up the side of a staircase
and Sid I'm governor comes up right and
in horror movies they always go mad and
go poo yeah right those I saw an example
for an app where they would
the staircase with curves and everything
they would then model the elevator on
the staircase in real time so the user
the the purchase of the buyer could see
it and say oh no I actually don't want
that that's too high or can you make an
or whatever it might be and then from
that that could export the model and
build it right so the prototyping or the
measurements I'm sure they're still
managing it of course because it's not
100% accurate but the measures are the
model was there they had it they go
build it in gun bang and solace and that
to me it's just like okay that just
makes people's lives much better okay
anyone else because it was a hand was it
yes have I see it in as training device
for in any kinda industry but you
mentioned engineers for example an oil
rig it's not that rugged like I don't
think it would probably fall apart like
do not drop this usually when people try
to break it by it but I could certainly
see if there's an elevator company
called Tizen I think or something that
user for the engineers so if you're
going to repair an elevator it'll know
what model elevator is an overlay
schematics and everything on it so yeah
there are people are using it but still
it's not widely spread with Ultron
anywhere else last one
nope alright thanks very much going
speak it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
