today learn about irelia today's talk is
gonna be a bit of an intro tell you what
irelia is give a little bit of a demo of
the frameworks teach you how to use the
framework by the end of this talk you'll
basically know 80% of what you need to
know to build any irelia application
after that we're gonna move on to the
current status of the project and where
we're moving over the next couple of
months over to the next year
so what is irelia first thing is
Borrelia is just JavaScript we're using
the current and future versions of
JavaScript we call it es 2015 current
version is es 2016 but we also move
forward and look at what we call es next
upcoming features that are coming to the
language over the next couple of years
we transpile those using stuff like
Babel or typescript it is possible to
write irelia applications using ES 5 but
I wouldn't recommend it es 2015 is such
an awesome update to the JavaScript
language that you should really use it
irelia itself is a collection of
collaborating libraries ok the framework
is built into these modules of code and
the cool thing with this is that this
makes stripping down the framework and
getting rid of stuff that you don't need
very very simple for example if you were
building an application that didn't make
use of our router you don't even have to
include that in there not even talking
about tree shaking if you're familiar
with that you can just not include it in
your project
irelia is used to build JavaScript
clients single page applications and a
couple of years ago this would have
meant things that ran in the browser
okay but here in 2016 that that's not
the only place that JavaScript
applications and html5 applications are
run they run everywhere you can run
desktop applications or you can create
desktop applications
using something like electron you can
build mobile applications using
something like a patchy Cordoba PhoneGap
and the cool thing with irelia is that
it's so performant that if anybody's
used an Apache Cordova application and
it was really really slow
when you use something like a rally ax
it's it's not slow it can be near native
speed so we utilize what's called the
modern Dom and web components technology
irelia is built on standards we're not
reinventing the wheel okay this means
that a lot of the code you write in an
early application you'll be able to if
you decide not to use rel e in the
future you're gonna be able to move
forward with that code and not do a
complete rewrite of your application
the modern Dom is not slow a lot of
competing frameworks like to say that
it's slow it's not we have the
benchmarks to prove it okay and we
utilize web components technology now
the thing with web components is they
are a set of specifications for things
like custom elements the shadow DOM and
a couple other things but the problem
with the web component specifications is
that they're not user friendly okay they
were they were just not designed for
mere mortals okay and the great thing
with irelia is that we take all of that
and bring it down to a level where
someone like me so I can use these stuff
like custom elements or the shadow Dom
so the philosophy around Durell is first
off it's an open source project where
MIT license the framework is free and
always will be free you can fork it if
you'd like we're up on github we like to
encourage you to write clean code
through the use of simple conventions
okay we're not we're not trying to
infect your code your applications code
with framework just a framework close
code in the demo that I'll do in a
little bit you'll see this you'll see
that throughout the entire demo there's
only a couple of lines of irelia
framework code
gets in okay you can compare this to
other frameworks out there where you're
a basically writing code for that
framework we utilize modern tooling
tools like web pack are first-class
citizens when you're building an irelia
application and we like to espouse
testability maintainability
extensibility what we call the illa tees
okay when you build an irelia
application because there's not a lot of
framework code and boilerplate in there
your code is gonna be very very testable
because your code is just bog-standard
es2015 or es2016 or typescript okay
because of this you're gonna have very
maintainable code code that you don't
have to have developers come in who are
experts in the framework to be to be
able to maintain your application and
also through the use of these simple
conventions we create applications that
are highly extensible also irelia is
experiencing rapid adoption and we have
a large active community if you come to
our getter channel we have over 3,000 or
4,000 people active in the Gator channel
no matter what time of day you come in
there you can ask a question someone
will help you answer it I am subscribed
on Stack Overflow
to get notifications from people asking
questions on irelia and it I'm 10 to 15
questions a day come in and it continues
to increase month by month so before we
get into the demo I'll give you an idea
of how easy it is to get started
learning irelia these are our beginner
kits these are not a basis for a
production application okay but it's a
great way to quickly get started with
irelia so you can learn you just go and
download one of these two zip files
unzip it and then depending on how you
want to work with it you know they're
open it as a website and visual studio
if you like using node J s just globally
install the HTTP server and then run it
in the folder or if you're using Firefox
it's even simpler you just open the
index
html5 file Firefox actually allows you
to run JavaScript from local files but
for today's demo I'm gonna use the
irelia command-line interface this is
something we've been working on for a
couple months now it allows you to work
with
irelia and not have to worry about all
of the complexities that come with
modern JavaScript development we do
everything for you it allows you to set
up a project skeleton and out and just
get working now what I have here on my
screen is the index.html file that you
get when you run
irelia new from the command line you'll
see here there's only 11 lines of code
we have a little bit of styles that I've
brought in a body tag that has the
irelia app custom attribute on it and it
points to main so it tells the irelia
framework that we're going to look for a
file called main j/s and then we load up
our vendor bundle and tell-tell the
framework to load irelia bootstrapper
that's it for most of your irelia
applications
aside from styling a loading screen this
is going to be your index.html file so
now we'll go in and look at our code now
before you get too worried i've already
started up Aurelia's CLI to do what's
called watch so that every time I save a
file in this project the browser will
refresh the code will get re transpiled
in the browser will refresh I'll show
you what it looks like currently it's
very very simple just hello world okay
but don't worry it's gonna get more
interesting so let's look at how that
hello world was created we come in here
and first we have this main.js file this
is where you kind of configure the start
up of your application we have a little
bit of stuff in here I'm using the
import syntax from es 2015 to load a
module called environment from the
environment file
that is right here this environment
module just tells that I want to be in
debug mode and I'm also in testing mode
so we load that in we set up Bluebird is
everybody familiar with Bluebird for
promises in our project by default we
utilize Bluebird because it's faster
than the native promise implementations
in all of the browsers out today and
then we have a function here called
configure now the great thing with
irelia is that irelia will inspect your
modules and if there there are functions
that are the proper name it we'll just
call them for you we did not have to
import a configure framework function
from an irelia framework module we just
wrote a function called configure and
arelius sees it and passes us an
instance of the framework for us to go
ahead and start configuring so first we
tell irelia here to use its standard
configuration this is a quick and easy
way to get up and running with the full
framework and we load what's called a
feature I'm gonna ignore this because
it's a it's a more advanced topic but
this is something that comes with the
standard setup when you run irelia new
next we tell irelia that if we're in the
debug environment we want to set up
development logging which is great for
us to see what's going on in the
framework as we work with it and if
we're testing we want to load the irelia
testing plugin finally we tell irelia to
start and then we tell it to set root
but we don't pass anything to it which
tells rlea to use the convention that
the framework has the convention for the
framework is that it will set the root
of your application to a file called app
J s and app HTML so let's go up here and
look at our app J s and app HTML files
we have a simple class here who's worked
with some other modern JavaScript
frameworks and is familiar with having
to require in modules from the framework
to do anything you know you have to take
a dependency on the framework to do
anything well you'll see here that we
have our first file
I'm not importing anything for
the irelia framework all I'm doing here
is telling the framework to pass me an
instance of the framework and then we
come up here and I've got a pas there's
nothing from the irelia framework in
here we're just setting up a standard
yes 2015 class and setting a property
called message on it and then in here
we've got a template all irelia views
are wrapped in templates this is our app
HTML this is the view for our view model
and we just use string interpolation to
interpolate in the message property this
is the simplest possible
irelia page you can have this here this
dollar sign curly brace is from es 2015
this is the template string stuff that
came with es 2015 it's probably my
favorite feature of es 2015 but anyways
this is just hello world and this is
really boring so let's start working
with irelia so I'm gonna go in add in
some code here I'm loading the bootstrap
JavaScript
and then I have another I have a class
called welcome I have a heading of
welcome to in DC Sydney I set up a first
name and last name property I have a
getter that will append a concatenate
the two of those with a space in between
and have a function called submit
that'll pop up an alert on the screen
with the full name now I'm going to
write out the view for this this is a
little bit more complex here now the
first line of this is the template tag
and then we go into where I load
bootstraps CSS this is using a feature
of irelia where you can require in
resources for your views and not have to
load them via link tags in your HTML
this way the framework is in charge of
loading and unloading these things for
you so we load bootstraps
CSS and then we come down here I've
already talked about the string
interpolation that allows us to place
things into our HTML so I'm placing the
8 of the heading
property from our view model here inside
this h2 tag then we have a form in the
form I have a couple of text boxes here
and this is the first time where you see
how irelia does data binding okay in
Aurelio whenever you see something dot
something inside of an HTML element you
can be sure that the framework is
working with that okay we like to have a
simple templating syntax and simple
binding syntax for you so that there's
not a lot of arcane binding commands we
don't have bananas and boxes here so we
have the value attribute of this text
box and we're going to bind our first
name property to it so we say value dot
bind equals first name
irelia we'll use it's simple conventions
and stand default setup to say okay this
is a text box this should probably know
what we're we're binding to the value
attribute this needs to be two-way data
bound so that any changes that come that
are made in the view model will be
propagated to the view and any changes
the user does in the browser will be
propagated back into the view model the
cool thing with irelia is that we have
same defaults for this so if we were to
say bind to the placeholder attribute
it's not likely that the user is going
to be updating the value of that
attribute so we make that a one-way
data-binding so the flow goes from the
view model into the view but doesn't go
the other way and we increase the speed
of your application for free but
sometimes you want to override this okay
sometimes you want to be explicit that
it's going to be two-way data bound or
maybe you want to override it and go
from two-way data binding to one-way
data binding and we make it easy in
irelia for you to do that so if you want
to be explicit about this data binding
being too way you say value dot two-way
that's it we have now explicitly set the
valid the binding the data binding to
two-way we didn't have to learn any kind
of arcane syntax it just I want to weigh
data binding I say two-way can anybody
guess how we would set up one-way data
binding yeah pretty simple you've got
about half of what you need already to
build or le applications you've already
learned you've learned how to insert
things into a template so that the
they're inserted into the HTML and
you've you've already learned about data
binding to HTML properties they're HTML
attributes we do offer one other binding
direction which is really nice which is
one-time so when you do the one-time
data binding we come in we set the value
of the attribute and then we're done we
don't look at it we don't worry about it
anymore crazy high performance for
example if you were by data binding to a
placeholder there's a good chance you
would use the one-time data binding here
okay but I'm gonna for now I just want
to use the default binding direction of
two ways so I'm going to say bind now we
have a last name textbox we have some we
are interpolating in the full name
property and then we have a button here
we have a submit button for a form now I
skipped up here I skipped how we're
working with events to talk about the
binding but when you work with events in
ireli when you want to bind to events we
make this very easy for you as well okay
any event on an element you take and you
say the name of the event and then you
say dot trigger and then an inside the
value of the attribute you say the name
of the function that you want called and
you put parentheses there and the reason
the parentheses are there is because you
can actually pass in parameters to the
function okay one that we provide you
out of the box is the event itself so if
you put dollar event that'll actually
pass the event into your function so you
can work with it it's really really
simple now
the thing with cement trigger or the
thing with the trigger binding is that
this actually attaches an event handler
to your HTML element okay the problem
with this is say you were inside of a
repeater and you're going through that
you know have every single you have a
button on a table row or something you
don't want to create hundreds or
thousands of event handlers so we
provide an easy way to use something
called event delegation where irelia
will have one event handler on the page
and it events that bubble up will come
up to it and then irelia will handle
passing the event to wherever you've
told it to we make this really simple
all you have to do is replace trigger
with delegate when we say submit that
delegate we've already started using
event delegation I recommend when you're
building irelia applications to use
event to use the delegate binding unless
the event does not support bubbling in
which case you'll have to use the
trigger binding okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and save our HTML and JavaScript
come over here
irelia is CLI has gone ahead and
recompiled our code and reloaded the
page for us we see here we have our
heading and I have data binding setup so
when I change this and put my name in
here we see that down here the full name
has been interpolated in for us
and when I click Submit the event
happens and we get our alert not too
impressive right just very very standard
stuff that any JavaScript framework
wants to help you with the other thing
that isn't great here is that this is
just a single page and that's not very
exciting most of the single page
applications that we build there are
single page only in the fact that they
live in one HTML file they actually you
have multiple pages inside of your
application so let's go ahead and start
creating a multi-page application so
first what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
change the name of app is an app HTML to
welcome j/s and welcome
HTML but in doing this remember that
irelia by default is gonna look for an
app j/s an app HTML so I need to go
ahead and add those back in and I'm
gonna add in code that will include the
use of a router so app dot j/s I'll come
here do that now because I'm importing
the bootstrap JavaScript here I'm gonna
go ahead and remove that from welcome
j/s I'll save that and I'll also take
out the bootstrap CSS from this file and
I'm gonna add app dot HTML and I'll add
in another snippet okay so let's look at
this again we've got an application
where we haven't brought in anything
from the framework okay but we're
running we have a full running
application in fact if I come over here
you'll see that I've already got a
bootstrap navbar at the top
still haven't pulled in anything from
the irelia framework what we do in this
class is irelia will see that there is a
configure router method and it'll call
it ok and it will pass in a router
configuration and the router itself so
we go ahead and we set the configuration
up we set the title of the router and we
provide one route we call it welcome and
we point it to the Welcome module which
is that file and h2 HTML and JavaScript
file that I just created and we say that
this route is navigable and we give it a
title of welcome with a capital W so
that when it's displayed in our UI it
actually has a capital W that's it
that is our entire app file yes
the question was what is the import
bootstrap at the top of the file this
loads bootstraps JavaScript now usually
you'll see in JavaScript or in es2015
files you'll see import something from
you know but in this case all we want to
do is load that javascript we don't
actually need it in this file so we just
say import bootstrap it loads it and we
just move on with our day okay so this
can figure out a method it's called by
the framework because it exists and
that's that that is it okay let's go
over here to our app template I'll go
ahead and minimize this you'll see here
where we're requiring in bootstrap CSS
in irelia if you want to load CSS files
this is here we're loading bootstrap CSS
but you could also load your own custom
CSS using this this require element is a
custom element provided by the framework
that allows you to pull in resources
into your view okay you'll see this be
used later on in the demo down here we
have a router view custom element this
is another custom element provided by
the framework this is a custom element
it's pretty obvious what it is this is
where the router will put the view
that's it's being that it is displaying
for you okay now I minimized the
bootstrap navbar so we could talk about
the router but now let's go in and look
at this is everybody familiar with
bootstrap navbars this is this is a
bog-standard bootstrap navbar just with
irelia templating inside of it first
you'll see here that we have the router
title being brought in being
interpolated in and then down here we
have something new we have repeat dot
four on this list element okay this is
Aurelio's repeater the guy who started
the irelia frameworks named Rob
Eisenberg and he he's told me that
creating frameworks is easy
creating repeaters is the hard part okay
so anybody who thinks that they want to
build a framework for themselves try
building a repeat
and you'll see that it's just not fun
but anyways this is our repeater and
we're saying repeat dot four row of
router navigation as I talked about with
string interpolation like up here with
the router title irelia likes to take
features from es2015 features from
javascript and bring them into your
templating so that there isn't this
mismatch and to tighten two different
ways that you have to know about how to
do things one of the new features in es
2015 was a new repeat new for loop
called the for of loop and it's it's
nice because it it loops over things
like you would expect it to okay so we
brought that syntax into our repeater
and said repeat dot for row of router
navigation so we're gonna go over every
navigable route in our router which in
this case is just one here you see
string interpolation being used inside
of our class attribute what we're doing
here is we're saying if the row is
active add the active attribute to it or
sorry active class name to it otherwise
add nothing this is really nice you can
actually have JavaScript expressions
inside of your templates so that you can
do more complex things with them
this doesn't support the full javascript
language because that would be a bad
thing but it supports pretty much
everything you would need to do so we've
set the active if the route is active
and then down here again we're binding
to the href attribute of the link and
setting that here and we bring in this
bring in the title so that's all pretty
standard stuff but there is one last new
thing to show you in this template which
is our if attribute now a fairly
standard thing you need to do when
you're building applications is show and
hide things from the UI okay and there's
two ways to go about doing this in HTML
you can either add and remove the
elements from the Dom or you can just
put a display:none or remove that
from it and I simplify it with the
display nine but that's the basic idea
you know you can hide it or you can
remove it and so it really provides you
out-of-the-box ways to do both of those
things if you want to add and remove
things from the Dom use the if attribute
if you just want to hide and show things
use the show attribute but in this case
we want to add and remove this spinner
which is a fun awesome spinner from the
Dom so we're using if dot bind okay so
we see we're binding this to the is
navigating at your property of our
router and so whenever the is navigating
property is true we'll see a spinner and
whenever it goes to false
it'll hot it'll be removed from the Dom
for us so again we come back over here
and we see that you know I can click on
this that's it but this is still pretty
boring we've got a single page and we
set up a router so why don't we add a
second page so what I'm going to do is
come back into our app jas and I'm gonna
copy this route I'm gonna paste it in
and I'm going to create a new route
called users that points to a module
called users I'm gonna give it a name of
users point it to the module users and I
give it a title of users now when I save
this file and come back over here you'll
see that we're showing a new users route
but if I click on it because it doesn't
exist nothing happens the routing fails
so let's go ahead and add this new
module to our application new page to
our application go ahead and add users
dot j/s and users dot HTML okay
let's first look at the JavaScript for
our page
now I want to point out something
important on line one we are thirty
minutes into this presentation and it's
the first time I've brought in anything
from the irelia framework I've this the
first time I have imported a module from
irelia or imported anything from irelia
in this case I'm bringing in our inject
decorator and then I'm bringing in our
HTTP HTTP client our fetch client which
technically is not part of the framework
it's an add-on that you can use now the
inject decorator that I'm bringing in is
used to work with our dependency
injection provider in this case our
class we want to utilize an HTTP client
and so we need to have that injected in
forest dependency injection is a great
pattern to use it's fairly standard in
frameworks these days and we provide one
we provide a provider for you okay so
when you inject when you set up the
directive the decorator and you say
inject HTTP client irelia will pass this
in to your constructor you'll get an
instance of that class so we configure
this instance and then we set it as a
property on our class okay also up here
we have a heading property and we go
ahead and create an empty array for
users now what this page does is it goes
out to github and pulls in a list of
users and then it displays them if
anybody's familiar with our alias
skeleton this should look very familiar
this is a great way to see how to use to
make Ajax requests with irelia but also
how to integrate those Ajax requests
into the frameworks lifecycle and that's
what we do here in this activate
function the activate function is part
of the routers lifecycle it looks for
functions that exist on modules that are
being loaded by the router and if they
exist it calls them if they don't exist
it doesn't bother with it
so when the irelia router sees the
activate function it will call it and if
the function returns a JavaScript
promise
it will actually wait for that promise
to resolve before it continues with the
routers lifecycle okay so in this case
we go out to get hubs API and pull in
the list of users convert it to Jason
and convert it from Jason and then set
that as a to the users property on our
view model that's it that's 25 lines of
code that's all we need and then I come
over here to our view and I add in a
very simple template everything you see
in this template I've already taught you
about okay we have string interpolation
for the heading we have a repeater over
the users at users property binding to
the source attribute of our image tag
everything you already know how to build
fairly complex views using irelia so
I'll go ahead and save that and when I
come over here to our page and I click
on users thankfully if anybody's been
using the conference Wi-Fi the hotel
Wi-Fi I have a wired connection so my
internet actually works but we load a
set of cards with github users the other
thing that's thankful about this is that
github always loads these in order of
how long they've been github user so I
don't have to worry about bad avatar
images so now we've got a two page
irelia application we see how to use
navigation in a rally application and we
can see when i refresh this if i refresh
this and then click here well it loads
so quickly but if I were on the
conference Wi-Fi you would actually get
to see that the page wouldn't load until
this Ajax request was finished this
allows you to control the lifecycle of
your page in very fine-grained details
detailed we also offer a can activate
and a can deactivate hook in the router
so this is cool but anybody who's ever
been to demos at conferences always sees
things that you know they don't they
don't use every day or that they would
never do at the office you know you see
I like to call them stupid coding tricks
so I'm gonna do that here I'm gonna do a
stupid coding trick for you I'm gonna
take this welcome page that we created
that was originally our entire
application and that became a page in
our application I'm now gonna take it
and without modifying the code I'm gonna
make it a custom element inside itself I
don't know why anyone would ever do this
because it would crash your browser but
I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna come to our
welcome to HTML file and I'm just gonna
add down here an element called welcome
I'm gonna close it I've created a custom
element purely by creating a module a
view and a view model pair with the file
name of welcome I have created a custom
element called welcome this is a really
cool feature of the framework where you
can have something that's a page in your
application but you can also use it as a
custom element in in your application
but the thing is if I hit save right now
I'm gonna crash Chrome because this is
recursive and it will just blow up
eventually so we need to have a way of
only show only adding this to the Dom
when I tell it to so I'm going to use
that if binding I'm gonna bind it to a
checkbox that I'm gonna add right here
say input type equals checkbox I'm going
to use something I haven't taught you
about which is our ref attribute a lot
of times when you're building
applications
modern JavaScript applications you need
to work with actual elements but how do
you do that when you're working with
stuff like this where you know it's
dynamically added in move it
moved from the Dom things where maybe
you've got multiple things on the page
that maybe have the same ID you know
five years ago we would have used jQuery
but you can think of how that would fall
apart quickly especially if you were
inside of a repeater or something what
we do in irelia is we provide this ref
attribute and you can just say we'll
give this the name of do dumb stuff I'll
close it out now this automatically adds
this element to our view model as a
property on our view model okay so the
cool thing with this is that I can now
use this down here inside of a data
binding now remember I talked about the
difference between the show and the if
bindings this is a place where it's
really important to use if I'm gonna say
if not bind equals do dumb stuff dot
checked not dot value because it's a
checkbox and HTML inputs are weird and
I'm gonna save it and if I've done
everything correctly now when I come in
here I click these check boxes they go
across the page pretty cool right I've
taken something from being up the entire
application to being a page in our
application to being a custom element I
didn't write any JavaScript in fact I
took JavaScript out of that file I
removed the import bootstrap okay i I've
had to do nothing to make this journey
okay but if we were a little bit of
JavaScript we could do something cool
see the problem we have right now is I
have data binding but it stays inside of
each of these instances of the Welcome
module and it doesn't go up and it
doesn't go down and that's really
frustrating because what I'm doing dumb
stuff I want to do dumb stuff so I want
to data bind this all together okay so
to set that up I'm gonna add I'm gonna
come in and for the second time in this
demo I'm going to pull in something from
the framework
i'ma come to this file and change this
file I'm gonna import bindable from
irelia - framework so only the second
time you've seen the words irelia
framework in this demo
now this bindable thing that i've
brought in as a decorator decorators are
a pending standard that hopefully will
be brought into es 2017 or es 2018 but
we're able to use them today in
typescript and by the use of babel if
we're writing a standard echo script now
i'm gonna i'm gonna attach this
decorator mind able to the first name
property of our view model by doing this
i have set up a convention based binding
bindable property or findable attribute
on our custom element okay by default it
is a one-way data binding but I'm gonna
show you how to override that easily in
a minute so I'll go ahead and save that
and I come back over here I'm gonna say
first - name
now first everybody's probably wondering
why don't I do first name right HTML is
case insensitive so if I put this here
first name this would get lower case
before it made it into JavaScript okay
but our attribute is first capital name
and so how would we make sure that this
we can match these up and we do this by
converting from camel case in JavaScript
to kabob case or - case in our HTML
templates now I say first name dot bind
equals first name so now I have bound
the pages first name property to the
custom elements first name property and
then the second time or inside the
custom element I'm binding the parent
custom elements first name property to
the child custom elements first name
property so now when I save that and I
come over here click my checkbox
type my name in here it updates now of
course I only set the binding up for the
first name property not the second name
or the last name property so it only
updates on that one but you know I
changed it to James or whatever and it
updates and that's cool
but as I said it's a one-way
data-binding so when I change this to
Ashley
it doesn't update over here and we're
doing dumb stuff so why don't we set
this as a two-way data-binding
okay now who remembers how I can
override the default binding direction
and explicitly make this a two-way
data-binding
yeah pretty simple right so I saved that
come over here and a couple checkboxes
and now my type it goes up and down I've
got two way data binding I've added one
line of code and a word to my view model
I've taken the entire application to a
page to a custom element and I've set up
data binding on this custom element with
a very small amount of code now now one
thing I do want to show you before we
finish this demo is I want to talk about
componentized applications irelia helps
you to build componentized applications
okay you can like i like i took with
that welcome page and i turned that into
a component into a custom element i you
know we want you to do that with your
your templates so if you have something
that might get reused or something where
it doesn't make sense being part of a
template so you want to pull that out
and put it on its own we give you ways
to do that through custom elements but
the thing with creating a custom element
is that you have to write JavaScript for
it you have to have a view model behind
it and sometimes you have components
that it just it's really frustrating
because all you all you're doing is
creating an empty class or you're
creating a class and you're setting up
one property on that and your think
and I paid good money for this
javascript framework it should do that
for me that was a joke it's free but you
know the people who write the framework
right irelia which includes me we're
developers we use irelia on a day-to-day
basis for our day jobs and we are lazy
just like any other good developer and
so we came up we we came up with a way
to have the framework build that view
model for you when you have a custom
element or a component where there's no
real business logic in it
it's just template logic and we call
those HTML only custom elements and to
show you how that works I'm gonna take
our navbar cuz I look at it and I say
that's it's just really cluttering up my
my main template page so I'm gonna take
it out I'm gonna add a new file in here
called navbar HTML and I'm gonna add a
template element okay but I'm gonna do
one thing on this template element I'm
gonna so I'm gonna add a attribute
called bindable and I tell it I want a
bindable property on this component
called router okay if you had more than
one bindable property you wanted to
setup you would add them in a comma
separated list you can only do one way
data binding with this the bindable
decorator that I showed you earlier you
can actually pull in and set the default
binding direction to be one way or two
way or one time you can explicitly set
that with HTML only custom elements
you're going to get one-way data-binding
and if you need to override it you got
to do it in the parent template so I'm
gonna go ahead close this out and I'm
gonna paste in the code that didn't work
right
and instead of collapsing it I'm gonna
cut it out I'm gonna paste it in and
I'll save that and I'm going to come
over here I'm going to add a require
element I'm gonna pull in our navbar dot
HTML file and I want to close that out
now I've put dot HTML into this cup into
this require element it's from and that
tells irelia this is an HTML only custom
element if i were pulling in a standard
custom element that has both of you in a
view model I would leave off the
extension because then irelia would know
okay I got a good load of JavaScript
file
and possibly also an HTML file so I've
done that I'll miss a navbar router dot
bind equals router I'm gonna close that
save it when I come over here you'll see
the page is still working just the same
as always except that if I inspect here
you see that now I have the navbar
custom element ok I just created a
custom element and I didn't write a lick
of JavaScript that's awesome has anybody
here tried to create standards-based
custom elements it's not easy you have
to write JavaScript no matter what the
great thing when you're using irelia is
that we deal with that for you we write
the JavaScript that's necessary to
create custom elements
so I created a custom element without
writing any JavaScript I also took a
module in our application from being the
entire application to being a page in
our application to being a custom
element inside of itself in our
application what do I call that I call
that magic
I just love this gift
I love Arrested Development so I'm just
gonna let it sit there for a minute so
anyways that was my demo let's talk
about the status of the framework and
where we're gonna be going over the next
couple of months so we released version
1.0 RTM rtw of irelia last week you know
you are free to use it is go live it is
ready
we've squashed bugs you're free to use
it there's no worries
we are fully featured obviously we hit
1.0 we have a full set of API
documentation and profile based articles
let me show you what that is in our
documentation if I come down here first
this is our blog post if you go to
blogger Randall died oh you can see the
frameworks blog but this is the irelia
hub okay we are really proud of what
we've done here we provide you with a
way to look at documentation that is
suited to you as a developer or you know
we make things a lot simpler if you're a
CTO so we give you three documents to
look at we have code or we have dem
demonstration code inside of these if I
look at let's look at a value converter
we'll look at a simple value converter
down here oh it's loading but we have
actual runnable demos inside inside our
documentation we're working on for the
future to make these editable so that
you can you can play with it inside the
documentation but we're really proud of
our documentation I'm really proud of it
because I've written a lot of it which
is great because I forget things and so
I can go back and ask past Ashley what
what the way to do things are okay we
have real applications in development
and in production there are large
companies out there fortune 50 companies
that are using irelia today
they have applications in production or
they have recently started building
aralia applications this is not a
framework that's going to go away real
people are using this and again rapid
adoption and a large active community
and we have a global training and
consulting partner network and it's very
global because I came here from Florida
and I am a certified irelia trainer so
bring me in yes so what are we working
on currently with the framework well
tooling enhancements as I mentioned
earlier our CLI our command-line
interface we're working on that if
anybody is a.net developer and is used
to working inside a visual studio the
CLI work that we're doing is going to
make that a lot easier especially in the
next version of visual studio where it
finally supports Ekman script 2015 we
were working very closely with Microsoft
to make that stuff happen for you
I talked to match Kristensen fairly
often he's a huge fan of irelia we're
working on server rendering I we know
that this is important both as just a
checkbox for the framework but also as
something that helps with stuff like
search search engine optimization we
have what's called our node platform
abstraction layer that is community
developed and we're bringing that in as
a core part of the framework so that
server rendering will work for you very
very soon we're doing bug fixes no
matter what there's always bugs to fix
so anyways that's it thank you if you
want to discuss the framework check out
our Gitter channel follow our framework
Twitter a rally effect follow me I'm on
Twitter at Ashley
I belong is irelia dot ninja and any
feedback feedback you have about this or
if you want any of the demos or if you
want to see some more complicated more
advanced damaged mo code you can hit me
up on Twitter and I'll I'll get that to
you but anyways thank you also I have
t-shirts and
it looks like there's a small enough
beep number of people in here that I
should have a t-shirt for everyone so
come on up thank you yes
validation validation validation the
validation library was in a bit of flux
for a while it was being built on
validate j/s it was rebooted a couple
months ago and it's in active
development and it should be done very
very soon so yeah I'm not an expert on
it so we don't know but I can get you an
answer ask me that on Twitter and I'll
point you to the person who can't answer
it
any other questions yes the irelia
interface a relia interface for those
who aren't familiar is a set of widgets
that we've talked about recently if I go
here to our blog and I scroll back a
little bit from about a month ago these
are a set of widgets that we're working
on that are great at working on mobile
devices they've been optimized for
mobile a big problem with a lot of time
like if you use if you've used as I
mentioned earlier if you've used
PhoneGap or Apache Cordova applications
the performance is really really crappy
these are a set of tools that we're
building here I'll play these are our
switches that we're building to help you
out we don't have anything currently to
announce but hopefully over the next
month or two we we will have more
information on that and it will be
should be really information that makes
you happy
so any other questions all right let's
go get t-shirts thank you
so good I got two rounds of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
