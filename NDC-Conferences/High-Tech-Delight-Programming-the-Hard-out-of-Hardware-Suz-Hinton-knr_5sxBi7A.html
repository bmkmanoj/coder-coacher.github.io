much for going to the hangover slot I
hope that you're all not feeling too
rough after last night so really
appreciate you being here I'm presenting
a tool called high-tech delight and
that's going to delight is going to be a
pretty big scene throughout this entire
talk so the subtitle is programming the
hard out of hardware so I'm going to be
focusing on a lot of open source
hardware libraries and the specific
hardware ecosystem that I'm in in the
open source world which is JavaScript
hardware you might not think that
JavaScript it may not be the first
language that comes to mind when you
think about robotics and electronics and
hardware and things like that but I
wanted to tell the JavaScript hardware
story a little bit today and I'm hoping
that some of the case studies and
stories that have come out of this will
inspire you to think about the way that
you write software for other developers
a little bit more on the agenda is open
source hardware as i mentioned making
other developers happy and writing
better software so my name is sue's
Hinton you can follow me on github
Twitter pretty much anywhere online at
new cat or no up cat I'm not really
fussy about the pronunciation and I'm
between jobs of the moment so I'm just
going to say that I'm an open-source
Hardware dev but on monday i will be
starting a new job as a tech evangelist
for microsoft if that gives you an idea
of where i'm heading next i also wanted
to take a moment to thank NDC's so much
I was I was flooded to speak at NDC a
couple of years ago and the day before
my partner had a bad fall in required
emergency surgery and I was supposed to
run a robotics workshop and do a talk
and NDC were just incredibly gracious
and we're completely understanding about
it and offered to help out even and they
were amazing enough to ask me back to
speak at NDC London this year so just
amazing amazing organizers at touhy very
well and a funny note on that is
just a couple of days leading up to me
flying out I actually fell down the
stairs so I have a sprained ankle at the
moment and the first thing I thought
when I reached the bottom of the stairs
and was just sitting there blinking was
oh my god I have to go to NBC I can't
cancel on them again so I'm very happy
to be here and thank you again to NBC's
for being such wonderful organizers I'm
also a member of the no Jas hardware
working group nodejs is a JavaScript
runtime that runs outside the browser
and so you can do back-end server side
stuff a lot of you will have already
heard of it but for those who haven't
that's what it is and no Jas has an
enormous contributor community and were
broken into lots of different working
groups and so I'm specifically part of a
hardware working group because as a
group were working towards getting
cereal access and things like that as
first-class citizens hopefully in the
run time eventually but for now we're
focused on getting the community in the
nodejs seen less scared of trying to do
cool stuff like electronics and arduino
stuff with nodejs also a member of the
tehsil to team the tehsil to is a
microcontroller that specifically runs
java script on it and it has a wonderful
first sort of five minute set-up guide
and i'll be talking a little bit about
the tehsil community later on so stay
tuned for that so as part of the tussle
to team I just generally spread the good
word and I try to help out with open
source they're open source repositories
when I can so a little bit of background
on me and how I got into a lot of this
stuff and and it does kind of explain
why I care so much about developer
experience I've always been focused on
this idea of delight and so all of my
hobbies in my spare time whether it's
hardware or whether it's other projects
I don't really think is this going to be
the next Kickstarter or is this going to
be the next you know big startup on
TechCrunch I just I don't care about
that kind of stuff what I want is to
create something that either delights me
or delight
others or makes people think about using
technology in ways that they might not
have thought of before and if you're
having a lot of fun while you're
programming something you're you tend to
be learning a lot along the way too
because it keeps you motivated so I'm
more focused on the human side of coding
and I wanted to show you a couple of
projects that i did that led me into
crossing over to the other side and
writing software for other developers so
these are called meow shoes if they are
shoes with pressure sensors in them and
I made these for a fashion hackathon and
you can essentially hook them up to a
computer and you can report on whether
the heels of press the toes oppressed or
all of them oppressed and you can write
very simple algorithms to figure out
whether someone is standing on one foot
or whether they're dancing and I ended
up creating like a web socket interface
to the browser that allows you to queue
up music and so you can pretty much
dance out a tune and I had everything
from meows which is why the code meow
shoes which was a very annoying melody
type and then you could also pick things
like instruments and percussion so you
could pretty much play the drums with
your feet if you wanted to that went on
to become quite popular and there's a
book called make JavaScript robotics and
I wrote a chapter for that book and that
is featuring these miasha's and how you
can actually make them yourself after
that I went on to attend a different
hackathon this time it was for AT&amp;amp;T
which is a really large mobile
telecommunication company in the US and
this is called the / you might be
sensing a cat theme here the toe is the
personal ultimate reassurance response
if you wear this bracelet it monitors
your pulse and this was before a lot of
the fitbit's and a lot of the fitness
devices that came out that could measure
your pulse so used to pulse sensor and a
Wi-Fi Arduino and 3d printed this
bracelet it was really odd when I took
the 3d printer to the hackathon people
were mystified and I put this together
so that if you have an elevated pulse
for a certain period
time and you know you're not exercising
or anything like that it will sense that
you're probably experiencing a lot of
anxiety or you're having a panic attack
and it will start texting you pictures
of kittens so it will head up the AT&amp;amp;T
API and then it will send you pictures
of kittens saying it's going to be okay
and giving you reassuring messages with
those kittens so that was super fun and
you can see that i'm sort of focusing on
not necessary like again something
that's going to make a lot of money and
nothing that would be produced
commercially but that just makes people
smile and makes people understand that
technology can be used in lots of
different ways this here is wasn't
actually complete so you can see that
there's a lot going on here i have a
raspberry pi connected to a just a
battery so that it can be telus and the
Raspberry Pi is hooked up to a thermal
printer so you know that kind of receipt
printers that you see in a lot of
point-of-sales places and what this does
is it it measures the steps on your
fitness device and instead of you
competing with your friends what it does
is it prints you your own adventure and
so it looks at how many steps and how
much activity you did and it still
commands you for doing activity even if
it's really low and so that might sound
like a cop out but the thing is there
are a lot of people who because they're
ill they can't leave the house or
because they're super busy or they
stressed out they can't do a lot of
exercise and i think that the fitness
industry is just super competitive and a
little bit sort of aggressive especially
in America and so I wanted to show that
you can use a fitness device to tell a
story for someone will make up a silly
story this one says around five o'clock
I see there wasn't a lot of activity
from you you did 22 steps it's important
to rest so well done I trust you with
sitting on a lovely tree stump and a
friendly dog trotted over to hang out
with you i also had one such as hey you
just did twelve hundred steps you know
between four four o'clock and 5 p.m. I
trust that you
were doing a grocery shopping and a
dragon started chasing your tiger
started chasing you and so people can
kind of have these these stories made up
about them and then they can feel good
about the fact that they were actually
moving this here is a tribute to the
Metro cards that you can get in New York
that's where I live originally from
australia but I moved to New York a few
years ago I wanted to create a custom
circus voyage but not have it be just a
classic custom circuit board so I wanted
to create something that was shaped like
the public transport cards that you use
to swipe through the turnstiles and I
wanted to use javascript in and the Web
Audio API to take sounds from the subway
and then take that PCM sound data and
turn it into a pleasant song because a
lot of people don't like the sounds of
the subway and I ended up using
javascript in the browser to do that and
then I flashed the audio back onto the
SD card of this particular circuit and
then when you hold the button down you
can hear that music playing so you can
kind of take that music down with you in
the subway and and and just listen to it
translated into music this is a another
project that i did recently this is
Angie the anglerfish and I put this
circuit together for a tutorial in re
compiler magazine which is a feminist
tech magazine trying to like raise the
voice of minorities in tech and this was
just showing that you can do something
like you can use a magnet to activate
the anglerfish as light and a sort of
wrote up a tutorial and how did how to
do that and that's just using a reed
switch and I'm holding the magnet
between my fingers so you can see the
there's a big steam in a lot of the work
that I do and that's feelings you know
I'm trying to elicit feelings from
people I'm trying to explore feelings
and I'm someone that just wants to make
the world a better place even if it's
just making a couple of people smile
and so eventually I saw people asking me
all the time how did I make all of these
things and I found that I got much more
out of teaching others then I did out of
actually making these things and that's
sort of where I started switching over
and again you're probably thinking like
why javascript like all most of the
projects that i just showed you i did
with nodejs or i did something with
javascript in the browser why was I so
intent on using javascript and the
reason for that is I see JavaScript as a
very universal language now you can use
it not just in the browser but as I said
you can use it outside of the browser
you can use it in the AC two
environments you can use it anywhere
that can run their jas you can even use
it on a microcontroller such as the
pestle too so it has a low barrier to
entry and jens talk yesterday was really
awesome when she talked about how coming
into programming with java script is a
very common thing these days and a lot
of the time it's the first language
someone learns and it's quirky but
because of that it's very easy to learn
and as you said you you barely make
mistakes with it because it's so
forgiving and so that's really great for
people who want to learn robotic stuff
but they even new to programming which
is something we see a lot in the
JavaScript robotics community javascript
is event-driven and what I mean by that
is when you think about robots and
senses and things like that if you're
getting sensor data at intervals and
things like that that can be generated
as a data event right and so javascript
is so good at handling events that it
just seems like a natural choice for
this kind of thing and you know the
stuff is code like the Internet of
Things and javascript is associated with
web stuff and the internet so it just
seems like a nice little little dove
tail so the community especially is much
more the reason why javascript robotics
is such a great thing so it wasn't even
necessarily just the technology enabling
people it's also the community so has
anybody heard of node BOTS raise your
hands couple awesome so the Novus
community
was spun up probably about five years
ago now maybe a bit more and it started
when Chris Williams who is a JavaScript
developer wanted to use wanted to use no
GS with like the serial port and in
Python that's really easy you import
cereal right but that wasn't necessarily
available for nodejs at the time so he
created a module called serial port and
from there it just sort of exploded
because you could do things such as
communicating with Arduino zand and that
kind of thing and so that was a really
really exciting turning point for nodejs
in my opinion even though I'm quite
biased because from there a man called
Rick Waldron also wrote Johnny 5 which
is a march to the the movie of short
circuit and Johnny 5 kind of sits on top
of serial port and allows you to do
really simple things and provides really
nice abstractions for things like
turning on LEDs and driving motors and
stuff like that and it's a really
amazing library and so I was kind of
fiddling around with the Arduino with
flash actionscript before know Gia's
came out and you know I had to proxy the
serial port activity through a web proxy
and then I could use flash communication
server to use ActionScript to then like
manipulate things in flash using you
know knobs and dials and stuff plugged
into my arduino and this is me my day
because that stuff is so finicky and so
that's that's sort of how I specifically
got into no bots but it's a wonderful
community there is a really cool
terminal tutorial that you can go
through that was written for Johnny Five
and you don't even have to have any
hardware plugged in so imagine learning
how to interact with hardware before
you've actually even bought the Arduino
just to see if it's for you and so this
kind of simulate stuff while you're
actually learning out which is super
super fun so this is just already a
really great developer experience before
we even looking at some more deeper case
studies I used to live in Las Vegas it's
a long story but I was there for four
years and I'm just in the front there
sort of towards the left holding a kitty
but
more cats and this was the first
international node wats day that we ran
in Las Vegas and so I think it's july
twenty seventh to the 29th depending on
where we're sunday falls on the calendar
every year but every year the entire
world gets together and holds an
international no BOTS day and we all run
a very similar workshop and we have a
very similar kit that we produce that's
open source and we are and the the man
who made the the kid that's used
worldwide is actually sitting next to me
in that lovely rainbow text shirt and we
use this kit to teach people how to
actually start doing this stuff and so
it's a little remote control car
everybody gets to add their own flavor
to it so they spend half the day
building the bite and then they spend
the other half of the day programming it
and the programming part is very
important because the round board that
you see at the front is actually a sumo
by tournament and so they compete
against each other at the end of the day
and so here's a better close up that I
took of a lot of the bots that were
built if you look really closely you can
see people got creative left of lunch
time and they stole the plastic utensils
from their lunch kits and created these
some some of them the offense strategies
so you can see that there is a a
windmill on the right and there are some
folks to try and scoop up robots and
flip them over and I just I loved the
strategy and I loved how different every
single robot turned out I just love it
so that was an incredibly rewarding day
and no BOTS a las vegas continues to run
so i was there for the first two years
which was really really awesome you can
already see that when you compare this
to like the electronic engineering
community which aren't always super
welcoming this stuff is just really
really easy to access and cheap and and
very very welcoming so that made me feel
really good and i wanted to give back
more to the no box community rather than
just doing it once a year i wanted to be
part of the actual software side of it
because it had given so much to me that
i wanted to give back
and so I thought okay maybe it's time to
start making tools instead of just
making projects because projects of
one-offs but if you right tools then you
know so many more people can benefit
from that and it kind of you know kind
of broadens from there and so the first
tool I wrote was for Johnny Five and
it's called early DJ s and as a cat on
the screen further the Johnny 5 library
didn't have support for these OLED
screens which are the screens that you
see in your Fitbit watches or your
favorite devices and a lot of the other
fitness devices use them and they're
very low power so the power they consume
is dependent on how many pixels or
actually lit up at the time so there's
the super low power you can do really
neat things with them but there wasn't
supported them in Johnny 5 and I wanted
to do a project with the screens and so
I sort of reverse engineered a lot of
the code and looked at the data sheet
and wrote a node.js library called le DJ
s that uses Johnny fibers like
dependency injection so it's not part of
dirty five but it is a module that you
can use and I've seen that be four and
made compatible with the Raspberry Pi
and made compatible with all sorts of
other controllers and microcontrollers
which was incredibly rewarding for me
because I was like a home someone's
actually using my stuff this is awesome
and so I've seen robots that have faces
and all sorts of stuff that people are
shared with me someone made an
etch-a-sketch with it they put two
little knobs on the bottom and a reset
button meter which is the equivalent of
the shake and they've managed to draw
like tiny little pictures on the screen
because the screen is only about this
big so I thought that was really awesome
so then I went on to create a tool
called a VR girl that's the logo it's a
little bit small on the screen AVR girl
is a riff on the tool AVR dude and if
anyone's heard of AVR dude which I know
is a weird name it's AC package that
allows you to take pre compiled code and
you can transfer it onto a
microcontroller so most microcontrollers
are not powerful enough to run their own
text editors they don't really run an
operating system and so in order to
write code for them to run on the
devices you write it on your computer
and then you compile it and then you
flash it onto the board and so there
weren't really any centralized
JavaScript tools that could flash the
precompiled program onto like a broad
range of Arduino there are a few
packages out there that could do a few
things but they were very they were kind
of very focused towards people that
already knew what was happening with
these microcontrollers and so I wanted
to create a an interface of people who
don't really need to know about the
details and just want the code to be put
on their device so I'm going to explore
a couple of case studies from that
library today so you'll see a bit more
of that but that's the brief intro and
what it's about so case study number one
on delighting your developer tears and
writing better software for your
developers have a look so out of the box
experience I've mentioned there's a
couple of times but I think that this is
someone's first impression of your
software and so it's really important to
have that awesome you know Christmas Day
you open the gift and the batteries are
included which is just the best feeling
and so there are some software
equivalents for that and this is a
diagram i wrote to try and explain how a
computer and an arduino can react and
this sort of like well I don't know
maybe we can talk by USB and and so
that's how AVR go works you plug in your
Arduino via USB and there's a lot of
other stuff going on underneath when
you're doing things with no bots and so
you still connect your Arduino to a USB
connection but there's all these
different libraries that have sort of
visualized here there's no serial port
which is doing the connection there is
dhoni five in the left corner which is
running the robots and then underneath
35 is this bits important is a library
card for Marta and so for Mata exposes
the Arduino as an API and so you run
this samata script which is being
compiled on your Arduino and then there
is a Fermata j/s library that can then
talk to that protocol and so for example
you just send one bite
to turn on an LED on connected to a
certain pin for example or you can send
really complex messages through
protocols such as spi or ITC so it does
a lot and all of this is extracted away
from the user so that they just plug in
there arduino they flash the standard
for model code to their arduino and from
there Johnny Five is pretty much working
out of the box once they run the sample
script the HelloWorld script there was
just sort of one issue with it all of
this though and it was getting this
standard formato script on to the
Arduino so imagine someone might not
have programmed before or they've only
ever done front-end development or
something like that and they're coming
in and they're scared and they're like I
don't know how to do robots and we're
like it's cool we've got you so they
come in and we're like all right you
have to download the Arduino IDE which
is about a hundred megabytes you have to
install it you have to open the IDE at
that point they're like why can't I just
use sublime text or I just want to use
vim I don't understand what's happening
then they have to open the standard
format a sketch or script that comes
with the Arduino software they have to
choose their correct board they also
have to find the correct port that their
Arduino is plugged into and then they
click upload right so they're already
like what is going on and then they just
they close the ID and they never open it
again and they're just like took about
half an hour to 45 minutes depending on
the internet connection whether they
using Windows or Mac and all of this
stuff in my leg okay cool sorry about
that we promise that the last thing you
can now do your robots and this was such
a sticking point during a lot of the job
super buttocks or the node what's
workshops that I was doing that I was
like I just want to fix this so much and
that was a big reason why I did write
AVR go in the first place it was these
workshops that I had in mind because you
want to take this face that people make
and you want to like make sure that they
don't feel like that because you know we
can do better than that and so I used a
VR girl this is just kind of one of the
CLI commands you can use and so you just
you say what board it is which is a
an Arduino micro you tell it what hex
file or what compiled file you want to
flash and it even just automatically
finds the port that your Arduino is
plugged into you don't have to tell it
where it is which you have to do for a
lot of other command line apps that do
this and it tells you what it's doing
and then it lets you know when it's done
and so the having to download the
arduino ide versus running one command
is pretty good i would say it's an
improvement and then because flashing
standard fermata is such a common thing
that we do where am i teaching people
this stuff I went on to create another
abstraction on top of that called for
Mata party and some other party just
allows you to plug an Arduino in and
then run for Marta party and then you
just say the name of the board that you
have so you use NPM which is a
JavaScript package manager to install
for Marta party and then you just it's a
it's a global app you know in your bin
and you just run it like that and
there's actually a party mode that
someone pull requested me with and the
party mode is when you run it you just
press spacebar and it will upload that
of tomato and so for a lot of workshop
moments there just like swapping out
Arduino and they're preparing them the
day before and so a lot of people like
to do that for their attendees and they
just keep hitting space and like just
hot swapping all there there are doing
those which is really cool so it is
awesome and so now we have this really
good script that we can run for example
it would be mpm run robot setup or
something like that and essentially it
just kind of walked you through stuff
and it says he plug in your Arduino okay
we're just going to like put the magic
script on there and you know you can
learn about that later but for now we
want to get you started and then it says
cool you're ready to do your robots and
that's just been a much nicer and faster
experience and if people only have a one
day workshop that means that they've got
almost you know like half an hour to 45
minutes more to actually spend on fun
stuff right and not feeling confused
especially if people are familiar with
using node.js already this feels much
more native to them and it makes a lot
more sense so the lesson here is to
create a magic first impression just
make everything go smoothly this
when developers don't know the
technology or your software very well
because they're going to be the ones
that feel dumb like they're mucking it
up and the truth is it could be just us
providing a bad experience and so we've
all been there where someone's playing
themselves and they're like no no no
it's really not you and you know they
make this face and that's really great
and I love it when people do that face
cool k 32 when things go wrong and they
will and they usually go wrong so when
you run a vr gola do we know and you
want to flash an Arduino Uno if you
don't have the Arduino plugged in or
sometimes if it's a weird knockoff
Arduino that has a different product ID
or something like that you will get this
error and it's a javascript error object
and it just has a stirring that says no
i doing i found and that's very kind of
a robotic error and i find that every
time i release me software i'm worried
that it might have broken something for
some words you're bored or something
like that and so I've had pull request
opened on my library when people have
gotten this era exactly and then I've
had to kind of do this whole thing where
I go through this entire process with
them and I'll say okay so is it an
Arduino or like a genuine one or is it a
clone this is what it looks like does
the script work at all but you know like
if you leave it as micro but specify the
port manually and then if no then can
you run this script for me and it's just
it's a lot of work for both myself and
the person experiencing problems and at
this point I'm just like if my response
is this long then there's something
wrong with this debugging process and i
also had this issue open for a while
where I begged people to please test my
software on all of the different weird
boards that they have lying around and
again like I had all of this this entire
description it wasn't super helpful it
just says successfully uploading a blink
text file is a great test to try you
know here's a copy of it
and no one responded no one really did
the testing and i realized that i was
asking way too much of people so I was
expecting them to go through and find
this issue and do the work for me and
actually open an issue additionally if
the board didn't work and you know that
that was a lot for me to ask and so you
gotta make helping fund and I learned
that the hard way for sure so I created
a hidden web app inside of a VR girl
Arduino code AVL girl Arduino test pilot
and you can just run AVL goldish Arduino
and instead of writing / as your command
you just run test pilot and this browser
just pops up out of nowhere and says
okay like let's do it and it gets you to
log in via github so that you can get
credit for testing and it gives you some
really easy steps you plug in your
Arduino you choose what board it is any
click start test and then what it'll do
is it'll try uploading just a simple
script to your Arduino and it will then
provide a report at the end of that test
so the report looks something like this
it has the username the board the
operating system that the contributor
was using the node version they were
using the version of the test
application here and then the version of
AVR girl and if there were any errors it
will put the string of that error in
there and if there were no errors you
can still submit the report because it
lets me know that on a specific board
and on a specific operating system that
it works really well and you can also
remain anonymous and I need and you can
also take a box saying that you don't
want me to reach out to you at all to
like thank you or whatever like that so
there is a privacy policy on this
application as well that you can read
and it just lets you know you know
what's going on so that was really
successful and I've gotten a lot of
people around the world just testing
stuff for me and someone wrote a blog
post about it to encourage people to do
it and so I've gotten a lot out of this
there's some really weird errors that
you can get in the software such as this
one which is flash content length
differs local 128 versus device one
and this seems like gibberish and
there's not even the correct spacing or
casing in that era and that came from an
era of a dependency that I have and
essentially it was reading bites back
off the Arduino to verify that it
matches the script that was supposed to
be uploaded and it wasn't reading the
tongue sighs probably from Linux and so
ended up going down a rabbit hole to
success and I ended up opening a pull
request on my dependency and I now have
push access to it and I'm now
accidentally the maintainer which is
what happened sometimes when you open a
flaw request but I got that fixed and
that's awesome and so that helped me so
so much and I just couldn't figure out
why some people had issues on Linux and
some people didn't and it's been pretty
stable ever since so the lesson here is
make it easy and fun for others to help
and people will actually do it and they
get a kick out of it and the reason why
I get people's github user names is once
they become a test pilot they get
invited to the AVR girl organization in
the test pilot group so they get to have
that little github badge on the github
page saying that they contributed to the
AVR go project so that supposed to be
like my gamification of contributing you
get a little badger sticker at the end
kind of like I voted how you get that in
America which is cool so people feel
good about it and they feel like they
were part of a project even if they were
too shy to open a poor quest or if they
just had no idea how to use node.js
hardware they just kind of wanted to
help the project in a certain way that
just made open source contributions a
lot more accessible to people as well so
case study three useful feedback loop so
we're going to be talking about errors
again so AVL girl has nine different
types of errors so nine things can go
wrong in the process one of them as you
saw is you know they couldn't find the
board another one is just that yeah it
the the program that got flashed onto
the Arduino just when it read it back it
didn't match for whatever reason there's
lots of different things I can go wrong
the board didn't reset and come back
online properly
just sometimes stuff outside your
control so nine different types of
errors so if a developer is using a VR
girl in one of their projects which
happens a lot they have to kind of deal
with these errors and just for context
the kind of projects that a VR girl is
used on is things like an autonomous
sailboat in Vancouver that is using a
raspberry pi to upload updates to their
Arduino over the air which was kind of
amazing I didn't realize it was being
using an autonomous sailboat until
recently there is a couple of 3d
printers actually that have a web
interface or a electron app which is a
kind of an app that takes chrome and
putted nodejs process behind it and it
looks like a nap so if you've ever used
slack before slack actually uses
electron people were using a VR go to
just create really simple interfaces to
their 3d printers that they were selling
and things like that and so like when I
find this out I tend to pull down the
software and look at how they're using
it and I also sort of see how they
handle if things go wrong such as oh we
couldn't find the printer or whatever
and that's when I realized that the
error handling of the the way that
javascript errors are is not
particularly helpful to users but it we
just kind of throw errors and nodejs if
if something goes wrong and usually it's
just a string right and that's not super
super great as you can imagine and these
are the classic javascript errors you
have an eval error internal range
reference as we saw yesterday at James
talk syntax type and URI it doesn't
really feel like any of them match up
let a be I'll go errors that can occur
and so I can't even just throw a certain
type of error in JavaScript because they
just don't apply at all and so this
might be available and I know for sure
that it's available in a bunch of
different languages that you all will
have used but in JavaScript you just get
at the error object and you can pretty
much just throw like the classic default
like arrow types and
and that's not specifically helpful
right and so I'm finding that the string
the arrow strings that I wrote coming up
and bubbling up to users not just
developers so if someone's using the 3d
printer and they see an era that I wrote
I was never intending for use to see
that era and I only intended AVR girl to
be used by like the development
community and so that was a huge
surprise for me and recently arduino the
company have been doubling and testing
out using a VL go as a possible solution
to allow robotic stuff to an arduino
stuff to happen on Chromebooks and so I
thought ok that needs to be much more
useful errors so normally when you throw
a generic hour in JavaScript it's just
the name of Eddie's error rate and again
that super generic and people can't look
at it and you shouldn't really regex
against the error strings because they
can change at any time and that's really
fragile for people right and so
something that I've been working on
recently is actually trying to shim in
JavaScript to have things that most
other languages have which is an actual
error name or an error type that you can
throw and so thankfully because
javascript has the prototype chain model
we can just kind of extend that where
the message can be the exact same thing
but we can have this idea of trying to
create an proper error name right and so
if you have board not found error that's
much more useful for developers to use
when they're implementing AVR girl in
their apps that users using who don't
have any technical knowledge and so you
can do that really simply you can is the
object or create arrow dot prototype and
then you can start creating like a
custom error object that can take a name
and be overridden with that name and so
that's what I'm working at the moment
I'm hoping to release it soon and i did
a youtube video on this a very long time
ago when i started writing it i have a
twitch streams that I do every Sunday
where I just live program on open source
for a couple of hours and people can
watch that and so if you're interested
in just kind of learning a little bit
about the library that are right and
what it's like trying to create helpful
errors in JavaScript you can go to
youtube.com / c / no up cat and yeah
it's it's a lot of fun and if you feel
like joining in on sunday at 11am us EST
time then i would love to see you i
would not be online this weekend because
i'm here but the weekend after cool so
what are the other advantages to
actually creating these errors which
seems so obvious to a lot of you with
who use them i guess like more helpful
languages when it comes to this well
this means that it's
internationalization or i18n friendly
and so you don't just have to stick with
my English strings people can have a
look at what type of error it is and
then they can write their own error
messages and they can also just create
things that are a bit more friendly than
like you know not found it can be
something like hey we couldn't find your
3d printer maybe just push the reset
button or plug it in and out or like you
know you have you tried turning it on
and off again and things like that and
that's way better than my robotic error
messages that are only intended
developers to see no more Joe g-string
reg axes as I said just to be able to
change that in the first place and it
also shows thought for the developer
it's just a nice thing to do so the
lesson here is think about your users
which which are your developers but also
think about your users users because i
just did not even think that that like
non-technical or non developer users
would even see these error messages and
so I just felt so ignorant when I
realize of course like maybe I just
didn't think anyone was going to use my
software and that was very surprising
and then developers are going to love
you so much because you just made their
job so much easier and it's just such a
small thing cool so okay so 34 community
this one has inspired me a lot and it's
about like a larger community and it's a
smaller one within the node what subset
and that's the tussle project which I
touched on really briefly in the intro
so the castle project was a like a
private company and then they ended up
disbanding into like an open source
hardware
project that is I think it's part of the
jQuery foundation now and it's all of
their stuff is open source they've
produced two different microcontrollers
right now and it's a really wonderful
out-of-the-box experience because you
essentially write your JavaScript on the
computer and then you can use Wi-Fi or
USB it doesn't really matter to just run
a seal they have a really great CLA you
run like tussle tussle upload and then
it just like zips up all your stuff
sensitive the wire and then boots it up
on your tassel and it takes like less
than a minute to do that it's very very
fast and so you can just write stuff and
you know in the time it takes for you to
build something in Visual Studio like
it's done and that's really impressive
and just using native JavaScript without
having this weird like for modded
tethering situation allows the tehsil to
be much more advanced because it runs a
much more powerful ship than a standard
Arduino which is like an AVR I think
eight megahertz chip this runs like an
ARM chip that could actually run linux
on it so the Tesla Rams open wrt which
means you can actually set it up as a
router access point which is even cooler
so I have a friend called hipster brown
on on Twitter it's nick her and he's
kind of doing a lot of the access point
stuff and he's doing some cool stuff
with it and so this is the what the
second version the tehsil to looks like
and so you've got your standard kind of
if you've used an Arduino before you
plug things into the pins it has a
network port but it also has about two
USB ports which is really really handy
and you can see along the side there
that's kind of like the wireless the
wireless copper exposed and though
tehsil have this open governance model
and I found it really super interesting
when I join them and so you kind of have
this the entire puzzle community at
large right and then it kind of like the
Rings get smaller and smaller then you
have contributors who are those who just
like contributing to the libraries and
fixing bugs and things like that
contributors move very quickly to be
team members if
kind of showing a lot of value to the
project and so I'm sort of the the
reddish brownish sort of oak Oh ring in
there and then right in the middle you
have the steering committee and so that
they have weekly updates about their
stuff they run meetings and report back
on them everything is is open source and
it's very clear how you can contribute
to the model and it just really liked
this because I don't see this in
Hardware ever you know so much hardware
stuff is very commercial very
enterprising very like insular very like
secretive you know and Tesla just don't
have any secrets like that and it's very
clear how you can contribute in how you
can become a member of their community
and I just thought that was really
inspiring and that's something that we
could do in general in the open source
community if an outside hardware to help
people get started in open source it's
really scary and intimidating for people
and I remember my first public pool
request my heart was pounding and I was
like they're going to hate it and
they're going to close it or they'll
merge it because I feel sorry for me and
I just freaked out about it this helps a
lot having this transparency they also
have clearly defined community goals
every year and so their latest goal is
to grow the community to increase
contributions and encourage both
inclusion and accessibility to newcomers
that to me is like it's just no but
that's exactly what the community
started and so it's wonderful to see
them continuing that within their
ecosystem which in my opinion is an even
better experience than just like a lot
of the note but stuff out of the box
they also want to support and grow the
number of production deployments of
tehsil in the field they've seen tehsils
being used in factories to monitor stuff
with census and so even though
microcontrollers or break our boards are
considered just for hobby used the
tehsil is like reasonably affordable and
if you only need to dispatch a few in a
factory there's no point in developing
your own cheaper board right like when
you only have to deploy them once in
each factory and you can update them
over the air and so they're seeing a lot
of really positive like production uses
where that's very atypical of this
industry as well and I think
awesome they also have an event called
meet the Tessa leaders which is really
really cute name for their community
where all Tessa leaders and so this is
in New York at a co-working space and a
few people had already left for the day
so they were more than this but a bunch
of us got together and try to all spend
the day contributing to the tassel
project and so I was debugging a weird
issue where some of the kind of breakout
board that you can connect to the tassel
one of the boards just wouldn't update
the firmware and so I was trying to see
if a viago could help solve that issue
and a lot of other people just try to
make example projects so that they could
improve the documentation on the site
which documentation super super
important and I didn't have a case study
for that today but I still think that's
one of the most important things you can
do for other developers and so all these
people here are developers the main two
ringleaders of tehsil are at the front
john and kelsey and there's Tim and
flaki and Nick hipster Brown and that's
really cool group so that was just
really nice having them come to New York
because everyone's kind of spread
throughout the world instead of just in
one place so meeting in person was just
a really great experience so the lesson
that I took from the tehsil to project
is that community improves your product
especially especially in urban solace
but if you are enterprise and you still
live open source stuff get your
community excited about yourself and
support them because you can't buy
community like you can't just throw
money at people that's not how it works
like you can only owned it and so the
authentic go out there find your people
find your contributors try and reward
them just like make people feel that
they're valuable and they'll do that
face and I love that face super cute so
bringing it all together i'm just going
to sum up everything out this is my
opinion it's obviously not a take away
from this talk but i think that
javascript rocks for robots and we've
seen that year after year after year and
so if you haven't already looked at that
and you want to get into hardware or if
you've just been kind of doing stuff it
a different way to that i would
encourage you to look into it you can go
to note bot
I owe or just google no buts and you'll
get a ton of resources treat your peers
like regular users this is definitely
the biggest point that I want to make
with users we tend to hold their hand a
little bit more and I don't think that
that's condescending to do that for our
developer peers you can't just throw
them in the deep end with like very
terse documentation and expect them to
dig through your test examples just to
see how to use your library if you do
give them errors and things like that
try to sort of take a leaf out of the
Elm languages book and provide really
helpful syntax errors and things like
that there are just so many things you
can do even if your library is very
simple and doesn't do a lot this is just
a ton of stuff you can do to help people
because developers are coming in to use
your software at all different skill
levels and again they're going to blame
themselves first and maybe it was us not
them so a big part of that is not to
assume knowledge and so always assume
that someone coming in let's say like my
library AVR girl is people kind of
stumble across it and they might not've
use node.js before and so even in my
instructions in my documentation I say
things like if you haven't already
install node day s these lot of people
will just run NPM install and neck in
the command line they're like the
command didn't wrk and then they're
stuck and then they're like okay what
time p.m. oh ok what's nodejs and so
instead just like give them directions
like just go back one or two steps
further then you probably assume you
need to and that's probably a good rule
of thumb provide first class support
just don't assume that someone is is
doing something silly with your code and
don't judge them just start asking them
questions and see whether or not you can
make that the error reporting much
easier to do and contributions over
complaints we do a lot of complaining
it's very easy to open issue and say
your things shocked she does work but
encouraging a community where it's much
more fun exciting even if it takes a bit
longer to open a pull request and then
be part of the project fostering a like
an attitude of contributions of
complaints I just love that so much and
I forget where I heard that from but I
just think that that's a really good way
of thinking about it you can complain
all you want but it doesn't actually get
the issue fixed and always ask yourself
at the end of the day for my final point
when you're writing software whether
it's for users or for developers always
ask yourself where can I delight that's
it thank you we have a little bit of
time for questions tell you another
question yes
that's a really good question so the
question was can you get that sumo bot
kids still you know does it come as a
kit and is it available to buy it's not
available to buy just because us as a
community just don't have they don't
have the resources to kind of like sell
that online and be active with it but I
think you can just google sumo bots and
the actual kit is open source so you can
go to the repo you can actually get the
laser I'm not on an Internet you can get
the laser cut files and you can actually
kind of get them done there are also
kids that are pretty affordable that do
the same thing and as long as you can
mount an Arduino on it you can make it
into a node but they make JavaScript
robotics book has a an example of a bot
that's even cheaper to make them then
that sumo bot that sumo bot costs around
fifty dollars us which sounds like a lot
but it comes with the board and the USB
cable and everything there's one called
a simple but in the make JavaScript
robotics book and it's just like one you
can actually make it out a cardboard and
it's a much simpler frame and it's
really cool so if you tweet at me if you
tweet it no a cat just asking me about
the kit i can when i have internet i can
taste up that github Reaper for you feel
like cool anything else great thank you
so much for coming i really appreciated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
