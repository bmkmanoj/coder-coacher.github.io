thrilled to be here guys my name is
Kylie hunt and I'm here to take you from
crappy to happy so thank you for coming
what we're going to do today is unpack
four of the most common challenges that
we face in the workplace today they
include dealing with a bad boss shifting
to a better work/life balance dealing
with unfairness and embracing workplace
change now before we get started today
I'd love to know a little bit about you
guys so hands up if you manage people
right we've got maybe five percent of
you manage people okay next question I
have for you is you can choose one of
three options
I would like to gauge the amount of
crappiness in the room right now
okay so first choice is how many people
are like Jeremy Clarkson's they love
their job they can't wait for Monday
morning it's the best thing since sliced
bread I've got one person - okay we've
got the less than ten percent okay and
these guys would potentially go to work
without being paid but we won't say
anything about that the next group of
people just feel a bit mess right
they're probably not the most productive
but they get the job done eventually
they just kind of go in do their stuff
and then go back home again so how many
of you are a bit men
alright so probably about 20% now
oh no the amount of crappiness is going
to be huge oh right
how many people are like the poor old
garbage man who's having a really shitty
day okay all right
so this compares really interestingly to
a global research study that Gallup did
in 2013 their global state of the
workforce report and the degree of
happiness and crappiness in this room is
probably a little bit skewed towards the
crappiness side so when they did this
study they found that 13 percent of
global employees are the Jeremy
Clarkson's they're happy they love their
job most of us 63 percent of met but
what's scary is 24 percent are like the
garbage man right so the unhappy people
almost outnumbered a happy people by two
to one now I don't know about you but
that scares me because people who are
unhappy in their job potentially hostile
to their organisations and can undo the
good work that the amazing happy people
do so before we get started really
started I just want to tell you a little
bit about my story now forgive me if I
read this a little bit I just don't want
to get emotional
so why should you listen to me because
I've been there I a few years ago from
the outside I had perfect job I was a
director in my company I'd been there
for a really long time so I was known
and respected I was part-time which in
the property industry particularly for
females is extremely difficult to
sustain and I was earning a really good
salary
but I was miserable I absolutely hated
my job and for those of you who are at
my talk last year you may be familiar
with the terms mondays which is the
point in a Sunday afternoon when you
feel really crappy because you know that
Monday's around the corner I was a bitch
my husband would attest that glad he's
not here now and so at my lowest point I
ended up going to my doctor and she
prescribed some stress ly for me as well
as some valium now to me that obviously
just resolves the symptoms rather than
the problem right so I am needed to
understand the problem now throughout my
career I had I've been guarded by my dad
and he helped me with my first resume he
cried when I told him of made associate
director he didn't cry when I told him I
was pregnant but that's okay that was my
dad right and he instilled in me the
importance of legacy but I didn't really
know that that was one of the values
other than work ethic and things like
that that he'd instilled in me until he
died five years ago from cancer and I
was 12 weeks pregnant at his funeral my
dad dying taught me a really valuable
lesson and that is what would what
legacy would I be leaving my kids that I
was grumpy every time I was going to
work that mummy was sad that mummy was
upset on weekends particularly Sunday
afternoons so I really and what does
that teach my kids when they're at the
age when they start to enter the
workforce that work is something to be
endured rather than something that we
can love and be passionate about and
give our whole self to so we've got to
be happy and needless to say I left that
job and I haven't reinvented myself as a
workplace happiness guru because what a
freaking awesome
that is a pheasant the reason I'm
sharing this is because yes I was crappy
and it was up to me to turn that into
something happy so today I'm here to
share with you some of the strategies
and the experiences and the tools that
that I've learned and used myself over
the years but it really is up to you
guys to do something with that so I can
lead a horse to water but I can't make
you drink but I will be there you know
kicking you out the bass if need be
so let's get on to how we can do this
[Laughter]
that's not my kid but it's pretty
awesome
right the first crappie for happy issue
is dealing with a bad boss now it was
interesting but only a handful of you
guys actually manage people so I would
bet that the vast majority of you have
had a bad boss or have witnessed a bad
boss now when I'm talking about a bad
boss I'm talking about the kind of
person that makes you feel belittled
that makes you feel unappreciated that
makes you feel crappy and this is
persistent behavior so we can all be
assholes occasionally you know we have a
bad day but I'm talking about a
persistent pattern of behavior here when
I'm talking about bad bosses now picking
the right boss is just as important if
not more important as finding the right
job now managers can change our work
situation for the better or the worse so
they can give us really great projects
or really shitty projects they can hire
aspire us bless you they can let us go
on holidays let's say no you can't do
that yet so a bad if you had a bad
manager is really bad because there's
there's power imbalance they have this
power over you and this is why having a
good relationship with your manager is
just so important but the good news is
you are not powerless you don't need to
accept about
and quite the opposite because if your
boss is not treating you right you've
got the responsibility to do something
about it I had an asshole boss he was a
passive-aggressive micro manager and
flips to say we didn't really get along
particularly well now I tried all sorts
of tools and techniques that I'm going
to explain today but nevertheless there
was just this imbalance right we just
didn't get along when I decided to leave
my job the head of HR interviewed me as
part of the exit strategy and he said to
me so would you recommend your friend
works with this boss and I said yes if
they can handle that kind of personality
now for some people a passive-aggressive
micro manager is not a problem at all my
husband would love it it seemed as a
challenge but for me it was you know who
must be skew troy on a her for me it was
the worst possible relationship that I
could have the worst possible dynamic so
that's why it's really important that we
understand that it's it's vital that we
have the right competitive compatibility
with our bosses now when we do have a
bad boss it can be absolutely tragic
because it can take nearly two years to
get over a bad boss so if you think day
after day week after week month after
month you're being belittled and put
down and all sorts of things it's going
to have an effect on you and it does
people who are bullied at work or have a
really bad manager they are more prone
to stress anxiety depression and then we
get into the fun stuff of heart attacks
and strokes so if you have a bad boss
the effects accumulative as well because
if you start feeling like crap you're
not really going to want to put in 110
percent you're going to start to become
the garbage man right which is going to
start affecting your pay rises and
promotions and things like that so it is
a cumulative effect now there what we
need to do is understand
why bosses are bad and there are
generally three types of bad bosses
there's the boss that doesn't know
they're bad right thankfully this is the
majority of bad bosses they just don't
know the effect that they have on you I
had one lady give me a call young lady
she was just new in her career she
reached out to me on LinkedIn and she
said Kylie I've started my career and
I've got this new boss but we just don't
really get along what can I do
and so I suggested to her that she note
down the problems you know so when your
boss does X it makes you feel Y which
results in that right so we have some
clear examples then take your boss out
for a coffee and so that you'd like to
discuss how you can work more
productively together now note we're
taking physically out of the workplace
so that we can both be on an equal
playing field because remember that
power imbalance right we want to try and
get on a level playing field as much as
possible thankfully that meeting went
really well with Carolyn and she gave me
a call back and said that she feel felt
so empowered to sit down had a chat with
this boss because this boss had no idea
that he was making her feel like crap
they've now also got a strategy in place
where they follow up every month so I'm
really pleased to hear about that the
second group of bad bosses are those who
know they're bad and they want to
improve I've got a client of mine who is
NIT and he runs his own company he's got
about 35 people in Australia and he
knows he can be a bit of it yes di CK
and he reached out to me and said I
really need help with my onboarding
process because it's a great process but
no-one's finishing it now don't really
know why so I came in and had a look and
we worked out that it wasn't necessarily
about the onboarding process it was
about how it made people feel so we had
a look at his culture and we had
interviews and it turns out that people
actually didn't feel like he gave them
any gratitude or acknowledgement and so
what he does now which is absolutely
awesome as he writes little notes and
even though you know one of them is a
small one for Duncan for being a star
but the big ones for Stevo because he's
awesome but if it's these kinds of
discussions that that can really
snowball into turning a workplace into
something awesome now the most dangerous
one of all you can see how to find a
people in fact the other day um is the
boss that doesn't give a either way
now these two we can handle right this
one run no matter what you do you're
going to be hitting your head against a
brick wall mostly right these guys don't
give a
so the tactics that I'm going to talk
about today really revolve around these
two okay so steps to managing a bad boss
as we've mentioned assume no bad
intentions your boss is not there trying
to be an asshole most likely even though
they are they just don't know it
so they might be just unaware of their
actions do it sooner rather than later
do you not wait for your boss to get a
promotion or get posted overseas or
resign or something like that remember
that the effects on your health are
cumulative if you wait you're only
hurting yourself choose the right time
to talk so don't just grab them in the
hallway or after a meeting set aside
dedicated time and go out of the
building to level the power imbalance
and that playing field explain the
effects on you and your work just like
Carolyn did she said when you do X it
makes me feel Y which results in Zed and
easy can relate to actual business
metrics then you've got a better chance
of your boss sitting up and taking
notice
make a plan and follow up this is
paramount I'm really pleased that
Carolyn was able to do this because it's
all well and good saying yeah yeah I
know I know and you know I've been a bit
of a dick and all of that you actually
need to have a plan because then as the
employee you feel that you've got more
control over things right so if your
boss is being a bit of a snob you can
say hey hang on a minute we said that we
were going to do it this way and so it
also
helps them be more accountable and
finally is probably one of the most
important elements now managers often
don't receive praise because we feel
that the praise should come from the top
down right let's try it from the bottom
up and see what happens I do that with
my children and I'm not suggesting that
bosses are like children but I'm going
to stop there so if they don't work
there's one more thing that might
there's proven medical benefits to just
thinking about the idea of swearing at
your boss
okay now swearing can be a fabulous
source of pain relief and it can
actually jolt your brain into becoming
more creative as well uh-huh so and you
can change your thinking space so what
I'd like you to do is think about a
really difficult person that that you've
worked with right and now imagine
confronting them and in your mind make
sure it's in your mind a half and then
the gentlest of times telling them to go
do you feel any better because I
certainly did so moving on to a happy
crappy to happy issue number two
shifting to a work/life balance now
research shows that where unhappier more
stressed and fatter than we've ever been
now this is a writer downer okay if you
have pen and paper but this is an IT
conference so no I'd like to say we live
in a world that celebrates work and
activity ignores renewal and recovery
and fails to recognize that both are
necessary for high performance okay so
we need the work and activity that we
need the rest and recovery so that when
we're working we're working at our
optimal I just want to unpack this issue
a little bit more the umbilical cord to
work is longer than it's ever been there
is this expectation now that we should
be contacted or virtually 24/7
so the blur between work and our our
personal lives is certainly blurring
even more and sorry
the term work-life balance is actually
almost a little bit misleading because
it implies that there's and that there's
an equal and equal part but it doesn't
mean an equal balance right because if
you try and work the same amount of
hours you work at work and then try and
apply that to your personal life it's
just never going to work out because
life needs to be more fluid than that so
your best individual work work-life
balance will vary over time as well so
if you're new in your career it might be
different to when you're nearing
retirement it will be different when
you're a single person versus married
you're different when you have children
so there's it will vary over time and
also there's no perfect balance that you
should be aiming for so the best
work-life balance is actually different
for each of us because we all have
different priorities in different lives
so let's think of work-life balance as
work-life integration or work-life blend
or work-life fill-in-the-blank we've got
this competing belief that people need
to work long hours in order to be
successful and do a good job but it's
absolutely crazy 30 years of working and
still going strong said this girl she's
24 years old hours just hours after
posting this tweet she collapsed fell
into a coma and died from overwork from
exhaustion and a tie energy drink one
holy moly and just hours before that as
well as she was um she was saying that
she was sorry she was contemplating
moving her bed into the office and days
before that she was saying that she was
really happy to get home before midnight
she was celebrating this people were
liking this and retweeting it and going
wow wow now this needs to be a wake-up
call because I would like all of us to
reject this
that we have of overworked someone will
say I didn't make the office to nine
o'clock so I'm going to go I didn't
leave till 10:00 it's not a competition
because long work hours they erode our
health right we don't end up being able
to have time to look after ourselves get
exercise eat properly so and once again
the effects accumulative right all these
bad things happening to you
it gets worse over time but how much
work is too much work
well 39 hours apparently and the
Norwegians have got it right because on
average they work about 30 hours a week
and they earn more money than people
that work longer hours right so there
are people there that are earning that
that are working 50 60 70 hours a week
and yet you gorgeous awesome Norwegians
have got it all sorted and are working
30 hours and have got a better work/life
balance than a lot of other developed
countries so it's it dis leads me to the
first step in improving our work-life
integration
I've seen firsthand working less and
relaxing more doesn't necessarily lead
to happiness I've tried the key is how
we isn't how we divide our time between
work and play is how we use how we focus
on the time when we're doing it so for
example most people's working time is
pretty pretty long right eight hours a
day are we always at our peak no we just
kind of go I'm going to go get a coffee
I need to go get something and then you
might have Oh
sugar I've got to get this work done for
a meeting or something like that so
really if we were to be as effective as
we could be we would be focusing much
more on how we spend our time we also
need to value our productivity over
extra hours so as I mentioned it's it's
not a case of if you need to get more
done keep working because you know your
productivity performance starts to
decrease after about 39 hours a week so
if you try and work extra hours you
probably have the effect of just being
less effective or sorry that they were
my earrings don't nod your head I was
just saying to someone the other day now
when you go and have a do your
presentation don't wear dangly earrings
do as I say not as I do right now the
next element is to unplug read regularly
now because the workday never seems to
end we need to make sure that we
actually do shut off her phone and when
we read our kids again don't check
your emails if you add a family function
turn off your phone be present now we
are very fortunate because we have
Denise Jacobs into house who Denise is
the author of banish your inner critic
and I'm sure she will agree with me when
I say that when you actually take your
mind off work and have time to recover
you become more creative right Denise is
nodding so for those that can't see so
what I just want to make sure that the
message gets through that we we have to
unplug please next element is chunking
it down having an hour of power so if
you focus on one task and then take a
short break and then go and focus for
another hour on another task you will
actually be more productive than having
the I'm gonna wander over and go and get
a coffee type thing it means they're
actually working smarter not longer we
can fit other things into the space in
our lives the next element is of course
to reject this cult of overwork let's
not be the copy copywriter who boasted
about working so hard sorry guys and
let's change our attitude and just
trying to spell this myths that we have
to work long hours in order to do a good
job and the final element is probably
the most important protect your
morning's
now there's an awesome psychologist
called Ron Friedman and he said that the
first three hours of your day
are the most precious to maximize
productivity because research shows the
brain specific specifically the
prefrontal cortex is most active and
readily creatives straight after sleep
so when you're asleep your subconscious
mind has been loosely wandering around
and when you wake up your mind is most
active to do thoughtful work I do want
to go into this a little bit more
because that's usually me in the morning
right I understand that protecting your
mornings won't work for everyone single
parents and and that it's difficult but
we can try right we can try and do it in
the context of our own lives so for
example my kids are allowed to watch TV
on the weekends so long as it's after 6
o'clock so at 6:01 i hear the
pitter-patter of little feet going
downstairs to watch the scooby-doo and
that was me but I've gone No I on
protecting my morning and I got up and I
worked a couple of hours on these
presentation just some solid work and I
was so productive it was fantastic yes I
still do this on occasion but when I
actually got out of bed and did some
work it was actually really really
fulfilling so alternatively you can wake
up a few extra hours early and try and
get some work done but it's really just
trying to make something work for
yourself now the alternative is to do
the 1991 rule so for 90 days you spend
the first 90 minutes of your day working
on your number-one priority
now I'm sure that this is not checking
social media or your emails what I want
you to do is spend your mornings on
output not input if you don't protect
your mornings a million other things
will come up because they always do so
have some respect for your time and try
and encourage your employees and your
colleagues and and your partners as well
to give you the time that you need in
the mornings right grabbing a heavy
issue number three strategies to tackle
unfairness
now we're going to try something here
I'm from Australia obviously so here I
have some 10 x 1 feet note not for you
one for you mm one for you
nine of you they go one for you ah here
we go guys
and he go this road can have some there
we go and I don't see you guys yeah I
guess you can have all three look ah you
go you're standing up there you go and
one for you okay
I bet the people that didn't get it in
ten probably treating me right now oh
yeah
what about these some Vegemite right
here you guys are hating me even more
now ah oh you need some Vegemite
absolutely they go ah all you really
want something no no you go right and
you guys are at the fact sorry I
should've given you ten times instead of
Vegemite there you go you can have to
read them okay now hands up we've got
Tim Tams so we've got more than one teen
turn we've got the Vegemite you go peels
away oh no you don't like there do I do
you okay hands up who didn't get
anything
all right I've got this method in the
madness okay those who didn't receive
anything
your army glider is actually going a bit
in your brain okay it's going kylie
sucks that's not fair I don't like her
I'm going to give her red card because I
didn't get a 10/10 to those people I say
I have the rest of the box please make
it green now what I want to illustrate
here is that fairness it's not just a
nice to have it's a biological need okay
so the people that didn't get ten terms
are there going oh Kylie you suck and
now I know for next year that apparently
dark in terms and what chocolate in
terms of the goes so you know I'll work
up to that guys okay so I'm fitting this
is one of the most demotivating factors
we can have in the workplace now whilst
fairness in itself is not enough to make
us unhappy or happy unfairness is enough
to make unhappy right so it's not always
easy to be fair I was just then saying
yeah you can have one but you can with
no apparent reason whatsoever now I was
using my bias and I didn't even know it
I just want to unpack this a little bit
more we receive 11 bits of information
at any point in time when we're awake
eleven million pieces of information but
consciously we can only process about 40
pieces of information at any one time so
for example if you are in the middle of
your home town and there's thousands of
people everywhere how do you pick your
friends face out of the crowd you
actually use your unconscious bias now I
will break this down a little bit
Malcolm Gladwell in his book blink said
that our unconscious attitudes might be
entirely
different to our conscious values for
example we consciously know that it's
absolutely absurd to pay people who are
better less money it happens it's unfair
but it happens we also know that it's
unfair that women shouldn't get equal
pay for equal work we also know that it
shouldn't be fair that people get paid
different rates just because of the
clothes that they wear yet it happens
now imagine this dynamic happening when
you're recruiting people or speaking to
your clients or customers or undergoing
a performance evaluation or training
people so what are some strategies that
we can use to tackle this unfairness we
need to recognize that we do all have
unconscious bias and because we all have
it there's nothing to be ashamed of
now Google have recognized this and they
have this big workshop that they offer
to everyone not just people in Google
right they've got this amazing workshop
that's available online and it is called
unconscious bias at work if you'd like
some more information about it check it
out it's actually really really
interesting and it's free the next
element is to step back from conclusions
it's important to remember that in jutt
injustice is in the eye of the beholder
so it's critical that we are able to
assess the situation accordingly and
there's no substitute for perspectives
so wherever you can if you feel you're
being treated unfairly have a chat to
someone talk about it because it's
likely that they will bring a different
opinion or perspective let go of what
you can't control
now you decide where you put your most
precious resource which is your energy
so you can choose to have an emotional
reaction to something being unfair and
may not giving out intense or you can
take a deep breath and choose how you
would like to respond
and thank you for not killing me um I
certainly recognize on fairness because
I'm a mom of four year old and a seven
year old and I hear it in my house all
the time money does not burn
I was also made redundant when I was
five months pregnant so I really
understand what it's like to have this
feeling of unfairness when I was made
redundant I yeah was upset it was the
first redundancy I'd ever had
I took it to heart but then I turned it
around and 15 months later the company
hired me back again at a 42 percent pay
rise my pride has a price
the next element here is to take the
moral high ground now sometimes it's
actually okay to get on your high horse
and stay there because if you just match
grudge for grudge where are you going
where they're going to get you you're
just going to expend your valuable
resource your energy so if you are up on
your high horse you've actually got a
really good vantage point from which to
look down and look objectively at
whatever your organization or coworker
or something like that is doing so take
the high road because of you from much
from there is much better anyway keep a
record I would bet that a lot of you
have faced the situation where someone
has taken ownership of an idea that you
might have come up with one way that we
can counteract that is if we have this
brilliant idea and we say hey guess what
I've just done such and such and
everyone goes that's an awesome idea you
can then send an email after that
meeting and say hey really glad you
liked that idea about what I suggested
to do XYZ
let's let's continue to work on that and
you know set out some frameworks or
something like that so if someone is
they're trying to take ownership for
something that you came up with you can
deflate a little email in front of them
and say actually
it was my idea and finally reach out
directly and privately so pick up the
phone and call them because there's no
point wasting your emotions defending
yourself to everyone else when you could
just pick up the phone and talk to the
person who treated you wrong so start
off the conversation by discussing your
intentions you don't need to justify
what you did or defend it just explain
that you thought the other person might
be misunderstood might have missed out
misunderstood if you need to apologize
for not being cleared and do so but
don't waste your emotions on things that
don't matter okay
crappy cirhappy issue number four we
love change so long as it doesn't happen
to us now change is one of the most
common causes of stress in organizations
and we know there are reasons why change
happens but does it kind of feel that
change is happening more and more it
seems to be happening more and more
quickly I feel and we've got a lot of
managers who are particularly bad at
dealing with change because they don't
realize that it is a process change is a
process it is not an isolated event and
it takes time now I know it's a graph
I'm sorry hurt there is actually a
process that we go through we go from
shock to denial to frustration
depression then we experiment with the
situation then we try and figure out how
to work in the new situation and then
finally we integrate it now this is a
really well-known change curve and it
was invented in the 1960s by Elizabeth
kubler-ross
it's also known as the five stages of
grief cycle no wonder we don't like
change it's based on a grieving process
now the oldest and strongest emotion
well we don't like change because of see
this is I find this a really interesting
quote this is an American author who
writes horror stories so he would
certainly know all about fear but we
know that change is inevitable and it's
necessary for businesses to thrive and
survive so we need to overcome these
fears but how do we do it we're scared
of failure with we've got a fear of
success fear of looking stupid a fear of
the unknown how we thrive is through
predictability and having control when
there are changes things have suddenly
thrown into a state of uncertainty now
it's perfectly normal to feel a bit
fearful a bit confused or unsettled five
changes that happen at work at first
okay once again it's a process that we
go through we're wired to respond to
change and uncertainty because we're
primed to be alert right but this can
translate into anxiety so what we need
to recognize is that change isn't this
isn't the challenge it's the transition
so some tips on embracing workplace
change first thing you need to do
acknowledge the change I know that
sounds really simple but if we
acknowledge it it means that we can face
it it means that we can understand the
impact that it has on us it means that
it's an actual thing now I worked for
this one boss and he promised me an
awesome promotion if I did a particular
project really well and we got it
through council and all of that and I
worked my bum off and I'm really really
one of this promotion and then all of a
sudden he left he went overseas well
there goes my hope of my next promotion
and I feel really bitter because the
person that came in had no idea that I
have this discussion
with my old boss and so I could choose
to get shitty or I could choose to focus
on the next goal and so the next goal
resulted in my son being born twelve
months later the goldstone owers have to
be related to work so by setting a new
goal we can bring about these wonderful
mind shift so I went from oh god I'm you
know my job and promotion and all about
to I'm gonna have a baby so we can and
if you can imagine for a woman it's a
huge mindset shift amazing mindset shift
the next element that we can that we can
do to embrace workplace changes to talk
about it I had lots of lunches with
girlfriends to discuss the challenges
that I faced at work because there were
times when I was scared for my job and
clearly you know one of those realities
came through when I was made redundant
but what I did was by talking to my
girlfriends and there to help give me a
reality check and breaks broke the
breaks broke the negatives pattern in my
head so I needed to stay positive as
well because fear can come from creating
all these negative scenarios okay we can
we can just build these things up into
catastrophic and horrible things that we
think are going to happen to us but if
we understand the transition and have
realistic expectations we are able to
deal with it a lot better for example
when we first jump into a swimming pool
sometimes it's really cold right but we
stay in it because after a few minutes
we get used to it think about change in
that sense if you wonder
stands that it's a process and that yeah
it's going to be uncomfortable initially
but I'm going to get used to it and then
I'm going to absolutely love it
then we're able to deal with things a
lot better and finally get involved in
the change if you're hoping to drive the
change then you will most likely be more
understanding of the rationale behind us
because often change we feel that it's
just from the top down so to have a
degree of control over the change itself
is absolutely vital and if we keep
working and keep giving ourselves a
sense of purpose and accomplishment
we'll be able to keep up our morale as
well and we know that that changes the
new constant in the workplace we're all
we're all here in IT and here at the
conference because things are moving so
quickly and we want to start to date
with what's going on so you have taken
the first step from crappy to happy by
being here today and as I mentioned in
the beginning it's now over to you guys
to see what you do with that information
because I've given you the kick in the
butt it's up to you guys to do something
about it because without a clear purpose
the mind will wonder often into a
useless place so don't let that place be
crappy I hope you learned something
today if you didn't I have 10 terms if
you did I have 10 terms
I am Kylie hunt and I would like to open
the floor up to any questions that you
might have anyone have any questions I
should have remembered this is Norway
has anyone been through similar
situations before yes sir
so I'm kind of picky now then oh yes
okay so if Denis had very packages
Denis had a boss who made her come in at
before nine o'clock each morning and no
one else in her team did need to do that
and she would often send her boss home
to his pregnant wife at seven o'clock at
night and she would obviously still be
there it was an awful situation and you
got out okay so denise is now never
going to work in a corporate environment
again because of that situation and
you're not the only person that has been
true that my I won't say who someone I
know worked in a corporate environment
and he his role and his level of
importance was dictated by the size of
his office by how many tiles were in the
roof in his office as well as how close
his parking space was to the building
what do you think that says to the rest
of the people in the organisation and
the kinds of values that that
organization has I know of a company who
who was making loads and loads of staff
cuts and redundancies and things to the
point where they didn't have fresh
flowers and receptions they had fake
flowers in reception in fake water I
didn't even know that was possible
but you can have fake water so it's
those things that those messages that
these companies send us that can drive
us away and if we have a boss that
cherishes what we do understands us
knows how to motivate us because we're
not all motivated by money a lot of us
are motivated by how many tiles are in
our office space or how close our car
spaces to the building that's true or it
might be that people are made of
motivated by and having access to
management so having a say over how
things are run or having training
courses or being able to go to awesome
events like this or being given ten
times or something or other
everyone's motivated by different things
and they might want flexibility and so
if we have this element of fairness and
happiness in an organization that there
are proven business metrics now I might
just see actually if I do have this I
have a slide that I put in almost every
single presentation because I can almost
feel
the questions being asked so imagine
today's Thursday thank you
sorry filling the other day I didn't
know what day was so imagine going back
into the office on Monday right and your
boss says so how is the conference and
you can you go it was awesome I got
interns or I didn't or exactl something
or other and the boss says okay did you
learn anything and you go yes what did
you learn I learnt that happiness is
important right and so I have this
awesome slide because all sorts of
wonderful things happen when we're happy
our profitability goes up user ratings
go up to turn over goes down shrinkage
okay that means best okay goes down
absenteeism goes down the odds of
success goes up by 400% when you have
happiness as part of the agenda so
please if you're going to take anything
away let it be Tim Tams and this slide
that you can show to management to say
that happiness matters it's not just
some airy-fairy thing even though I call
myself a workplace happiness guru I can
call myself whatever I like because I
have this ability to be able to go out
and speak to people and strick the
importance of having happy people
because we know how shitty and
demoralizing and just soul destroying it
can be when we don't have a culture that
nourishes what it is that we do and as I
mentioned in the beginning what legacy
are we leaving our kids the next
generation is we put up with crappy
workplaces it's up to us to do something
about it and I'm absolutely thrilled
that you guys have been here today thank
you kindly for your time I will give you
an early mark if you like or I'm here to
take questions as well if you like thank
you kindly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
