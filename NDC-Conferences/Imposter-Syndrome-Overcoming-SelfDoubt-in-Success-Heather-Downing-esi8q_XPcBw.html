rewiring your brain who's surprised
that's actually what we get to learn
today yeah nice after having such a
great opening keynote I was it kind of
excited to bring that correlation
together so this is the topic that I
have for you today and before I get into
it I'd like to tell you a little bit
something about myself once I stopped my
alarm alright so my name is Heather
downing I'm from Kansas City Missouri
and I have coded for right about six to
seven years now I'm at net developer I
have been working with Fortune 500
companies almost since the beginning so
right away I got to work with a very
large company as an intern who shall not
be named that does tax preparation and
and I got to experience what it was like
to put together XML for every single
state in the United States and so that
was exciting for me to start off right
off the bat so I didn't do anything
small-scale I also am a speaker this is
now my third time speaking out of the
country and I'm really excited to be in
Australia yes very excited and I'm an
entrepreneur so along the tails of that
is that I'm an entrepreneur in the
equestrian space I am an equestrian
myself I do mounted archery so does
anybody done it before I'm in the room
oh I thought I thought for sure we'd
have some Aussies here who do that
funnily enough the Australian mounted
horseback archery Association has the
second most people in the world that do
horseback archery so now
brave is a reality for all of you guys
to do it down in South Australia I think
they did quite a bit of it so I thought
I would come here for sure and meet at
least half of you doing that sport
disappointed I also am an elven vocalist
as anybody seen Lord of the Rings yes
I'm that nerdy so I sing in languages
that aren't real and I've done about
three albums worth of it I finally
pulled it off Spotify because I got
tired of being asked questions and a
language that I have not studied for a
bit I'm also I'm also a
semi-professional
so if you're all willing to take a
Heather selfie with me at some point
during the conference please come up and
say I just need to have their selfie
with you I'll tweet it out with your
handle and we'll go from there or you
can just talk to me about how I can be
flown over at some point and do a nice
professional set up for you sound good
all right so just this year I started
working with Alexa and that was
something I wanted to do as a net
developer because it was something that
was kind of a little bit against what
Amazon wanted you to do they wanted you
to do everything in node nothing wrong
with that but I wanted to see if it
could be done so that's kind of what I'm
known for now is dealing with NLP
processing and what it means to actually
converse and communicate with your users
so after all of this I still feel like a
fake hey that's interesting because I
oftentimes love to hear the introductory
section of a talk how much time does
somebody amazing like Troy hunts or
Richard Campbell or Jennifer Marshman
spend I'm telling you who they are very
little time it was incredibly
uncomfortable for me to stand up here
for five minutes and tell you all of the
things that I've done because that makes
me sound like I'm bragging and maybe
that is what that is and I want to be a
so far away from that that it makes me
physically uncomfortable I'm not the
only one that feels like this among high
achievers the truth is about 70 percent
of the people in our industry have felt
like this at one time or another and a
lot of people have this issue persist
regularly myself being one of them so
before we go into the definition of what
this is I want to remind you that I am
NOT a psychologist but I have looked
into this extensively because this is
something that I wanted to bring up to
the developer community specifically
we're not necessarily thrust out into
the spotlight oftentimes we get to kind
of retreat to our cubicles or our
amazing dungeon lairs and we don't have
to necessarily talk about what we do
and when sometimes when you're going
through this it makes it sort of feel
like you shouldn't belong as part of
this community
it's so not true some of those brilliant
people I've ever met
struggle to accept that they've given
anything of value so that's the reason I
wanted to bring it specifically to
developers is because I have a logical
mind
we all have logical minds right and I
didn't want this to just be a touchy
feely subject there's a little bit of it
but a lot of it is about what can we do
about it okay so that's what I'm gonna
do I'm going to present you some
scientific research about what this is
I'm gonna tell my story about how I
found out about it and what made me need
to what successful people think about
that don't have this issue so that we
can kind of rewire our brains think more
the way that they do and what we can do
about this for others too so let's say
that you don't feel this way but maybe
somebody else does we're gonna go into
that in detail all right so according to
Wikipedia imposter syndrome can be
defined as a collection of feelings of
inadequacy that persist even in the face
of information that indicates the
opposite is true is experienced
internally as chronic self doubts and
feelings of intellectual fraudulence
sounds really serious and I was reading
that like I don't know if that's what I
have I just I what
so I decided to look into some
scientific studies around this how did
it even start many of you may be
familiar with it but I wasn't so
according to the Journal of behavioral
science there was a paper published
about women who were having problems
believing that they were bright and they
really have fool people into their
positions or into the I don't know the
papers they actually wrote that's the
way that and they were starting to feel
because for impostor success does not
mean happiness this is an important
distinction here that there's a
difference between being humble and just
not being able to accept it to the point
of where when you do it excel at
something it actually makes you feel
uncomfortable and you experience the
and stress and self-doubt with all of
your achievements
so imposter fears kind of interfere with
a person's ability to accept and enjoy
anything that you achieve and they have
a negative impact on your psychological
well-being especially when facing an
achievement related task which is almost
everything on a Trello board and here's
what all of those things right because
you often experience uncontrollable
anxiety due to your fear of failure so
at one point in time when I first
started playing around with the idea of
an agile development process I was like
oh oh you all you have to do is a sliver
this little thing and then you can put
it into a you know a little done section
and other people can look at it for you
that sounds exciting once you get to
drag it into done but I was so worried
that it wasn't really done that I never
enjoyed moving that card over ever cuz
I'm like oh I know I just know I forgot
I just know I forgot something or
they've got to be more to it than that
some people might say that was because I
started out in a waterfall style of
development and I moved into an agile
style of development but had nothing to
do that because even when we were
planning things for six months I still
felt that way every time I would try to
build an API so burnout is really part
of this emotional exhaustion and loss of
intrinsic motivation poor achievement
including guilt and shame about your
success are reinforced by this cycle I
thought that part was really interesting
guilt and shame about your success
nobody really wants to admit that they
feel that way so I'm not gonna be give
me a raise of hands how many people feel
guilty for being successful that sounds
like a first-world problem doesn't it
I'm so sorry that you feel bad about
doing good things alright it doesn't
sound like anything we should be worried
about but it actually has a huge impact
on you being able to survive as a
developer and just for you I drew a nice
little diagram do not critique my UX
skills so let's say you are in a
fictional company working on
fictional tasks that you've never done
before I'm a.net developer so I'm gonna
go ahead and say I was asked to build an
API in node don't really do drive a
script but I said yes because that's
what it takes to put food on the table
okay so I don't really have an option to
say no I said yes we'll go into those
details later and I decided okay I have
to go do the thing so that is the
achievement really tasks I have to do it
in a specific amount of time let's say
two weeks okay now you can go a couple
of different ways with this but usually
what I end up doing is immediately
worrying that I said yes to this and
then I sit there and I chomp on it so
either that leads to procrastination
where I'm like oh I know I got to do
that but gosh that's just so
overwhelming I don't want to deal with
that right now or I immediately just
stress about it and think I think I have
to just immerse myself in this which
sounds exciting but not if you're doing
it 23 hours a day then you're just kind
of going overboard and over preparing
trying to figure everything out about
node in detail down to things you'll
never use as part of what you're trying
to achieve but you just have to know all
the things so those are one of the two
pathways that you choose okay so let's
say in two weeks you do end up
delivering your little node API hooray
so there's like this temporary little
feeling of relief like oh god I
published it just in time right and then
you get some positive feedback from your
client saying wow this isn't amazing cuz
you were transparent cuz everybody
should be transparent with their client
that you don't know a language before
you build something and they're like wow
this is really impressive you did this
in a language that you are not familiar
with and a framework you've never used
and you did it in the time allowed
you're amazing this is amazing so you
get that feedback and immediately an
imposter will discount it and say oh no
no no if I procrastinated until the last
second like the last three days okay and
then I dive into it and it worked I will
say well ash because I got lucky right
but if I was the person who obsessed
over it and never slept for two weeks
I wanted to learn everything about
noting and probably write a couple of
Pluralsight courses on it at this point
then I attributed that to the amount of
effort I put in oh that's only because I
just didn't sleep for two weeks and this
the only reason that this happened
either way they're both discounting it
right so because you discounted it
sometimes heavily then after that
conversation is done you start
internalizing it and then you start
telling yourself wow I hated that
feeling I hated the feeling of not
knowing what to do or I hated the
feeling that I got during that process
you know I really am NOT very good
developer it really should be better at
this why the X they even do this in the
first place why am i coding and this
whole loop starts again so even though
you might have done something that was
textbook just did exactly what your your
client said or you manager said or your
team needed if you discount that
feedback that will send you in this
imposter cycle over and over and it
actually is a downward spiral
it isn't just on one level it's downward
spiral like a like a twister like a
tornado I think goes all the way down on
the ground so is this really a big deal
I mean it's not that big of a deal
actual question got from a real
developer is that really a big deal do
we care about that because if you have
confidence then you would kind of
dismiss this like oh that person just
needs to believe in themselves more
right it sounds a lot easier than what
it really is when I had this
conversation with a developer it was
somebody who lacked empathy I'm sure
you've met a developer who lacks a
little bit of empathy anybody ever gone
on Stack Overflow before there's a
little bit of hacking here and so no
joke he said well I know you're going to
talk about imposter syndrome but I want
to produce a talk that says you don't
have imposter syndrome you're just a big
baby I don't I don't think that's
probably the best thing to do and this
is the quote that I had given him in an
email you know
the Intelligent are full of doubt okay
we're the ones who are full of doubt
sometimes people are a little
overconfident and don't look where
they're going and they trip and fall so
to also point this out to this guy about
exactly kind of where he fell on the
scale
I found this level a little drawing
about a couple of different things has
anybody here heard of the dunning-kruger
effect oh cool some intelligent Ozzy's
here I like it the dunning-kruger effect
has to do with how good you think you
are and how good you really aren't
that's that's kind of what I would like
to describe there somebody who says I'm
an architect you're chuckling because
you know I'm an architect I know what
I'm doing this is what you're all gonna
do
and yes I'm amazing and I will take the
credit I'm surely nobody here has ever
dealt with anybody like that right I
like to call him if you ever watched a
Disney movie called Beauty and the Beast
I like to call that the the gaston of
the developer world right who thinks
he's really great but maybe isn't then
you have the guy who's really doing all
the work
who's putting in all of that work and
accomplishing amazing things but just
things that he's never gonna get
anywhere with it even though he built
almost whole system himself right behind
that architect right so you kind of have
people on two opposite ends of the scale
the healthy place to be is right in the
middle that is ideal so I'm sure you're
asking yourself right now am i an
impostor hmm I don't know but if you
feel like a fake and you attribute your
success to look and you discount your
level of success when you reflect
probably so so then who else is affected
by this
I mean what are the actual statistics
about this so when I was looking into
why these things were happening to me
and that sounds kind of strange when I
say why these things are happening what
I mean by that is why I felt frozen
anytime I was in a code review and I
couldn't speak up because I didn't feel
qualified to speak up at a code review
that I was supposed to have input on I
was
host to do that because I wasn't invited
it was just assumed that I knew so it
wasn't like directly invited to have
feedback even though the whole team does
I often just wouldn't say anything
because clearly I'm the one with six to
seven years experience and these other
people have 20 why would I speak up at
all in any of this so the amount of time
that I've been in this field had a big
impact into whether or not I would say
anything and I wanted to know how many
other people feel felt like that so
according to Amy Cuddy who is a
fantastic TED speaker 50% of people who
contacted her privately about their
issues were actually men so even though
the original study was done on women
back in 1978 they found out that men
actually go through this quite a bit now
in our industry if you just want to
crunch numbers obviously I am in the
minority just like other racial
minorities in terms of people who are
programmers or identify what sounds
weird self-identify as a programmer you
know what I mean
say I do code I code things that I'm
obviously in the minority there so it's
no surprise that quite a few people who
have talked to me about this are male
and especially in an environment where
they feel like they're hmm being put on
display I use that code reviews as as an
example because it's it was originally
supposed to be something that encourages
everybody to learn from each other and
it has become how have you screwed up
today Sean or sat there you know and
sometimes it becomes that for the wrong
reasons and it kind of leads people down
this path the statement people are going
to think whatever they want to about me
and there's nothing I can do about it
kind of goes along with this concept I
actually looked into a little bit more
about how the imposter phenomenon
affects racial minorities as well so
according to the Journal of Counseling
Psychology the University of Austin just
this year did a study about how this
degrades the mental health of minority
students who perceive prejudice
against them okay which is an
interesting statement there are so many
people that feel this way in a racial
minority that like out of 332 minority
undergrads that are like black Latino
and Asian backgrounds felt that they
they couldn't succeed in their program
even though they were straight-a
students on paper they passed every test
and sometimes were beyond it but they
felt like they would never be taken
seriously in their craft because they
were not necessarily because they were a
minority but that's just the way
unconsciously they would be perceived so
they're just never going to make it and
these are people who are on the honor
roll who many many different accolades
would drop out of college in their
senior year because they felt it just
they'd never make it you know even
though they're the ones who attribute
you know gave the most to the program
kind of crazy isn't it about how we
perceive things versus how others
perceive things so there's some credible
people out there who also have gone
through this just in case you were
interested in identifying with one of
them dr. Margaret Chan is amazing she's
done quite a bit of work in the World
Health Organization and she says that
there are an awful lot of people out
there who think she's an expert but
there's she's so much more aware of the
things that she doesn't know this is a
woman who is revered by many and she
constantly deflects any sort of praise
and even Albert Einstein says the
exaggerated esteem in which my life work
is held makes me very ill at ease I feel
compelled to think of myself as an
involuntary swindler if this guy feels
this way there has to be something to it
I knew that some celebrities also went
through this so Tom Hanks how did I get
here when are they going to discover
that I am in fact a fraud and take
everything away from me
it's a high-wire act
we all walk this is a man who has two
Academy Awards and he said this this
year the best advice I've ever received
is no one else knows what they're doing
either it's true it probably is every
time like I don't know I don't know
enough about this to talk about it why
am I talking about it I'm reminded yeah
but no either we learned it for this and
then of course Natalie Portman said that
when she got into Harvard right after
the release of episode 1 she assumed
that people would think she just got in
because she was famous and not because
she had the intellectual chops to get in
to Harvard
well those exams are blind and they
can't see me who you are and so she
obviously got in at her own volition
it's amazing she's also a very
scientific person you guys should look
at her if you haven't already and Will
Smith I still doubt myself every single
day what people believe is my
self-confidence is actually my reaction
to fear this is interesting
because I found a story about Will Smith
about how way back in the Fresh Prince
of bel-air days maybe before your time
in the days when he first started he
would go around the set and pull pranks
on people whoopee cushions you know you
know paint their seats like he would do
that all over the place and just pull
pranks in them because he was so nervous
all the time that he had to let out his
energy he was so freaked out just
standing in wardrobe getting ready to go
on the set that he had he had to do
something with that energy and he would
actually tremble when he did I Robot he
would tremble right before a shot and so
much so that he had to learn new
breathing techniques so he wouldn't
shake so obviously his reaction to fear
was to be funny was to jump around and
it actually ended up serving him pretty
well early on but we all know now that
he is kind of a double talent he can do
comedy he can do dramatic things as well
and that was because he's had to learn
how to live with this there are also
some author
that I discovered that go through this
to Steven Pressfield has a wonderful
book called the war of art and it's
specifically poignant to us developers
if you ever get to a point where you
have writer's block or coders book you
need to look at that it kind of
addresses that issue
I like his quote if you find yourself
asking yourself and your friends
am I really a writer am I really an
artist chances are that you are the
counterfeit innovator is wildly
self-confident and the real one is
scared to death maybe Neil Gaiman made
more of your tone yeah the first problem
of any kind of even limited success is
the unshakable conviction that you are
getting away with something and then at
any moment now they will discover you
are you starting to notice a theme and
Maya Angelou you've heard of her yeah
okay she's written 11 books but each
time she thinks they're going to figure
her out and she's run a game on everyone
she's one of the most celebrated authors
of our time so then let's get a little
bit more personal shall we let's talk
about it in the tech world I actually
had the opportunity to meet Sheryl
Sandberg this year and she says that
there are still days when she wakes up
feeling like a fraud and not sure she
should be where she is
you know the CEO of Facebook still
doesn't think she should be there
Richard Kate right Richard says that
he's made a lot of mistakes and most
intelligence comes from failure because
you learn more when you fail than if you
had just breezed by success and of
course Scott Hanselman I feel like a
phony sometimes sometimes I joke hey
it's a good day my badge still works or
I answer how are you with I'm still
working I thought that was interesting a
good friend of his and I'll get into
this a little bit later a good friend of
his also struggled with an imposter
syndrome issue and decided to tackle it
a different way but the best way that he
could have tackled it is by talking
about it that seems to be a
common theme is that whenever we have an
issue maybe if we talk about it more
openly we'll discover a way to get over
it
so the next question is if you feel like
this at all is this a healthy concern or
is it an illogical doubt the way that I
like to think about it is best put my CS
Lewis which is humility is not thinking
less of yourself but thinking of
yourself
less it's the best way to think of it
that's the difference between humility
and insecurity you know if you feel
humbled and stunned by the world around
you then it's a sign you should embrace
what you don't know this is the whole
reason now that I do something called
running towards fear so if you're kind
of afraid of something that's a sign
that maybe you should definitely dive
into it for example I cannot swim I know
because I have a serious fear of water
even though I was raised in Southern
California didn't make me very popular
as a teenager but that's something that
I want to run towards so it's on my
bucket list I know that I have to do it
cuz I have to conquer it because it's
like this weight on my shoulders that is
a good sign that you should conquer that
thing so the real question is is this
detrimental to your career as a
developer right fear can utterly
dominate our behavior it stops us
thinking and helping and learning
discovering and sharing the things that
we need in abundance because you know
fear is the mind killer it's true so
what is that true meaning of fake it
till you make it I really hate that
statement because it implies that
something isn't true and that doesn't
really help us right if we're thinking
this way I think that we need to
reiterate that every one of us are in
various stages of not knowing what we're
doing even these experts that you've all
come to learn from at this very
conference are in various stages of not
knowing what they're doing it's true
even Lars you need to convert your
curiosity into confidence so if you're
curious about something you need to be
confident that you're gonna figure it
out that's the best way to kind of look
at this is that you are the detective
for whatever it is that's going on if
that means what's going on is something
that's inward that means you need to
kind of look inward and decipher what it
is that's going on inside of you and
that's something that I could really
grab ahold of as a developer it's
something that was logical I need to
know psychologically what's happening in
my brain you have to interpret fear as
excitement so this is the rewire your
brain part anytime you're afraid you
tell everybody I'm so excited to speak
it and he sees me
not that I'm about to throw up but five
minutes of four of this talk which is
totally true you know because I'm so
excited to be here I am but I'm also so
afraid it's going to go badly right
that's that's how I had to convert it I
had to convert it and I had to start
saying it out loud and then it started
to become true it's good to know what
you lack I know that I lack memory so
there's just not a lot of hard drive
space up here and so I'm not very good
at memorizing anything luckily I can
Google things all the time
it was fantastic for me when it comes to
presentations I always have to remind
myself with notes as I go and I worry oh
great they're gonna be like she can't
she didn't even memorize this hour-long
talk you know people are going to get at
me for that and I realized it doesn't
matter because I'm excited to share what
I discovered about this with you and
that is what matters right so that's me
converting my fear into curiosity into
confidence okay don't compare yourself
to other people please we've heard that
for years but it's really important in
the tech industry and by being able to
identify these impostor feelings and
recognizing them for what they are
I've been able to know that they are
just feelings and not facts I really
like that part that's what I really kind
of identified with because remember the
story that you are telling yourself
about your competence or incompetence
it's all invented so I'm going to tell
you about my story then the reason that
I even looked into this in the first
place is because I
had just become a senior developer whoo
I could put senior on there all the
recruiters start calling yes
and I was given a project to do and
again I'd never done it before because
what else is new right there's only a
million JavaScript frameworks that come
out every year so I was given a project
I'd never done before and I said sure I
can do it because I was eager to prove
my senior ness yes let's do this
I said yes I was given a week I said
okay so I hold up for a while and I
dreaded it and I kinda didn't want to
touch it I danced around the parts that
I felt were easy for me but I left the
meat of it just kind of on the table and
I just waited until the last three days
so wait till last three days could not
figure it out I was down to our ten and
I got called over by my manager and he
said hey where are you at with this
project it's really important that we
have it it's a financial piece for a
very large company and I said yeah about
that yeah just give me a little bit
longer by the way do you know anything
about this
it was security should anything about
security and he goes what where are you
at with this oh I am I'll show you it a
little bit no show me now you know so he
sat down with me and realized I had
written about 15% of what I needed to
and so he called him the troops and
everybody on the team just you know
swatched around and worked at it and we
missed her deadline so we lost the
contract because of me so I got fired
it's a really big deal is that I had
gotten in my own head so much about it
all that I lost something that I'd
worked so hard for and it wasn't me
failing as a junior developer as an
intern this is me failing as a senior
how do you think you feel being let go
after something like that it was
devastating to me that whole cycle as
well I failed at this why am I even a
developer maybe I'm faking it and I
don't belong here at all even though
I've been doing this for a few years
surely I'm not cut out for this because
I didn't succeed at it right
so because I got in my own way so much
it cost me a job and this is of course a
little bit more of the extreme but if
you don't get out of your own way and
believe that the things you have built
are correct and asked for help when you
need to this can be absolutely
detrimental to your career because I was
too busy telling myself I didn't know
how to do this and I'm not good at it
that that is what came to fruition I was
a self-fulfilling prophecy from day one
because I told myself I'm not cut out
for this it's great that they think I'm
a senior but I'm not cut out for this so
I made it true and so the next time that
you have a team member that fails pretty
significantly like that sometimes it's
best to realize that they might be going
through the same thing none of us were
born coding unless somebody can tell
them is anybody born coding no this is a
learned skill I don't want to anybody
can learn it anybody who wants to be
persistent enough can learn this so if I
was persistent enough I could have been
successful at this eventually but that
failure was important because it taught
me that I was my own worst enemy and I
don't ever want another developer to go
through that that's part of why I'm
bringing this to you so when I thought
about how do I stop feeling like this
because it was uncontrollable almost
like an anxiety attack
it was uncontrollable I couldn't help it
I started looking at the way successful
people who did not have imposter
syndrome were functioning I needed to
know what their thought patterns were so
I did a case study and some people at my
work that I felt were amazing they were
speaking all over the world or were
really doing incredible things and their
teams and I wanted to know how do they
respond to certain situations so we have
ABA we have a project manager heather is
actually in charge of SEO and Preston is
in charge of a development manager okay
so these are people that are wildly
successful the place that I worked and I
wanted to ask them a question how do you
approach having to deliver something
you've never done before
I wanted to know how they would
done it Karen said well the first step
would be to get with someone who knows I
like how candid she was in that response
because to me that indicated weakness as
if we are all these animals are going
around you know jockeying for first
position and we can't show weakness it's
actually not true at all in a team
that's functional
Brad says you know to ask for
appropriate discovery time and pad your
estimates generously Heather also
thought that if you are transparent
about where you are at that way you
don't offer to hit a bar that's kind of
outside of the realm of speed right and
Preston said to try not to make
commitments to set yourself up for
failure which is basically a reiteration
of what Heather said so then I asked
them these perfect people what was your
most memorable mistake that led to
growth I challenge each of you to talk
to a mentor this way and see what they
say
Karen released a bug into production it
didn't catch it pretty big bug social
security information
Brady big bug Brad accidentally deleted
years worth the database records none of
us have voted on that before I however
thought she could do everything on a
project herself and she failed that
started sounding familiar to me and
Preston said he didn't pay enough
attention to the connection to the signs
that things were going badly and didn't
read the situation properly so it got
him burned he ended up losing some
really good people on his team for a man
so then I thought okay so now you
actually are human how do you keep going
after major failure like that and Karen
said if you do fail you know things
still need to get done she's very much a
push on anyway kind of warrior princess
and Brad said you know everything you do
is a tiny drop in the bucket of life
it's not that big of a deal
overall are you gonna think about this
near you might but well anybody else hmm
that poor guy at AWS Heather has the
stubbornness to not quit
because she constantly has something to
prove I bet many people in this room
probably identify with that statement
and Preston was very good about speaking
to a lot of his subordinates this way
failing at something does not mean that
you yourself are a failure just look at
ways to improve or decide it is not in
your wheelhouse but become self-aware
that's probably the biggest thing that
you should take away is to become
self-aware of where you're at so then I
asked some leaders about this because
these are the people you know who cut
our paychecks and give us money and I
wanted to know what they think about
some of these things so John was my boss
at a company I worked for a now at vml
and he said to do everything to become
the expert even if you don't feel that
you'll reach it yet let it drive you and
find the joy in discovering this is
important especially when you find that
your task is boring
try to find the joy in it and it will
propel you and from the creative side
our chief creative officer said that you
have to have a level of fearlessness to
do what you do because more than
anything you have to listen to others
and realize that people want you to
succeed that statement that the very end
there was told to me the very first time
I gave a talk out in Nebraska I said
these people are just gonna know that
I'm not really qualified to be an expert
to be up here
let's City gap but everybody coming to
your talk is given an hour of their life
to you and they want you to do it well
with it they want you to succeed so
don't worry about that we're all on your
side and then of course our CEO said
that there's a fine line between
humility and lack of confidence and
pride if you think it's luck you will
stop being able to repeat successes John
said that nobody's useless everybody can
have a role on a project and the people
he knows will succeed will own up to the
failed attempts that's probably the
hardest part and actively demonstrate
that they learned they are relentless in
their pursuit and an attitude of
positivity and ability to visualize
success is really key good leaders can
see the eventual positive outcome in a
person and he looks for someone who does
not remain frozen by the failure like I
remain frozen so when I entered
you'd him and I said you know I lost a
job because of this now I'm talking to a
guy who currently employs me how about
that that that's pretty transparent
wouldn't you say I actually lost a job
because of this and he's like yeah but
did you learn I said yes he's like
that's why you're here don't forget to
give that kind of a feedback to anybody
else on your team whether they're above
below you were right alongside you don't
be scared of failure be scared of not
finding the truth that's really what
matters in all of this if the truth is
you have holes in your shall we say
education does anybody have holes in
their computer science education
Wow nice you really know minute great I
don't have a degree so I would say yes I
did this in five months and I did like a
little startup bootcamp to do net and I
definitely have a little bit of a hole
when it comes to writing my own
algorithm maybe I'm using other people's
and so I know I have these holes I don't
understand big o-notation what is that
even
and so there's a guy who came along his
name is Rob Connery has a fantastic
handbook called the Impostors handbook
and it literally goes over the things
that as a developer you should know you
should probably know this and if you
don't know this is what it means it has
nice little drawings in it and he
recently came out with a video series of
all of the exercises if you want to go
through them it's totally worth the
money it's not very expensive and I
highly suggest that you check it out but
let's say yeah this is all well and good
for somebody who's currently
experiencing this but what if you're not
what if somebody on your team is
experiencing this there are some things
that you can do for them you can
attribute their successes to internal
factors it's not external this is
something that's also being spoken about
for little girls so often times you know
with little boys little girls we are
conditioning them by saying certain
things to them when they're young and
it's the same for any employees that you
may have so instead of - a little girl
saying oh you're so pretty
maybe n - little boy saying yourself so
you're so smart you can say you're so
curious you're so adventure
and two little girls saying you pay so
much attention to detail because some of
those things you're born with and that's
not something that they can actually
influence by their actions versus the
ones that they can so make sure that
when you congratulate somebody on it you
don't use arbitrary where it's like
smart you use words like oh you were
very persistent or whatever it is those
are important distinctions that
eventually can help rewire the brain and
discourage comparisons with others this
is the third time I've said it but it's
really important if they start saying oh
well maybe if I did it like this like
that person literally stopped them in
the tracks and this doesn't matter
whether they are on the same level as
you or they report to you please stop
them in their tracks it's okay to be
rude and say Kelly just let's change the
subject because you're going off in a
direction that isn't that true and
remind them that they were work in
progress just like all of us just like
you know the freeway systems that are
always under construction we are we are
a work in progress to get better at
where we need to be and just remind them
that we all are that way and give
encouragement to fail better I don't
really know how well people understand
that last one
what is failing better even mean I
thought that that was such an arbitrary
statement I didn't know what that meant
how do you fail better you feel better
okay making the most out of the
information you got from the failure and
reprogramming your brain to not ever go
down that path again that's really how
you feel better as you look at it as an
opportunity to put in some really good
programming in your brain that's how you
feel better you actually have to use it
you can't just be so ashamed of the
situation that you hide from it you have
to actually look at it and study it and
go oh this is interesting just like any
sort of scientific research right oh
look at this some of it I did all right
so why did that happen
all these things and start looking into
it and this is not something that
someone else should do for the person
this is something they have to do for
themselves just remind them and
encourage them to fail better so let's
shift our focus okay we need to give
encouragement to get encouragement and
that cycle will repeat
seems to team up with a friend or
somebody else that isn't even in the
place that you work and talk up the
skills that that other person has like
without even being invited to just start
talking about it post about them and
they will start doing the same for you
it's called Cobra Gein and it totally
works
it has especially worked and the women
in technology circuit we have started
doing quite a bit of that so just
remember to be kind to yourself please
the technology world is really hard on
us and like only gets you so far
eventually people are gonna figure out
whether or not you know what you say you
know because it's kind of hard to argue
with a working versus a non-working
application right remember that you were
the one that acted on the opportunities
that you were presented so you're not an
imposter for trying something that may
not work you are a hero for trying it at
all we deal with stuff that impacts the
whole world imagine the you were working
on aviation software and those are the
lives of passengers and pilots up in the
sky that if just one bug could
technically you know cost them the loss
of lives those can be really big things
right so for us to even try down this
path it's pretty brave to do it's not
who you are that is holding you back
it's who you think that you're not so
before I wrap up let's go over the
solution you have to discover how to be
self-aware and recognize what these
emotions are whether it's in yourself or
someone else update your view of failure
as an intense growth opportunity because
it definitely was for me
I not only moved up after that I
actually moved up and over and into a
company that allows me to come and speak
overseas without charging me for
vacation time I mean that's pretty
amazing and I just said this is who I
really am so I really need to be what I
want to do and they said let's align
with that let's work on it
that was an opportunity that I asked for
and I ceased and fake it until you
become it
not fake it to you make it fake it until
you become it and make sure that you pay
it forward it is so important for you to
be the very first one at the office or
wherever you're working whether it's a
remote or in a team to be the first one
to complement we have to do it because
if you don't do it then the whole
atmosphere is dark and it changes
especially if you're in a place where
you you can't really control a whole lot
of the culture coming from the top down
you know from a certain company this is
something that you can change you can
change the attitude of everybody on your
team if every day you said something
about what they do and their job that is
a compliment that's an actual compliment
something that they can really thrive on
so that maybe someday when somebody says
hey it's really cool that you climbed on
the back of your crazy Arabian horse and
tried to shoot an arrow off of it and
fell and clearly didn't do it well maybe
eventually you'll be able to do it for
real and take off in ways that you
didn't even expect because you just did
it one little encouragement at a time
there's a whole network of people that
have been in my life that has allowed me
to be braver about each step that I take
up and remember you don't have to attain
perfection or mastery to be worthy of
the success that you've achieved so if
you'll do me a favor and go brag on
somebody today and talk about it stay
curious
thank you
