Jessica Kerr better known as Jessa Tron
and I'm here to talk about development
automation I am super excited about
development automation I don't think I
have to sell developers much on
automation itself it's what we do it's
our superpower we help other people by
making their work faster making it
easier for them to do the same things
they already do we also with software
make things possible that weren't even
possible before so there's like there's
fighter jets that go so fast that human
can't pilot them alone humans in their
set in the direction but the perturbance
is in the air at that speed a person
couldn't compensate for them quickly
enough to keep the plane stable so
there's programs that do that without
software we just couldn't move that fast
we couldn't build those plays and also
with automation we've we as a culture
have made technically possible but
completely infeasible things feasible
for instance it's technically possible
for me to take a cute picture of my kids
and print 200 copies of it and mail it
to all the people I know but I would
never do that and I would never pay
someone to do that yet Facebook is right
there and so why not yeah I'll send that
picture of my kids to 200 people and
this kind of thing that making new
things possible and also making possible
things feasible it changes the way we
work it changes our culture lord knows
last year in 2016
Facebook definitely impacted the outcome
about elections so like it or not
software has an impact on our world when
we're talking about development
automation we have the opportunity to
make our own world better so another
thing we can do is just take something
that's perfectly possible and feasible
and make it Pleasant now git log is my
favorite example when I switched from
subversion to get might behavior changed
significantly because subversion log I
mean that's a thing you can do it but I
never did it because it like call buzzer
the server and it takes its time
back with a list and it just I never use
that but get log I use constantly
because it's right there at my
fingertips it's on my machine it's so
fast that I can pipe it through grep and
said and do what I want with it and I
make a lot more commits and the log gets
even more useful so my behavior has
changed Oh another example of from
possible to easy is IRC to slack people
are like Snap is an overhyped IRC no
slack is a game-changer because it's a
sea change in how easy it is to do chat
went from something something that most
of us could get working if we tried and
then we could learn all the little
tweaky things I never really got I are
comfortable with IRC and this is
developing for 20 years there were there
were hurdles to get over to be able to
use it
slap takes all of those away and it's
everywhere it's on all my devices and
it's on everybody's devices because
there's no hurdles to using it and
that's changed the way we talk to each
other so slack is a great example of it
software as opposed to a program there's
a whole spectrum of automation from
programs to software so a program is
something that is useful to you on your
machine you wrote it you can run it
that's great
those are really fun to create because
they're fast that and you know what you
want them to do when you make them do it
and then we're all happy but to help
other people you need well to help the
maximum number of people then you go all
the way to the other end of the spectrum
of software which runs on everybody
else's boxes and it has like production
data that's replicated and it has
security and it has authentication and
it has whole teams of people just to
figure out what we think it should do
it's thousands to millions of times more
work more expensive to build software
versus programs apparently it's like
even bigger than that and impact or they
wouldn't be paying us to do it so that
software is stuff we're not going to do
by yourself it's a lot of work and the
programs are really fun there is a sweet
spot just a little bit past program that
is local automation like programs that
you use
maybe your team uses maybe adjacent
teams but they're written by the people
who use them and this is a sweet spot
for a couple of reasons one it doesn't
take a whole team of people to figure
out what to do you know what you want to
do when you make it do it great and you
know it's going to be useful because you
wouldn't be writing it otherwise it also
doesn't have to be perfect because if it
falls down on a corner case well guess
who it fell down in front of you or one
of your teammates someone very close to
you so when a developer is running it
then every run is effectively a test
because you can fix the bugs right there
or fall back to manual processes either
way it doesn't have to be perfect and so
it's much cheaper and it's also really
fun it's about the power of programs and
that the feedback is very quick and it
makes our world better so that's really
cool and that's a sweet spot in one more
way which I'll get to later I work at
atomist
which is fun because we're developing
tools for development automation so like
last year I worked at stripe which was
great stripe is awesome
and they should hold team of developers
doing development automation integrating
Travis at github and slack and JIRA and
streamlining the flows so that we would
- you know there was more chance of us
conforming to it and that made our work
easier mostly everything fits in them
all gr anyway and that's awesome that's
great but a company shouldn't have to
have a whole team of people doing that
Adam is my goal is for that kind of
automation to be doable by one person
half time our team of people just here
and there when they get around to it by
introducing like new primitives that
make it really easy to do these common
development tasks so in this
presentation I'm going to talk about the
why of development automation and then
the hard question the when and in the
course of doing that I the best thing to
illustrate development automation is to
do some development right so I'll have
some live coding and I'll show you them
the problem space so this is a story
thanks it see these kitties
okay this is my this is my toy app it's
a kitty survey and you pick the kitty
that you like the best and you push vote
and then it tells you how many people
have voted for that kitty since the
service was last restarted which is not
very long ago right so I can pick Grimm
again and vote again but what I can't do
is see any more kitties in these three
these are the fallback kitties which the
app puts up there if it can't retrieve
any new Kitty options when I hit new
survey I get another error two four or
four it's not implemented so that's what
we're going to implement today first a Y
in the Y of development automation I
don't think I really have to sell
developers on that I mean we all want to
write fun programs that make our own
work easier that's not a hard sell the
church is selling it to our managers
because our job is not to speed up our
work our job is to speed up other
people's work by creating software with
teams and teams of other people so a lot
of these Y's are actually reasons for
you to give your managers or anyone else
who questions spending time improving
our own workflow I've got four reasons
three of which are new slash redefined
words and one precaution something to
watch out for the obvious reason to
automate is to save time this is like a
blindingly obvious one but if you think
that automation the value of automation
is the number of times I do things times
how long it takes me to do that it's way
more than that that is like trivial yes
you could predict that but just take the
simple thing of if I fit takes me two
days to deploy a new service and I
deploy a new service about twice a year
well if it took me a week to automate it
I'd take a whole year for that to pay
back but the thing is if it took me half
an hour to deploy a service I might
deploy anyone every month so that number
of times we do it is highly dependent on
how long it takes and if we can make it
easy and not just easy but also safe
like
without risk like a big part of
automated deployments is that you're not
afraid to deploy because if you can
automate deployment you can automate
rolling back and so it's not scary
so sometimes automating the undo what
get is another example of that suddenly
changing code is less scary because I
can always roll back that part is
automated and that's really powerful but
more than time in addition to yep you'll
save more time than you think and you'll
also save brain space we as humans have
limited working memory we can only put
four to seven things in our heads at
once and the way that we grow and
advances the species by compacting four
down those four down into one category
and then we can think at a higher level
this is a a person says that
civilization advances by extending the
number of basically primitives what is a
primitive for instance in get I want to
get my master branch pointing to origin
master again so that I can like do disks
Andry basis and stuff and generally keep
up with what's going on but I might be
on a local branch and might have local
changes so there's actually like five
steps it's like I've got to stash my
changes have got to check out master
I've got to reset master which was the
goal tip my branch again and stash plot
my changes so I made those into a script
whatever or it's a batch function or
something and suddenly five things or
one and I can like type FF enter and
then I'm ready to get on the plane it
doesn't sound like a big thing but it
just it eases the number of things I
have to think about and then I therefore
I do it more often am i repos are more
up-to-date a better example if
deployment takes seven steps and you
convince that into one step then there's
six more things you can think about
while you're deploying you can think
about what else is going on you can
think about what you should be
monitoring you can think about coffee
out or doesn't matter the point is you
have extra brain space because these
things are condensed into one and some
of the things that save you brain space
don't even save you any time they just
save you from collating
multiple pieces of information into one
so for instance all right we're going to
start on the kitties but the first thing
that we need to do in development is
unfortunately not open the IDE it is
coordinating with other people so Adam
is our our thing is we've got two
categories of development automation one
is the literal automation of development
like code that changes code and the
other one is everything else we do so
automating the collaboration and all the
information that we need getting that in
the same place and I don't care if you
add misses actually in private alpha so
I don't expect people to like go home
and use this tool what I do hope is that
you'll use whatever tools you have to
make your own development flow faster in
this case that means slack so I want to
work on the kitties and I need to know
if that's going to bother anybody on my
team
cool Dan says it makes sense I think
he'll count as the whole team today cool
so this is real life you interact with
your team and I might make a new service
for for this piece we'll see look at the
architecture diagram in a minute what
does Sam think we should call it but no
exam we're not going to call it Sammis
amazing but I will call the issue Sam
it's amazing so the here's the first
thing my bot is doing I use it for this
pretty often it is going to create an
issue in github what makes me I'm happy
with this one I mean this is a minor
thing I am not saving time by automating
by a slack bot
that lets me create issues in github it
didn't take me and appreciably more time
than clicking over to github and create
the issues but here's two things I get
out of this one is that I didn't have
the contacts which that's a pretty minor
the other is that everyone can see in
the course of the conversation that I
created an issue it's been multiple
times when I'm discussing with somebody
blah-dee-blah happened and they're like
oh that's totally a problem that should
be a bug and I go create the issue and
they go create the issue at the same
time and then we have a duplicate and we
have to like merge conflict and this
means everyone else who comes and reads
the conversation later can see that an
issue was created and there it is I
don't have to remember to paste a link
in and so that's that that saving
correlation time later of somebody needs
to coordinate what's in github with
what's in the slack and then the the
atomist is giving me the github
notification so you could wire in get up
notifications to slack that's trivial
you can get the event stream issue was
created this one is actionable it's got
actual buttons on it so I can do
something with the issue without
changing context which is nice and when
I push the label on it come here it's
going to ask me what which label to use
how about in progress submit or I can
click the button the new label
notification comes in and it doesn't
span the channel and I don't have to
correlate it it's right there it just
updates this message so that's really
nice it's a little thing of saving brain
space by putting things in one spot
and it's it's just it's refreshing to
have this kind of automation all right
but there's another reason next reason
good Nikita the next reason for
automation besides that it just makes
our lives easier is safety and I'm not
using safety in the boring sense of oh I
stubbed my toe or somebody died it's not
about personal injury safety here as
defined by Nancy Leveson in engineering
a safety world is about the prevention
of unacceptable losses prevention of
accidents or disasters
so we want to have safety from disasters
of all sizes to varying degrees as for
most of us probably the biggest disaster
for our organization would be to go out
of business would be to lose money so we
try not to waste that money that's like
a safety thing for us we don't want to
lose it
and as such we're developers clearly
it's a disaster if production goes down
and we don't miss our sls it's a
disaster if we lose customer data or
expose it to the outside world it's a
disaster it's a small disaster when bugs
get through or varying varying sizes of
disasters depending on the bug so these
are all things we're trying to prevent
with safety and automation introduces
safety in a couple ways
one of them is the obvious you're less
likely to make a mistake so if you have
to take seven things you might forget
one you might miss type one and the
program is just way better at
remembering a lot of different steps so
that's the trivial safety but there's
another one because it does a sneaky
disaster that we're all subject to and I
really want to avoid and that disaster
is congealment of the software because
as as our code bases get bigger as our
distributed systems get more and more
complicated there comes a point in many
many of my past projects where we're all
working so hard to just keep the system
alive then we don't have time to improve
it we don't have time to fix it and
making change is super hard and
dangerous and scary because the system
is so big and complicated that it's
congealed and that's an architecture
problem probably and okay so back to the
kitties again here's the architecture
diagram of my kitty survey in the middle
you have like the person interacting
with the front end and on the right is
this service which is for random reason
called London that takes the survey
results and then on the other side at
the beginning side is that when we
haven't implemented yet that supplies
the survey result now my job is to ship
features to customers in the fastest way
to get a new service up would be to glom
it on the London glommit on to the vote
service that accepts the rights
but that is not optimal architectural
architecturally reads and writes have
very different concerns the rights it's
really important that we not drop one
but we don't really worry about response
time and the low volume so we can handle
that the reads on the other hand might
be much higher volume and we need very
fast response time and we need to ship
more data over the wire but if we drop a
request whatever somebody'll hit refresh
and we didn't lose any information so
they're very different concerns and this
is one of the advantages of the service
architecture is that you can separate
those things so it's architectural
advantageous to spin up a new service
but if that takes two days it doesn't
happen it would be irresponsible of me
to do that but do we can take this
trade-off of doing it fast or doing it
right and we can eliminate this
trade-off with automation so in this
case when I want to spin up a new
service I am going to ask Adam ystem
here I used to type spin up a new
service but I got bored typing that so
it's just let's go and this is basically
a programmable bot and I've got like
little typescript programs that tell it
what to do and all I have to do is give
it a project name we'll call it and you
see Oslo sorry Sam and it's going to
create a repository in github and and a
slack channel and link them together
it's going to populate that repository
with the contents of my organization
seed so my organization has a seed for a
new project which says this is how any
project should start this is our like
collection of local contextual best
practices are collectively best for the
organ out for the world so it's still a
real thing and that repository it ok so
to the generation process of creating a
new project
some people use templates and other
people copy a project and templates are
a pain because they're not like actual
code and new who wants to maintain them
but copying a project is a pain because
then you need to like delete specific
stuff from that project so this is
actually cop this is cut and pasted and
modified except it's automated
so I copy a real working project
and then like change the package and
change the application name and do all
the modified stuff automatically from a
program oh good it appeared so here's
NDC Oslo and I can clone it that's
something that's a bit I'm going to get
NDC oslo from satellite of love
that's my org now get is another this is
what you turn field piece of automation
this didn't take me very long it just
CDs to the right directory does the
clone and then CDs into the directory
the biggest benefit I've got from that
is actually a safety thing of at some
point I was in some atomist github repo
like our public open source stuff which
this code editing stuff is all open
source at the command-line you don't
have to integrate with slack you can you
can run a command line and that's all in
github so I was Dara and I did it pushed
a master accidentally oops looks like
something that like didn't even compile
I don't think so I went and changed this
piece of automation just get that I use
so if I'm cloning an animist repo it
copies in a push hook I get push hook
that says no we're not going to let you
push the master unless you define the
environment variable so I can still say
no really get push but I won't
accidentally get pushed to master and
because I had the automation in place it
was pretty easy to make sure every a
Dennis repo I have on my local machine
gets that push hook and I don't screw it
up alright alright so I have I have
clone to this we are in MVC Oslo and I
can open it in IntelliJ ok this part I
have not figured out how to automate
IntelliJ still makes me click what we
learn NDC Oslo there we go
come here I've maybe created a few too
many projects recently I open the palm
it'll work and the the seed project has
been useful because whenever I learned
something new about how I should do is
bring the rest service I incorporated in
here here's the
web integration test so like I used to
have a different port a specific port in
there and then that turned out not to
work so I fixed this to say random port
and now I never make that mistake again
everything get bigger run I can run this
test just make sure it works
nope nope I have to right-click and
they'll be fine so now we have a
repository but the hard part is not
creating the repo I mean yeah this saved
me a little time of like creating a
repository and github and copying a
project it's it's so nice but the hard
part of spinning up a new service is
actually getting it into the CI system
and into production and whatever
deployment integration we need which
usually involves making changes in other
places and I'm going to go ahead and
start this going banana miss can do that
too in the up so it's going to go to
Travis and enable the build and then
it's going to encrypt the keys as
necessary it's got to enable the Builder
through the encryption key run the
secret which it has to get up so if it's
a secret set of faults and then it runs
them through the encryption keys and if
I had to do that myself no way what I
start a new service for this because
even just that is a sufficient pain in
the ass to be a deterrent ok good it did
a bunch of stuff it added Travis builds
the repositories and then it did a pull
request so get is really nice because
suddenly it's like not scary to have a
computer modifying my code because if it
gets it wrong whatever it's just a pull
request I'll reject it in this case so
I'm going to accept it without waiting
for the build to complete because I want
it to finish fourth to the end of the
Simo so the merge the merger
notification comes in from atomists and
set up directly from github and it's
slight pretty and stuff and it's got a
merge button so it's actionable and then
there's some push oh and it's telling me
it made a PR over here in this other
repository which this is the repository
yeah this for submerge
there should be a paramedical okay there
it is there's the PR notification as
this other repository is where I define
what gets deployed into my environment
and I'm gonna merge something to merge
go and then I'll show you that
environment so this is what we're
looking at we've got the code on github
there's a build and Travis which is
going to push stuff into the push docker
images into the docker registry and then
this is this is this bottom part here is
specific to my production environment
which happens to be a copy of Adams
production environment but that's
irrelevant I could have done this demo
like with Heroku and been like you can
do this at home but I don't want you to
do this at home I want you to do it at
work so this happens to be our
environment um I found I found you know
I've worked in deploy automation and I
find it really interesting and I got
excited about Skyliner and then I went
to write to recommend Skyliners
deployment automation and just that day
I got the email that it was dead that
that company is closing and I've decided
that deployment is really quite personal
I don't think anyone can sell you a
automated deployment build pipeline
unless you're starting from scratch
because everybody has legacy things that
we need to deploy so this is why that
local automation is so important no one
can write that for you people can supply
tools get and github for instance and
Travis Travis can supply or teamcity and
these others can supply the primitives
for doing continuous integration but we
have to write our own build scripts
because every system is different okay
so animist integrates with these things
and then rather than add yet another
place where you can go to look for
information we use slack as vui entirely
slack it's the new command line except
that everyone can see what you're typing
which is really great for coordinating a
little scary sometimes okay so let's see
about those messages again what did we
get backwards there's the kiddies
okay
so we did emerge here I like this
because that one command line modified
two totally separate projects so this is
abstracting an operation at higher than
the project level if we're going to
automate changing code we're not limited
to changing it in one repository at a
time and good our build is starting so
here's another example yet the penis
came in on master and a build is started
on Travis animus is also backed by a
graph database so some of this
automation is that there's pieces you
can do in a batch scripts and on your
and by yourself and then there's there's
other pieces that are really hard as we
have a graph database at the commits and
the builds and stuff go into so when
that build notification comes in we
don't just stand the channel and make
people correlate all of them that's what
we used to have at stripe was just all
the information came into the channel
but you had to use your brain to
correlate it here it just puts it up and
when that build turns green when it's
finished
oh it turns green this demo by the way
it depends on conference Wi-Fi github
Travis Adam is spot in my production
environment being up so it's so far so
good and I'm pretty happy with that
yeah so once that bill turns green it
will update this message and it becomes
like a little dashboard and also oh now
I won't get a button because the deploy
will happen automatically if it works
and then we'll have it will have a
service sped up and that would be great
now the safety aspect of this Suzy yeah
is that I didn't screw it up because
it's all automated and I didn't have to
remember how to do it and when when
someone new joins the team and they're
like how do I deploy a service I can say
you say Adam it's let's go and you give
it a name and then you go look at it and
if you're happy with the code you say or
probably you implement some stuff
locally realistically and then you say
I'm going to spin me up that's really
easy knowledge to transfer it's the same
if you have a deployment script that you
run from your local command line it's
just so much you can transfer a lot of
knowledge in that one statement and and
then you have a documentation you have
your process document documented in the
only documentation that's ever accurate
which is code okay next next word
legibility now I have stolen this word
from the book seeing like a state by
James C Scott and this is a book mostly
about politics and City Planning and
forestry but it introduces the concept
of legibility to mean an understanding
that rolls up to higher levels it's like
a mono um this is the F P track so I can
say mono the canonical example is back
in the day and like medieval villages
the villages were smell enough or maybe
pre medieval Dark Ages the villages were
small enough that everybody knew
everybody you didn't even have to have a
full name I could refer to you by your
hair color and just everybody knew
everybody so that was fine then
everybody knew where everybody lived the
streets didn't have names because
everybody just knew where everything was
and it was small enough that that worked
now you get like kingdoms getting bigger
and you get like Kings that want to know
about their kingdoms I mean they want to
tax people right into tax people they
have to know how many there are and who
you are and where you live so they can
come after you so then people show up at
the villages with these big Ledger's and
they force everybody to assume a first
and last name at least for the purposes
of the book and they put numbers on the
houses and they put names on the streets
this is not for the benefit of the
people that lived in the villages
although I think eventually it turned
out to be useful this was for the
government it was for those higher-level
decision-makers to be able to count and
then when you can count the people then
you can add the numbers from this city
in this city and get a bigger number and
so you can estimate what your tax
revenue should be this is an
understanding that rolls up and it helps
them make decisions now we totally need
this in software too both on the
technical side and on the social side it
is crucial that we be able to understand
our systems this is another prevention
of congealment so then their
architectural level we want to
understand their systems
now and this the automation as an
incentive becomes important here because
you want some uniformity in your
services as much as i want to be like
micro services right it in every
language that sounds so fun
it does sound fun while you're
programming it but it doesn't sound fun
to operate that system and to understand
it and as like at a high level to make
decisions about a system it helps if we
have some uniformity and you can get
that without decree just by making one
thing really easy so if it is completely
trivial to spin up a spring boots
service then that's what people are
going to do unless there's a reason not
to and that means if I have one service
running in production that's in Python
there's a reason for it because they
wouldn't that developer developers have
the company's best interest in mind if
you just don't get in their way that
developer needed something specific in
Python maybe he's doing some very
specific data analysis and matrix
algebra and the libraries are better
there but the difference becomes
information when there's when there's
incentive to keep everything uniform so
automation helps with that a lot and
then on the social side as much as I
abhor JIRA and I didn't join Adam until
after they had started using JIRA and
then stopped which was satisfying as
much as I don't like that it is real and
true that the people in management and
at the executive level they need to make
decisions and they need information
about what's being worked on what's
stalled how things are going it's
legitimate that they need this it's just
not legitimate for me to sit in a status
meeting for an hour to provide my
five-minute information and I'm also
sufficiently spoiled that I don't want
to type it into JIRA and fill out their
forms those those those drop down boxes
and those required fields they roll up
you can run report on those drop-down
boxes and required fields so the other
way to get this information is by
providing automation that's useful and
then hooking into it
so if I come in on Monday morning and I
don't know what to do and I say animist
what's up and it gives me the list of
issues that are assigned to me and maybe
like PRS that I need to approve and
stuff like that and I click oh yeah I'll
start work on that that's information
that whoever writes the automation can
plug in and send to JIRA or wherever and
it's not getting in my way in fact it
takes away the trade-offs of knowledge
versus pain-in-the-ass
by being useful and providing the
information where it needs to go so
legibility it's the legit requirement
speaking of uniformity let's see how
that build went ah ha yes God started so
we should be able to curl it let's see
if we can see it curl survey Adam is
calm slash and BC are slow and this
should say hello world yes hello rest
Microsoft's world ok that is the default
great next we want to add the endpoint
that's actually going to do something
Adam is add endpoint so here is some
code that modifies code it's going to
ask me okay what do you want to return
let's call the survey field name for a
sample field I will pass it a seed which
will be an INT click a button okay the
first time that I wrote note that I
added an endpoint to spring boot service
which was only a few months ago I've
followed the tutorial and I added all
the different places and it's really
only like three places that you have to
make change spring already have a ton of
magic unfortunately but still I I follow
the tutorial and I to the thing the
second time I added an endpoint I said
aha I think I remember how to do this
but let's find out and I wrote code to
do it and then when that code turned out
to be useful I refined it and made it a
little better and now it actually copies
valid Java code out of a real service
and copies it into mine and it's like
navigating the Java ast to do this
so we learned something about the Java
ASDs I'm doing this and I can like dig
around in the class and get the method
this is the open source part 2 and then
I can go stick to method over here
inside this class and and then I can do
that for like I think I made a new
controller but I stick to method in for
the test and then I generate a Java Bean
which the IDE can do but this way it's
lumped in with all those other
operations so I've made address endpoint
into a single operation instead of 3 and
I get a pull request so I can upon
request I did it says the branch is add
survey endpoint ok I can do that
check out add survey and point oh man oh
fetch right and then we can go implement
our endpoint it did it the demo gods are
with me so far
ok I have a compile error this is fine
so this illustrates that when you're
writing automation for yourself it does
not need to be perfect
my my my program my code that modifies
code my editor here assumes that that
type was a string and it just gets an
initial value of the string and I could
put in a special case for int but I
don't have to I mean why it's not like
I'm going to screw this up the compiler
is telling me about it right here it's
plenty good enough for my purposes I
probably want to change that initial
value anyway so we don't have to make it
super complicated I don't have to handle
all this corner cases because the only
one who's going to be surprised is me
and I can decide does this bother me no
it doesn't bother me I will just take
out these quote things and then this is
actually kind of convenient because it
takes me to exactly the code I wanted to
modify anyhow I'll import ok but what I
actually want is to make sure I get back
three kitties I should get three from
results get body ok a survey should have
some options options should have a size
and it should be three semicolon friend
job ok
and that we can implement that I'll have
to go into the survey here's a sad
little POJO but I'm going to replace it
with one with more things
oh and that survey option that's defined
in a library so we need the palm yeah
that and I could throw a dependency in
here dude did you do survey source and
this is my little library which I can
illustrate something with that in a
minute
all right you can import that and now we
have a survey with survey options and if
we go to the controller it's going to be
angry Survey controller so we have a new
controller just for this one and it is
currently returning a very boring survey
with just a seed which doesn't even work
anymore
and we will have it returned a better
one that uses the library to retrieve
some random kiddies and we're good see
the test passes they might have
implemented this already so I get to
focus on the actual business problem the
what do I want these surveys to contain
which is three kitties and then my
library this is fun while we're talking
about legibility over here in slack come
here I can go to that survey source
channel and I can say hey animist who
uses this library and what version are
they on and Adam is knows how to
navigate through the tree of from my
github org to all the repositories to
anything that has a palm and then it
retrieves each of those palms and digs
around in it to parse this library and I
see I have two on an old version and two
on is that the current version I should
put that I should add the current
version here whoa Adam is ok I think
it's just report version but I can do
that to this repository too and say oh
ok I have a bug there oops oh well but
it did get the version right and that's
fine I can choose to fix that bug now or
I can wait until it bothers me again
that is up to me but it's not bothering
anybody else because it's local
automation alright
yet did our tests pass they did we can
commit and push this we have implemented
it and the conveniently created branch
we can push it that's going to pop up
over here that build failed because I'm
I don't know why that bozo compiler that
was of course that that build failed it
was supposed to but now I'm going to
cheat and hit merge on this before the
build completes because I just want it
to go and back to keynote to do more
reasons there is one more reason and
it's my favorite reason is my favorite
justification for why they understanding
it rolls up for why development
automation is valuable this word I have
stolen from the Journal of
organizational psychology it is
generativity and at least in this
particular article about executive teams
executives are off also systems builders
so I think they have a lot in common
with developers generativity means your
team's output with you
compared to your team's output without
you as opposed to personal productivity
about what of what you individually did
because it is not about me it is about
the whole organization it is about the
value that we can create together and
that's a very different focus from
comparing people on individual
productivity how do you make us better
the whole 10x developer garbage I'm
sorry if you have a 10x developer on
your team or horse if you are a 10x
developer compared to the other people
on your team you are doing it wrong
because you need to be transferring that
information if there's that much
disparity most of the productivity
really comes out of familiarity with the
existing system that's when you get
really snappy productivity and it's the
person who has all that tribal knowledge
that's super productive and if you are
that person you need to be sharing that
knowledge with the people on your team
not hoarding it so I have seen 10x
developers like clearly and they were
apples because they were hoarding like
deliberately keeping the developers out
of the meetings with
other developers out of the meeting with
the customers however you can be a 10x
developer as a team you could be okay
maybe your team could be like 3x when we
all support each other you could be the
person who doubles the output of your
team by helping with collaboration by
automating the stuff that gets in
people's way so we're not stuck with
mistakes spending some time on
automation that local automation that
are shared with your team may be
adjacent teams and not much farther is
incredibly generative it helps everybody
and and remember that part about how we
take whole teams to figure out what the
software should do we don't have that
problem when we're doing local stuff
that's because if I didn't automate
somebody else's work and do a great job
at it I have to really understand their
work and when I automate my own work I
spend it I get a much stronger
understanding of my own work I really
have to think about what does it mean to
deploy this do I really need this step
or could I go about it a different way I
learned about the ast into my language
writing code that writes code is
significantly harder than writing code
but man will understand that code you'll
know it and then you can forget it
because you don't have to think about it
anymore I like pop from language to
language a lot I do
maybe mostly Scala and typescript
occasionally closure for fun elm and
sometimes Java and so when I come back
to this stuff I do not remember how that
had a rest end point I'm going to have
to go to the stupid tutorial again
actually it's a really good tutorial but
I still don't want to be there but this
saves me from that because I'm able to
put that knowledge someplace that I can
access it without reloading it into my
head just really nice
okay so generativity is like super
awesome and oh oh and it just happens
that if you automate your work you can
also look really productive so this is a
human query that queries again Huba api
from their demo and i search for all
like commits related to add amidst and
ha I look super productive I made the
most commit haha just because I've been
practicing this talk and say putting up
projects and adding rs.10 points all
over the place that automation can also
make you look really productive okay the
only other left to talk about is the
scary thing at the bottom which is a
caution but let's go see if we have
kitties yet Oh me the build past but I
don't see the deployment I do see oh
yeah that's promising it may have happen
okay well it hasn't done it yet
oh look starting pod there it is okay
good oh and it and it's okay good so now
my pod is running I am in production I
could create a github release but that
wouldn't do much these messages are
coming from github
Travis github and our internal
kubernetes infrastructure and they all
get correlated okay now that the pot is
started it is technically possible that
we can get a new survey maybe wait for
it yeah more kitties okay I'm really
happy the whole thing work oops I hit
new survey I meant to hit vote st.
kitties yay no one who's voted on the
survey because it's finally implemented
alright and we can't get another one I'm
not going to be different right maybe I
only have I only let it generate ten
seeds so they're not very different okay
awesome we have implemented two kitties
and it is happy spectacular now we have
the precaution this is a danger of
automation ossification and this is
something to consider especially for our
customers because when you do automate a
process you make something really easy
and that and it's consistent but
consistent you know engine it can expire
it can go on too long it can persist
longer than is optimal so that can be a
negative I have worked at a place where
we were supporting like a bunch of
biological researchers as they're like
investigating the effects of different
genes
and we had a whole department of
software developers building software
for the researchers to streamline their
process to make what they were already
doing faster which is like the lowest
benefit kind of automation by the way
and in addition to being pro benefit and
really expensive it had the effect of
the companies all proud we're capturing
our existing knowledge so that if far
domain experts leave we will so have
this knowledge captured in our software
yeah you know what you've captured the
knowledge you have today you know what
you're shopping everything you're
learning because if the researchers
wanted to do anything different 18
months from like project initiation to
delivery I mean admittedly that is like
the worst pretend agile actually
waterfall schedule that I personally
have seen but it was terrible because we
just got in people's way where the
people were supposed to be helping we're
actually holding them and these are
smart people they don't need the
software telling them what to do and
it's the same with developers we are
smart people and if is that if our local
automation becomes hard to change if
anyone who uses it isn't allowed to go
in and tweak it and improve it that's a
danger
that's a smell yeah because that poor
research software really I think it held
back the department but you know what it
did it had great legibility the people
who are watching this process from there
our top floor offices could see the
different genes moving through the
system and they felt really good about
it
so that's that's something to watch out
for you can get legibility from
automation but when that becomes the
real point especially if you don't
acknowledge that that's the real point
it can get ugly another hard question
why is easy there's lots of great
reasons but when are we supposed to do
this because our job is not to create
automation it is not to make ourselves
faster it is to deliver features to our
users it is to make them badass
and yeah in the long-term it often helps
but when are we supposed to do this
because it's totally interferes with our
work also there's the obvious answer I
like to do this on weekends but that's
just me and I'm kind of obsessed with
this and it's fun though because this is
this is like programming at its easiest
and funnest like I think sometimes we
get excited about the latest new
programming language we use because it's
really fun to write things in elm in my
case but that's because all the things I
read an elm are really simple and only
need to run on my computer our median
can help patience and they don't have to
be like good UX I'm very much a back-end
developer as you can tell by my kitty
survey UI but it's so it's fun to do
this and once in a while I'll I'll sit
down on a Saturday and I'll start with
just some little tasks and then I'll be
like ooh how can I make this easier oh
how can I make it easier to make this
easier and and I totally wind up writing
code to write the code that modifies my
code and I find the short fun but it's
an exploration so you know if you're
into programming in your spare time this
is a great thing to work on but nobody
should have to do your some excuses for
during the week when you make the same
mistake again so at this point you can
justify the automation with look I just
screw this up again it cost me some time
and a lot of frustration and it might
have been dangerous it might have like
endangered other environments especially
if you like brought down the dev
environment and you've cost everybody
time so that's a great time to automate
stuff and do it in a time box so the
second time I make a mistake first time
I just feel stupid the second time I'm
like okay it's probably not me this is
actually hard I bet other people make
this mistake too if I'm feeling brave I
ask them so I'm like okay I'm going to
give it 15 minutes and I can write I
know a Bosch function or a shell script
or just something really simple and can
I solve this problem for me in 15
minutes and if it doesn't work out I'm
out 15 minutes big deal this limits the
cost
of trying something but it keeps you're
probably going to get some benefit and
you might get a huge benefit in the long
term you don't know oh it so when you
learn how to do a thing right like I
said about the spring rest stuff that's
a great time to automate it because
you'll really figure it out and you
won't have to remember it again can I
miss once no and again you can time box
that because if it turns out to be like
really hard to automate and not worth it
then you've lost a little bit of time
but you've gained that knowledge too
could you put that thought into how to
do the thing no remember it better next
time it's like writing down directions I
can write down the directions and then
throw the paper away because once I've
written them down they're in my head and
the second time if I can't do anything
in 15 minutes then the next time I make
that mistake again I'm like okay I'm
going to give it an hour because it's
clearly useful and proceed as such
another one is when you notice that the
incentives are skewed when you notice
that you're making a trade-off where
you're sacrificing the best way to do it
for the quick way to do it because your
job is to deliver features now that's
the right thing to do in a lot of cases
to compromise on architecture or code
quality until you at least find out
whether this thing is even going to be
useful because a lot of things never
make it into prod however if you can
eliminate that trade-off entirely with
automation that would be awesome so when
you do when you get to that point you
know you're probably memory that day or
you wouldn't be making this trade-off
but think about it and come back to it
when you have a half-day or it's a
Friday afternoon you don't want to start
anything boring and that's that's a flag
that there's a possible really high
benefit to the automation if you can
pull it off
and then there's like the end game of if
they make you report your time in a
third system and you're like are there
other jobs out there while you
automating that for a day or two is
going to be cheaper to your company than
quitting that's my theory
also they deserve it and then I can give
it to my
to workers and make real friends oh this
incentive thing so when you want someone
else to do something then just make it
really easy for them and then they won't
have any excuses like oh oh so like
right now the kiddies are up on th pages
right that was the easiest place to
deploy them but really I should be I
should like figure out how to get that
in a docker container and deploy it in
survey data mess calm but until then I
have to have this restrict course notice
don't restrict course this cross origin
header so the first time I learned that
I needed a cross origin header I went
back and added it to my example rest
service so now I I never forget anymore
but I still need that piece of code in
there which is disappointing so in my
controller yeah this cross origin
annotation so now all my code has this
as a security person once this add this
app does get deployed out of survey data
miss calm I don't want cross origin wide
open anymore I still want it there for
like local testing but I want it
restricted to localhost so I could no
security policy everybody must change
their cross origin headers and like
added tasks to everyone's plate and
generally mag people and be perceived as
a bully whether I am or not or I could
write code to write the code for them
and this particular one happens to be
pretty small so here is one of my little
code editor programs they're all in
typescript and it says I'm going to edit
this project and I'm going to dig around
in it find all the files under source
main and if they end in Java add I mean
I could do this with like ast and
analyze the annotations but why it's a
search and replace so I can do that
search and replace and then I can set
the commit message and this is running
on on rug which is a domestic and it's
code tool and I could do this one
because I could publish this like to a
local repo and everyone in my company
could run it at the command line would
be a little easier for them but if I
have adamance of my slack then it's much
easier I can just say animist or glide
at a time I've written that editor I
have
oh and at once an editor name I
called that restrict course I've also
used this to like change that the docker
files like change the JVM arguments
inside all my docker files across my
organization oh it wants me to name the
branch ok this is going to be called be
nice ok
so in that case I give it a branch name
until it with it and it's running it on
every repository that it knows about in
satellite of love and a lot of those are
going to result in no changes because
they're not Java projects and that's
fine oh I happen to be in a Java project
so my PR just came in and now to pull
request and after the builds succeeds I
can I can run it I can do that with my
library - if a survey source I can say
like release library and this is not
going to complete in the next 3 minutes
but this will upgrade the version of my
library on master and when that build
finishes it will make a branch in all
the projects that depend on my library
and that branch will upgrade to the new
one and then if that build succeeds
it'll make a pull request and if it
doesn't it'll create an issue and then I
can track that I can track which ones
have upgraded ok look at all the
happiness
lots of PRS last one is pretty
interesting to me personally developers
have a reputation for if you give us an
easy problem we'll find a harder one it
solve that instead because we like to
think we enjoy thinking and even if but
what I can do is I can keep that hard
problem outside of my code I don't have
to add a bunch of libraries and
abstraction inside my code it makes this
tricky for the people who come along
later and I think it's clever but I'm
not what I can do instead is write code
that writes code and then the problem is
harder for me but then I solved it over
and over I have a theory that if you get
a feature request and you can provide a
definite answer you can provide an
estimate that's right because you know
all the steps needed and you've done
this a couple times before and this
just a standard thing that you have a
standard it's two days two days if you
can provide an estimate a solid estimate
it should be an hour because if you
actually know what all needs to be done
and you've done it before well automate
that how long does it take for the you
to run the editor and click merge when
the build passes and the deploy just
happens yeah I think estimating anything
else's is always going to be a made-up
guess because we are creators and we've
never created that thing before we can
try but but if you really know then you
could automate it so there it is local
automation it helps your whole team
it makes everybody safer and it can even
help people understand what's going on
in the company as a whole
I'm Jessica on if you are interested in
atomists you can you can request access
to the pre-alpha but also just add
amidst Rugg on github for the open
source stuff couple of book
recommendations and thank you go forth
