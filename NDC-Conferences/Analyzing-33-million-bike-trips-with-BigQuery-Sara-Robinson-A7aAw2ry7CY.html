to teach you how I analyzed 33 million
bike trips with bigquery feel free to
come there's some seats in the front
don't be shy
a little bit about me my name is Sarah
Robinson I'm a developer advocate on the
Google cloud platform team I'm based in
New York my first time in Oslo super
excited to be here you can find me on
Twitter at Esther odd tweets and as a
developer advocate my job is to teach
other developers how to use Google cloud
platform products I focus on big data
and machine learning and I do that
through demos talks and online content
like blog posts and screencasts before I
dive in to how I analyze the data I'm
going to start with a story so up until
about a year ago I was terrified of
riding bikes for no good reason really I
just liked having my feet on the ground
but I moved to New York and I saw these
city bikes everywhere and decided to
give it a try there was lots of nice
paths in New York and I really enjoyed
it so slowly I became a little bit less
afraid and as I started to use city bike
which is New York's local bike share
program more I started to notice that
they had stations everywhere every
couple blocks in all the boroughs of New
York there's all these bike racks and I
noticed that at different times of day
they were more active than others people
some people were using them to commute
to work
other people were using them just to get
exercise tourists were using them to see
things like Central Park and obviously
there is different factors that affected
when more bikes are being used for
example you can see this picture in the
middle obviously when it's snowing not
very many people are going to want to
ride the bikes so the dock is completely
full so as I started using city bikes
all these questions came to my mind
I wondered how many stations there were
and how many bikes were in circulation
at a given time like I said before I
wanted to know like how different
factors affected whether the bikes
whether more bikes are being used I
wanted to know what the most popular
routes where if people were riding her
unique routes or if there were certain
routes that tons of people were riding
frequently and City Bike has a
subscription system where you can pay an
annual fee and you basically get
unlimited access to use it or if you
want to use it on a one-time basis you
can buy a 24-hour pass or a three-day
pass so I wanted to see if people that
had the annual subscription we're using
it differently than people that just had
a 1 or 3-day pass also under do men and
women take the same bike routes so tons
of questions came to mind but without
any data these are pretty tough to
answer right might be like a tough
interview question how many bikes are in
circulation in New York at a given time
we could come up with a pretty rough
estimate but there's no way to know if
we'd be exactly right so I was really
excited to discover that city bike
provides data on every trip that's been
taken since 2013 and this is publicly
available so anybody can go and download
these CSV files and do anything you want
with the data data on every trip so CSV
files look something like this that's a
lot of text I know breaking it down for
one entry we get data on the bike ID so
each bike in the system has its own
unique ID we get the start time and end
time of the trip the ID name and
latitude and longitude of the start and
end stations and we also get some
additional data we get the duration of
the trip in seconds which is what this
number is we get whether they're a
subscriber or what they call a customer
subscriber pays the annual fee a
customer is just using it on a one-off
basis and if they're a subscriber we
have data on their age through their
birth year and then their gender so I
wondered I have all the CSV data how can
I analyze it and since I work on the
Google cloud platform team I chose to
use bigquery to do this bigquery is
essentially our big data as a service
tool for Google cloud it's completely
managed no-ops it's a big data analytics
warehouse so you upload your data to
bigquery and you can query it really
really fast it's great for large sets of
data so you can query terabytes of data
in seconds towards the end of my
presentation I'm going to show you a
terabyte query and all the queries are
in familiar sequel so you can do it via
the web UI you can also write queries
via big queries REST API and we have a
number of client libraries that support
that in many different languages and if
you're not familiar with sequel bigquery
also integrates with a number of
third-party visualization tools like
tableau data
I do I'm going to show you some of those
today one of my favorite things about
bigquery is that you can share your data
really easily right away so you can
share you can share your data on at a
data set level so the data set contains
multiple tables you can share your data
set which is one person via an email
address or a group email alias or you
can share it publicly to all
authenticated cloud users and if you
want to try it out
we have lots of public data sets
available and you get a free monthly
quota so you can query up to a terabyte
of data for free every month we recently
announced a free tier for storage so you
can store up to ten gigabytes of data in
bigquery for free so that's a quick
overview of what bigquery is so the
first step was I found all the CSV data
I needed a way to import it into
bigquery I'm going to show you how I did
that
once it's in bigquery I wanted to
analyze it we get a ton of data on every
trip so lots of possible different ways
to analyze the data and then finally I
wanted to visualize some of the data
because bigquery gives you this nice
table output but sometimes it's easier
to digest this data in the form of a
visualization so the first thing I
needed to do was import the data into
bigquery and what I did was I downloaded
all those CSV files and I put them in
Google Cloud Storage that's just one way
to import the data and I am a big fan of
nodejs
so I use the node client library to
import the data and all I needed to do
was create a reference to Google Cloud
Storage get the files from my storage
bucket with all the trip data and then I
call this function create bigquery table
which I'll show you on the next slide
and so here using the client library for
bigquery it's really easy to import
these CSV files and I just need to
define my schema called data set create
table give it some data about what type
what the format is of the data that I'm
importing and then I can call table
import all my bike data is readily
available to query and bigquery this is
just one way to do it you can also
import data via the web UI so if you
have just one or two files on the web UI
is super easy to import data that way
because I had a file
for every month of bike data I decided I
would write a script to automate that so
I use the REST API through the node
client library there's many other client
libraries available as well now you can
also use cloud dataflow which is our
batch and stream processing service so
you could pull data from bigquery do
some processing on it output it to
another bigquery table or a number of
other sources and finally you can link
firebase analytics to bigquery firebase
analytics is a mobile analytics platform
so anybody that's building a Android or
iOS app using the firebase SDK which
firebase is a back-end platform provided
by Google you can link your application
to bigquery so that you can
automatically stream all this analytics
data about your users on you can create
custom analytics events and you can send
it to bigquery to do on all sorts of
custom analysis on your data so many
ways to get your data into bigquery but
now that our bike data is in in bigquery
I want to analyze it so I'm going to
walk you through a bunch of the queries
that I ran along with some of the
visualizations I created on the data so
first things first we have this is what
the bigquery web UI looks like and we
can write our queries directly in the
browser so I'm looking here at the city
bike trips table this table is publicly
available it's part of the bigquery
public data project so this is what our
schema looks like and once this loads
we'll be able to see what a row looks
like for each trip each row represents
one trip so we get the duration to start
an end time some information about the
start and end station we get the bike ID
the user type and for all subscribers we
get data on their birth year and gender
so I can query this directly in the
browser and the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm just going to do a count star
to count how many bike trips there were
we can see that you already knew this
from the title of my talk but there's 33
million bike trips that have been taken
since Citi bike started in 2013 which is
a lot we probably want to do something a
little more interesting than just count
how many rows are in this data set so
the next thing I wanted to look at was
the number of bikes in New York over
time
that were part of the city bike system
make that a little bigger I'm going to
run this query and we should see for
each year how many bikes so when it
started there is about 6500 bikes and we
can see that this gradually increased up
to little over 10,000 bikes in 2016 now
let's say we wanted to instead of just
looking at the data in this table format
let's say maybe the data is more complex
and we wanted to instead visualize it so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
a tool that's provided by Google called
data studio this is a homepage and I'm
just going to create a new report from
scratch so I'm creating a new data
studio report and it's going to ask me
to create a new data source so I'm going
to choose bigquery and make that a
little bit bigger so you can all see and
I'm going to write a custom query I need
to link it to my project and I'm going
to paste in that query here uses
standard sequel and so when I connect
this I'll have all the data you saw
right here available in data studio to
visualize so you've got that here I can
add it to my report and let's say I'll
do a bar chart I'm going to put it right
here and we automatically have a nice
bar chart of our data I'm actually going
to sort it by year ascending so that we
can see how the number of bikes increase
per year so really easy to integrate
bigquery with other data visualization
tools and if I put it in View mode we
can see that I now have this nice
interactive chart this is one example of
how easy it is to visualize data in
bigquery with a number of other tools so
the next thing I wanted to look at was
what were the most popular stations in
New York so here I just I'm going to get
the 10 most popular stations I'm going
to get their name these are the start
stations the most popular stations for
people to pick up a bike and we can see
here that we get the start station name
the latitude longitude and the number of
trips were ordering here by number of
trips now again it's nice to see this
data here but I don't know about you but
I can't look at a latitude and longitude
and picture where that is on a map so
it'd be nice if we could map this data
and to do
I use a tool called Cardo to create my
maps and all I needed to do was I
clicked this download a CSV button in
bigquery I didn't do the limit ten I
just looked at every single station and
then I went over here to cardo and I'm
able to create this heat map so the
darker red dots show you stations with
the most trips and I can hover over them
and see Fifth Avenue and twenty ninth
Street had 131 thousand trips in total
since the program started so I can
create this nice interactive map and I
can see that the lighter stations like
over here in Brooklyn are fewer trips
maybe they're newer stations obviously
the stations with the most trips are
Midtown in downtown so just a nice way
to visualize a lot of tude longitude
data that we get from bigquery the next
thing I wanted to look at was trips by
member type so I told you that there's
two types of members there's subscribers
who pay the annual fee to have almost
unlimited use of the bikes and then
there's people that just use it on a
one-time basis so I looked at all the
trips just in 2016 by member type and
what we find here is pretty interesting
so the subscribers account for a much
larger portion of the trips nine million
trips taken by subscribers in 2016
compared to 1 million trips taken by
people that are just using the bikes on
a one-time basis but with the
subscribers we see that their average
trip duration is much shorter than the
people that are just renting the bikes
on a day which makes sense you're
probably if you're just rent if you're
visiting New York and renting a bike
you're probably using it for sightseeing
rather than if you're a member you might
be using the bike to commute every day
so I'm also going to visualize this in
data studio so if I go back to my data
studio report I go to edit and I'm going
to create a pie chart but I will need to
define a new data source so I'm going to
say create a new data source I'm going
to do the same steps I did before so I'm
gonna do a custom query link it to my
projects
and connect that and then I should be
able to generate a nice pie chart
showing me the number of trips by
subscribers versus customers so I'm
going to disable that field we're not
going to use duration in this example
and just need to tell it to sort by user
type and then the metric is going to be
number of trips and there we get a chart
to show you that subscribers account for
88% of all trips taken in the system so
then I can again go back to view mode
and I can see that nice interactive pie
chart and so the next query I want to
show you see where we left off is right
here so continuing with analyzing by
member type the next thing I wanted to
do was look at the routes that different
types of members took so if I want to
see if there was common routes that a
lot of people were taking so I'm going
to go ahead and run this and I also want
to just look at the average trip
duration for those routes so what's
interesting here is that even though the
customers accounted for a significantly
less portion of total trips they're
doing the same type they're doing the
exact same routes so the most popular
route is Central Park South to Central
Park south so you notice that the start
and end stations are the same here so
they're just picking the bike up doing a
nice little tour around Central Park and
then bringing it back to the same place
they got it the top three trips have the
same pattern of the start and end
station being the same and you'll notice
that they're renting the bikes for a
long period of time even though when
you're just renting the bikes you get
thirty minutes you can spend longer you
have to pay a fee for that but they're
spending a lot more than 30 minutes on
the bikes the first route we have by
subscribers is only five minutes in
length and then we have another one by
customers again the start and end
station are the same so we can see
really different types of usage patterns
between these different member types and
going to my next query I wanted to look
at the gender and age data that we got
from city bike and see what the most
common ages of people using the bike
were
and we can see here that 31 is the most
common age there has been about 1.2
million trips taken by 31 year olds and
we can see that men are using the bike
significantly more than women in New
York and again this data would be a
little nicer to read if we could
visualize it so for this visualization I
use the tool called exploratory it's a
third-party tool it's just a desktop app
and again I downloaded the CSV and
imported that to exploratory and I'm
really easily able to visualize my data
and I can create public graphs and share
the URLs for them so we can see here
that indeed the orange shows women blue
shows men and we can see that 31 is the
most common age and we have riders as
young as 16 all the way up to 90 which
is pretty cool so big big age range of
riders although they're mostly
concentrated in this 30 to 45 range so
that's another way we can visualize our
bigquery data and diving further into
looking at routes by gender
I wanted to see sorted grouping by
gender what were the most common routes
so I looked at only 2016 and I first
wanted to see the top five routes by
women so I get these routes here and I
wanted to compare this to the top five
routes by men initially I thought this
would probably be very similar I didn't
expect very different usage patterns
here but if I run this query to look at
the top five routes by men you'll notice
that they're completely different which
I thought was really interesting so I
wanted to map that again this is just in
2016 so there's not so much data for
total trips here but we see it's
completely different and so I wanted to
look at this in Cardo so what I did was
I mapped the top ten routes so the
purple routes are aroused by women the
blue routes are aroused by men so it's
interesting here is that we can see that
women are riding for a bit longer this
is more of a scenic route along the
river matter maybe using it more for
commuting and their usage is
concentrated in this area
which is near Grand Central Station so
maybe it's people that are commuting
from outside the city then getting out
and using a bike just to get to work
that way we can see that women are using
the bikes more outside Manhattan in
Brooklyn down here so another way you
can use Cardo and to actually map routes
and the ways Cardo here has a tool that
will give you if you give it a start and
end point you can choose either the
walking biking or car route so that's
how it's able to map the routes here
instead of just drawing a straight line
between start and end so the last
animation I heard last visualization I
wanted to do is I wanted to look find
the bike id that has taken the most trip
since 2013 so I'm going to run this
query and we'll see that bike number one
seven five to six is the winner
I think they should paint that bike gold
or something it had fifty five hundred
trips since 2013 so that piece of
information isn't so interesting on its
own so what I did was I ran a query to
get the start station latitude and
longitude for every single trip that
that bike is taken and Cardo lets you do
animations so I did I'm going to play
the animation now you can see the date
right here so it starts in July of 2013
and we can see how this one bike travels
throughout the system and you'll notice
that we're in September now when we get
to the winter you'll see it kind of drop
off for a bit
December kind of goes quiet even though
the system is still in operation people
don't really want to ride in the snow
but you can see how this one bike is
just traveling throughout the system
which is cool I won't play the whole
thing it goes all the way through 2016
but the way I did this is I just
imported my CSV file into Cardo and you
just give it a data point to animate on
so it animates by time and we can see
the station's change as it progresses
from 2013 to 2016 so that is all the
bike queries that I have but I'm going
to go back to my slides and show you a
little bit more data analysis in
bigquery so I show you how we visualize
our data
I'm using a number of different
visualization tools so we had Cardo
exploratory in data studio at the
beginning we do have a number of other
public data sets in bigquery and you can
query all of these for free using your
free terabyte each month one of those is
about a year ago we put all the open
source code on github into bigquery and
this table is massive it's almost 2
terabytes which is a lot this is a table
that contains the contents of every file
and github in the head branch so it's a
lot of data and using data studio this
is a visualization of the languages by
bytes and then by repositories so by
bytes see accounts for 63% of the code
on github whereas if we look at by
repositories javascript has the most
with 14% so what I wanted to do since
it's a dotnet conference I want to find
all of the c-sharp files on github so
I'm going to copy this query and I'm
going to go over here and what I have
here is this is a data set that contains
all the github data so here I have the
files table and the files table about
300 30 gigabytes it's updated
continuously to add new code and the
files table gives us the repository name
the rest the path of the file and then
we have this ID which we can join with
the contents table the contents table is
that giant table 1.9 terabytes which has
every file in the head branch the
contents of every file which is pretty
crazy if you're playing with this data I
recommend using these sample tables so
you don't use up your free monthly
terabyte right away so you can play with
the sample tables they have about 10% of
the data and then once you find out what
you want to run your query on you can
use the full table here so we're going
to go to the files table and we're going
to use standard sequel and I'm going to
paste in that query here any guesses
I'll run the query first and you can
click on this validator here which will
tell you exactly how much data your
query is going to process and that's
what you
charged on so you can kind of get an
estimate for it before you run the query
any guesses number of files c-sharp
files on github I'm going to run it so
here we can see that there is about
eighteen point eight million see start
files on github which is kind of crazy
there's a lot but I wanted to do a
little bit more complex query here so on
the next slide I wanted to find out what
were the most popular new get packages
on bigquery in on github sorry so I'm
going to copy this query I'm going to go
back here and I am going to not use
cache results to show you that I'm not
cheating so this query will process 2.1
terabytes
run it runs so because it's going to
take a bit of time to run i'm going to
run it and then explain what's happening
i'm going to run that query so what
we're doing here is we're getting all
the packages config files all of them
from github and we're getting the
contents of those files and then we have
a regular expression here that just gets
the ID of all the package names from
those files so it's running now and
again this is running over every single
packages config file on github and then
we're just going to count how many times
that package occurs and order it by the
count should be finishing up soon there
we go looks like it's done it's done
so newton soft is the most most popular
we can tab through it to see if this is
what you expected and see some of the
most popular ones so that's just an
example of type of analysis you could do
using the github public data set on
bigquery now again we have a lot of
other public data sets that i haven't
showed you here you can see just a few
of them right here an interesting one is
the weather data so we have weather data
from every year since 1929 so something
I haven't done yet but I would like to
is find the weather data for New York
and join that with the bike data to see
if how rain and snow effects bike trends
so I definitely recommend checking out
the other public datasets we have
available another fun one is all Stack
Overflow questions and answers and so
I'm going to go back to the slides
lastly I've got one more thing for you
what about Oslo bicycle New York data is
interesting but we're in Oslo right now
so some of you may not have even been to
New York Oslo bicycle is has been around
for about a year so it's a local bike
share system here I tried it out
yesterday here's proof that I rode a
bike and I put all they they also
provide public data and I put it all in
a public bigquery table in my personal
project that you can access so I'm going
to show that to you now so it's
available if you go to this bitly link
I'll show it again at the end you can
also query it create your own
visualizations so right here is it's in
my personal projects there a bigquery
we've got data on all the trips taken
since it started in April of last year
now they don't provide as much data on
each trip as the New York City bike but
maybe they'll add more in the future so
we have the start station start time and
station end time data looks like this
and they also provide station data so I
went ahead and put that in a separate
table so you can join this to get the
latitude and longitude of the start and
end stations and we also get data on the
number of docks at that particular
station so you can see the name of the
station but the title the number of
locks and in a latitude and longitude so
what I did was I created a data studio
visualization this is pretty much what
you'd expect so I looked at the number
of trips by hour for all stations around
Oslo and we can see that you know
commuting times make sense so around 8
a.m. at peaks at 23,000 trips per hour
and a 4 p.m. we have another peak and
then I looked at the most popular
station Ikaruga may have mispronounced
that I tried looks pretty similar to
this graph and this is just in May 2017
I created another map using Cardo to
look at the most popular stations in
Oslo so we can see here that the darker
red ones are not even going to try to
pronounce that one are the most popular
stations I think we have the Aqua Brutus
station over here so 52,000 trips on
that one and then we can see there's
some newer stations on the outskirts
which have had fewer trips and then one
thing I did was I created an animation
so I looked at one day of Oslo bicycle
on May 1st last month all the trips that
were taken in one day the time here I
think is a little bit off because I Xin
you to see but you'll see in a day these
are all trips happening and you'll see
that you can tell what the rush hour
times are we can see more and more trips
happening throughout the day people
slowly making their way to the outskirts
so I encourage you all to check out the
Oslo bicycle data and create your own
visualizations see what you can do with
it and definitely let me know if you
create anything interesting I would love
to see it and so now I'm going to go
back to the slides and this is a link to
the map that I created if you're
interested to see that heat map of the
most popular stations and that's all I
got so I wanted to end with just sharing
you all the resources that I talked
about today if you want to learn more
about bigquery there's lots of
QuickStart guides documentation there's
a c-sharp client library one thing I did
forget to show you I'll go back to this
slide I wanted to show you how to how I
ran these queries in c-sharp so I use
the bigquery client library for c-sharp
so I've got Visual Studio open here and
I just wrote three of the queries that I
showed you before so if I go here to run
the program we should be able to see my
queries outputted here so I'm just
showing you the query I'm running and
then we're outputting the results just
showing you three of the queries so
really easy to do this
in c-sharp net totally forgot to show
you that before and if you want to find
