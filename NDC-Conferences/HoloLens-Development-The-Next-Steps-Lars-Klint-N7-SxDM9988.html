thanks for kind of making out I don't
know how many went on the cruise last
night yeah yeah exactly that was pretty
good others few more people coming okay
come on in don't sit over there come in
here come on yeah so this I don't know
if anyone here so my talk last year the
main difference is that I now actually
have a hololens it's like yeah all right
this talk is more about all the bits you
need to know as a developer and less
about shiny stuff although we will have
a bit of a play with it of course so
this is kind of what I want to go
through the first thing is that I'll
assume that you know some about it but
not everything I'll just do a quick sort
of recap we got a look at holo toolkit
which I should have this slide because
it's changed name two days ago we'll get
to that we're gonna look at some
gestures kind of more in depth of how do
gestures actually work and what are they
voice commands the same also about
designing voice commands the designing
spatial audio spatial mapping is
something that has often kind of skimmed
across and not really it's kind of
taking for granted so we'll talk a bit
more about that and then something about
testing because no one gives any ya
notice to test you whatsoever if you do
have questions please just raise your
hand and I'm happy to take questions at
any time if I don't know what I'll say I
don't know it or if I'll tell you Mike
to wait a bit or whatever but please
just ask questions all right the more
interactive we make this especially with
a small group like the more you're gonna
get out of it so if you are so inclined
there will be more information on
Twitter on my account as we go through
the presentation so through the magic of
internets there will be some some live
tweeting um hello and so the quick
overview so as anyone who played with
the Holland's I know a few people yeah
yeah okay cool this this is actually
stephen's hololens
because i didn't have to bring mine then
so I know you've did anyone see Steve's
talk yesterday on the opportunity
recognition and stuff yeah no okay a
couple people all right so pretty
overview there's basically five
Holland's development that you need to
be aware of the first one is gays gays
is you can kind of compare it to your
mouse cursor but you use your head
alright so it's a little bit odd so
where you point the device not where you
look it's not eye tracking it's where
your point in your head is where your
mouse cursor is and that's called gays
that's how you interact with things and
one of the ways you can so if you want
to point and click essentially that's
something you use your head to point at
things gays is one of the three ways
then you can provide input to the whole
lens and it's probably the most common
way that people start out using a
Hollins because it's very intuitive fact
you have a white dot in front of you and
you just use it like that gestures so
gestures is that there is essentially
two gestures and that's it there's this
which is ready and then there's press
that's kind of it and then you have and
then you can combine that into different
things holding navigating stuff we will
get to that and then you have the bloom
which is like this and this is sort of
your catch-all you if you're in an app
your exit if you're out of an app you
just pull up the Start menu and you
can't overwrite that as a developer
that's just how it is right so those are
the two all right that's it there are
only those two you can use voice so
that's the third way so you've got gaze
gestures and then voice ggv voice is
pretty damn accurate like the voice
recognition of this device is very very
impressive often people get a wrong
impression because the emulator that we
will look at uses the PC mic for voice
commands obviously whereas this thing
has an array of microphones in front of
you and it's it's really really good I
it's very accurate voice is big well
it's really easy to use really really
hard to get right so we will look at a
few more ideas as well later on and then
you have sound so we talked about
spatial sound and spatial sound is kinda
like 3d sound right so this device has
two over four speakers actually but two
on either side
these red things here they sit just
above years and the whole idea is that
as a developer you just kind of almost
drag and drop the sound onto the object
you want it to follow in unity of all
units in a second and this makes it
really really easy like the whole
spatial sound concept is kind of taking
care for you care off for you but you
need to still have good sound design
which is what we look at as well and
excuse me the the sound so the idea you
know the idea is that this is supposed
to mimic real life right the more
realistic this device can make it the
more likely you are to accept the
experience as being mixed reality as
being real and the Holograms that you'll
see will will have sound attached to
them so if I have it if I put it on
right and there's a hologram over there
it'll appear as though the sound is
coming from over there
and as soon as I turn my head the sound
will be in front of me it's super
accurate right it's very very convincing
and it has to be because we want to be
trying to convince people that there are
more things than what there really is
right so it needs to be quite quite real
and then of course we've got spatial
mapping which is we're going to much
more detail on that but spatial mapping
is the the fifth pillar odd column
pillars but it's what makes hololens
hololens
without spatial mapping you would not
have Hollande's it's the way that you 3d
map the room using infrared and UV on
these little cameras to sit up here and
know it's not real time unfortunately so
you can't have these funny effects that
we'll get to but it is pretty damn close
and it's yeah it's it's all about
battery life I would imagine that's why
it does it at the frequency that it does
it but it scans the room about five
meter distance so you need you will need
to walk around a room like this size you
would need to walk around for a bit to
scan the whole room all right so any
questions on this there's this kind of
make sense that was like really quick
right just in those are the pillows
that's those are the fundamentals of
building a mixed reality experience
until logic stands a VR experience as
well except for the spatial mapping so
I do have the updated name here because
Microsoft everything changes name all
the time right so now it's Windows mixed
reality is the platform and it's so
called hololens but it runs mixed
reality and it used to be called the
holo toolkit because it was for hololens
now it's called the mixed reality
toolkit it's still the same thing but
they have said that they will be
breaking everything with name change
name space changes which is just yeah
okay I can understand they're doing it
because it's got to be you know we'll
get to this thing as well later on but
there's gonna be many more devices you
can't just call holo everything because
it might not be so that's why they're
doing it anyway
it's on github there's two versions
there's a unity version which is really
easy to kind of plug into your unity
project which is probably the one that
people most people use and then there's
a non unity version which is the unity
version is just kind of wrapped wrapping
the this version on the right here
essentially the holo toolkit is just
that it's a bunch of tools and it's a
whole bunch of scripts it gives you some
some shortcuts for starting a new
project which we'll look at in just a
second
and it has a bunch of demos as well
some testing scenarios the demos tend to
not follow the evolution of the toolkit
so they do break which is kind of
annoying but it's getting better like
they're getting better at updating in
overtime what else we're gonna say so
the the the mixed reality toolkit or the
hollow toolkit which is still what most
people will call it has come from two
projects in particular so the two games
once called fragments and the other ones
called young conquer has anyone tried
fragments I know a couple people
obviously have are you shaking your head
you have not try roamers Wow okay that's
cool that's good so these two projects
will car-like the showcases from
Microsoft to say hey look at the
hololens how freakin also minutes right
so I'm assuming that's poured a ton of
money in this it's done by a Paris based
development house
cold god I can't even a bozo I think
something and fragments is a mind
detective game and the reason that's so
effective are the whole lens is that you
are this persona that can see fragments
of people's memory right so these
fragments are placed in whatever room
you're in so the first scene for example
there's a hole in the roof and water's
coming in like so you look up there's a
hole in the roof and you can see the sky
through it there's a window on the wall
suddenly and there's things going past
the window outside but it just it really
is very immersive very very convincing
and they can do that because you scan
the room you got spatial mapping right
you can place things everywhere and it
works in every room I tried it just for
fun in the world's smallest hotel room
I've ever been in in London like it
didn't even fit the bed almost like one
you could - Sarge you couldn't go around
the bit and it still work like still
found places to place the holographic
characters and everything in order to do
that so young conquers very much the
same I don't fear I never played the
sega game conquer right way like okay
I'm just old but it's a little squirrel
guy this guy and he collects coins and
dust things but in this case he jumps
around your living room so he jumps on
your furniture and he you know he jumps
on your table he goes behind everything
in order to do these projects they
develop a bunch of tooling to facilitate
it such as I need to know what a wall is
I need to know what a floor is how do I
know that it's a couch so I can get have
someone come in and sit on the couch
next to you and all these tools were
then put into this hollow toolkit and
they open sourced it and put it on
github and it is still run by Microsoft
but it's very much a community protein
there's a lot of MVPs that contribute to
it all the time
you know submit pull requests for bug
fixes all that sort of stuff so it's
very very alive and well and it's you
almost can't build a new app without
using the whole toolkit because there's
so many shortcuts in it so there's my
first tip of the day mmm it comes well I
just found out it now had a has an
official logo
I was very exciting because it was just
a community project right but it has
input scripts that allows you to create
input very easily almost like kind of
drive and drag-and-drop again and it
plugs into an input manager
a hand gesture manager and all this sort
of stuff that allows you to do all the
fun stuff and not having to worry too
much about wiring up events and all that
sharing libraries I won't go too much
into sharing today but it's it's an
interesting concept because this is part
of the business proposal of this is to
hey if you get eight of them or four of
them you can collaborate on the same
experience all right so the sharing
experience gives you a server side
component that can run users running on
your laptop minutes but it's just a it
acts as a server and then everybody
connects via the network to that server
and you have a shared experience it's
actually relatively easy to set up it
probably takes half an hour an hour or
something to get it going but these
libraries just gives you that shortcut
again spatial mapping that's why I was
talking about you can recognize walls
and door know hey let me do doors now as
well walls ceilings couches as well
which is like oh there's a flat service
with another flat service so that's a
that's a couch you can place things on
it spatial understanding or that's kind
of the same word as was talked about
spatial sound and we talked about UI
control so bunch of controls like the
cursor or if I look at something the
cursor changes to something else so it's
a visual clue that the user is looking
at something utilities tons of helpers
like I don't know how many scripts are
in the whole toolkit but a couple
hundred three hundred maybe I don't
there's tons there's a lot and there's
some build automation stuff if that's if
you get to that point of having to
automate your builds alright questions
on the whole toolkit really all at once
okay
mm-hmm yep so so the question is can you
pre map a room and then essentially
loaded onto whatever you need to short
answer yes and I'll get to there more of
that not long actually and we'll just
have a talk about that as well but I
want to show you the holo toolkit see I
still have it hasn't been updated all of
it they mixed reality toolkit so I've
got a little I've cheated a little bit
because you can go in - no maybe not
like there you go
a good friend of mine has this hallo
toolkit does as your website's net Jimmy
angstrom in Sweden and it's just a
wrapper around it and you can just kind
of get your unity package with one click
right so he has an automated build
process that takes the github projects
and wraps it up and it it does what's
called a unity package dot unity package
so you just download that 120 Meg I
think currently and we'll get to that in
a minute so in here what happens is that
you go to assets
I can't unfortunately make that any
bigger so I hope you can still see it
you go to custom package here and you
just find your whole toolkit unity
package right and then you install that
that's all you need to do and then I
won't do it now because the sector few
minutes and it's kind of boring looking
at but what happens is that you get this
menu up here so you now have an extra
menu in unity that's relating to your
whole toolkit your whole lens project
with using the mixed reality toolkit and
it's still menu still set on toolkit as
well so if yeah it's just gonna be a few
weeks of both names but what you can do
here that is so has anyone used unity a
few people okay anyone does game design
gaming there's sort stuff no issue yeah
I know you've table there you go but
it's like if you if you do that you've
got a you got an advantage right because
unity is kind of where you do everything
so this is not a unity talk because I'm
certainly not an expert in unity it's
daunting because you get all these
things and I usually just tell people
just ignore everything and find out what
you need because there's so many things
that come up there but this there's
things that you need to do such as you
have to have a black background
because black is what becomes
transparent so that you can see the room
around you with Holograms on top of it
right you need to set what's called the
clipping pane at what point do you not
render Holograms when you walk up to
them like that distance needs to be
different because you don't want poly
grams here that's very very annoying
dive right in your face and won't go
away so if you're within say 85
centimeters they disappear right it's
just a feature that comes as part of the
framework but all those things there you
have to do every single time you start a
new project you can just do in here with
configure so you got hole and scene
settings move camera to origin because
the camera is you have face that your
eyes always has to be a 0 0 0 which is
the origin in unity clears a black that
we talked about update the clipping
plane update field of view so that
everything looks like it's real like if
you don't skewed or anything and you
just click apply and it all just goes
blonde right because otherwise you have
to remember this every time and you're
going your click there click there and
change the devera and this is it takes
five seconds you're done the same with
the actual okay with the project
settings you got a target the Windows
Store because it's a Windows 10 app
right and runs on Windows 10 this is a
Windows 10 device it has to be built for
direct3d possibly that's usually the way
it's done set quality the fastest so we
don't get you know lag and all that
stuff enable VR or all these things you
have to do with a new project you get
for free so you just use that whenever
you start a new project and then you
have all these scripts down here and
plugins and prefabs prefab is a
collection of things that unity uses so
that could be you know scripts and
scenes and characters and anything that
is in you is if you can yeah building to
a prefab and distribute and say hey oh
you want this dude that does this thing
here's my pre prep for that right
alright that's always gonna show over
the whole tool kit questions from that
know it is like you please do not start
a project on hololens without using
whole toolkit because you're just gonna
sit in the corner on rock having said
that I do run a workshop where I make
everybody do this manually and then tell
them about Halle toolkit so just cuz oh
yeah can't be nice all the time
so makes things gestures right just as
is is what people see because you go
around like this like an idiot all the
time right and you get pretty sick of it
which is why their supply clicker for it
so you just click but gestures is really
easy to implement I often get the
question of ah can I do my own gestures
I'm sure some of you thinking that but
no yeah well you can you can't actually
do that there is a way it's in the hole
in the mixed reality toolkit as well
where you can get the kind of raw data
for gestures and you can model your own
gestures ish please don't like there's
two reasons one is that everybody
expects to be able to do tap and hold
and manipulate and the bloom right so if
you start doing your own gestures well
for one they only going to be in your
app and how people gonna know about it
like it becomes a disjointed experience
for the platform and that's the reason
there are only those simple gestures
what simple the other reason that is so
hard to do accurately you need some sort
of almost natural learning mechanism to
just go through and actually create the
gesture right it's really really not
easy alright so we talked about tap tap
tap tap tap
there's also hold so you hold on to
something and that is an event that
triggers as well we can do manipulation
so many people ation is yet you actually
hold on something and you can move it in
vertical or horizontal space and it kind
of snaps to it or you have navigation
which is in a 3d space so you hold on
something again and you can sort of move
things in 3d space and that's usually
what people use for moving things around
so you hold on something and then you
move it over here
so those are the their advanced or the
extended gestures that you get yes
sorry yeah
so the question is how do you use the
clicker which is somewhere anyway it's
just a little thing like a like this
kind of thing you just click it right it
does have it like a gyroscope type thing
in it so you can do you can't do
navigation but you can do manipulation
up and down and to the sides so you can
scroll on a website but clicking and
scrolling that works so almost not quite
everything anywhere else yeah all right
so I'll just show you quickly here what
we got so we have a little project here
so this is from the whole instable of a
portal or the Holland's developer
academy and they just I use these
because you can just go and download
them right you can just go and you can
gret grab this code how it looks and
have a look at it and yourself but the
solution in case you're interested come
on you can see it says Universal windows
they're Universal Windows you know it's
a Windows 10 app right and that's the
reason that we can run it on the whole
toolkit as we're on the hololens as well
as if it was a you know a 2d apps on
hololens as well which means you can
have your mobile app running on the
Holland's so I believe office 2016 now
runs on Hollins as well so as a
developer you need to take a little
mixed reality check box when you when
you build it and when you submit it but
that's almost all you have to do and
there's no reason you can't run 2d apps
on it I think that repo would be a
feature of it that it won't all just be
fun and games and Holograms necessarily
because you can carry everything with
you on your head type thing and overlay
it and run on so we'll see how that
where that ends up but you get here a
new gesture recognizer which is what we
use to figure out what the gesture is
and that listens for the gestures and
there's a few different ones here
because they're doing some some fancy
stuff smart things you hook them up here
just like I mean the point of showing
this is that it's not scary like if
you've done any c-sharp development this
should look pretty damn normal right
we're just hooking up an event and with
an event handler and that's all we doing
and you can see here that we have a
tapped event
there we have a navigation starter
navigation updated and so they just come
for free like again you don't have to
build gestures you just have to handle
them and that's the key is that as a
developer this is not hard but it's not
the scary bit if we then I'll just start
this up because it might let's take a
second I'll just show the emulator as
well alright so they built this guy
called Astro man if you saw the first
slide he was kind of hovering down in
the living room and the idea with Esther
man is to showcase these things and how
do you use him now the holo toolkit does
give you some of the shortcuts so that
you have to do as much as much plumbing
as they do but it's kind of it's good to
know how that works underneath the
covers this is always interesting see if
the emulator will work so that's the
other thing if you're developing for
Hollins you don't need a physical
Hollande's you can use the emulator
which is as close to as you get to to
having a physical device obviously it's
more fun with the physical device you
know you don't quite get the same
sensation as when you're wearing the
headset but it is really really good
it's a hyper-v instance so you do need
to run Windows 10 pro or Enterprise I
think it is in order to run the the
emulator and this is not start there we
go maybe looking for this little thing
down here this should say deploy yeah
it's ready
there you go starting up hey so this is
kind of what you'll see I'll show you
what it looks like through the lens as
well but here you go there's your Start
menu and something went bang does always
do
they were deployment errors probably a
timeout that's what I'm guessing yeah
I'll just do it again
yeah the inner takes a little while to
start up but I think it crashed just
before I started the talk
it's what I'm guessing it does come with
his own network its own IP its own
everything it's just a hub of the
instance it is a VM essentially that
runs it
so deploy come on hey we got sound sir
this sound cool alright cuz I'll use
this notice the sound design okay and
then we'll talk more about when we get
to sound if you dip starts alright umm
what else can we say what we wait you
boys done it I'm hoping this is gonna
work the emulator sometimes just gets
caught up in networking issues I've know
you had the same experience you go you
just gotta restart the emulator because
it just does not work and then sometimes
this takes a long time
well mainly when I do talks it takes a
real time ok there we go so now I've
deployed it to the device it would be
the same experience is if you are hooked
us up with the USB and deployed to this
it would be the exactly the same right
there's no different it thinks visual
studio thinks this is just another hole
insta bus so here we go so I can use the
keyboard for this
unfortunately I can't make the emulate
any bigger because Microsoft so we're
gonna have to deal with it like this ok
and there's no sound why is there no
sound no I'm just checking cuz it yeah
the sound is kind of interesting in this
no there's no sound oh I think that the
HDMI is taking over the sound bear with
me for a sec here some playback devices
there we go okay so you get the idea
right he's in space move floaty floaty
it's all pretty now what I want to show
you obviously was with the gestures so
you see there's a little arrow here
little ring with two arrows if I move
that around that's gonna start changing
so that becomes like Beyonc that's all
out of the that's all in the huddle talk
get all this stuff that you know you can
have different so you find them press
ENTER which is to hold you can see that
a little hand that comes up but some I'm
I'm handling the hold event now if I
start moving so just the arrow keys in
terms of moving this deuteride while I'm
holding he starts turning alright so you
can do things like that so now I'm
holding I'm actually now I'm using the
manipulation in a in a horizontal motion
to rotate the dude and now that the
performers a little bit crap on this but
essentially the further way I move the
faster he spins and I just kind of hoped
he would throw up in his helmet but no
he never does because that would've been
amazing um I'll let go again
so that's that's the gestures that you
can't you get an idea but just notice
the sound is on right I can press on
them
it's just this ambient worth and if I
press this little button on the front
here again we have different elements
that give things and there's a heads-up
display that comes up so just a little
kind of fun example to play with it's
really good if you do want to learn more
about this do the origami tutorial first
then do this Astro man and you pretty
much up to speed on all the fundamentals
alright so see we can get him to shut up
there we go so I just pressed it Windows
key like you would on the start there we
go there's a Starman you're right okay
so that's gestures and I'll just yeah
yeah any questions on gestures okay cool
no voice commands go here we go voice
commands are again super simple I'm not
going to show you how to implement them
because it's so trivial I eat some kind
of you can use any phrase that you like
so you just make up whatever phrase you
want and that will be your voice command
so you can have you know half a novel as
a voice command probably not recommended
but it is really that simple and voice
commands are really important because a
lot of times you do get sick of the
whole tapping right you just you tap so
much in voice commands is really really
useful to kind of either provide a
shortcut for six taps or just let people
not tap and there's there's there's some
building stuff there's something called
see it's a it so in this case say it's
it removed here you can just point out
it with gay so your head you move the
cursor on your point and you just say
remove if you just point at the element
that has that attached so if there's a
label with an action attached you could
just say the label so anything you see
you can just say it
alright that's really really handy and
people often forget it's kind of you
need to learn that now what I really
want to talk about is sound of speech
design because as easy as it is to
implement as hard is it to get it right
like it's really tricky getting it right
and mainly it's because we don't really
consider what we need to do with speech
design as a developer
because like what actions can you
actually take through speech like what
makes sense because you can do anything
but but speech but does it make sense at
the time like what are you actually
trying to achieve what's your end goal
with doing this voice command is it even
a good option for completing a task
because sometimes it might be better to
have people click because they need to
know what the intuitive action is that
goes with it like there's a cognitive in
process that happens when you tap on
something right how does it use an open
speech input is available right how do
you train your user what's the education
process how do they know there are these
commands that they can say so yeah it's
easy to implement but how do they know
that that's the command they need to say
is the app always listening because it
will be by default but other scenarios
where you want to ignore this particular
voice command
what phrases so that that really so I
build this demo through my workshop
which is essentially built some blocks
and shoot balls at them right and that
you tap and the ball goes when it shoot
and it impacts on the blocks and they
fall off from the floor and stuff but
then we do the voice command I always
ask people so what's through the voice
command be for that anybody goes shoot
which you would think is the good option
but it's too short because depending on
dialect and accent and context and you
know what else is happening shoots very
short so it might not pick up the exact
what you're trying to do so I always use
shoot ball because it provides context
and the speech recognition works much
better when you have like a two three
four syllable maybe two words action so
just things like that it makes a big
difference
interaction dialogue like as are you
gonna have contexts because if you use
Cortana which I'm sure you all do right
right katana works on it as well but
things like hey you know what's the
what's the best restaurant in the area
and then it shows you to say take me
there well you have that context of take
me where and you can do that as well but
you have to implement that yourself with
these things so if you want context of
speech you need to take care of that as
well and then I always do network
connectivity because as developers we
always have network connectivity well we
we should have and buddy uses might not
they might walk into a Faraday cage we
don't know so what happens if that's the
case now we don't need internet
connection for voice recognition or the
speech design but we do might we might
need it for the actions that it triggers
so we might want to you have disabled
things all right any questions on that
no cool so I was gonna just do a quick
demo on voice commands yeah Mike because
we're just running a little bit over
time so unless you want to actually I'll
do it when we demo the Holland's how
about that okay so I want to talk about
spatial audio and we briefly touched in
in the beginning spatial audio is really
really easy like it's really simple all
you need to know is just these things
right there's nothing else so but no
it's using what's called the head
related transfer function h RTF and and
this i have no idea where this means
it's from wikipedia i just copied it
right because you don't need to hear
about it you don't need to know that
this particular formula gives you a beta
thing with the other thing yeah this
though does kind of make sense so you
got left and right here the header a
transfer function measure it calculates
distance and direction and how you
should play volume to two years that's
kind of the idea here so if it's right
and directly in front of you the speaker
here well the sound comes from the front
as the sound moves that way then this is
the listener position and the graph and
the numbers and all that that's how kind
of the the idea of the head related
transfer function is but yeah you don't
actually need to know about this all you
need to know about is that there's a
pretty picture and it works okay because
it's all taking care for it so you don't
you just attach you just drag and drop
in units you say hey this sound plays on
this object or in code in a unity script
hey attach this sound clip with these
properties whatever might be now just as
with voice the really really tricky bit
is getting this desired design right
hey because there are many things here
that can go wrong as well so
design audio design is trying to make
sure that we don't annoy the user so
grounding is one of them grounding is
you know real objects have sound that
means you know where they are you want
the same for your Holograms you want to
ground the object so you want to make
sure that you can hear Holograms even
you can't see them because it becomes a
vision so a guide for the user as well
as you'll see you have very little
narrow vision of the real world through
this with Holograms overlaid you get
used to it but it's not very big you
need audio to guide the user and tell
them what it look so that's one of them
grounding user attention so you can get
you can use sound to get the users
attention if there's say a clue for the
fragments game or conker wanting your
attention or something you can get into
a MIT sound and makes the user turn and
gets their attention right immersion
obviously we want to make sure that
people know the sounds are as realistic
as we possibly can make them so our bird
sounds like a bird our tree sounds you
know wind and trees sounds like wind in
trees because if it's not real the whole
idea of mixed reality kind of goes out
the window okay
and obviously with the game like you're
on conker there's gonna be sounds that
I'm not that realistic but they're
realistic in the context of a game okay
but yeah please make sure that your your
audio design is as natural as possible
it's less intrusive as possible because
that makes the emotion much more
effective and obviously user in your
interaction design so we're talking
about how do you interact with the audio
the audio needs to be like because we
don't have any tactile feedback when you
tap on a button well give it a sound so
that people know yeah I clicked on it
you know something happened so you need
to use audio for that as well so all
this is really easy to implement but
it's really tricky to get right because
there's there's a lot of design ideas
that you need to kind of consider
especially with the audio because as we
just saw with astro-man that background
music thing it's just annoying like
after minute or two you just go just
shut it up you know just get rid of it
and the other origami example in the
whole ins develop always the same has
this Chinese kind of back
music that just loops and displace in
place and plays so be careful with
having too much sound as well alright
yeah just some audio tips guys mixing
make sure that you use audio in with gay
so you look at things and they you know
you use the audio for feedback or your
haptic we talked about that you click on
a button then it actually gets audio
feedback and then immersion as well
ambient sounds I find hard so be careful
with ambient sounds like just one soft
sounds are fine because they go away but
yeah the ambient one okay this is a fun
bit spacial mapping so spatial mapping
is very much a integral part of the
product or the platform that we don't
actually ever really notice much but it
just becomes part of the part of the
experience right but it's so important
to get to understand how it works and
how to use it because that's the way
that you create what's not a VR app but
we don't want to create this virtual
reality stuff or just augmented reality
stuff we want to use the spatial mapping
that you create so this is kind of what
the representation is bunch of triangles
it's all triangles lots and lots and
lots and lots triangles that creates a
3d model is it how accurate is it mmm
okay if you map this it would probably
just come up like kind of a blob but
accurate enough so you can place things
on it and you can I think there's a way
that you can sort of dial up the
accuracy or the details but I haven't
found a good use case for it yet right I
don't think you need that much more
detail I probably going to have some
performance hits as well so there's four
different kind of areas of spatial
mapping placement you wanna be able to
place things like we want to be able to
put our Netflix window on the wall and
resize it if you want to be able to know
where we can put stuff where can this
holographic person go in and sit next to
you
placement is kind of the most
fundamental of these things that users
are after because you if you place a
hologram through the wall it just loses
the whole idea of the mixed reality
experience
is a really nice fancy word of saying
hiding stuff so you needed to be able to
like conquer will walk behind your
furniture and under your table and to
have that illusion real you need to be
able to hide him when he walks behind a
couch right like he is walking behind
the couch and then in Congress place it
just kind of fades out so you still kind
of see where he is because otherwise
you're gonna run around looking for him
but things need to be able to go and
interact with your furniture and your
environment as is and that also means
physics if I place something on a table
and it kind of knocks over and it needs
to be a realistic physics attached to it
right if things starts floating off or
having this ragdoll effect or something
it's just it just takes away from the
realness of the whole thing and then
navigation of course the spatial mapping
allows virtual carriages to navigate
your space which is very convincing when
that works it really works okay
I want to show you the developer portal
de which is part of yeah this should be
clear so the developer portal is what
comes for free with with the Holland's
oh okay okay so in here all you do is
just click on this little thing in the
emulator says open developer portal
click on that and it opens up a new
browser window and this works the same
way on the device and I'll show that in
just a sec so this gives you bunch of
tools like whole bunch of tools that you
can use usually the the kind of fun
thing is this 3d view oops
so in here I can update and now this is
the emulators representation of the
space now there was a question before
can you preload and can you record rooms
this is exactly what that is so I can
change the room on the emulator here
just go these more these tools here oops
here we go
so in here the room and you can actually
load more rooms there's some that comes
default on the emulator that's five of
you but you can also record your own I
recorded my living room at home and
quiet quite some detail spend about 15
minutes walking around just mapping
everything and then you can then reload
that so that means that if you are
multiple developers on a project you can
have say you have a test room you map
that and then everybody can get the
recording of that mapping and load it
into the emulator which makes it much
quicker so yes you can do that and in
here you can see just so what make sure
you can see both in the same time yeah
yeah
so in here as I move you can see that
moves as well if I turn and go forwards
and backwards that most is wrong I could
do a little bit better there so come on
yeah so as I move around the room even
though I can't see anything because Mara
black is transparent so that's where the
actual room should be it still give you
that representation of it of it there
okay so that's the spatial mapping you
can see there now yes you go
so so can you so load it onto another
physical device I don't think you can
yeah I'm not you can have it as part of
your app somehow you can have yeah I'm
not sure how that would work
uh-huh yeah
so it's the same thing can you preload a
recovery room recording a 3d model onto
a physical device I would have thought
there'll be a way to do it but I'm not
sure what you guys I actually don't know
because I already have one device so
it's never been a problem okay I'll just
close down the emulator because we're
not gonna use anymore
and then fire up listing because I know
that's why you're here really and hmm
I'll go back to here and
there you go so see I'm moving my head
in real-time all right so I've cheated a
little bit so if I click update it
should have already met bits of it okay
not much little time bit all right so if
I just move down here and I just tap on
you guys don't worry I won't hurt much
I just tapping forces it to map it right
so it's kind of mapping as I attempted
all right so I'll just tap the front row
here do you like that yeah
click update and you can see it's update
here and there's people in the front row
right so that's the kind of level of
detail it's pretty good alright and then
you can obviously see here as I move
that's gonna move with me so if I look
at you guys you know it's gonna know
exactly where I am so that's kind of
neat and that's the spatial mapping in
action and then it now knows that
there's a surface there and there's some
chairs there and you can use those
actually the Holland's doesn't know that
at all it just knows there's a mapping
but you can use the whole toolkit and
other functions to know where those
things are so you can use them in your
app cool does that make sense yeah
spatial mapping good to know about
really easy to use it's it really DS the
core thing of the whole platform that
you kind of get for free all right so
I'm going through this kind of quick
because I'm there's lots of things I
want to talk to you about ok all right
so usually this kind of gets peer
testing really but testing a whole ends
app is not like testing your you know I
was it's it's quite different yes it's a
Windows 10 app and you have code you
have business logic probably then you
can test but to be honest it's it's a
bit cumbersome and unit testing doesn't
really work on it so instead we have
what's called environmental testing
which is obviously very specific to this
device like nothing like you wouldn't
have an environmental testing
necessarily on your Android app you just
have lots of sleepless hours of testing
42,000 devices
so you want to go through this kind of
list whatever is appropriate to did what
you're trying to do but because you
probably have the same room that you're
gonna test in all the time when you
build your app this is a good sort of
shopping list so what if you have a
really dimly lit room like what have you
changed the light you know to all you
know paddy light you know does it still
work
what about like doorways and curved
walls can what happens if you place a
thing on a curved wall if that's what
you're meant to doing yep placing things
and walls what happens if it's like a
curve because it's gonna look like it's
hanging kind of off the wall are you
gonna bend it or what you can do right
those sort of test scenarios are much
more valuable than what we traditionally
think of as testing when we're
developers especially this one user
movement this is the old it's like text
box that you have a new website you
don't know what the users gonna enter
and they will enter you know snot eighty
to alert underscore comment or something
right you just don't know so until you
try it and because it tracks everything
with head movement and body movement
everything wears things gonna be and
what happens if you tap on something and
you move your head or like all these
things that you could imagine a user
might do even though you kind of go
nowhere ever do that but they will
physical environment because you don't
control that right you has sure you have
your test environment but once it's out
in the wild people download and use it
wherever so you need to kind of test for
all these I like this one
I would but stairs how do you deal with
stairs because that's really tricky like
is it a surface or is it not and can you
what happens if you go up and what yeah
it's there interesting things to test
and there might be things here that are
not relevant that don't matter but
there's your list for it and then
there's the other thing that I really I
quite like this it's called perception
simulation this is kind of like your
unittest so perception in this case is
what the user is perceiving what are
they seeing and we simulate movement and
actions that the users can do and it's
quite quite easy to do actually oh I
close the emulator denied
okay so while I fire up the emulator
again apologies for that yep deploy I'm
just gonna have a look here so this
again perception simulation it's a new
ish library probably six minutes six
months old now that Microsoft had done
because they need to understand how
what's really hard is that you can't do
the same action as a human twice you
can't do an identical motion twice in a
row she's not possible right even you
think your head is still is actually
slightly bobbing it's just how we are as
humans how we keep the balance how we
move so what you can do is that you can
set up these steps so in this case we
going there opiate and I'll just put the
IP in here in a minute we've got these
steps here so we get this eye perception
simulation manager dot create perception
simulation manager thing and that gives
us this manager that we can do things
with and this works with the physical
device as well it will override whatever
you're doing as as a person and simulate
it on the device as well which is kind
of weird but it works on that as well
it's easier to see with the emulator so
in here we just have this manager and we
just say human do in action such as no
there we go
I'll just get the IP that work great so
that's all we do to hook up to it and
here we just add the IP and go
yeah so now we have a connection to it
and with the emulator you just there's
no log you know anything right you just
it's just an honest login if you're
doing a device you might have to provide
credentials and what we can do is that
in this case we have perform gesture
perform gesture so that's the home which
is the Blum right let me do that twice
we then yep whoa okay there we go
we then rotate our head they may perform
another gesture we press to me release
that's a tap and then we tap again and
then we rotate the head again these are
just you might have a difference in I
obviously for what you want to look at
and what you want to press it on and
then we do a tap again and we do home
but very simple basic example so what I
can do is I can make sure this is still
running put that over here if I start
this comes up a little console get a
second just build it and then this has a
connection to the emulator because again
the immune is just a VM there we go and
it then performs those actions aren't so
I'm not touching anything right and go
Oh starting up again alright let me just
try that again because it was asleep
yeah let's do it again be quicker the
second time okay
so again I'm not touching anything right
and here yeah so we gonna what I do that
this is the demo gods right what you
would see is that it would put up the
Start menu it would then move and tap
and when it taps it bring up the brings
up the grid again there that's right I
don't need to deploy anything I just
need to Emily to come up so I'm not sure
why it's doing this right now anyway
it runs those perception stimulation
actions on to the emulator right and it
moves it around and you're not doing
anything but does the exact same action
every time rotates the head the same way
it pressures at the same time it does
everything and you can just redo that
over and over and over again it's really
powerful and you can set up a bunch of
them and you can automate them if you
wanted to not quite sure how that would
work with email but yeah there's there's
ways for the whole toolkit mix rally
toolkit that you can automate these
things as well any questions on testing
yes good question so how do you verify
that the test you just did did what you
want it to do or not you would have to
build something in to a log or something
I would imagine there isn't that kind of
feedback yep it just does actions so if
you knew that after a minute you app
should be doing this or whatever you
would have to build that in and time it
and log it somehow and then check those
logs but it is a step in the right
direction of providing some sort of test
framework because it's new no one's ever
done testing for it before so anyone
else know cool and now I don't need to
hear any more now we can show that ok so
you may have noticed that I had this
thing lying here and I'm talking about
at all there's a good reason for that
so this is what this is an ace ahead
said and as you probably can tell
there's you can't see through it right
this is still Windows 10 mixed reality
so it's still the same kind of platform
as hololens but this is essentially the
next step or evolution of devices it is
kind of a VR experience because
you have a headset on you can't see the
real world but it still has the
environmental cameras and it still
tracks the room for you so you still get
the spatial mapping but is then
projected inside of the VR experience
and this thing here is $3,000 u.s. this
is 400 right it's massive difference
which is why they're coming problem as
you may have noticed tethered
it's a massive long cable for it problem
number two is that I don't have a
computer that can run it so I got this
headset a week and a half ago and I
don't actually have a machine with a
graphics card that's powerful enough to
run it so that's another kind of barrier
for it hopefully that may change as the
platform evolves but currently I need to
go and talk to friends about hey can I
use your computer a bit I just thought
I'll bring it up and mention it because
there are more of these coming Lenovo is
doing one Dells doing one HP has one for
sale right now on the HP website in the
u.s. I think you can buy this as a deaf
kid through the Microsoft Store they do
run out pretty quick because they're not
expensive as a company they're foreigner
bucks I think u.s. you just buy one it's
into your life but it is tethered so
there's a different experience than the
whole once it's not the same but it's
the same platform and I think this is no
one's gonna spend three grand on that
device right it's just not gonna happen
all right so do you wanna have a look at
what this does the bit more fun yeah
just for a few minutes
well I will so here's our little
developer portal again and I'll just
show this this is the cool bit if you
haven't seen this before
it goes to sleep pretty quick so battery
life is user question I get like what's
the best you live on because it's no
it's not tethered uh-uh two to three
hours ish usually there we go yeah okay
so in here and a mixed reality capture I
can do a live preview and of course it
will work first time and you can now see
what I see II it's a little bit of a lag
on you can see when I turn my head it's
not quite full in real time so here's my
Start menu I'll try and keep my head
still so you don't throw up again the
bloom
again I can tap on things here so I can
go into the Start menu just like any
other Start menu I can go up and down
see I'm moving my head to control the
mouse right
and here's apps like any other Windows
10 device holograms place that there
this is always kind of a fun one
so then usually you know anyone wants a
kitten yeah I think we'll put a kid in
down here so that oh and then lovely
there you go you never kitten so that's
kind of fun right yeah no here he likes
you stroking him here there you go just
animating anything there's no sound have
we got no sound again audience okay it's
just cuz I hear it here right and I hear
it before use it's big wait we'll just
shut him up again yeah yeah you can take
that home you can keep it so that's that
you get the idea
as I click around here it's gonna map it
as well you can see it was a triangle
and all that that's when it's mapping it
mapping the room now I've cheated a
little bit again and over here is rubber
raid I know if anyone's ever tried
rubber raid but
so you can hear that is there any sound
one so you see they come out the wall
here right so there's robots coming out
the wall like I walk around it you know
I gotta shoot this good okay and they
crawl the wall cuz they know where the
walls are right said no there's a bit
that I haven't mapped I think this is
wall there but I can shoot the walls as
well and everything you know there's
holes in the walls so they can look
through the hole right in here and it
kind of just you that's just in this
super stable but it might be a bit jerky
in the video but it's really really
stable on the other device there you go
and we just keep shooting stuff and
there's holes in the walls and
everything yeah you get the idea so
that's I always showed that demo
I always show rubber raid because it's
one of the best examples that you can
quickly convey what mixed reality is
right oh hello I still don't think
that's a gaming device
I really don't but right now as you're
kidding right now the best example the
best showcase of mixed reality are games
that you can get freely like there's
lots of companies that do really real
really cool stuff such as you have
choosen Kroop i think it calls german
company elevator company yeah that one
but I said in German oh and they have
this this showcase you can look it up on
YouTube that shows you a bunch of stairs
and they're what I install one of those
disabled elevators for the stairs right
if you can't walk up the stairs and they
map the whole thing they got this
special like kind of mapping tool so
they a little thing that you can use as
a guide so it's more accurate but
essentially they map the staircase and
build the elevator holographically share
it to the customer say hey is this what
you wanted and then adjust or whatever
the need to and then send it off to
production right the the hologram itself
is the 3d model that they use to produce
the actual device of the the production
thing before and that to me it's just
like well oh man you just cut out the
whole layer of we need to come back and
remesh and oh this wasn't quite what I
wanted I didn't think that was gonna go
there and all those questions right it's
just gone so stuff like that I think
that's much better especially for $3,000
device no one's gonna buy a gaming
device for $3,000 right but here we are
all right so the usual thing that I
normally do the end because it's not
that interesting but yeah I'm me I'm I'm
iris MVP which means they give me
stickers I get lots of stickers that
says MVP and I could give them to people
or museum I have a blog as anybody else
but I do write about some of these
things and many other things I'm doing a
robot talk tomorrow
little guy called Cosmo which is
actually a guy I met here last year
showed me this Cosmo thing at a talk and
now I'm kind of stolen his idea and
doing a talk on it like it's really cool
little robot does has emotions in her
tomorrow afternoon just a fun talk I
haven't run a podcast with a guy I've
never met who lives in Alaska and he's
the paint obviously because I'm the Dane
called the Dane and the pain look it up
if you want to listen it's pretty good
fun I do amazing jokes on there really
good jokes and I have of course a plot
course as well on Holland's development
feel free to check it out and if you
haven't heard of pop conf that's
tomorrow night after the events like the
after-party 10 talks I think of 5
minutes which slides that progress
automatically and you just got to keep
up not record it highly inappropriate
political incorrect all that stuff very
good fun but yeah go there if you want
to come along and that's all I had
