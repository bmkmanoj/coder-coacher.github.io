you're still better wake first sorry for
my my cold I think I got it yesterday in
airports while flying so here I am now
giving it back we like to give back to
the community
yeah so I'm sharing the code with
everyone in the conference ok that's
better what are my slides
right so in the next 60 minutes we're
gonna talk about one of the trends these
days in technology because I like trends
I'm a trendy women rule and probably the
future of UX and UI a few things about
May before we start my name is Robert
but I go by a nickname BB apparently
it's easier for everyone to call me baby
so feel free to call me baby I worked as
a developer advocate for a company
called next move we do cloud
communication api's like SMS voice to fa
verification this sort of things and
because I'm there like dotnet developer
advocate I get to play with different
technologies and hack and that's why I'm
talking about boats today I'm also the
regional director of women who code in
Bristol yeah because we are still need
hashtags in 2018 so we still need those
user groups as well I like travelling
like a bit of photography and I like
coffee I really like good coffee right
I'm gonna start with a bit of history in
the old good days where machines used to
be flat big and black screens nothing
much on them and you barely can search
for a file it's because
it's just complicated but we were will
do excited about them but then we did
something a bit better and we moved to
the web and with the webcam the server
and we managed to write some code that
is not on this like big screen and
things are getting easier and we love
the web and because we loved the web we
decided why don't we make this amazing
thing on smaller devices so we can have
it everywhere and that's when also we
moved to more smaller devices laptops
mobile phones tablets as you can tell
with this shift in the type of the
devices and where we are storing our
code we there was a shift in the size of
screens and the way we interact with the
screens as well so we moved from clicks
to scrolling but even rolling is now
becoming a bit of a task for humans we
are lazy right so we kind of thought oh
why don't we move to something else why
don't we move to voice because it's
easier let's face it
but this shape didn't just happen like
that this shift is the result in lots of
progress and work done in different
fields mostly the fields that used to be
a research lab kind of thing
AI languages processing but now we took
all these separate kind of works on
these and we said why don't we instead
of leaving them just as a research like
some sort of elitism kind of thing not
everyone can understand it why don't we
bring them to the end-user and do
something useful with them and that's
when we started talking about contextual
communication we are using the language
we are using your eye and we are
changing the way the user communicates
with applications basically contextual
communication is as the name says it's a
communication with a context you have
two parts and there is a context it's
not just like flowing informations like
that think about it now if you need to
do anything if you need to call your
doctor if you need to book an
appointment if you need to call HMRC
good luck with that one but if you need
to do any of that you're talking to a
robot you know that you're not talking
to a human but it sounds like a human
and there is a context to the
conversation they ask you about your
name you give the name and then they
move to the next question if you answer
if they don't hear or something
they would say oh I didn't hear you say
that again so now we are talking about
havoc context it's contextual
communication and it's not just the
small things like Alexa or Google home
to look for the weather but we are
talking about big businesses trouble
agencies like ordering food or call
centers because now we are moving from
call centers with humans
to call centers that are basically a
machine behind the screen and when we
talk about contextual communication we
talked about conversational interfaces
this communication it still needs an
interface but it's just different and
when I use the word
interface it's not UI interfaces it's
not the traditional don't think of it as
a screen and we say conversational
because we do converse with the machines
chat BOTS again the home assistants that
we have now there is some sort of
conversation so conversational
interfaces there are three types there
is the text-based one's chat BOTS almost
now on every website or every service
you go there and they are like hi would
you like to chat to Rachel Rachel will
help you and then we have the voice
based ones Alexa or if you have a Google
home that's also based on voice and you
have those who are both of them because
if you are using the Cortana on your
phone or if you are good using the
Google assistant on the phone you have
the ability to use your voice to talk to
them or to type in the center
I'm going to focus more on the voice
based experience because that's where we
are heading basically and the value of
the voice experience why we should
consider voice the first thing is and
which is obvious is the speed think
about it if you if you need to search
something on your phone I don't know if
you need to book a flight or even look
for the weather in a certain city you
need to get the phone go to the app go
to the search box type and maybe you
have a menu in there and you need to
click to navigate between few pages
until you find that search thing you do
the search you click the search button
and then you will get the result
now with the voice all you have to say
is Cortana how's the weather in London
ok Google what's the temperature in
Lisbon so we talked about speed and
simplicity it's simple like everyone
uses their voices since we are babies we
use we use voice my mom would struggle
to use some apps maybe she's not a very
techie person but if I give her the
option to simply use her voice that she
uses everyday probably she would manage
to use that after like you know she
would get used to the fact that she
needs to say the word Cortana and then
ask for what she needs and that would be
more simpler for her to do that than to
use the phone or even the laptop in the
traditional ways and the other thing is
which is bit obvious is the fact that
it's available everywhere we are using a
human language we all speak that
language so it is everywhere you your
users
like you don't have like all of the
humans are your users right now let's
look at this from a developer point of
view and when we say designing for
conversation interfaces it's not again
it's not the traditional design as
designed but it's thinking about your
the whole experience how you what you
are offering to the user a few things to
consider and I will start with the
capabilities of your take although this
one applies to almost every app you're
building whatever you're building you
need to consider what you have really
you need to make it smart there is no
point building about that doesn't do
anything or it's doing the wrong thing
if I want to order pizza I would be
really upset if I'm booking a flight to
New York because the the price
difference is quite big so it needs to
be needs to be smart so how are we
building it we need to think about all
the possibilities and but takes me to
the other thing which is the structure
of the information because when we are
building these conversational interfaces
we can't really talk about error we
can't like have use cases because
literally the user can type or say
whatever they want so how are we going
to deal with that wasn't like one
obvious example of this is if for
example I say book me a flight on the
20th of April what do I mean by the 20th
of April is
that 2018 well April is not a good month
let me say on the first of January does
that mean this year which doesn't make
any sense because what's in the past do
I need next year which logically makes
more sense and how is this boat will
interact with me would they just imply
that I mean next year and they book that
or do they ask me the next question and
say what do you mean specify more most
of the time they just keep asking you
until you give them a more specific
answer so they didn't say oh I did they
will just say when when when when when
until you give them a more specific
answer and the other thing obviously is
the language that users understand and
can relate to if you're targeting users
added now maybe in a Chinese speaking
country that is maybe you should
consider do it in Chinese better than
English or if you're targeting a more
global use clients maybe use English now
I want to this is the light we are not
going to write code actually but I want
to to show a nice tool from Microsoft
that help with these things that help us
build smart models and that they
understand the language which is quite
nice and fairly easy to use it Louis
did anyone heard about Louis
that's not on my screen yet
right let's see okay um so Lu it took me
a while to understand that Luis is just
not a random Lois named Lois stands for
language understanding intelligence
service and what news does Lois is
basically you are building your language
model and training it in the same way if
you have an app and you want to do the
what since temperature now in London but
what's the temperature in London that's
a language model so Lois help you do it
it's Lewis dot a I you need to log in
with any Microsoft email and then create
new app I have few like demo apps and it
should it should work so if I click on
create the usual stuff and you see demo
you can you see the list of languages
that you can use there are a few of them
and then you can type a description and
if I say don't it's creating the app
and while it's loading it did that look
now okay while it's loading it's a um
there are few terms to know we have
intent and intent is what's the
intention we are talking in human
language but in the end of the day the
boat is is an application so how are we
going to translate that human language
sentence to something that the button
understands and based on that do
something so for example here this is an
app where I it's an up to or the field
takeaways or whatever so for example my
intent is the most important one is or
the food so I have an intent I just
create a new intent and you give it
that's probably me and you just give it
a name so I have all the food the by
default intent you get is non and non
means is probably something that the
model didn't understand or doesn't
qualify as ordering food if I say it's
such a lovely day in London it's
probably would say mmm that doesn't
sound like shoots to order food so I'm
done just gonna classify this as none I
have another intent over there which is
specify payment let's imagine that my
app asked me if I am going to pay by
cash when the delivery arrives or I'm
going to use card payment and we have
entities and think about think about
entities as variables or properties so
the entities in my intent probably I
just give them name so I'm saying
payment methods and my order so with
that in
specify payment I would say I want to
pay a cash so that would cash is the
entity that's the payment method and
then when I'm using this language model
in my application I would say oh I want
you to take that payment method and
based on that do this this and this but
in order for this to be smart I need to
add what we call it rinses which is
basically the these sentences but the
user would say like for I'll pay with
cash if I say I'm paying with cash
so it will add it in here and I click on
this cash and I say here I can see my
entities and I say the word cash is
payment methods
obviously in real words in are you you
don't just put like two or three of
these because the more you add that's
the training for your modem so the more
utterances you add the smarter hopefully
it becomes and then I say I did train it
earlier so if I want to test if I only
know how to click you have untrained
it's telling me that I haven't trained
changed but it's fine and you can tell
because I'm not really doing that
properly when I said the weather is nice
it thinks I'm ordering food let's say I
want to order sorry
so I click on that and in here that's
what I typed and the top-scoring intent
so each of these three in ten T's we get
some sort of score basically it says the
probability that what this sentence
means it's ordering food that's 0.3 and
probably the other ones are getting
sometimes they just get 0 or something
and that's how you train your model and
once you have a proper model that you're
happy with you can publish it
let me just this so publishing this
because it's gonna publish it to Azure
so you'll have the usual stuff like what
time zone and are you doing that in
staging or production and then you get
few other things if I just say that I
wonder if it would region key and
endpoint I'm not sure if it will allow
me just to publish it because I'm just
on trial yeah publishing complete and it
should show me this is my endpoint which
is a trade zone and if I curl to the end
of this endpoint this cue here is query
so I still can test here and say query
pegye thing and now that I like Mike Way
is not empty anymore it's telling me
what I did and the score and stuff like
that and then if you obviously that's
kind of the first part of what you need
to do and then if you want to
use Lewis with your like both
applications we you will need your like
proper endpoint and you use it with your
app you need to provide the usual stuff
like your key key the endpoint and a few
informations and then you just say oh I
want you to recognize Lewis so whenever
I'm using Louis in this this spot will
recognize Lewis and for every intent you
say this is what I want to happen if
that's the intent that we are getting I
want you to do this this and this like
any app
so this is we talked about Chloe's and
now I'm gonna talk a bit about the
Microsoft bot framework which is
basically if you want to build
conversational interfaces using
Microsoft technologies that's what
you're going to use with so Microsoft
offers the bots you can use them writing
in no GS or dotnet also they are pushing
a lot to use Azure so you can write as
robots these days what I do mostly is I
use old good net so um usually you need
to to use your body you need this
channel of communication so cortana
cortana is not the bot Cortana is a
Chanelle and we call them skills skill
is like just a unit of intelligence it
is an application it's your boat but
you're gonna invoke it through Cortana
it's not the only way you can use them
obviously with slack messenger lots of
other thing Bing there are different
ways but like obviously the most like
known one is Cortana because it is
intended to that so what happened is you
simply create a boat and then you build
and deploy your boat and the users when
they converse with Cortana Cortana would
invoke the boat because it's already
registered as a skin now there are there
are two ways to do this if I can
so either you so just like Lewis if you
go to dev both frameworks calm and Julie
again you'll have a list of your boat or
how to create a boat you can or you can
start from the Cortana website and you
say I want to create a Cortana skill
which when clicking on the button will
simply take you through the boats and
say would you want to resist one of
these existent boats as a Crotona skill
or are you going to create a new one the
other way to do it is to start from the
boat so you create your boats you resist
to them in here and then you go and say
and you simply say I want right so this
is the as I mentioned the chanels where
you can use these boats and I'm not sure
why the page is so weird and then you
can add something for example I say I
want to add Microsoft Internet so I
would be able to use this boat with a
Microsoft team's
and then you do some configuration stuff
and you have the ability if you change
your mind you have the ability to delete
the Sunehri
keep going to the first page I have no
idea yeah so as long as it's registered
Cortana would know the boat with keys
again and it will invoke it this is
exactly the same thing as I was saying
it's just written differently I think so
just build the boat then resistors as a
scale and you publish this game
right I love this page because it has
the files that I need to download so so
far the the bottom plate the bot
framework is not available for visual
studio for Mac so you need the Windows
machine that's the first thing and then
you need to download few files few
templates to get the complete and be
able to do it you need to have Visual
Studio 2017 and they say update all your
extensions and then you need to get
these three files here the boat
application the boat controller and the
dialog and you need their zip files you
need to install the boat controller and
your visual studio templates c-sharp and
project template directory and to get
the item templates you need to install
the controller and dialog zips you put
them under again Visual Studio template
c-sharp item template directory this
time not the project directory also the
other thing that you need to install
which is simply a desktop application is
the bot framework emulator so it will
help you test your BOTS locally which is
quite nice because you get the log you
see what's happening and also you see it
basically you test stuff in there
I guess this one so because obviously I
have all these zip files in the right
place I can if I go say new project and
because lately I was using like pot
applications so it comes in there and
I'm gonna say NDC demo okay
and as you can see he the abode project
is basically a web application at the
end of the day so you get all the Europe
config and the usual stuff basically so
in the web config when we register the
bots in that portal I showed you dev dot
bot framework calm when you want to
register your boat it will generate some
values of some case a bot ID and up
Microsoft app ID and the password they
go in here in the web config you will
need the same values to register the
boat as a Cortana skill and the reason
for that is when you publish your boat
and when someone invoke it
Cortana would go and see hmm what do
they mean
oh it's that boat over here so the only
way to know that is with this case
here we have a message controller and it
always does that when you first run it I
just need to restart the project or just
build it and it will be fine but in this
post method whenever the user sends a
message that's the method that will know
that there is a message and it will call
the root dialog or any other dialog if
you using dialogues and in the root
dialogue that's when we decide what to
do with that method in this message
receive for example this is the and the
by default piece of code you get with
when you first install the project all
it does when it receives a message it
makes sure first it's user message
because it could it could be a system
message notification or something else
related to the system not the end user
and all it says oh I got this message
can you count how many characters and
just by its it's just a sample but any
any logic you need to do any kind of
thinking and processing you need to do
with the message that you received it's
going to happen here
in this up over here I'm doing things a
bit differently so depends on your app
your needs and how complicated the app
is there are a few ways to handle
dialogues so you can use a simple
dialogue or you can use things that
makes your life easier so here I'm using
a form flow so a firm flow handles
everything for me
all I need to do is to specify exactly
what I need so I have in this demo here
what I'm demoing is how to use a TFA
verification so assuming that my boat is
an app that needs a verification code so
before doing anything so the boat he
would ask the user a few questions to
get some informations including the
phone number and after that would send
the verification code so as I said with
the form flow here I'm saying so this is
my strings and this is what prompts
these so this is what the boat will be
asking what's your name
what's your first name what's your last
name etc and then we build the phone and
we go like what you're gonna say in the
beginning when the form is complete
what's gonna happen and inside my
controller now instead of using virtru
dialogue i'm using this new dialogue
which is I'm calling it here make root
dialogue and it knows it's of type user
profile so I have a shame and let's say
from this I want you to do this when I
when it's completed when the form is
completed I want to send a refutation
code to the user
and you can handle exceptions in the
usual way I say if something that like
if something wrong happens this is what
we want to tell the user again
so in here I'm calling that and I'm
saying instead of calling the root
dialogue that I got for free now I want
you to call this new one that I created
myself and then what happens after that
is that when everything is finished I
want to reply say thank you for example
or do something and this is my in this
private function in here I'm just
sending notification code using the next
move verification api's so if I run this
as I said because it is simply a a web
application so I can run it but what I
need is the endpoint I'm using my local
endpoint usually you put the your URL
and then you put API messages if this
was publish it I would need that ID and
my password to connect to it but because
it's local on my machine I don't need
any of that I simply say connect without
filling these and hopefully I'm sorry
first and hopefully just connect to it
so I'm just gonna trigger saying let's
say hi and if you follow the logs it
will tell you exactly what's happening
and here it's telling me off or not
updating to the latest SDK which I
probably should do so for example I say
my name is Robert
but and then it's telling me to be able
to send me that verification code I need
to give my phone number which is fine
I do that
and as you can tell because I just
specified that I'm using the form flow I
didn't do anything this is part of the
form flow so it's not something like I
coded saying oh I want you to get all of
this information and put them in an ice
box or anything I just get it for free
so I say yes profile is complete and
then hopefully it will send me code soon
maybe not
oh I did you see whoa hey the last one
at 5:00 p.m. and then I'm gonna type
this and it's a thank you the next thing
probably to do if I wasn't lazy is to
properly check that that is a
verification code but it's some of the
things that you can do with it really
so this is what I have to say about this
just a brief kinda introduction to the
world of boats and how we should what
considerations as developers and why is
it important for us to to consider that
because apparently it's the future
obviously if you are interested in the
boat framework and katana Microsoft has
an amazing documentation they did great
job on their new documentation there is
like samples on github very detailed
documentation and all of that it can be
a bit confusing it was overwhelming to
to have all like 1,000 portal to go
through and to reduce the thing and to
get too many keys but after certain
paunchy you get it and if you'd like to
learn more about contextual
communication that's the website for my
company they pay me to be here but
because that's what we do we are all
about api's and we don't just innovate
with Microsoft so we have connectors for
alexa and we have also project with IBM
watson so we are really invested in this
area and my whole team that's what we do
basically thank you and sorry for the
cold and I don't know if you have any
questions they're not the end of the day
but so if you have any questions
I'm coming over here that's easy a sorry
sorry oh if you wanna order pizza you
need to know who they are where does
that fit in the flow that has legal
stuff to do so and you can you can
register information about the user but
after they're concerned yeah yes so
legally you can just take for example if
you are using the same app all the time
you can ask them if they need to save
their payment method their card or even
their name but if only if they lets you
do that and based on that you they say
that the the system gets a smarter
because it gets these informations and
try to build on there how would you so
the bit I don't understand though is so
say you you know you open up Cortana and
you say you know say you know when is my
delivery from Joe Bloggs arriving
there's enough context there say Joe
bugs was the company is enough context
and to be able to look that up if I'm
allowed to look at that person's account
let's say how do you know what joins
those things up no because like in the
end of the day what you're doing through
Cortana is kind of bridging to another
app so for example let's say if you want
to if you want to book or buy anything
through Amazon Alexa it's not because
your skin is it's not what's doing that
it's because you are connecting that
skin to your Amazon account yes right so
with any other application you are
connecting that skin to the main
application so probably if it's I don't
know delivery or something at some point
you will need to provide the right input
to do that
for example I listen to my Spotify on
Google hell but the first time to do it
it did ask me to connect my Spotify
using the phone obviously not like not
just on using the Google home but it
says look we have an application with
the settings on the phone for you
so go there connect to the Wi-Fi so I
know what I'm using put your information
oh and if you want to use Spotify it
needs to be a premium account would you
like to connect to you account so there
is always a bit of setting it's not just
random you know no absolutely I just
wondered with Microsoft Bob framework
you know how much of that is talking who
is it still the same thing and they
specifically say you can't get any you
can have like the users information
because the bot gets a smarter and they
have ways to make them to learn as you
use them but you can do that unless you
have the consent of the user to store
this data and use it okay thank you
thank you
yeah question thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
