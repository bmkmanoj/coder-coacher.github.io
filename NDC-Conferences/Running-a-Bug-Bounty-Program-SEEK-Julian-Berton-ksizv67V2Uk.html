I'm a
and security engineer at sea so I help
sake and the developers there try and
secure their products to make sure the
bad guys can't break in and steal our
customer data essentially I used to be a
developer as well and I run a bunch of
other things so this survey link if
you've got messenger on Facebook you can
actually take a photo of it and I got
the same picture at the end of the slide
deck so you can might kind of take a
photo and leave some feedback as well it
would be really good
I run the OS Melbourne chapter in
Melbourne obviously so we do monthly
meetups to teach developers and students
and new people to security about all
things security specifically application
security so if you are from Melbourne
you can check that out
and we also have a Australia wide OPSEC
conference coming up as well which we're
running for the second time this year
which would be pretty good so good good
lineup so that's a bit about me are you
guys all developers or so your technical
in general anyone who works in security
no didn't think so that's all right
awesome so your old your build products
that right okay cool
so today today's agenda doesn't work
sorry
just give me a second
they're sweet just gonna talk quickly
about what motivates an attacker and why
we're here in the first place and why
security kind of matters and some of the
trends and breaches that have happened
recently then we're going to go through
how like why that's still happening in
this day and age and why this transition
to building faster software agile devops
all those kind of buzzwords is making it
a little bit more difficult but then how
we can actually solve that problem as
well so that's kind of one of the things
sakes been trying to do over the last
few years is to try and scale security
as we move into a world where we're
deploying multiple times a day and lots
of different teams doing their own
autonomous things so talk a little bit
about that and then the main focus
obviously will be on bug bounty programs
as anyone heard of a bug bounty program
cool so go through that what it is what
are the options out there for you guys
as well if you want to try and bring
that into your company as well and then
a bit about our journey at seek over the
last year and a half since we've had the
bug bounty program up and running I'm
and then I guess some examples of some
of the submissions probably the more
severe ones we've had at seek as well so
that should be pretty interesting as
well so you can think of one thing that
comes to mind when you talk about a
hacker
what are they normally after when you
think of like a you know the guy in the
hoodie what about what do they actually
want money right so money is the first
one is there any other one do you think
of chaos anything they can sell so well
all the time it does come to money it's
not just about stealing physical cash
it's also that blackmail and all these
other different motivations but a lot of
it does come back to money or cash but
there are a few others so like could be
politically motivated it could be
state-sponsored we obviously heard of
like NSA and Russia and China or a
showing to attack us and things like
that
and religion religious views as well so
terrorist groups and things like that so
there are a few other things but the
that we have to worry about especially
if you're in a typical organization
that's you know not morally sensitive in
any way just a standard organization
producing products normally it's the the
money side of things that we have to
worry about the most if you get to the
point where you're starting to worry
about your nsa's and the state-sponsored
actors then that's a very different
kettle of fish and something that you
have to work really hard to be able to
protect against so unfortunately hackers
are here to stay and they seem to be
persisting I don't obviously I'm bit
biased because I'm in the security
industry so I hear about this stuff all
day but I feel like the security
breaches that happen are getting a bit
more attention from mainstream media
that's obviously because they're
affecting a lot more people as well so
this is a recent one that's happened
locally in Australia with Red Cross
Blood Service had their SQL database
backup publicly exposed to the Internet
and someone found it luckily I think it
was okay because it was a concerned
citizen who did find it we don't know if
it had been found previously by an
attacker and that was reported to Tory
and his website have I been poned which
is a good thing
we'll get back to that example of it
later when I talk about some of the
principles we can focus on to secure our
products this happened a little while
ago now but Gumtree was hacked username
and password stolen Yahoo do you guys
hear at this one or multiple of them so
yeah that was a pretty big one a billion
records were stolen so that data was
probably a bit old because it happened
quite a long time ago but we were only
found out about it recently that tends
to happen a lot
LinkedIn was the same case actually
their whole database got stolen in 2013
or so we only found out about it a few
years ago so these things have a bit of
a delay you know here's an interesting
case cuz they have so many breaches they
have a whole Wikipedia page to keep
track of them all now so yeah that's
pretty interesting and this is a really
cool site that actually shows you all
the different breaches around the world
by time so this is the latest ones that
have happened
so you can say from 2015 to 16 and 2 now
we have quite a lot and you can barely
see all of them there and the bubbles
show how big the breach was or how many
records were breached and you actually
go and click on each one of these it's
an interactive map and it shows you more
information about each breach so yeah if
you just google world's biggest data
breaches you can get to this lapse which
is pretty cool so what happens with this
data I mean we mentioned the motivations
were mainly money driven so if you're an
attacker and you steal someone's name
where they live like all this kind of
personal information what do you think
is the best way to monetize that
information sell it back to you is a
blackmail I guess you can see that yeah
it's a bit hard to scale maybe I mean
people are doing that a little bit with
the ransomware stuff right that's
essentially what that is so you have
this thing that gets installed on your
computer and your clips or your files
and then ransoms the data back to you so
that's yeah and that's where it very
very well these days anything else come
on put your hack your hats on identity
theft so using the data to get bank
accounts in their name credit cards in
their name surprising how little
information you need to get that to
happen that also puts the risk back on
the attacker who breached the data so
they often often look for other ways of
getting money at a lower risk way so one
of the popular ones at the moment is on
the dark web so through tor hidden
services and all that kind of stuff so
this is an example of Australian Records
you actually request certain people to
see if they have records on particular
users and we're talking not a lot of
money like this is 25 USD per record and
you potentially get a lot of this type
of information so this is currently
being sold and it has been for a long
time but I guess it's getting worse as
we put more and more information online
so all the way from Australian people
obviously to other countries and even
your typical like login bank account
details
this normally gets stolen by you know
you you an attacker sends out this
massive phishing campaign and grabs all
these users details by sending them
links to fake websites where they type
their credentials in and that's $30 a
pop and they've been tested also this in
this case unchecked balance so they
don't know how big the balance is but
this is actively happening so why do you
think this is happening can you give me
a few examples maybe in your
organization where maybe you haven't
done something just like to do with
security or it's kind of been put on the
backlog or hasn't really been
prioritized that's fair enough but I
like that happened it's not an unusual
situation it happens at seek as well
because at the end of the day companies
are designed or they're there to make
money and they're there to sell a
product so security is helping them it's
kind of like an insurance so yes along
with other types of departments as well
we're all kind of helping the company
sell products so you have to get that
balance between doing enough security so
the bad guys go elsewhere and try to
attack someone else that's essentially
what you're trying to do but you don't
wanna do too much that you're taking up
all the time so you can't actually make
products so if you think back and maybe
some organizing organizations are still
here but I feel like most organizations
are moving a lot faster and moving into
this new world of software development
so you used to have three to six-month
deploy cycles one software stack to a
company you know all these kind of
everything was very slow so you had a
bit of time to consider security within
that that period and you have like Gantt
charts and you put your security
somewhere in places so this might have
been what it looked like in a typical
organization where you have a maybe a
manual security review you might just
have a pen test that gets done right at
the end as you're about to release the
production and then you haven't really
allowed time for any fixes in case
there's any big fixes in there so that's
kind of where security start like kind
of initiated from but now we're moving
so we're moving you know like agile
methodology is DevOps EIT D all that
kind of stuff we're now deploying a lot
faster we're moving a lot faster so how
do you fit that same level of security
in this new world and that's kind of
part of what we're trying to get at
today so this is actually about a year
and probably almost two years ago now
this graph so I haven't actually updated
it recently but I'm sure it's a lot more
than 30 times a day but this is how many
deploys we were doing at seek
essentially yeah over over across a lot
of different streams so that number is
actually probably a lot lower a lot
higher now you can see that like if you
tried to put a manual pen test inside
each one of those 30 deploys before they
went to production you just you just
can't do it it's not physically possible
so how do you scale security so that it
can fit into this type of environment
what about this one so you have number
of breaches no this is a pretty graph
I'm not very good with this sort of
thing so and then unreasonable security
controls so why would the number of
controls increasing with the attacks
also increasing because normally you
think it's the opposite right normally
you think more controls the more secure
we are what's the key word here that
I've highlighted unreasonable so what do
people do when they don't like something
they're going to bypass it so this is
you can't see it very well but there's a
gate here but the gate is obviously you
can just go around on the grass so
people can see all the tracks are going
around the gate instead of going through
it so if you put all these controls in
place but they're not going to fit
within the current model the current
environment in which you're working in
then there's no point having those
controls just to tick a box or to say
yet we're doing this thing but no one's
actually really doing it or it's not a
very effective control so we want to
move away from that the other thing is
who has security as part of their
performance review awesome one person
yes
let's know it's a very unusual thing for
a tech company to have security as one
of their responsibilities a lot of large
organizations in Silicon Valley might
have this kind of mature structure but a
lot of the time the security falls on
the security team if there is a security
team if there isn't one then who knows
where it falls so it's a this kind of
weird thing where you you know it
doesn't really fit within the the same
model there's also a pretty big skill
shortage at the moment especially within
Australia of people who understand
security so that's one of the bigger
problems is it's really hard to hire
people to do this kind of work as well
so even when organizations are really
trying to push in hire people to do this
work it's very hard to even Google or
struggling so that that's a good sign
the things are not not going was so well
and this is just obviously a typical
ratio it might not even be it might even
be worse than this depending on which
organization you work at and what their
risk appetite is and all this kind of
stuff so this is what it is essentially
at seek at the moment but that's not too
bad really when you consider other
companies and we also have a larger
security team but still how do two
people try and secure other products of
all these different people who are
producing code on a daily basis
so the idea is to try and get that 140
people to try and do some of that
security work and that's what we're
trying to do a little bit at seek the
other thing is it's getting a lot more
complex so a lot of company and this is
a a slack message that Julian bright one
of the other colleagues we have at seek
he posted the other day so this just
gives you an indication of how many
different frameworks and languages we're
currently using ballpark so it's not
just the one software stack anymore now
we have to consider security for all
these different frameworks different
languages and that just adds to the
complexity especially when you couple
that with this situation so if the
developers and everyone else in the
organisation organization I'm
considering security as part of their
assessment criteria
say hey should we use this new software
stack should we use this new framework
this new library one of the security
implications do we have tooling that can
support these new frameworks and
libraries so that's probably an
important thing to start thinking about
before it gets a bit out of control so
what is the solution then can we make
our web apps 100% secure is there a way
there is one way
don't put them on the web so turn it off
shut down everything no customers no
problem right that's essentially the
only way to get a hundred stansky or so
apart from 107 we want to get pretty
close to it so one thing we can do and
these are some obviously pretty
high-level principles but a lot of them
are pretty self-explanatory the first
one is what I'm going to cover a little
bit today but there's obviously
minimizing attack service keeping things
simple so even getting rid of your tech
debt can be really helpful with security
as well so you actually do a lot of work
security into your business cases to
improve other parts of the business as
well but if we consider the debt the
defense-in-depth analogy I like to use
the car safety analogy so in a car you
don't just have one control that
protects you when you have a crash you
have multiple controls in place ABS
airbags seatbelts crumple zones and all
these things are in place to protect you
not just one control so it's a similar
analogy for security so if we have a
look at this example of the Red Cross
breach that happened here are some of
the things that they could have done to
potentially prevent this from happening
so if they did one or two of these
things it probably would have prevented
that breach from happening in the first
place let alone if they had all these
different things altogether it paints a
very better picture so in this case they
had a an SQL database that was on a web
server that was publicly accessible so
it only took someone to scan the IP
address looking for SQL files or
got files to find this thing because the
the server had directory listing turned
on it wasn't white list it was publicly
accessible there's no authentication
they might not have had a pen tested it
was a third party environment who was
looking after it so did you make sure
that that third party was looking after
you know security as well so there's
lots of different things you can put
around it monitoring and learning
potentially as well to detect access to
us early don't expect people to be
accessing so there are little quick wins
you can do to to kind of get there so
how do we integrate these principles
into this new world that we were in
software development moving fast well I
don't know if you've seen this but it it
all starts with conjoined triangles of
success so first of all you can see a
nervous Joe I don't know if you guys
have seen Silicon Valley I really try we
really need to somehow integrate and add
security as part of the this DevOps
kind of world that we live in so now I
know you've already got as a dev you've
now just got lumped with all this new
work that you have to do with
infrastructure and you have to set up a
diverse environments and all this other
stuff
but now we also need you to think about
security a little bit as well
unfortunately and hopefully as the
tooling and information online gets
better this shouldn't be that much of a
learning curve after a while but this is
really the way we need to go so take
this is our kind of plan a little bit
it's not by any means complete but there
are different stages of the development
lifecycle and we add security into each
one or trying to add them I'm not saying
we're done all this it's very difficult
to get to this level of maturity but
what I wanted to talk about today is
really bug bounty programs so hopefully
this gives you some context around why
we considered a bug bounty program
and as you'll see some of the value we
got out of it it was it was really quite
good but it is
the very last stage kind of a similar
realm as a pen test so you do really
want to be doing a lot of this other
stuff as well especially the training
side of things and trying to automate as
much security into your your build
pipelines as possible as well so a bug
bounty program is essentially a
crowdsource way of doing security
testing but the other the other main
difference is that instead of paying
someone to come in and spend a week of
their time and you pay them for that
time you're paying these researchers all
around the world to participate in your
bug bounty program per bug that they
find based on the severity so if they
find a high critical vulnerability
you're gonna pay them a lot more than
they you would if they reported a low
one and if they don't report anything
then and they've spent a whole week of
their time you don't pay them anything
which does seem like a little bit unfair
sometimes but that's the incent scent of
eyes model to incentivize them to keep
going and to try and find something if
something is there so from a business
point of view it makes a lot more sense
sometimes I mean it can be more
cost-effective as well so these
researchers are from all the way around
the world will see some graphs of where
they might come from in the most in a
second but it does help us even up the
playing field a bit because we can tap
into this resource of people who do have
the right skill sets they're diverse
they're constantly looking for these
types of issues on other programs so
they replicate that same knowledge at
the end of the day if we can find all
these issues on seek that's all we care
about not if they're using the same
skill set to get a lot of money from
other companies as well if they're
finding the same vulnerability on
multiple sources that's that's great for
us too so there are a few companies out
there at the moment that help you run
these types of programs obviously buying
them from scratch like your Google and
Facebook do it requires a lot of effort
a lot of resources a big security team
so these guys have come into the scene
and the last say three or four years to
help companies really just get their
foot in the door you can do
really minimal testing to start off with
minimal programs with a small scope so
there are ways of kind of working up to
a big BIGBANG like we have done and you
can do it obviously like time-based - so
two weeks on your production system or
it could be on a testing environment
things like that but essentially when
the researchers get involved in these
programs they get a brief so this brief
outlines what targets are in scope so
technically they should only kind of
test those particular domains what
issues you don't care about which what
things you don't want them to test if
you don't want to test for denial of
service because you're worried that your
service might go down and affect
customers you can put that in there as
we'll see a bit later they don't always
follow these rules but it's a really
good indication and it gets you kind of
a descent there which is really good and
there are a lot of companies at the
moment that are doing is about 500 plus
programs and that's growing pretty
rapidly every year some of these
programs are private so you might not
know exactly about a lot of these
programs it's something till they go
public where they start getting marketed
a bit more and if you're a researcher on
one of these platforms and you have a
good reputation score you start to get
invited so you can actually some of the
benefits of a private program is that
you just invite researchers who have a
really good reputation so you're
minimizing a lot of the risk of a rogue
researcher going and stealing all your
data and all these kind of risks that
you normally think of when you think of
allowing 50 hackers to just test your
site even the Pentagon has a bug bounty
program now so it's definitely hitting
the mainstream it has proven success in
a lot of different companies so it's
getting a lot of attention from your
regular industries now not just online
tech as well surprised I guess not so
surprisingly there's a large percentage
of people from India who are
participating in the programs but also
from everywhere else around the world so
it's really getting that untapped
resource skills because you don't really
need to be
submit English speaking to put like to
participate in our program you just have
to be an awesome hacker and know how to
find cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities and all these types of
things so the barrier to entry is really
small so it's all about lowering that
friction for these people who have the
passion have the skillset they just want
to test your program and get paid a
little bit of money for it as well so
not surprising is the technology
industry is probably the leader in bug
bounty programs mainly because they're
probably the best equipped to handle
programs initially but these days those
services I was talking about do allow
other verticals to get involved in an
easier way so we are starting to see
other verticals getting involved as well
and as you can see it doesn't really
matter how big your company is is a
pretty even distribution of people
getting or companies getting involved in
these programs as well so it's not just
for you
5,000 plus employee company there's not
have any questions of that just feel
free to interrupt during
yes that's probably like consultancy
firms and people specifically do it I'm
not sure exactly it like so this data
actually comes from the state of bug
Danny report so yeah might have to refer
you to that document maybe they have
exactly what's going on there but they
produce one of them every year with
updated data and that's through
background which is one of those
providers so this is just information
from their service as well it's not
global make sense yeah it's a good point
probably like IT management security
services that kind of thing rather than
products online technology kind of thing
so just before I get into the journey
that we went on at seek that isn't
important to ask the question can I run
a bug bounty program the answer is
probably yes but you do have to ask a
lot of these types of questions to make
sure the business can handle it so if
you don't have for example security
aware people to help you fix these
issues or triage issues that might be a
little bit of a problem maybe you can
get a consultant to come in and help you
or maybe the services themselves can
direct you a little bit because the the
researchers will give you some
information but they won't give you all
the information you need to be able to
completely fix and remediate all issues
what is the maturity of your website so
if you haven't had a pen test done or a
security test done by a consultant or
anything else and you don't have any
other security controls bug bounty
programs might not be the first place to
start because you might run out of money
quite quickly if there's a lot of issues
that you have to kind of flush out so
it's always important to kind of
understand whereabouts your maturity
sits before you unleash the crowd as
they say and the other thing is can you
fix issues with in a timely manner so if
you have lots of issues and you have
this bug bounty program as soon as
they're found
especially critical ones you don't
really want them to hang around too
often and if your if you can't fix a
critical issue within say a week or
month even and this thing ends up being
there for six or twelve months that's a
risk oh yes you have to take but at
least you know about it so there it's
definitely a positive outcome there but
if you can't fix these things the
researcher community does start to get a
little bit annoyed and I'll show an
example of that
also how fragile your systems are if you
can put a testing environment out
publicly so that people can test on that
environment rather than your production
environment that's great not everyone
can do that we couldn't do that because
our environment was so interconnected we
didn't have one testing environment that
we were happy to push publicly so we
decided to test on our production
websites with a few restrictions here
and there so that customers weren't
affected but if you have a really
fragile website and if you ran like a
security tool that automated
automatically scanned your site and it
brought it down for example that happens
constantly all the time with these
researchers coming on board so you have
to make sure you can handle that so
that's a good question so there are it's
obviously one thing you can do is not
put it in scope so in that brief that I
mentioned before you just don't put if
it's on a subdomain or you could say
specifically don't test this thing but
if so you kind of have to segregate it a
little bit and it have some internal
processes sometimes that deal with that
type of incident so for example we have
sake we obviously post job ads and we
don't want researchers posting fake job
ads and hitting real customers so we
have a fraud team internally and we have
a few other process in place that
prevent those ads going to our real
customers so one thing in the brief we
actually say please are in the post jobs
to this category in this section where
we know there's no customers who are
applying or searching on those on those
categories so there are kind of ways
around it but in some cases with
one of our products we had to completely
take it off the the scope because there
was no really easy way of not affecting
customers because it was about
purchasing a CV and that would directly
hit the customer so in those cases bug
bounty programs are the best solution so
in those cases best just to get a
regular pen test or other security
controls in place yep if you have a
staging environment and it's publicly
accessible then that's great you can
actually these services actually do
offer like a VPN service where you can
direct the researchers internally but
then they have to connect via a VPN so
that that's that kind of friction
element to it as well like would they
test on your site versus testing on
another program that's just easy to hit
so we kind of and again it's not
one-size-fits-all it really depends on
the situation in your company and what
you're trying to achieve
but for sake we realized it was a lot
easier just to lower the barrier
completely test on productions
production systems and try and cater for
those scenarios where we yeah customer
impact and stuff like that yeah so it
took a lot of investigation a lot of
understanding about what our risk
mitigations so if I get time later on
there are well definitely released a
slide deck anyway and I have some stuff
in the appendix section that goes
through the risks associated like what
happens if an attacker steals all your
data and puts it on the dark web or
whatever so there's a lot of answers to
all those questions and if you can make
the business comfortable that you've
fought through and you have kind of
backup strategies then that puts them a
little bit more at ease then
so the other thing you can do is run a
smaller program and which is what we do
very limited scope so you can kind of
start very close to a real pen test to
get the business comfortable with
running these programs and then so you
don't have to go Big Bang public program
anyone can do it on production systems
you start off smaller and that's kind of
what we did essentially so we had 50
researchers invited you can obviously
have less than that - we've tested on
production was only for two weeks and we
only had three apps in scope for this
one out of the two over the two weeks we
had a hundred and four issues reported
and we voice you had lots of pen tests
done in the past as well so these were
uncovering issues that have been there
for like three years that we'd never
knew about some new that'd just hit
production like in the last week kind of
thing because we do like lots of
deployments so I was catching everything
and it was very varied but what you can
see here is that there was 40 they were
actually triaged the rest were either
duplicates so we already knew about all
they were existing like kind of won't
fix or out of scope kind of issues so
the these services help you to triage
and deal with these the incoming issues
or the other thing to note is like we
did get a massive spike when we first
started the program in the first few
days but then it kind of paid it off but
the interesting thing is the high rated
issues didn't really come through until
that halfway through the program and
that's obviously for a good reason
researchers need time to understand your
application really have a look what's
available there and then go deeper on
certain issues and then fund and they
kind of come up there so overall we had
three high issues come up and those are
like really like quite high issues but
we definitely cared about even the
medium ones we like really didn't want
to get there we really wanted to fix em
pretty soon as well and then all the
other ones were kind of just
informational lower ones that weren't as
severe obviously but that's a pretty
good ratio like from a pen test
or any other type of security testing
you really want your high quality issues
and getting a quarter or so out of all
the all the issues as qualities it's a
pretty good ratio yep so yes there's two
levels so the first of all the service
so in this case bugcrowd and the
researcher themselves will rate it based
on what they think but then you always
have to rewrite that based on your
internal if you have an internal risk
rating I don't know if you have like a
matrix that says if it's gonna cause
this much damage you know what's your
risk tolerance as a company and then
kind of rewrite it internally but it
really depends on if you have that skill
set in-house and whether you have that
matrix and stuff like that but you can
always rewrite them at the end of the
day it's really just to provide value
rather than ticking a box to say yes for
secure so just focus on the impact to
the to the business rather than the
actual priority that's given it's
probably good yeah so you rewrite them
and then you they get paid out at the
rear Aidid severity if that makes sense
so you make the final call yeah so the
customer always makes the final call
there is a bit of a to-and-fro because
sometimes it's not as obvious what it is
and there are a few cases we've had one
recently where we end up writing it as a
low but they thought it might have been
a high so it was a bit of an unusual
situation you get those every now and
again but generally speaking it's pretty
easy to understand how bad it is so
they're always top ten that's an
indication of I don't know if there's
everyone heard of the OWASP top ten if
you haven't go have a look it's a really
good document to get people started in
security at least the what I waswhen the
community think are the highest or most
common and most severe issues in the
wall
and that's kind of backed up by this
data at 97% of all those issues that we
found were actually from that top 10 so
it's a really good indicator of where to
start your training from where to start
teaching or the developers about certain
issues so it's a really good place to
start in other words the other thing is
you invite 50 researchers but not all of
them are going to actually test on your
side because they're busy doing other
things a lot of them have day jobs so
out of the 50 we had only 15 people
submit something which indicates that I
need about 15 of them started testing
because most people will find something
it might even be a low that's kind of a
good indicator of how many people are
actually testing your site because
that's the one thing you can't guarantee
with a bug bounty program is how many
eyes are testing what parts of the
system whereas least with the pen test
you can say hey can you please it's a
physical person you can say hey can you
please test this website very thoroughly
and then you can ask them what they
tested whereas the research is a bit far
far removed so it's a bit hard to get
that assurance this is still a POC we
had 15k in the pool for the researchers
so this is the distribution of the
rewards so as you can see a lot of them
were paid out in the 200 range which is
all the lower issues that you saw before
we had one or two that were in the
higher range and they're getting around
a thousand ish dollars and if you take
that on a per researcher
right so two weeks worth of work and
this is in USD there one researcher got
over two thousand dollars which is
especially for countries like India
whether the currency conversion rate is
really good these guys are making you
know it's definitely worth their while
in other words which is where that
motivation comes in and how we can tap
into that resource pool the other
interesting part is that we didn't
actually see that big of an increase in
traffic so two weeks before the program
versus during the program this is the
traffic difference I don't know sake
have a large amount of traffic that we
pump through our sites anyway and it
really depends on how much traffic you
have initially on your website
but for us it wasn't a big increase and
that was one of the things we were
worried about and what the business was
worried about is how we're gonna handle
these these researchers are they gonna
take our systems down especially because
we're testing on production does anyone
have any questions so far
yeah so if the the question I understand
correctly we don't need to provide any
credentials because people can just sign
up themselves on the on our sites to get
credentials to get access but if you
don't have that ability then you can
actually specify the credentials or link
to something that will tell them how to
to login so you can actually if you have
a site that needs credentials set up you
know manually then you can do that as
well there are ways of doing that yeah
yep that was all of it yep yep
if it doesn't all get paid out it's
specifically for bugcrowd anyway at the
time things change pretty rapidly but
you can then use that same pool for the
next test if you want to do another one
as well yeah and that's not including
the bug crowd fee as well which is like
I can't remember now but not probably
half that so seven or so so what we did
then after the park was pretty
successful obviously we've got a lot of
value from it at seek nothing collapsed
our customers didn't complain too much
so it was like when when that proved to
the business that we could move forward
and try and do a little bit something a
little bit more which is an ongoing
program so we started that in last year
in November so it's almost been about a
year we started with 50 again and we
ramped up over the last six to 12 months
you know ten per week and that kind of
just keeps that cadence of new eyes on
our applications and we're still testing
on production so this is kind of this is
what the the researchers get invited to
when they invited to the program it
tells them a little bit about the
company and then goes through all the
the program brief so if you scroll down
you'd see all that stuff that I talked
about before reward ranges in scope
items all that kind of stuff it also
gives them an indication of how much
they might get paid if they find bugs on
your system because obviously there's
lots of program
and if the reward ranges are very small
or there's just kudos
so nothing then they might go elsewhere
so it's all about managing that kind of
expectation as well and obviously the
more rewards you have the more skilled
researchers are probably going to likely
to come and test your stuff so you can
start off really small and then ramped
up through a range as well so there's a
lot of flexibility in how you run the
programs so yeah so duplicate issues
it's paid out for the only in the first
person who finds it and if you have in
so that's that's where it comes into not
really so they get an indication when
they submit the issue we say this is a
dupe here's the link to the duplicate to
prove that it is a duplicate because
there's a bit of a trust thing there
because you could just feel like oh we
found this internally I like five days
ago sorry can't pay you but so you have
to be pretty honest and you don't want
to it's all about keeping up the
relationship as well because if you burn
one or two relationships with the
researchers doing really good work for
you they're probably gonna tell all
their researchers friends not to work on
your program and then you're not getting
the value out of the program that you
want so it's very much about keeping
that relationship and honesty and
transparency but and then that's the
other reason if you can't fix
vulnerabilities quickly then you start
getting into that where a lot of the
submissions might be duplicates if
you're never fixing anything and that is
a bit annoying for researchers obviously
you can also break up into different
tiers which is what we've done so we
have one tier which is obviously a lot
less so our kind of internal domains or
stuff we don't care at all like a static
website that's hosted somewhere else and
then you tyonne's which is maybe where
all your sensitive data is and all that
kind of so you're willing to pay more
for that because you care about issues
more on those websites
I'll be going for time as well what time
is it quota to say 15 minutes okay I
gotta keep going so this is the live
skip so this is the average time taken
so you can see the critical issues are
getting very quickly being remediated
severe pretty quickly being removed away
remediated within two weeks moderate
again it's a bit more so this is kind of
a really good way of indicating how how
well you can fix and respond to issues
and if you don't then you might get
something like this where we had an
issue that's been around for about 12
months and researchers get linked to
that issue so they know how long it's
been around this guy oversee there's
gonna buy a cake and sing happy birthday
to this vulnerability because it was
turning a year soon so he was obviously
just joking but it's a bit frustrating
from a researcher point of view this is
a graph of JIRA issues that we so all
the issues that are found on seek this
is low high medium everything and you
can tell when we did the POC and when we
started the ongoing program so really
good spikes but you can also see this
green line is the remediated issues so
we're also constantly fixing issues as
well so eventually over time you want
these kind of to converge a little bit
but initially gonna see a massive volume
of issues coming through especially a
few maturity is not awesome think I've
already really gone through a lot of
these the only one I wanted to point out
was that if you are testing on
production you're going to be triggering
operational alerts so make sure your
developer teams are aware of testers and
have backup strategies in place they
don't always follow the rules so as I
said this is some of the researchers
that were following the rules about
putting a specific user agent string in
their in their request for no testing
because we want to know who was a tester
who wasn't and this is obviously the
people who didn't so you can see that
the brief is really just there for a bit
of a guidance you have to have
Cup strategies in case I might another
another one is like even if it's in even
if the domain is not in scope they still
might test the site but then you don't
have to reward them for those issues of
their report if you don't want to and
obviously every now and again you'll get
some researchers that are really unhappy
with the response you've given and they
get a little bit aggressive sometimes so
you just have to be a bit
tongue-in-cheek and just kind of
understand that they might think that
you're they're trying to get they're
getting screwed over or something like
that sorry so I just got a few examples
of issues now and that's really
finishing up the presentation today
so it has anyone heard of an XML entity
attack this is gonna get a little bit
technical now so please try and follow
Facebook have had one of these before it
was really popular issue last year with
the bug bounty community so again once
one person finds and starts blogging
about it then every size is tested for
this one particular issue so essentially
it involves around if your website takes
in a document like a word document and
then parses that document you may have
this issue so what happens is with a
doctor and you can actually unzip it a
docx you can actually unzip it and you
get a bunch of files and within one of
those files you can actually put XML in
there because docx is all XML based and
what they do is you put this external
entity which refers to a server the if
you control with this kind of file
that's hosted their payload DTD so you
set up a file server with that file in
it and you have another entity in there
which is extracting contents of a file
so in this case it was running on the
the server that was pausing the word
documents was running on a Windows
server but in the case of Linux so some
people in the case of Facebook they had
it running on a Linux server so you can
get kind of
passwords file and dump that out so all
you have to do is set up this thing so
it's listening just a simple Python
script will do the job
upload a resume and then wait for it to
kind of parse the document and then when
it passes the document it will actually
execute that XML script and send to the
server the contents of that file that
you requested
so essentially you can get out a lot of
sensitive information in the worst case
you can actually get remote code
execution you can do like server-side
request for jury we're hitting different
internal URLs so that was a pretty
pretty bad one this one was actually
really really good and not in a good way
they're very interesting so this is kind
of like an insecure direct object
reference but not really as a bit of a
weird one so in one of our apps you can
obviously this is an advertiser Center
where you post the jobs essentially you
can invite users to be part of your
account so you add their email address
in they get an email saying hey you can
activate your account when they click on
that link you get taken to a page where
you put in your password
it all looks pretty innocent until you
look at the request that gets sent on
that password complete so you've got
your new password it's it's all pretty
standard stuff first name last name
email and your password your this
security link thing which obviously
seems to tie to that particular length
it's you got sent in the email and then
you have their user ID as well what the
researcher found is that the code wasn't
actually checking this security good and
then you could just enumerate through
that user ID and change everyone's
password on all the accounts so that was
actually really like very very impactful
very obscure cuz you have to have this
one user settings turned on to be able
to get to this page which is probably
why a lot of other pen tests and other
other bug bounty programs in the past
cuz we ran this came up in the second
program that we ran so even the first
program didn't pick this up so just
shows you that continually testing your
apps will still find
Sudheer issues this one's a good one as
well third we're moving into AWS for
moving a lot of our API is publicly
facing I didn't find a vulnerability but
it's never a really good way to start a
report but once you'll see what I mean
in a second
so this guy said infected server
question mark this this is not our
obviously our main domain it's a domain
that we use to host a lot of our
internal non client facing stuff so it
really shouldn't be public facing so
it's not a massive impact for us one of
our tier two domains but obviously what
I found when I dug the serve this this
server or domain is that it was linked
to an IP address there was in Amazon to
a5 to address is normally Amazon one
which is pretty common for Oscars we're
on AWS and what happened is this remote
skin for X Y Z was used by us at some
point but that IP address was then
discarded at some point and picked up by
another person who decided to put a
website containing some not-so-nice
material on there so essentially we were
hosting on our own domain a porn website
which is not good so he fixed up pretty
quickly so things like this come up
quite often in bug bounty programs
because they have a lot of tooling that
automates a lot of this stuff for us so
this is the offending one here and all
you have to do is really just remove
that from your raft III or your DNS
server so remembering to clean up after
yourself as well I'm really quickly
gonna get through this one and then
that's about it and if we have time for
Q&amp;amp;A I'll answer it outside so we had
this come through which is kind of out
of scope in some ways because it wasn't
really in scope wasn't affecting one of
our domains we had in scope but again we
definitely wanted to know about this
issue so we end up paying this guy out
regardless of the fact that it wasn't
really in scope so it involved Twitter
SSI plus a customer service
a little service that we use equals
access to our internal corporate slack
channels which is obviously quite
sensitive information in there so we
have a ticketing system all tickets go
to support at seat combo you they have
an option to sign up with Twitter in
this customer service thing to be able
to see emails that you've sent to
support so you can check on the status
of these emails so here you can see that
emails are to support a seat comedy and
from the users email address that you
log in via your Twitter you might get
lost a little bit hopefully it makes
sense a little bit towards the end
because this is really complicated it
took me probably at least half day to
figure out what's going on here even
myself so if we go back here and we sign
in with Twitter and we actually use
something like this no - reply at slack
comm and what we found is Twitter
doesn't enforce email verification so
you can actually sign up to Twitter
using whatever email you want and the
SSO wrauth implementation wasn't
checking your email address so you can
see they things are not getting is their
email address so it's like or what's
going on here so means this customer
service portal wasn't actually checking
if there was a valid email address but
how does that get me anywhere so now
it's actually logged me in as no reply
at slack comm on this customer service
portal and we're seeing emails from to
support and from no reply I'm in the
Twitter documentation it does say that
you can actually get this email but it
will returns null if it's not verified
so that's obviously something they
weren't checking there so at the moment
we can see emails from support to any
email address because we can just sign
up on Twitter with that email address
that's not that interesting like people
support emails aren't that sensitive
normally our customers normal just how
do you post a job ad or things like that
but what we do is we do use slack and
slack offers a feature where you can
find what teams you're associated with
so in this case you can get an email
from slack at no reply at slack Andre
you with the list of the things that you
have access to so in this case the
researcher was able to add in support at
see comedy you in here see the email and
the customer service portal to figure
out we had access to slack got the email
that gave him access to join our seek
slack because the emails from there also
go into this portal because they're from
no reply at slack come to you to support
at seek come to you and he was able to
gain access to our corporate slack
channel like that so crazy number of
different things that all got put
together and chained up into this
ridiculous long thing and I guess the
main point I want to make here is that
you can never automate that like you can
never automate something that does that
but what you can do and this shows the
importance of looking at each thing in
particular in its own right so we
thought of this this portal wasn't that
sensitive was just answering customer
support emails it doesn't tie into any
of our corporate stuff at all turns out
it might actually do that depending on
how things are configured also that was
our slack wasn't on the corporate plan
just yet it is now but it was allowing
this to happen so any domain on at
seekto comedy to make it easier for our
employees to sign up so having that
option on was also what allowed this to
happen in the first place so just shows
you like if you put a lot of controls
around each individual thing it's much
harder to do these chaining of issues
and that is it so if letting go time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
