the beautiful and mixed realities my
name is Maxine Ileana writes a long name
Marxist gay further onto here so I'm
basically the one that is delaying you
the party so okay I'm the one between me
and the party and the idea is that I'm a
web developer okay so I have been doing
web development for a while now
so around 22 years okay so that's a long
time and I'm also been doing mobile apps
both from a website and also a native
side so I'm from Argentina so I have
been doing also trainings around the
world on many countries and many
companies and I have also a couple of
books as you can see there with a trick
so I have some books original books I
have authored and then translations from
languages that I don't really understand
ok Korean Japanese Russian and the
latest books are priming the mobile web
and high-performance mobile well from a
riley so as you can see i'm usually
targeting a mobile web as the main topic
so questions yes please later so we have
an hour before the party so and then so
i will try to give some minutes
therefore for questions so we're going
to cover we're going to start talking
about the new words so for you to give
an idea i want to give you an idea of
how these new words of new realities
looks like how the experience looks like
from a web point of view so we're going
to see how the web is getting into these
realities today then api's and specs
that are currently available and are
going to be available in the near future
what we can do today with some examples
of frameworks and things that you can do
and finally the future so what company
what come in the near future so based on
the first on the new realities that we
have available now for the web so
basically the web has always lived in a
box so from this so my first website the
first website have browsed was basically
in those so it was something like that
so from that from a mosaic right our
friend ie even on mobile browsers it was
always inside
the box okay so now it's time to get out
of that box and that's that that
basically idea of the new realities that
we have okay
I'm not saying that everybody is going
to browse the web using these new
realities it's just for a specific use
cases okay we know exactly how many use
cases we have we have an idea but I mean
it's not like 50% of the browsing will
happen in VR and in the next CBS at
least so it's time to free the web from
that box and that's the ideal when we
have new realities they have a
better-funded here so um that's another
reality by the way it seems so we have
digital reality probably you know that
so you know what that means
okay augmented reality and mixed reality
that are kind of similar concepts okay
mixed reality has a parent last few
months 30 years two years something like
that there is kind of a better mental
reality so basically the duration
element already was I mean the original
talking about like five years ago on
mobile apps mostly it was just a layer
of information on top of your reality
okay so where is the metro station so
you were using your phone and it will
show you where is the Metro stage it was
just a layer on top of that the idea
with mix reality is that that virtual
information will mix with the physics of
your realities so for example the
holograms on the hololens are one
examples that right so when the hologram
knows where the chairs are where the
table is so basically we can put things
on top of the chair so that's basically
one of the difference between augmented
reality and mixed reality so but
probably you think you hate but they're
what developers this I am
so because sometimes when we're talking
about VR we're talking about 3d unity
right native apps and not about the web
so we have good news and the good news
is that these reality stars come into
the web and there is a reason for that
the reason basically is that I'm not
sure how many of you are BR users or
even hololens users but basically if you
want to install an app if you want to
experience some be our solution you need
to sell a nap
okay that usually is between two hundred
megabytes and gigabytes on your phone on
your hololens on your windows computer
if you have an HTC device vibe or
something like that and sometimes you
experience one experience that you're
going to use just once right just
something that the newspaper is offering
you I know like see a New York in VR
okay one experience I don't want to fine
an app for that so you want to try it
experience and probably if I want to
install the experience to get a better
performance or something like that I can
do that with the Web today but that's
why the web it's going to be huge for VR
annulment reality that's of course like
on the web today that's not the you say
for every VR experience of course if you
have a very heavy 3d game but it's
better a native app so it's like the
mobile web ten years ago even fifteen
years ago right think about PR today as
ten years ago the mobile web well kind
of
it's absolutely interesting right the
experience wasn't so cool we didn't have
so many users but now is half of the
users half of the users are browsing the
web through mobile devices so we are in
that era right now in VR and AR so in
fact this is not really new on the web
not sure if you have ever seen this
that's from the 90s okay so ah VRML
stuff some kind of an HTML 4br okay of
course we didn't have any headset at the
time so we are was basically like like
quake right you are using your car soft
keys to walk in a BR environment its 3d
environment but that was 20 years ago
okay it looked like this okay so I
remember a Yahoo version where every
section of Yahoo they index went well
Yahoo were an index remember that Yahoo
was before a search engine it was an
index so every section of that index was
a door so you open doors you get into a
room okay so that was like an old
language of course that now we have a
different technology we have headsets
and now we'll get into that because what
happens if you don't have head
anyway let's start doing about
technology for that so these are
technologies about the experiences so
because I'm not sure if you all of you
have ever experienced like web content
on a br on an AR device so first we have
flat web content so every website that
you have developed or design so far can
be browsed in VR mode like I will show
you how it looks okay then we have
completely 3d words okay around me
there's a completely new work I can also
share 360 animated or still content like
pictures for example if you use a camera
like the camera we have here okay so I
can take a 360 picture okay there are
different cameras available for doing
this so and if you take the picture
probably you want to share that picture
on a website right now probably you have
seen those pictures on Facebook if our
Facebook user sometimes you see 360
content video or photos well what
happens if you want to share that on
your own website okay well that's one VR
experience that you can offer to your
users and finally we have augmented
reality or mixed reality on the web
okay so we will get that at the end so
adult distribution so as I mentioned
before today most of these solutions are
being distributed of apps native apps
that you need to download from stores
okay and as I mentioned before that's
not really useful on most of the cases
because of most of the cases you want to
just experience that's things like a new
car you wanna sit in that car and see
how it looks like and that's all right
so you don't want to get apps for that
then you have websites for example if
you want to share 360 content be it 60
video you can be shot inside a normal
web site and now you can create pressive
web apps okay
so oppressive web app quickly it's just
a website that can be like upgraded
using pressure management techniques and
new api's too unlike a native app okay
like a native so basically it can be a
website but if the user wants to install
that and have an offline experience then
the user can do that right
using these new technologies
so so again why the web impressive web
apps are important for those experiences
of these experiences because we can
share something like videos photos or
even if you want to share like a
conference so something like that as a
HTML CSS JavaScript 3d models probably
and you can use all the API that you
know as web developers to create those
experiences that the user basically just
need a device and that's all so in terms
of if you have never seen this before
let me explain first the humor interface
so how the user is going to interface
with your 360 or VR content so we have
gaze with gauge I'm not sure if you have
ever play with the devices that are in
the in the main room so there are a
couple of VR devices there but if you
try some for example even though the
hololens use gauge gauge is basically
using your hel to point to think you
have a cursor on the screen and and then
you're going to use shafts your head as
the pointer okay so that that means gaze
that's one thing that you can do and now
we will get into the platforms that we
have available on javascript but
basically for example on the mobile
phone then you have accelerometer and
gyroscope that will let you do that so
because that goes inside the headset
then you move your head and the phone is
moving then those sensors we give you
the information so that grace but also
you have the boys and we will get into
the API is that we have available today
on the web to work with the boys right
so I can express commands using the
voice touch controls for example the gr
BR has a touch pattern here so you can
scroll you can click right on the panel
doesn't have a clickers okay
and controller so here you have an
embrace the clicker example at this so
usually they are Bluetooth based depends
on the device controllers like more
complex controllers okay like joysticks
and game pads that you can use and even
your body one for example you are using
devices like the hololens okay like when
you
using just your fingers okay so and the
idea is that you will get that
information in JavaScript somehow okay
so the API is that are appearing today
will let you do that of course you can
even connect mouse and keyboard you can
say okay what's the idea here well you
can create a whole visual studio in BR
mode okay so you can connect a full
keyboard and then have 100 different
simulators around you like phones
tablets right and make a web app or an
app the red green dr and for that
probably you want to call and for that
you need a real Giver
so now a quick throughout every platform
available for today at least that will
support Ori support in today web PR and
first we are talking about platforms
that needs a song okay so the cheapest
one is a carb or something like this
okay where in this case you put your
phone in size so this is like 20 euros
something like that or even cheaper and
you put a phone it can be iOS or it can
be Android and then you have like a very
basic VR experience okay so that's the
cheaper solution of course it's not the
best experience in terms of frame rate
the whole experience that you have but
it works okay and that's something that
you can use today then we have the the
GRB are by oculus and Samsung it's that
one that you need a galaxy device inside
so basically the galaxy device is the
engine the screen and also the most of
the sense for example not the touch
panel but all the rest of the sensors
are coming from the phone so daydream is
a even speck from from the Android
system to great headsets and create
phones that work together this case this
is a daydream view that's like the the
first daydream compatible headset but
it's not the only one and this is the
pixel from Google but now the Galaxy s8
will receive an update and it will also
work with daydream okay it's not there
now but it's coming so from this year
next year every high-end smartphone will
be daydream compatible and that means
that you can use that phone inside every
compatible headset and the headset also
includes like the controller the
controller is basically to
point-and-click so then you don't need
to gaze you don't need to move your head
to point to buttons or elements on the
screen and then we have desktop based
platforms where instead of using a phone
as the ensign of the heart of the
platform you are using a Dexter computer
and there you have ocular drift okay
that today working only on Windows and
you need like for all these solutions
you need really good Hardware ps4 VR HTC
vive and Windows mix reality so these
are some keys that are coming ok from
Acer HP and other platforms that will
work with Windows course and the idea is
idk it's not Halloween so in this case
you will connect using a wire ok that's
saying it's like an external display
with some sensors that's basically the
idea and then we have standalone
platforms that today in terms of big
players we have only the hololens
because with the hololens is completely
wireless so you don't need to connect or
bind these to any computer the computer
is here ok the battery the computer the
display the projection mode is
everything is here ok so it's a
standalone solution there is another
solution that is scanning google has
announced that solution that we don't
have devices yet for also for the
daydream platform so they're going to be
stand-alones headsets as well running
Android we don't have those yet today ok
so that's basically the like so panorama
of VR and AR so we have now seen the
experience that we have for the web the
human interface possibilities hardware
available and now we are good we're
going to get into web platform and
that's the web user experience so far we
have been talking about hardware but not
about the web so ok it looks like okay
so from beyond the web we have different
browsers today
that are compatible with VR or AR we
have Samsung internet browser mature how
many of you are some so users but you
have like an icon called internet but
that icon is basic the Samsung internet
browser
it works with VR we will Chrome okay I
will mention this later but basically
will Graham has two modes VR modes one
is about the API that we will talk about
later called web er that works on every
Android phone and with some to say for
now warnings and then there is a new
version coming of Chrome for br okay
that's not the same as web beer let's
get into that later Facebook is working
on the browser as well because phase
will realize that you don't want to
start an app for every VR app or
experience that you want to use so
that's why they're creating a browser
okay the today is in preview mode I will
show you the examples called Carmel for
now that's the name edge is now
compatible with VR but only on the mixed
reality kids not on the hololens yet at
least
and then there are a couple of
third-party browsers on every store that
you can use to download and try so let
me show you some experiences so instead
of using live demos I can use the
ademÃ¡s because it will take time to get
the Wi-Fi I have some videos they took
today okay for every experience so this
is the first Samsung Internet so with
this one okay so when you open the
browser the Samsung interval so this is
what you're going to see so you move
your head okay that's the idea so you
put this and you move your head and in
this case it's point engage you can see
a small card so they are going on okay
like that you can type a URL okay and
you can see it's like a curved screen
around your your BR world okay so you
can scroll using the panel here that's a
normal 2d web site that's the MVC of the
web site okay but if you if I open a
video it goes like in a theater mode by
everything is now dark okay so and you
can change the mode of that video okay
so because
you can share 360 videos 3d 360 videos
as well get into that later how to do
this so you can change the move okay
when you are watching the video and you
can you can open more tabs if you want
and also there are assumed versions so
you can like make a bigger screen so you
go to an IMAX now to look at the website
so a bigger cinema in that case probably
you need to like move your heads you see
the whole content but that's that's how
you browse the web okay on the Samsung
internet browser the last thing I want
to show you here is that around you you
have like a picture it's like this
animated okay you can and I'm sure if
you so there are some lights going on
there so from the menu you can change
that background that is known as the
skyline you can select like the
background okay so and then you can
browse the web with different 360
pictures or even animations and what is
more important later I will show you
that now if you have a website you can
define your own sky image for your
website so when the user is getting into
your own website you can like create the
full immersive experience for that user
so you can pick that image okay so the
next example is the kernel preview
browser so that's the Facebook one today
you cannot type a URL so the only thing
that you can experience our demos from
Facebook so it's just a quick demo there
so that's that's the browser you can see
that there is no URL bar that's a game
to transcript game that you can play you
can also see that that has the sky as
well and then it has a 3d model in the
middle that's usually WebGL it's not
mandatory but it's usually WebGL while
you're going to render here and here you
have some examples okay that you can run
and try directly from here this is all
open source so you can go and see all
the code that you have there so that's
the button add own button which outfit
and then you can click on that button
and change the color of that thing and
you don't see that here but you see
perspective you see 3d
because we have two different I so that
the view for each I so that means that
it's 3d okay so you can also show 3d
content likeness to the female then this
is a chrome VR on Android it's a preview
in fact it's not working properly yet on
the latest beta of Chrome
in fact you if you want to try you need
to enable a fly okay inside chrome
called Chrome VR so I'm here in an
Android phone and think it wasn't a
pixel on the same website and I'm going
is did this so I'm looking at the
website and then I'm put in that phone
here in the headset okay so it's asking
me to close the headset to finish the
experience that's the idea and when you
do that okay you need to synchronize
that with the controller so that's how
they dream works if you want to try that
later I can borrow this so when you do
this then you are browsing that website
you in 360 mode and that's chrome okay
you can see that the sky is just white
so I think they need to change that they
have the URL bar at the bottom and again
that's the 2d website not the web PR
content notice 3d 360 con them and you
also have a video you can see that I'm
not sure if you see that line there so
that's my pointer side pointing with
right with the pointer in there in the
beautiful environment and this is
playing transcript okay so everything
you can you can read the data of the
pointer which are script so you can know
exactly where I'm pointing you in the in
the VR experience okay so that's that's
chrome okay so it's again it's really
experimental today then what happens in
Safari Safari that's what having in BR
mode yet Apple doesn't have a VBR so in
the latest WWDC they have announced a br
for the mac okay for the HTC bye for now
only but not in safari yet okay so we
don't have the are on safari yet so but
if you have something like this the
Carver
okay that's iOS then you can look at
that website in this case with my iPhone
I was doing
like this okay just moving my iphone
party you see that in facebook right
when you're seeing for 60 count I can
get full screen and also I can get VR
mode and this case is asking me to put
my phone inside the cardboard and now
you have a 3d also view you can see that
the screen is a split and for each eye
this is basically using an open-source
framework from from Google and finally
we have as on hololens so i came early
today this morning
here it is wrong so i shoot the video
with the holland in this particular room
so you can see how the experience of
browsing the web looks like on the
hololens okay so so first I'm opening
the Start menu takes time sometimes when
you're when I'm recording the video
because using the CPU for the video
sometimes takes time so you can like put
edge is the only browser available in
the hololens leave for now so you can
type a URL okay come on and you feel so
calm and you can see that that website
is just hanging in the air okay that's
the idea of the hololens and i can even
look behind that website okay inside we
wasn't around there so and you can open
as many times as you want you can scroll
the website just using your fingers but
the idea is that that website is now
hanging like a frame inside your room
and you can walk around your room and
put different websites on different
parts of your room okay so in this case
on mobile in Netflix and then I'm
getting ethics out of that window to a
new window then I can position that
Netflix somewhere in fact you can even
go to a new room and put that on a new
room like on the bathroom probably in
the bathroom so you have Netflix the
bathroom and then the hololens remember
each room and what the windows that you
have position on each room ok so that's
how you experience the web ok when you
are using the hololens
as you can see it's still 2d content
okay so they're like frames hang in
there and you can reposition everything
you can move this in the 3d space
okay so I can and I can also resize this
as much as you want even you can change
the aspect ratio I think I did that
limit so um like there yeah you can make
it like taller so now it's a total
viewport okay um yeah you can have every
newspaper in your living room so when
you're having breakfast you have every
newspaper around for example I know if
you want to do that but anyway and of
course you can open videos as well and
many many other things okay but for now
it's still - the content okay so that's
that how browsing the web looks like
again you can see behind the seal so
nothing is there
okay so unshut for fun I also I want to
show you this if you have never seen
this already you have but this is not
the web now I want to make the
difference here that you can make 3d
holograms okay like there okay so and
those are 3d elements that's the
difference with the Web today okay you
can put that there
I think it's much like here in fact if I
turn on my Holland's now if I wear the
cons now we will remember everything
that I have said before this morning
okay because it remembers the room so
that's how the web looks like from a
hololens point of view now let's see
what API do we have available like to
serve content for these devices or these
experiences are a number these devices
are just the model well 15 years ago
okay so we are just starting with this
so we are going to cover here what we
are the gamepad API something around web
Bluetooth another API that can help you
creating these experiences or creating
experiences that will work with these
realities
so first let's talk about web we are so
web we are we give you data about the
current capabilities of the VR headset
so for example not every headset is the
same so there are some headsets that for
example the hololens that will give you
something known as boom scale
information so the hololens knows about
the room the size of the room the shapes
that we have the table where the table
is okay where the chairs are other
devices like this are more simple so it
doesn't even have a pointer or a clicker
or something and we have devices with
clickers okay
like the rim view so the API the
JavaScript that we give you the that
information okay so that's the first
part that it will give you the toes
that's the help mount and display so we
give you basically the coordinates of
where you're looking at okay that's
information that you will receive in
chocolate and if it's available also
room-scale data so you will receive the
3d information about the current room
how the room looks like okay and what
elements do we have in the room so then
you can position elements HTML elements
the most of the time WebGL elements okay
in the room and also you can request VR
mode using this API so you can have like
a normal website UD website for a
browser a plain flat browser and then a
button saying start BR mold
something like that and then with that
ABI it will request the user to plug the
be our heads okay with the animation
that you saw before it depends on the
platform you're using windows on the HTC
vive then you need to type the the
headset and it's usually prepared for
working with WebGL so WebGL is going to
make the rendering not what we are okay
web PR is just going to position the
camera on that WebGL 3d work
so so then we have a first draft the one
point now there is also a one point one
that some browsers are supporting so you
can see some kind of a mess it's a still
experimental this API and we also have a
draft of the next version of the API ok
this is the first version not that you
point oh okay
so just to give you an idea of what do
you have available for example you have
some events they are available for BR
something for example when you connect
the device when you disconnect the
device we're talking about the headset
okay when that device is activated or
deactivated on the new version of the
API instead of things go in Windows
Navigator there is a navigator dodi our
object put everything for this API and
then you can ask for VR displays to the
navigator and you will get an array of
displays usually only one and then you
get the information that you need okay
from there I already mentioned this so
the API today is available on Android
from version 59 it's also available on
Firefox in the developer edition version
okay so resulting the final stable burst
and on edge from version 15 not on
Hollins and it's like a mystery of why
it's not in Halloween yet and also on
the Samsung internet browser that ABI
okay so for this device but by the way
there are I think it's 2 million devices
out there of this Samsung VR headset and
goodness good partial good news is that
there is a polyfill available and that
polyfill will also give you the ability
to use the API even an iOS why because
it's emulating the API using
accelerometer and gyroscope api's I'm
saying that is partially good news
because the frame rate that you will get
here because it's not prepared for PR
it's not so good so the experience when
you're doing this with an iPhone it's
not good enough yet it's okay for a
small test
or but it's not comparable with all the
other headsets yet okay
in fact the idea is that for VR we need
higher frequency higher frequency rate
so we have we need at least hundred and
twenty frames per second to get a really
good experience so that means a
chocolate performance is really
important here and also what the is I
believe on that new Carmel Developer
Preview browser from Facebook's pockets
the only thing that the browser is
supporting then we have the gamepad API
and the gamepad API will give you
information about pointers game paths
and controllers okay on every else the
devices we have seen before so it will
give you information about gamepad and
controllers basically you can get an
event when a game polish connector
usually just Bluetooth connection and
you will get information about the
buttons okay and also if it has a
joystick you have information about the
axis as well this is available
everywhere every browser including
Safari supports the gamepad API ok
mostly with Bluetooth joysticks and
gamepad so but Google would will chrome
when further because for example with
this controller you have here a touch
panel so I can scroll on that touch
panel and the additional gamepad API is
not prepared for that so that's why
Google Chrome crave you an extension for
touch and pose ok that it's also
available that's also useful for example
for the oculus or the HTC vive where you
have different controllers that are
pointing to different places in in 3d so
you will get all that information by
it's on Chrome only that extension under
fly so you need to enable a slide to get
it work today at least ok so that's
coming so you can see we are starting
with this and then we have Bluetooth and
you can say well why do you need blue
tooth this is not to connect with these
devices blue this is more to
to the environment okay so if I'm
working with a hololens and there is a
light or something when I talk when I
interact with a mixed reality with the
Reg I want to turn on the lights or
unplug that then we need web Bluetooth
and it will let you scan Bluetooth
low-energy devices around you the
services of every device and you can
connect to these services and send and
receive data this kind of low level mean
you need to understand bluetooth first
but it works okay so just a quick idea
of the API so you say navigator
Bluetooth I want to request and when I
look for a device using a filter so in
the filter you're going to see what kind
of device do you want to get and you can
use like generic constants available or
you can use like you unique if you have
your own Bluetooth device then you can
use the unique ID that you have like in
certain that hardware and then when you
are when you have the device you connect
to the device you have a primary service
you get something called the
characteristic and then you listen for
values coming from the device and of
course so you can send values so the API
is not so complicated but of course you
need to know sound bluetooth and how the
device works unfortunately that's
available on chrome only under fly and
also you can make it work
now with something called origin trial
other ideas that will help you creating
these experiences ambient lighting API
the gain or whatever I mentioned a belt
that's the like the new version speech
web audio let's start with ambient
lighting API this is pretty simple it
will give you information about current
light conditions why do you need that
because when you're using things like
this mix reality devices you need to
know about the brightness of the room
because that will probably let you
change the colors that you're using
because it's not the same if it's a dark
phone or bride's room so it measures in
Lucas and it's pretty simple it's a add
eventlistener device light and it will
give you information every time the
light changes the information change
if it's a pretty simple API that is
available on some browsers such as
chrome chrome is under fly-in edge it
was announced that it will come in the
next version and it's also in Firefox
okay well this is the the same API that
we have mentioned before but it will let
you connect with game paths that are not
probably coming from the same headset
provider so it can be any Bluetooth game
but even it can be a PS ps4 gamepad ps3
game pad you can connect those game pads
to - Dexter computer for example okay so
you can connect that and that's
available the new version on some
browsers only and now it's time to talk
about speech I'm not sure if you know
this but today the web can speak I can
listen to the user okay so let us
interact with the user and not talking
about VR here I'm talking about the web
normal well but of course in the are
it's useful with some challenges that we
have but it's really useful when we are
doing this in VR mode so speech
synthesis will let the web speak and
recognition we let the web listen to the
user the API is simple this is how
you're going to speak okay you create a
new object you set some properties like
the tags the language that you want to
use the page the volume and you say
stick okay so the challenge is that some
browsers are working that on BR is that
today some browsers will let you let
your website to speak only when the user
interacts with the button or with
something know where the page loads for
example when you have a headset right
then if you want to say something you
don't you don't want the user to touch
on the screen so that's why they're
working on changing the spec so then you
can use a in BR mode when you are in
deer mode you can use the API whenever
you want
that's a via our recognition okay do you
see how it works you create also an
object some prop
these you have any believer and that's
basically every time the browser things
that have some data for you
so some recognition of what they usually
saying that it will give you a result
with the text and the percentage of
confidence so will say you know I it
seems that the user has said that and
thirty percent you are okay and then you
can do something about that
in the beer war for example so the
synthesis is available on Chrome on
safari given an iPhone opera it's coming
on edge and it's under flag on Firefox
recognition is chrome only unfortunately
today at least ok and then we have Web
Audio why do we need web audio for BR or
a our experiences first you generate
dynamic audio that will let us do two
things
ultrasound communication I will give you
a quick example in a minute and 3d a
spatial audio so when you are doing the
are I have one of these headset on I am
wearing this headset if inside the beer
were someone is talking to me in this
side I should hear that is coming from
that side right so then and if I move my
head if I'm pointing my head so they are
or they are the spatial audio will
change so I will recognize that the Sun
is coming from there like a 3d audio
okay so for example let me show you this
DCPI for communication it's like instead
of Bluetooth you can communicate two
devices using ultrasound that's pretty
cool so there is a open-source framework
called sonic net so this is how we work
so the greatest socket it's not a TCP
socket the socket through audio okay and
you send data and from the other side
you receive data okay so let me show you
a video this is a video from the
developer okay so it's turning off the
Wi-Fi so you recognize that there is no
connection so you can see it from a
phone and sure if you there is like a
quick sound there but you can go with
your sonic now there is no sound
you don't need please don't have dogs
around Raleigh so in this case no
Bluetooth no Wi-Fi it's just sending
information from one device to another
device that it can be for example device
that it inside headset to a computer or
do any other thing is Raspberry Pi
wherever that you have there that is
sending information okay from the
headset so that's one use case and the
other use cases for example spatial
audio and there is an open source angle
for that called Omni tone that will let
you mix this with VR so then you will
create the cool extreme for your users
and that's available also everywhere
okay so the Web Audio API is available
everywhere which is a good news
so in terms of API is we have cover web
PR web blue to help you connect to the
physical devices around you and some
other api's okay so now let me show you
what you can do today
first you can serve contents you be our
headset of course we have already
mentioned that but also to desktop on
mobile browsers even if the user doesn't
have a headset probably have seen this
that using pressing engagement you can
also create VR experiences for users
without the VR headset ok and that means
that on desktop you will use your mouse
to drag around that it's like a window
in a VR world and on knowledge devices
you can use your fingers to move or you
can just do this it's not the same
experience but probably have seen this
for example on 360 content on Facebook
if you have it headset yeah it's an
immersive experience but you can also
offer be are ok to users without the
beer heads but most of the users today
and for that you are going to use the
presentation approach so the same code
will work on both situations and today
you can create sub content that's just
the normal website that you're creating
today that you can in haste
sometimes that content we can render
better on VR mode you can share 360
content like the picture
for example I'm going to take right now
you can create completely 3d experiences
like a bigger 3d World Star Wars or
wherever right that you can walk around
it's a completely 3d world or what
happens with a mental reality and that
there is a question there okay question
mark you will see why in a minute so in
terms of that content that's just normal
website okay I showed I demoed the the
NVC of the website and several devices
that's a phenomenal website that you can
see inside via headset so it's a 2d box
inside a 3d environment and as I
mentioned before on Samsung into the
browser you can define the Sky box the
Sky box is the 360 image or animation
that is in the background that the sky
okay
of the 3d environment and you do that
with a very simple JavaScript API call
that works only in the browser okay you
just define the URL of the image it can
be informal and there are also other
other versions of the image and have
several images for like it box around
you cube around you so but it's very
simple and and then you can start
encasing your website for VR users so
I'm inside the game every time the user
is doing something then you can change
the image that they usually seem as the
sky so under expecting this for other
browsers as well now Chrome should
probably do something like that because
Chrome will have the same chrome VR mode
and right now it's white so it doesn't
look nice
okay suppose we have I know it will be a
meta tag a JavaScript API like the
Samsung one to change the sky box for
360 content as I mentioned before you
can use device orientation that's the
JavaScript API that has been for wipe
early six years or just touch a mouse to
move around 360 content like images that
you have there okay anyway you're
probably going to use a framework you're
not going to just write the code
yourself you can of course I have mono
or stereo images the idea here is that
mono is just the image that you are
with your normal camera or even your
phone camera and stereo means that you
are taking two pictures one per eye and
I will create the 3d experience okay
there are more expensive cameras than
are doing this for using this today
there are a couple of free and open
through solution the first one is BR
view from Google they have two versions
a chocolate version an iframe version so
the iPhone is easier is just by in front
like that you define the URL of your
image and if it's mono or not and that's
all and that iframe we have beer support
with the mouse with the phone movie your
phone or with web BR if you have a
headset it will create the full
experience for you okay so if you have
360 content you can start sharing that
content your website using the Train
work so this is how it looks like so
when you get there you see that image
okay and this is a using this device
okay so then it will split the screen
automatically for this device there is
also a Beiser editor available that's
the URL where you can create this
experience yourself there is like it's
like a BR editor where you can create a
6360 experiences if you're sharing video
so if you have 360 video the samsung
internet browser have some specific
types that you can add talking about
that saying okay that you can add to
your video tile the normal html5 video
tag but you can specify that this is the
360 content so then instead of looking
at the like a cinema the video will
appear around you in immersive mode okay
and there are a couple of the dimensions
that you can set okay it can be 3d or
not and they are different like format
here to store the file the actual video
file side by sides of the border well it
depends on the camera that you're using
it will give you the video in some
format and then you define the dimension
inside the source of the video type
and that's today compatible with Samsung
internet browser we will see what
happens with Chrome to capture 360
content you can use these cameras okay
or even you can use the cab or camera
app that is available in Android and iOS
so Google Play Store and App Store it's
free from Google that will create that
image for you for image is known for
video this and then there is a tool I
will share the slides anyway with all
the URLs there is a tool that will give
you the final file that then you are
going to host your web server ok in this
case you will like take different
pictures with that app to create like a
panorama or a 360 image that you can
share on the web and then you can if you
know 3d and WebGL you can create WebGL
experiences ok but if you are not in the
3d of space that's like a huge deal mean
for normal web developers because it's a
completely new world WebGL it's like an
OpenGL implementation in JavaScript in
fact it doesn't look like JavaScript it
looks like C++ so fortunately for us we
have one excellent framework and one
that is coming the first one is a frame
this is coming from the Mozilla team
it's really great simple to use and it
will create VR for on normal mode so for
example with the head with the finger
with a mouse or will the accelerometer
and also with web BR with all the
compatible heads it will do that for you
and it works will something like this it
works with web components so you create
an a scene and a sphere with a sky I
will create the BR extreme for you ok
automatically there are a lot of
examples on the website that you can try
even there is an online editor that you
can type you can change things and see
that in action that's pretty cool one of
the best frameworks out there to create
BR content today for the web and it
looks like this and you can see the
that's the
example the basic example that icon if
you click there it will request VR mode
with a headset if you have any of the
headset that it will do the work for you
to use the web BR API or to polyfill
that API if it's an iPhone without it
for example it will do all the work for
you
also a 3GS has PR support
that's a 3d library the it's common on
3d games on the web and now Facebook is
working to fill in Developer Preview
it's working on react VR ok there is a
version of react for BR ok isn't paste a
quick demo because it's like 20 lines
that because that's react and but it's
the same thing as react that
specifically targeting BR components
okay it's open source and it's basically
all the examples that are available for
the Carmel browser are basically react
BR example
so today the idea is that you're going
to use pressure enhancements techniques
to offer be our experiences to all your
users even users without a beer headed
for that you can still share in your
flood should be content and you can
engage that content for example with the
skybox information and that will
probably double probably be news on that
during the rest of the year mean things
to do on Chrome for example you can
share 360 content and you can create
completely 3d BR work for example using
an iframe okay so that's everything that
we can do today but there is something
more the last thing I have for you is
that okay what's the near future focus
on the web and BR and they are first
it's augmented and mix realities and the
first thing I want to show you is the
cameras a platform I'm not sure if you
have seen this but this year Facebook
Apple and Google the three companies in
their developer events they mentioned
this idea of using the camera as a
platform
for AI for machine learning and several
things okay for effects on Facebook or
for recognized objects for example on
Google and also even with Google the
Google glass didn't work I'm pretty sure
that it will appear one time LaForge is
a company that is creating like nice
glasses like those that are going to
taste like the glaad whoo glass well
done and there are a lot of companies
working on that so the concept will
appear again well you have a camera on
top of you okay also the car and for
that we have some api's some API is that
are available today and some API that
are coming so let's get into that first
a well-known getusermedia API that will
open the camera okay so this is the
latest version of suspect but you
request user media and then you can
basically render that on the video tiger
and that's working today well in a
couple of months everywhere because iOS
11 and Safari 11 will support
getusermedia for the first time so that
means that you can in your website you
can open a camera and render the camera
on the screen the question is yeah you
want to add layers on top of that if
it's a 2d layer it's easy the paramus if
you're going to I mean if I want to see
your Twitter accounts on top of your
faces that's that's a challenge when I'm
moving my camera okay well for that
there is an API that you can try today
it's called the shape detection API and
there are today the API supports three
kind of addictions face detection and
that detection will be done by the
browser and the browser can rely on the
hardware the CPU GPU or a machine
learning solution or in the near future
probably a machine learning CPU like a
TPU like Google and CPUs are probably
they're going to be devices with GPUs
inside that will give you that
information so you can detect I see
okay we have an array of faces on an
image and that image can be can be a
JPEG or it can be an image that is
streaming from the camera and if you
give an array of faces and each face
will have the box and that's X Y width
and height of the face and also
landmarks what's a landmark inside the
face eyes mouth nose it will give you a
coordinate of that for example it's when
I put something on top around okay to
make effect also you have text detection
so you have it you could create a text
detector and we'll give you a block of
text that are detected with the box and
also the raw value so that's OCR on the
fly using the camera and finally you
have barcode detector okay that will
also give you the raw value and amatuer
if you want the box there but probably
you want the value on a QR code or a 2d
barcode and this is available today in
Google Chrome under flies from crown 57
I think so if you have chrome on Android
you can try this right you need to
enable the flights experimental web
features and then you can try the API
okay so it's pretty cool of course you
have some transcript algorithms to do
that that they use a lot of flattery
because a lot of bitmap manipulation but
this is like more optimized that's idea
so what that's one part but Google is
going even for can it has announced the
last Google i/o web a er web augmented
reality API proposal that works on top
of web PR and it will give you
information about spatial search so for
example for the hololens the Holliman
has enough cameras and sensors to
recognize the space around me the
distances and also 3d objects that we
have in the room well we will get that
information in chocolate and today
that way if you want to try this there
is an experimental apk so a nun will
package the pre mental compilation of
chrome fact is not really chrome that
works only on tango devices those are
there are three devices
so they're supporting something a
technology from Google's known as tango
that it's like a similar technology that
the hololens has but on android special
cameras and sensors that will recognize
things around you and here i have a
quick video of one app that it's it's
there okay that for example you can use
to try furniture in your home so you can
see it's recognizing the floor in 3d and
you can put using like just your phone
you can put something there like in the
hololens okay but in this case using gel
chocolate okay so that's that will be
web AR if you feel embarrassed anxious
but it will let us do this kind of
things on the web so for the hololens
some possible future devices we still in
early stages for the web at least so two
great x previously everything is native
okay so if you wanna create things like
this 3d content from the hololens for
example you cannot do that this is just
native right so that's the hololens but
it's not working on on on the web today
so there is no web access very
unfortunate today so I think we need we
need toward there is something called
follow Jes if you want to look at it
it's a frame where it's an official
finger from Microsoft that you create
Universal windows apps so native apps
using a script so not for the browser ok
I just was also using WebGL here with
you this this is for the VR devices so
it's an it's a place where you can run a
write JavaScript code and when you
execute that code that code we great 3d
content in your VR space so this has to
give you an idea of what we can see in
the future so we can write code them and
see that that all of those elements
appearing in 3d around us Singles pretty
cool so the last thing I have in the
last two minutes is about new challenges
okay
so for example what a big sell mean so
for example bitmaps if I have like
that's a hotel hole so if I have a
website like far away what a pixel means
so why because I can get really far
really near really close to the element
so if I render ten pixels wide what does
that mean ten pixels okay so we need to
redefine bitmaps like this like when
your 3d game if something is really far
away I don't want to load the full image
because I'm not seeing that image I will
load a very small version of that that's
usually called mid maps so we can create
responsive images based on distance of
the user distance okay there is a format
that is called leaf the new image format
that will support these kind of things
so this is just ideas it's not really
inspect but something like that we can
have media queries on the distance okay
like far away or even if the user is
looking to a different angle you can
change something with JavaScript so
these are new challenges that we have
okay we will have okay even infinite
viewports if I increase a built on
window what we want mean that if I have
a website and I'm creating a lie I'm
doing this do I want the longer website
we want to me if I'm resizing the window
what do we want to find the size on the
window we want to get a different layout
like a mobile layout if I'm doing really
small this do I want a mobile layout the
same layout but smaller so I don't know
right what do we want probably we need
to define this what will happens when we
are doing this so for the future we will
get into mental reality we have newer
api's like wherever you are and more
devices coming so we have cover your
realities the cloud experience looks
like today from a web point of view the
API is available what we can usually in
the future okay so I think we're talking
about exciting times the web coming
but we are still in early stations so
everything's probably going to change so
keep in mind that so that's all
any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
