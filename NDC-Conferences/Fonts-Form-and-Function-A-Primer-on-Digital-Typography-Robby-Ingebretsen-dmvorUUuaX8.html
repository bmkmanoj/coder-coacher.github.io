the fonts form and function a primer on
digital typography do we have any like
type enthusiasts in the room okay that's
great
and then how about who's here to learn
about type like starting from scratch
okay that's great too
that's even better for me actually
because it's a primer so it's a sorting
starting in the beginning um let me
introduce myself my name is Robbie Inger
Breton I work for a design agency
actually started a design agency called
pixel Lab we're based out of Seattle
Washington are there any other Americans
here just me okay well is it a novelty
to hear an American accent not really
right if you guys come to the US you
your heroes
we love any other accent and we sound we
know that we sound kind of stupid
everywhere we go
that's okay um okay well I want to start
off by the way we this is a little bit
lightly attended but I promise this will
be a great talk so stick around you will
have a ton of fun and it's kind of nice
that it's small you can interrupt me ask
questions we'll kind of treat it more
like a classroom
all right um so I'm gonna start off by
reminding you telling you about a story
of a scandal rumor disgrace betrayal a
story that shocked the type world
you may remember ver Donna gate anybody
remember this so I think it's 2009 IKEA
did the unthinkable and they swapped
Butera the typeface they'd been using
for years and years and years for ver
Donna not just in the in their you know
their web in in digital materials but
everywhere they changed their catalogs
from this typeface that they'd been
using for I don't know since the
inception of Ikea until 2009 and people
were so upset about this that it made
headlines in the New York Times Time
magazine this is I think as closed as
typography has ever gotten to like real
news by the way so this is a big moment
um this is the difference I don't know
if I mean some people don't see it
some people do see it I don't know if
you see it that but this this side right
here is the
the old one this is fou Torah on the
right hand side we have a switch I moved
to Verdana and the reason that this was
so upsetting to people this something
terrible that it happened the reason it
was so upsetting to people is that they
made a change for what seemed at the
time to be the wrong reason so they
moved and I have to say it was well
intentioned but they moved from a
typeface that was targeted at print to a
typeface that was targeted at the web to
from a sort of a print typeface to a
digital typeface and you can understand
why they did it because maybe they saw
that I thought you know it's funny I
still don't think my kids are
particularly I don't know like digital
organization I don't know if people shop
IKEA online I don't think so but you
know maybe this seems kind of
forward-looking here you can kind of see
the different side by side
the thing about pradana is it was
designed to be a great screen typeface
and not a great print typeface and if
you look at it large you know like it
like in the headline there it kind of
looks awkward it's a spacing seems a
little bit too wide the the characters
themselves seem to kind of have an odd
rhythm to them compared to something
like futur which is really beautiful
it's super geometric it's been around
forever it's it's actually the basis of
a bunch of typefaces that we love like a
veneer which is it shows up on your
iPhone really frequently Gotham which is
was it actually the typeface that that
these slides are using and it was the
Obama typeface in 2008 it's also the HBO
typeface so it's a classic and traded it
for something that kind of felt new the
reason that I noticed this and I thought
that it was so interesting was so this
was I say it's 2009 and at the time I
was still using an RSS reader you guys
remember the days and um to get my news
and these two headlines showed up in the
same session for me in fact if you look
at the dates they're right next to each
other so one was August 26 and the other
was September 4th so then you know
roughly a week for each other I saw
these two headlines and I couldn't help
but notice the irony because ver Donna
sorry IKEA was switching to
a digital typeface for the stated reason
that they couldn't find a type that they
couldn't use something like footer on on
a screen and at the same time Paul Irish
who you guys may know he's a guy who
works for Google he was publishing sort
of his best syntax for font face which
gives you the ability to use custom
fonts inside of a browser so at the same
moment that were that IKEA was
abandoning fedora for Madonna Paul Irish
was sort of you could say announcing the
the future of custom typefaces on the
web I like this story because I think it
shows this sort of contrast between the
this like incredibly rich history that
we have with type and its print basis
and sort of what's going on right now
where types definitely like undergoing
this sort of explosion of interest it's
becoming very important it's driven a
whole bunch of design in the last five
or six years flat design you could argue
was sort of type driven and this was
sort of a moment for me right this is
where these two things came together so
let me tell you about this time so cool
things first of all this talk is for
anybody that loves or wants to love type
you don't need to be a typographer I
think I in fact practicing for this talk
I have given it to my wife and also to
my twelve-year-old son so people who
have no interest really and type other
than just supporting me the other thing
is a primer do you guys know what that
word means that is not a common American
word by the way that's a very European
word we don't say very much do you guys
say it a lot it sounds kind of English
to me
do you really that's so how about that
so it's a primer for us a primer is
something that you paint with how about
that we have we say primer that seems
opposite I would have expected you guys
to say primer and we say primer huh so
it's a primer and finally this talks a
little insight out compared to most
talks that you might get on typography
in that I'm gonna kind of skip the stuff
you normally talk about so this is you
know normally if you if you got a
typography doc this is where you might
start sort of the anatomy of type to be
honest with you I don't think that this
is really learning this is just naming
things
um the guys know richard fineman surly
drug mr. Feynman that's his thing he
said that naming things is not learning
I agree with that so you can name these
two things doesn't do anything what
we're trying to do is help you
understand how to use type in what it is
so we'll be a little bit inside out
we're gonna sort of start with the soul
and the heart of type and then work our
way out although I will point out that
that thing is called a gadzooks how
about that okay so let's start with this
question what is typography so we're
gonna kind of approach this and this
will actually sort of be the basis for
the talk so we're gonna first talk about
the shape of words and letters right
that's one thing that is typography
another thing is the layout on the page
so how you you know compose type how you
put typefaces forms together and then
finally we'll talk a little bit about
the technology that we use today for
rendering and getting things on the
screen so the kind of start with the
shape of letters so um the fundamental
unit of type is a glyph writing a glyph
is one character and it's a you know
anciently a glyph was sort of a unit of
meaning I actually how about this I just
saw the Rosetta Stone yesterday how
about that
and I learned something I learned that
with the Rosetta Stone we discovered
that something like this this glyph
which would presumably be an Egyptian
hieroglyph works a lot more like a
character in an English alphabet or a
Roman alphabet it has a sound not a word
meaning that was new they didn't know
that people didn't know that until that
guy found the interpreted the rosetta
stone
so today though we have a really really
sophisticated way of thinking about how
to represent information visually right
we have sophisticated alphabets so much
so that we go even beyond kind of just
the idea of trying to portray a letter
but try to put meaning into the sort of
the form of how we represent that letter
of those words when you combine a bunch
of glyphs into words or into a set of
glyphs you have a know what you think it
is a typeface or font so either answer
is right so here's the good news
typeface or finds kind of a confusing
term
when to use which is hard to know the
good news is that you're probably right
whichever one you use in most
circumstances but that is not enough for
us today we're going to go a little bit
deeper so best way to kind of understand
the thing this difference is to think of
the example of Garamond
so if you guys ever used the font
Garamond before have you seen it on your
computer so gehrman's a great example
because gehrman was designed and I think
the 1500s I bet it's in my notes
the typographer design it was a guy
named he's a punch cutter named Claude
Garamond he lived between 1480 and 1560
right so it's super super old this
design is as old as you know well I was
gonna say anything around here that's
probably not true because we're here um
but it's very very very old and when it
was designed he designed a typeface he
the thing that he created was a typeface
he designed a typeface then he took that
typeface which he had designed and he
turned it into a font so he cut the
letters he was a punch cutter so he cut
the letters turned them into a font then
he had a bucket of letters those buck
that bucket of letters that combination
was a font it's sat in a desk drawer for
somebody somewhere and they they
produced words with it so here's one way
to kind of think about it so a font is -
a typeface as a recording is to a song
so kind of the the fundament like the
ideal sort of the the ephemeral ideal of
a font is its typeface that's the thing
that it represents a font is like an
incarnation of that just like a
recording is an incarnation of a song so
I even have a picture for you so a font
is - a typeface as a recording is to a
song so in a digital world what that
means is that there are something like
twelve different versions of Garamond
that you could go buy right now Dolby
makes - I believe Microsoft has one
Apple has won multiple foundries create
garam owns and they're all based on this
original typeface the thing you're
buying though is a font right it's an
incarnation of that typeface there are
something like 200,000 fonts in the
world or let's say typefaces in the
world and that is a totally made-up
number I have no
how many there but the point is that
there are many and so when it comes to
working with them you have this big
challenge which is you need to choose
the right one so there's a typographer
the thing you want to do is find a type
that works and I mean that in two ways
one it kind of works like it works like
hey that works it looks great I also
mean it works like it's doing a job for
you right so to understand how to get
typed do the job that you want it to do
we've started sync of type as performing
different jobs so there's lots of ways
you can break this down we're going to
talk about two I've included some other
here so there's body type body type is
the stuff you read so if you're creative
you're working with body type you want
it to be easy to read there's display
type display type is like headlines or
signage it's usually designed to be big
and so I has different characteristics
then say reading a paragraph of text a
decorative type decorative type is is
trying to convey personalities trying to
convey something through something
bigger than the words that it means
something's trying to illustrate
something um interface type is I would
say kind of a subcategory of body type
so we'll talk about this in a minute but
when you create body type for print
versus body type for digital stuff there
are differences in how you think about
them and we'll talk about that right now
actually okay so we talked about body
text it's the text you read it's good
for sentences and paragraphs I like this
quote this is a really really old this
guy was a print designer and it's an old
typography manual and he says typography
has one plain duty before it and that is
to convey information in writing no
arguments or considerations can absolve
typography from this duty so
fundamentally the thing that you're
trying to do is convey information or at
least that is normally the case this is
the work of a guy named David Carson and
he was a graphic artist in the 1980s and
he had this magazine called ray gun and
he started doing this crazy thing this
is an article from the magazine he would
do crazy things with that with type
layout and
design almost like e cummings but for
type rather than forwards and he pushed
the envelope generally however this is
not what our goal is so unless you're
David Carson I think you can stick with
a simpler goal which is legibility so
one thing that's kind of worth
understanding is the difference between
legibility and readability
so legibility has to do with the power
of the individual glyphs to be
recognized readability has more to do
with the comfort of interacting with
that text over an extended amount of
time and generally you want both but
that's not always the case so for
instance a phone book needs to be
legible but it doesn't need to be
readable because most of us don't read
phone books although I'm sure there are
people to do and those people are
probably mad that it's not more readable
but it is very legible and so you can
see that in phone book they're trading
information density for readability and
that's fair you know think straight see
there's a myth about readability and
legibility which is that for some reason
serif fonts Oh fonts that have to get
know what a serif font is it's fun that
has extenders on the bottom so like
Times Roman or Georgia or serif font
versus a sans serif font which is
something like that like Arial or
Helvetica there's a myth that serif font
is serif fonts are easier to read and
but it's not the case I thought I had a
better slide that displayed this I think
we'll get to that in just a minute okay
so five steps toward choosing a great
body font so the first thing that you
can do to choose a great body font
meaning one that's both readable and
legible is choose something with a large
X height so the x height refers to as
you can see the height of a lowercase
letter X and that tends to set the
general height of all of the lowercase
characters and the reason that this is
important you can see here does anybody
know what that says
TVN gasps you can take them in I mean
people
guest:this and gunner right what is it I
am so impressed you were the second
person to ever get it I give this like
like four or five times that's that's
impressive man so we already that's
right it says weatherman but very very
hard to know that I'm super impressed in
fact when I was going through the slides
today I couldn't remember what I said I
said several minutes try to remember it
says weatherman how about this one
sunshine right there's a tremendous
amount of information that's conveyed in
that top half of the x-height so if you
can increase the size of that it draws
attention to it and makes it more which
would be legible or readable legible
right because you can recognize the
individual glyphs another thing that you
can do if you want to create or if you
want to find a great body typeface or
font is you want to choose less stroke
contrast and so you can see that in this
example we've got Dido or I said I don't
know probably so many French in here
they can correct that for me but you've
got Dido and Gil Sands Dido is known for
having like very like strong contrast
between the between the stroke the the I
don't know I guess the vertical the
horizontal strokes so right there and
that also decreases readability
especially on screens because those
strokes tend to be hard to tend be hard
to render okay
next thing is you want to choose
something with strong glyph support and
this is more and more is actually
becoming less of a problem great good
typefaces must-have software now that
helps typographers build these
characters more easily used to be this
was pretty hard to find in sort of
anything outside of like sort of a
mainstream typeface nowadays this is a
lot easier another thing to look for is
want to avoid weird stuff this as you
can imagine decreases both readability
and legibility this is kind of
interesting typically the way that we
read is we look for shapes and so in
this example these were all this was a
test that was done where people were
shown words where they're supposed to
try
identify or recognize words that were
misspelled and they were way more likely
to recognize that TSC was wrong than tsf
and the reason is that the shape for
tests and tests is very similar so
you're likely to skip over that we read
by looking at the overall shape of word
not by looking at the shape of the
individual characters and so the weird
stuff gets in the way of that obviously
and here's the best advice of all it's
for for reading for legibility and
readability use something that's tried
and true if you look at major newspapers
and major magazines generally they will
take one of two strategies for the the
typefaces they choose for body text
either they'll use something that's been
around as a digital typeface for a long
time like Georgia is very very common
times new roman' Helvetica or they'll
use something they've been using in
print for a very very long time and
they'll create a digital version of that
which is like what the New York Times
does for instance and the reason is that
there's really not a lot that can
replace the the refinement that comes
after somebody reads and reads and reads
and so that actually is oh this is the
myth of the seraphs this is where I had
that extra thing in there so if you look
at this you'll notice how the seraphs
get muddy compared to the so the extra
steps that you have are actually just
creating noise digital noise and so for
that reason that makes the typeface a
lot more muddy so generally people would
say that seraphs if might be distracting
at a at best they're doing nothing in
terms of creating readability and that's
what the studies show you know that's a
great question I don't know the study
that I saw about that it was a it was a
researcher and I I can track it down for
it I don't actually member who did it
but researcher yeah
did you guys hear that so the the reason
for the seraphs was that in in when you
were carving in stone it what you would
allow it allow you to have a clean
termination to a long line I'm not sure
what the research says about for print
I had heard my entire life actually that
sheriff's like allow you to establish
like a line along the bottom of the text
and it improved readability not
necessarily legibility this study that I
found in if you email me I'm happy to
track it down for you indicated that was
not the case that it didn't help and it
was referring specifically to digital
type I'm not sure about print I'd
imagine to be honest that because you
know if you think about this all the
research that I've seen shows that this
is how we read and I would imagine that
the seraphs or more of a distraction
than a help they're they're not adding
to our ability to recognize shapes but
I'm not sure about that when I say go
with classics I mean Helvetica only was
that not clear there's some subtlety to
this guy's you have to work through it
the subtlety is Helvetica only okay so
this is the best of all the advice back
on track here is that you need to read
it and that's why you go with the
classics so you know to be honest
Georgia is probably my favorite body
typeface in it is a ser face so there
you go
okay moving on we'll talk about display
of typefaces so display text is designed
for headlines signage things that are
big and it's actually a lot more fun and
this is where you can actually play with
text a little bit more rather than
trying to choose something that favors
legibility and in particular readability
you really don't need to think about
readability legibility is still
important so when we talk about display
by the way this confused me forever
I saw the display text mint text that
was designed to be shown on a display
that's not true it's older than this
kind of a display it's used for displays
like I think like signage I think it's
where that comes from
um okay so I love this quote and I think
this is a great way to think of
out choosing a display typeface so
typographical design should perform
optically what the speaker creates
through voice and gesture of his
thoughts especially for display I think
this is a great way to think about it so
let me show you an example of that so
this conveys something right see this it
says very soon we're all going to the
zoo this looks I think sort of the
feeling of this conveys to me at least
as children's Barker it's sort of a fun
feeling it's very different than this
right which is not it's a different kind
of zoo altogether I think so
this is a really similar quote phases of
type are like men's faces you know by
the way I when I remember I read these
quotes these are these are like these
guys in like the 60s and 70s
I imagine Mad Men like these guys that
really pronounced these like pearls of
wisdom about the you know this crazy
industry they have but anyway phases of
typer like men's faces they have their
own expression their complexion and
peculiar twists and turns of line
identify them immediately to friends to
whom each is full of identity so with
that in mind one way that you can think
about working with type is you can think
of it as like a casting call right
imagine that the typefaces are actors
and you're setting the stage you're
trying to tell a story and you can think
like okay who do I want to be my display
type face who's sort of my supporting
characters the body who's the the lead
the major headline so with that in mind
I have sort of a fun game for us to get
into this so I'm going to show you a
typeface and you tell me we're gonna do
the opposite of what I just said you
tell me what actor you would cast in the
role so who is Helvetica I'll kick this
off for you
Helvetica is Kevin Bacon right because
it shows up everywhere
his hard worker can play any role kind
of plane and also kind of connect it to
everything and everybody just sort of
loves it right okay let's do another one
by the way this is Ariel
it's Kevin Bacon's sort of less
attractive younger what's that word
doppelganger there we go
okay how about Clarendon any ideas who
this might be
I'll tell you I think if Clarendon is a
little loud sue
we're friendly great for delivering good
news lots of positive energy a slightly
masculine version of something feminine
they may come to mind that's pretty good
actually it's not bad that's not who I
had but I think I'll give it to you
who's that Robin Williams that's pretty
great too
I would take either of those I chose
Ellen actually so I have a challenge for
you this is the one that you can take
home and think about so I'm gonna give
you an actor you need to think of the
corresponding typeface and let me know
just think of a good one so who would
Chuck Norris be how about that I can
tell you Chuck Norris isn't and that's
Comic Sans what's that yeah impact
that's a great one that is it do you
guys know in fact Super Bowl that is a
great one so that's a fantastic choice
okay um this is a Chuck Norris joke that
type that I found the other day by the
way do you guys know what it means to
hit something type in anyway um he looks
like he could do exactly that okay so
here is sort of just some general
thinking about how to choose a display
face so you can choose serifs sheriff's
tend to make things feel a little bit
more buttoned up stroke contest tends to
make things feel I was looking for a
wording I just think fancy right this
feels a little bit more formal but I
already had said that for serifs so I
guess we'll go with fancy slab serif so
slab serif is is like a regular serif
font except that the the extenders all
have the same thickness all the way
around and the sheriff sorry the
sheriff's and they have the same
thickness as the extenders
gyah geometric fonts are fonts also like
a slab serif where it tends to have a
very uniform sort of look to the strokes
they tend to feel modern and progressive
they grew out of like the Bauhaus
movement so they're very systematic they
feel kind of industrial narrow typefaces
tend to be a little bit harder to read
so you tend to sacrifice a little bit
both legibility and readability but it
does feel more down to business and for
a displayed type
that's usually fine it's kind of a way
of saying that whatever you have to say
is sort of more staccato important has
to be you have to get it out there
quickly so you tend to see this for
headlines a lot on the other hand if you
extend that out and have more of an
extended font seems to sort of indicate
that your try it's more pensive more
thoughtful and also tends to be seem a
little bit more important so once you
begin to sort of play with these
different personalities for your display
phases then you have the exciting job of
pairing so often you have to choose
different typefaces and hope that they
work together and this is a lot like
choosing colors to be honest it's
there's it's really hard to find much
science to it and a lot of things work
but that thing that combination that you
create tends to say something this was
an example that there's a there's
hopefully frere-jones or I think there's
whole Flair and co now I was a foundry
that created a ton of really famous
typefaces and this is an example that
they put together using a lot of their
typefaces the thing that I found
remarkable here is just the like sheer
number of typefaces that they got to
work in one design generally that's not
something you do generally try to limit
yourself to one typeface maybe two if
you're a rebel three but four would be I
guess you're you'd get fired if you work
for me
so here's some sort of simple ways to
approach pairing so here's the basic so
first of all fewer font families those
guys we're very very good they can pair
multiple typefaces together most of us
cannot so think fewer typefaces you can
be bold without many many typefaces in
fact a lot of times many many typefaces
create clutter and make you less bold
this I think is really good advice first
of all look for contrast and then seek
for harmony so figure out what your big
your headline is trying to say and how
that's different in your body so if you
want to create interest look for
contrast but then you need to create
unity and harmony later on and then this
is also good advice which is at most you
can have one hero you can't have
multiple heroes or you end up with
Suicide Squad something that you end up
with a big mess
so one or fewer heroes yeah that's a
great that is a really great question so
um actually you know what this will make
it a little bit more clear right here so
a family is the same thing as it so yeah
this is where maybe we should have done
some anatomy of type first so a font
family would be something like Gotham or
Garamond or Arial or Helvetica is a
great example so Helvetica comes in
multiple forms though so you have like
Helvetica light Helvetica condensed
Helvetica bold held Attica ultra bold
all those things fall under the family
of Helvetica and so if you choose a
single family the advantage that you
have is that you know that those they
already have a tremendous amount of
harmony and a lot of times you can find
contrasts within the family but you know
that they're already harmonized does
that make sense
so here's an example this is a type oh
this is Helvetica perfect so you can see
up at the top we have held edit
condensed bold and then for sort of the
I guess the the byline we have Helvetica
regular bold and then we have Helvetica
regular and I guess in this case we're
using a light version of it for the body
right so we still have contrast but we
know they're harmonized because they all
belong to the same family so that clear
up the question of what a family is okay
so a lot of the families that we're used
to but we'll have maybe two or three
different sort of variations like you
might have normal and bold or regular
and bold or if you're lucky and italic
in there and it's hard this is harder to
do with that so if you're gonna play
this game you often want to look for a
family that has multiple variations and
they're out there you know if you don't
know where you guys get fonts but like
you go to google fonts you can actually
look for you can sort of sort by fonts
that have multiple variation or families
that multiple variations ok so here's
this is a really beautiful example of a
just working within one family and
actually here they're I mean I think
this is really just an italic and a
regular and just by varying the size
they're able to create it
incredible amount of contrast I've
actually found this quite beautiful in
it and it's finally when I first saw um
okay so another option that you have is
to pair a serif with the sans and this
is kind of a the classic right because
you know here now you're favoring
contrast first and then you'll find
harmony later so you because you have a
serif and sans you know you've already
found contrast now you need to look for
harmony and you can do that often by in
a way I mean it's it's a little bit of
art here you can just kind of look at
personality and sort of try to get a
feel for it but the other thing you can
look for is for similarities in like the
way that they would render unique
characters like A's and G's there's
multiple variations so you could look
for they call them like single story A's
or a double story A's it's either like
the so these are these are double story
A's and single stories like how you did
it when you're a kid so you look to that
you can look for similar stroke
contrasts you can look for those kinds
of things to then create harmony to be
honest if you're only working with two
different families you don't need to
worry as much about harmony so it's more
when you're it you introduce a third
it's kind of like color that way this is
a great example comedy central did this
thing where with their rebranding where
they had they moved to a sans for sort
of their main logo type and then they
paired that with a serif font for all
their kind of additional display text
and I actually just thought it worked
really really well okay the other thing
you can do is you can pick something
with a lot of personality for your
display and then pair that with
something that is known to be very
neutral and then you're kind of moving
all the personality up into the display
typeface like your headlines or your by
lines and then you sort of focus on
something a little bit more readable and
legible for the body this is what a lot
of magazines do like Fast Company does
this
I think wired does this I think both of
them use Georgia for their body and then
they have in fact that Fast Company I
don't think they usually gothic do they
use a typeface very similar to that for
their headlines you may have noticed
um here's another example of that where
this the the menu on the side is clearly
something very simple looks like
Helvetica or even Arial and then the
headline is a really really bold kind of
interesting typeface with a lot of
stroke contrast so Matthew Carter is a
typographer that he actually is a guy
that designed for Donna he did a bunch
of other typefaces for Microsoft super
sort of well known living typographer
and this is a hard quote to read but I
liked it so much that I included it
anyway so I'm going to read it and try
to give emphasis to the thing that you
need to take from it so it says as the
saying goes this is so funny because if
this really where as saying nobody would
remember it because it's so hard to
parse type is a beautiful group of
letters not a group of beautiful letters
that make sense so what that's saying is
that ultimately when you are putting
type together you want to think about
the harmony of the group rather than the
individual characters and so again that
good advice have you've got to read it
you need to look at it and you need to
see it as a whole it's a little you know
this is what's fun I think about
typography is there's not it's as much
art as it is science and so it's a place
where you can play and it's okay to if
you want to start playing with
typography it's okay to play look at
things walk away and it kind of embraced
the the art of it all right do you feel
like you understand the shape of letters
because it's time to move on so we're
gonna talk about layout so when we think
that layout so layout is the is how we
position the letters on the screen right
where do we put the sentences how do
things sort of come together to create a
you know sort of a gestalt or the
meaning as a whole and I thought this
was a really simple way to kind of state
the goal of that she says typography
helps readers navigate the flow of the
content so when you think about layout
maybe that's the thing they're trying to
do is establish the meaning of the
document or the thing you're creating as
a whole rather than you know sort of the
the unit your this is your chance to
kind of create a gestalt help give
people a way to move through things and
also experience something
when they first get there so um to that
end this is some copy that we had on our
website years ago it's actually not
there anymore but I thought this was
kind of an interesting exercise I
thought we could take some copy from a
website a real website and kind of go
through the process of a layout and
apply some things that we learned to
this particular copy when you show up to
this you really honestly would I mean
you could read it and then you might
understand it but even after you read it
I think you would kind of have a hard
time knowing what I think is important
right like you might figure out what you
think is important but I didn't tell you
anything so when it comes you know going
back to that quote the thing that we're
trying to do is help somebody navigate
this help somebody understand what I
think is important I want to convey to
them how they should experience this
thing as a whole
Jehu Jakob Nielsen is he's a usability
guy human factors guy it's been around
forever he's like I think if it was like
the web's like like number one
curmudgeon he he's awesome spent a lot
of time telling us the mistakes that
we're making so this this is an old
quote I think this is from like 1997
when the web was brand new even when the
web was brand new he noticed this thing
which is the way that we read on the web
said this is how readers how users read
on the web they don't we don't read
instead they scan the page picking out
individual words and sentences so the
first thing that you want to do when
you're looking at type and think about
layout is you need to create hierarchy
and hierarchy gets created when we can
define contrast and again it's kind of
what we're talking about earlier with
pairing where you're trying to balance
you trying to this thing where you need
to create contrast and then bring unity
to that contrast right so these are not
the only ways that you can create
hierarchy or create contrast but some of
the most common are you can create
hierarchy with spacing symbols color and
size so we can apply some of that first
thing we'll start with is just some
spacing so if I literally just add some
carriage returns between this you begin
to kind of see how at least I group
these things right so you can see for
instance that quote
stands on its own case studies just
became a headline and agent 8-ball now
looks like a headline of its own right
we kind of already covered that so I'll
just keep going so now I'm we can apply
some sizing differences so here we're
creating some even greater contrast so
we already had structure now we're
adding even greater contrast to that
structure with we've done a couple of
things so one is we varied the sizing
and we've also varied the weights so
bold as I think everybody just
intuitively knows it typically is used
to indicate that something is louder or
more important it doesn't always have to
be the case although if things are the
same size and one of them is bolded and
one isn't it's almost always it would be
interpreted that the bold one is the
louder or the more important too so just
by giving it making a couple of things
bold like agent 8-ball we now know as a
headline even though it's the same size
as that paragraph below and then pick
slab and case studies are clearly the
sort of two anchors that you have in
this text now I think this is so
intuitive but I think it's funny to look
at you can not you can try to create
contrast and fail so for instance if you
have two typefaces that look a lot like
each other you're not creating contrast
or if you are not varying the size
enough you're not creating contrast or
if this is extra funnier because on my
screen actually look like different
colors here they look like they're
identical colors and that's actually a
real problem
that a lot of times we work on better
screens than the people who are actually
interacting with the things that we do
so so my advice here is if you want to
create contrast don't be afraid to mean
it right be bold
so we hire a lot of designers and one of
the things I've noticed about new
designers is that and this is true
people learning how to design is is that
you make like these micro tweaks and
because it doesn't quite feel right and
I'll just this is the advice if you find
yourself trying to design something and
you're spending a lot of time on micro
tweaks you need to step back and and
think about the larger tweaks because
micro tweaks are probably not going to
convey the thing that you're trying to
convey so you know my critiques like the
move spacing three pixels or they'll
just
color by two shades or whatever that
sort of thing is probably not working in
your favor usually if that's where
you're spending your time you need to
step back so then you're probably living
over here instead of living over there I
this is a great example of multiple
levels of contrast there is no question
about what the headline is here it is
clearly with daily right no I'm joking
of course
it is clearly last minute travel apps
and anyway it's just clear what's going
on here so this is a great example of
creating contrast so if you combine
those two things you want to create
contrast and you want to create use the
contest to create hierarchy now we get
to come to this great rule of thumb
which is we all work in threes and I
don't know why this is I'm sure there's
research but if you think about the
hierarchy you're trying to create in
three parts or if it's a longer document
or something you can you know maybe have
four or five but typically we think in
threes so this is just a powerful place
to start is try to create three levels
of hierarchy so if we apply that here
actually you can see we kind of already
did we sort of have these three levels
of hierarchy we have the the pick slab
and case studies which is sort of the
top level headlines we have a gen 8 ball
which is another sort of level of
structure although I think you could
argue that we don't have enough contrast
there with the body text yet and then
we've added some a little bit of
contrast too you know that's funny we
really have four here and I did I put it
right after the three levels I've never
noticed that it's kind of a mistake but
that's ok ok so here we're creating a
much sort of stronger sense of the the
three things that I want you to notice
so there's clearly this this important
thing up at the top kind of a middle
section and then sort of the third thing
down at the bottom so when I did this I
sort of felt like the headline the thing
that I wanted you to notice most was
getting lost up at the top and so we
made this flip where we put it more in
the middle so it was sort of more eye
grabbing and I guess that the reason
that
you know I'd love to give you a rule for
why we make that change I think that
there isn't a great one I think instead
the thing that you need to think about
is how are you devoting space to
different things and this is a great
quote from Alex White if you're a
aspiring designer by the way this book
by Alex white called the elements of
design
are there any of you guys developers
that are trying to see a little bit more
about design this is a fantastic book
for you that's kind of how I am - I
started off in computer science and sort
of through my career I've moved toward
design and this guy Alex white wrote
this book called the elements of design
and it is a it is a fantastic book and
it's it is it's like it's written for
the sort of analytical mind of a
developer he takes these principles that
are normally I think talked about
I don't know without a ton of structure
and he gives a lot of structure to him
it's a fantastic book and it's like it's
maybe like 100 pages it's a suit you can
read it in in two sittings you can read
it in one so anyway he's got this great
quote where he says typography is 10%
letter management and 90% space
management and that's what I think is
going on here is that as you go from
here to here you realize that you are
you have to kind of understand not just
where the letters go but what goes in
between them and again it kind of comes
back to this idea of Gestalt like how do
you help people perceive something as a
whole um when it comes to this question
of space management there is this really
really old principle that we can rely on
called a grid and as developers you guys
are actually probably pretty familiar
with layout grids that would not have
been the case four or five years ago
this is responsive design has made us
all start to think a lot more about
grids and so we have grid systems that
are sort of built for CSS we all use but
it's old the grids have been around for
literally centuries and the reason is
that they work it's a great way to force
yourself to give structure to a document
the the Bauhaus folks were famous lovers
of the grid and I think the reason is
that it
you know the Bounce movement was a lot
about trying to suit
sort of like industrialized design right
like to create repeatable patterns for
how you think about designing something
and the grid is one of those things that
is highly repeatable it works in so many
situations so this is this I this
beautiful document I actually don't
remember who created it but you can see
this like super-strong grid there and I
saw some I loved it because this looks
like something that we create for the
web today right like this kind of a grid
is probably familiar you know it looks
like I don't know like the foundation
grid or something like that like it
looks like something that you've
probably seen and yet this was created I
think in like the the early 20th century
this is how we use the grid today and
this is probably how you guys think
about it so we have all these you know
lots of systems and and it's it really
is a fantastic way to think about how to
layout a page and where to put type on a
page a lot of times it's easy to feel
like the grid is confining and and I can
see that I think can be the case but
great graphic artists have been using
grids forever to give structure to
something that is fluid or to give some
structure to something that appears to
have no structure and this Miles Davis
album cover I think is a great example
of a crazy grid but look at how he's
used that grid to not like if you look
at the the picture of Miles Davis up at
the top is sort of culminates like sort
of in the the center point of that grid
you he devotes as sort of this column to
the front of the trumpet and that column
to the text there's that like beautiful
repeating pattern the that defines other
kind of a points of intersection within
the within the album cover so don't feel
afraid to be creative in the way that
you apply a grid it's it's a really
great tool for you to keep structure and
keep something that's organized even if
you're trying to push the limits of what
you're doing with type so if we apply a
grid to pixel AB then you can well let's
see do I have a picture yeah so this is
I wish I didn't have the grid in between
I'd love for you to just see the before
and after so this was layout that was
all done just by I just by looking at
things
this is layout done by grid and I don't
know you know these
things I think are sort of subtle to see
and it's it's very much subjective about
whether or not that looks better but to
my eye we just added a ton of structure
to this thing I feel like all of a
sudden it feels like it flows and feels
like it kind of works it also gives us a
place for some navigation and we can
make that fit within the grid and we
continue to kind of keep the harmony
that the grid is imposing on this also
here's just a random graphic that we
could put and I stuck the intersection
of this very large graphic right at the
intersection of two lines in the grid
and then use that kind of balance out
the menu that we have on the other on
the other side there and then just to
kind of finalize our contrast we can
play with color a little bit okay
sim you know what this number is the
golden ratio yeah so this is do you know
this is a really controversial number
people love to talk about how great this
number is I honestly don't believe in it
other than the fact that I believe it's
a number and I think that for the thing
we're about to talk about you need a
number so we'll go with it so the golden
ratio has been around forever and it
does create basis for a ton of design it
shows up in the works of Salvador Dali
in this particular printing of Paradise
Lost
I think the pyramids have some golden
ratio basically the way the golden ratio
works the idea is that in this case they
as you subdivide something you'll conte
the the the the two ratios will continue
to sort of preserve themselves as you
get smaller and smaller and smaller as
you continue to subdivide and that
number works out to be one point six one
eight so question is does it actually
work and like I said that is very
controversial but the thing that it does
do like I said is it gives us a number
and there's this thing that you need to
do as a typographer which is you need to
choose the sizes for your text and size
is kind of important because as we saw
if the sizing is off we're not creating
enough contrast to actually convey
differences between the different types
of text so there's this thing that
typographers view is called a modular
scale and this is a great place to start
if you ever find yourself needing to lay
out some text this is a fantastic place
to start
this guy Robert bring her is just sort
of like the the modern sort of master of
typographic design this is another great
book
not maybe targeted as the developers in
the same way as the Alex white book but
it is kind of the manual for modern type
design and he I don't know if you
introduce the idea of a modular scale or
just popularized it but he talked about
this idea of a modular scale as being a
prearranged set of harmonious
proportions so like I said you need a
number and it could be the golden ratio
people use other ratios for that too and
there's this great website that you can
go to called it's modular scale calm and
it will help you define a modular scale
and basically what you do is you come up
with a base and you can add more than
one but so I chose 24 pixels in this
case and normally like if you're doing
web design you would set that as sort of
the body size and then you can use
ratios from there to define the other
sizes that you need to work with so your
different headings and and whatnot and
so here's the thing because you need a
number to do that he lets you choose and
there's a lot of people that sort of I
guess would I don't know sort of
evangelize this idea that you should
pull from the sort of musical scale so
he lets you choose musical scale so in
this case you can see that we're using a
minor second and I'm I wanted to do
actually will do it really quick I
wanted to do something kind of
interesting so I'm gonna play a minor
second and you tell me if you think that
that type looks like a minor second okay
so this is a minor second so
do you see it I don't know if I see it
but it's kind of interesting
okay so here's another one this is a
perfect fourth play perfect fourth for
you so this is a fourth
santÃ© correlation leading to the next
one the fifth
I don't know so this this will be the
this will be the real test though we'll
go to uh this is um so now we're gonna
do a minor again we'll do a my this is a
minor six
I don't know if I see it but a lot of
people swear by it um but the idea is
that you know we are naturally sort of
aware of at least musical harmonies so
that idea is if you're trying to
harmonize the text on page you can use
the sort of same musical harmonies to
produce the harmony between the
different sizes that you choose and you
can use these harmonies you can use
these ratios to define your grid you can
also use them to define the various text
sizes that you work with this is by the
way you have to choose these numbers
right and so might as well use this
trick and this is a fantastic website
for it so if you go to modular scale com
I'd say that like the past four or five
years there's become a really big thing
he this guy Tim Braun who created the
site first started talking about this a
talk I think in 2010 and everybody was
super excited about it I don't think
anybody had ever really thought about
applying it to web design in that way
and since then it's kind of everywhere
so like there's plugins that are built
for this for like sketch and an
illustrator and it kind of shows up
everywhere so if you look for modular
scales now you'll know what that refers
to
oh this is I was going to ask you if
this was felt sad this is also minor six
does it feel sadder when we had the sad
dog - it kind of okay
so this is so back to the kind of this
pixel AB page that we're trying to
design so this is what we had before and
this was where we had just laid it all
out by eye and this is once we apply a I
think this is a perfect fifth to it and
to be honest with you I have to say it
felt a little bit better to me it felt
more organized it also took on sort of a
brighter I don't know tell me if you
agree I felt like it took on kind of a
brighter cheery or disposition maybe I'm
making that up
but if that harmony is a real thing I
kind of felt it here so it does kind of
feel sunnier and and that's a perfect
fifth the sunniest of all harmonies okay
so that's layout do you guys feel like
typography layout experts if you do we
will move on to technology in the
remaining seven minutes Oh every
supposed to be done right now or do we
okay we've got seven more minutes okay
so we've got seven more minutes
do you guys know what these two numbers
are anybody know what is it sorry I
didn't hear
I pixels French you're right so what
makes these two interesting so 72 is
significant for two reasons it is the
number of points in an inch in
traditional print typography right so if
you have an eight point font that means
it's a ninth of an inch or a nine point
five would be an eighth of an inch it's
also the sort of the implied dpi of a
Mac so if you say that something is 72
pixels high in theory that would be
approximately one inch high on a screen
on a Mac 96 for whatever reason
Microsoft chose 2 to be 96 dpi on their
screens the reason that I brought this
up actually you really don't need to
know this to be honest doesn't matter
anymore but there was time when I did it
it doesn't really matter but the reason
I bring it up is just to show just how
crazy the world of hype rendering is and
the the kind of minutiae that it carries
with it somebody had to make this
decision like what is an 8 point find on
screen and those decisions were made a
very very long time ago and really did
not account for the way things work
today
this was the history of they were
inheriting we've gone from a printing
press to an offset press to a digital
press where you know digital press today
has it probably printed 2400 dpi a
digital display in 1970 was about 7 tbpi
if you were lucky I actually much
smarter that that 7 EVP I would have
been like 1980s and the nineteen
seventies probably would've been much
smaller than that so it was a huge you
know sort of step away from what we were
used to working with and even today this
is something we kind of have to deal
with so this is from the online version
of The New Yorker and you can see the
huge difference that we have between the
the quality of rendering that you would
get with something like a you know like
a I guess an offset press where you
literally are confined I guess by the
molecular properties of the ink to you
know being confined to 72 pixels in an
inch or whatever so there's a lot of
complication to rendering and I like to
think about it as sort of these these
three things
we'll think about it as a cake because
they stack on top of one another first
this typeface design and we're just
going to cruise through these because we
only have five minutes typeface design
it highly influences the way the type
gets perceived on a screen and the as we
talked about a lot of the typefaces that
we love even today were not designed for
screens they were designed for print Fuu
Tora and Times New Roman are great
examples of that but even something like
Helvetica which it shows up everywhere
was designed in the 1950s well before
anybody was thinking about how that
would look on screen today we can
actually design typefaces that are great
for screens and we can even create
versions of classic typefaces that are
better for screens this typeface is is
the one that I mentioned down there and
in 2005 the JAF created a version of a
typeface that I think was originally for
print they called facet web and they
created a web specific version of this
typeface and this is what they said that
they did in order to make it better for
for the web or for any on screen they
increased the x height where we talked
about that for readability they
shortened the descenders so again they
kind of pulled things at the centers
like the bottom of a G it's the things
that go down below the baseline and so
they pulled those up they created a
lighter version of bold because what
tends to happen is bold fonts tend to
render too bold on screen and regular or
lighter fonts tend to render too light
so they they created a bold version that
was lighter and then they manually
hinted and we'll talk about what that
means the typeface so once you design a
great typeface you need to get it to
render well on the screen and for that
we use fonts so the digital equivalent
of that bucket of type is a font now the
digital it's a file and inside of that
file it's kind of like a little mini
program or information that tells you
how to render that onto a screen
the original fonts were bitmaps it's
changed a lot but originally it was just
a list of just a bunch of characters
just a bunch of images and you would
have Chicago at 24 point or the one that
is crazy me as Sanford
why so Apple does not these are the
Apple the Mac font I don't know why they
made it look like a kidnap like a ransom
note the one that they named after their
hometown but anyway so the so you would
you would get a typeface name or a font
name and also the size because the size
had to be pre-rendered the first laser
printers prompted Adobe to create
something called PostScript and
PostScript was at the time a landmark
because instead of having the like
little images for each of the characters
now you had a little program a little
bit of code that would execute and tell
you how to render a character in a
particular spot and that's a big deal
they needed it because laser printers
Apple launched their first like home
laser printer but even prior to that
there were commercial laser printers and
they needed that because they had a much
higher resolution than screens did and
so we needed digital type that could
match the resolution of those printers
in 1991 Apple and Microsoft got sick of
needing to pay licensing fees for
PostScript so they came up with their
own format they called it true type and
true type introduced something really
cool which is what we just talked about
which is hinting so to type was also
different in that it was screen first
instead of print first and so they
introduced a solution to this weird
problem which is what do you do when the
the way that you're telling the letters
to draw don't follow along pixel
boundaries and so in that little program
that knows how to draw a letter a more a
letter A or whatever now there's
information that says scoot over a
little bit if you're right on a pixel
boundary so you get something looks a
lot more like this you get the the
bottom instead of the top I used to
think that hinting looked like this like
you just scoot things over it looks a
lot more like this it's crazy the world
of hinting is kind of nuts and
fortunately today we can automate a lot
of it so if you ever want to try to
design a typeface a lot of this can
actually get get done for you
1996 we combined TrueType and PostScript
and created the best of TrueType and
best of PostScript and created something
called open type and open type in made
typography even richer give us the
ability to have interesting character
come
nations kind of cruise through that in
2010 if this is where we are today
we came up with a new typeface or just
write a new format called woof woof
looks like this it's basically a way to
encapsulate OpenType and compress it and
then include a little bit of licensing
information and so that you can deploy
it on the web
so when you see a why if you work on the
web if you do a lot of web work this is
universally supported and their modern
version of every browser this is
definitely the format that you want to
use for a while you there were certain
browsers that couldn't render this today
you don't even worry about it
I think yeah honestly we just deploy off
today we don't even do to type refugee
anymore and so this is what you should
use
except you should use this instead so
now there's wofe to the thing that got
better is it compresses slightly better
and it's it's worth it you know some
typefaces can get really really big I'm
not gonna talk too much about
rasterization except I'm gonna tell you
this one a very exciting thing which is
look at this look at what happened
between 2005 and at frankly between 2009
and 2010 and we got a huge display
resolution boost and the reason that we
can prove through the rest of this is to
be honest with you at that kind of dpi a
lot of the tricks that we normally would
need to use in order to make type look
better just aren't necessary we have you
know very high resolution LCDs so we
still need to think about it I'm going
to cruise through this it's if you get a
chance it's interesting to kind of read
about the different rendering
technologies that we can use where I
wanted to end was that I'm not sad but I
would have been it wasn't for this so
now I'm happy and to tell you this the
future of type is bright even if you are
just a hobbyist no matter what you do I
think understanding a little bit about
typography and its rich history is
exciting and it's an exciting time to be
paying attention to type some things I'm
excited about are the increased pixel
densities that we have on our devices
and screens today
icon fonts you guys are web developers
I'm sure you know what that is but it's
a really great way to deploy vectors on
the web and to you know work with
iconography on the web and open source
type and here's the basically there's
this incredible thing happening right
now where there is a huge amount of open
source and because of that you know free
for many uses fonts and typography on
the web and these are some great sources
I'm sure you guys know about google
fonts here a couple of others and this
to me is an invitation for anybody who
has any interest in typography at all to
jump in because there is a lot of
quality typography that is available for
you to play with for free so go make a
poster go make a website go do some of
them with your kids and feel free to
experiment typography and and put
yourself into it you know there's a lot
of developers in this room typography is
the perfect in my mind intersection of
sort of the creative arts and and the
sciences and it is a great place for
developers to do something fun and sort
of express your most creative side so I
leave that with you it with a big thank
you and for your time so thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
