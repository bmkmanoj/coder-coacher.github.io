go now my name is Pierre de droga i work
as a technical evangelist in microsoft
and i would like to say thank you for
coming to my session there's a lot of
brilliant sessions I hope I'll not
disappoint you we're here today to talk
about conversations for the masses which
is a bit bizarre title but I will try to
show you where we're going the tools we
have the power behind the digital
systems and box and a bit of history
lesson two just for fun so if
technologies with me let's again i will
like to say the first that for me this
is conversations as well i'm addicted to
stuff like this google trips help me get
here it told me by looking into my
emails it could tell me on my phone when
my flights leaving when my gates
changing where i'm going to be staying
how incredibly hard it is to get from
the airport to the east end of london
all that stuff you can get from google
trips so my hats off to this service
it's amazing well as beginning quick
quick history of machine conversations
the conversation is really about
communication is about interacting
verbally or via text can be spontaneous
it's a dialogue but social and
context-aware and the Turing test that
Alan Turing created in the 1950s is
about machines ability to exhibit
intelligent behavior equivalent to your
indistinguishable from that of a human
being the Turing test got'em pass by
Eliza Eliza analyzed inputs and gave
clever answers and if it couldn't answer
the input she just sort of well didn't
really answer like answered with all
comments and stuff like that then they
came Long's monk called Perry which was
like Eliza but worse it was modeled
after paranoid schizophrenic but those
two could pass the Turing test we have
seen a lot of this before especially
within this field so the chat interface
the voice interface it's not new when I
was not all sitting on my own room
hacking away on the dial up modem go in
on IRC channels I had fun then I learned
to create egg-drop BOTS so even back
then I mean IRC was created in what 1988
in Finland even then we had BOTS give it
they were just really not talkative they
were scripted but the robots we had
digital assistants to write remember
that guy I mean people laughs about him
they heard him the column names but that
question that he's asking right there it
looks like you're writing a letter would
you like some help I see people today
right
office Adams doing exactly that we're
writing bots that are asking exactly
that questions like would you like some
help in doing that time yes please but
don't show this tip again so it's really
all about conversations I'm in this
field there's people there's digital
systems in this box the people and
people talk just fine florastor
communicating in a language both
understand people to digital assistants
is sort of what I was opening with so
they're helping us they're teaching us
the bots and digital assistants can talk
to each other to even bots with bots if
you're looking at financial trading that
would be it would be bots talking to
bots so we're we're using human language
as need you I both spoken and written
and this is infusing everything that we
do and it will be even more so in the
years to come you see that and the
changes that will happen will happen in
the world of the conversational canvases
the conversational canvases is where
this dialogue takes place if you look at
smartphones today this is just really
random start screens to the smartphone
the one on the left is mine the two
others from colleagues and friends they
kindly supplied me with screenshots what
is interesting about these smartphones
not because remember when smartphones
came around everyone's like installing
apps and it's candy some things that
woulda crushed something and its front
and center now these conversational
canvases are starting to take center
stage
people are not just using phone and text
with their cameras too but they're using
the the wii shafts they're using the
whatsapp they're using kik they're
probably using like a lot of stuff we
don't even know about I mean I see some
young people so I know some people know
about it these are all channels right
channels where communications being
increased les les is just a few of them
turtz way to manatee try and lift them
off but if we were to look at three like
just single and mouth messenger hasn't
been around for that long since 2011 but
already they've surpassed more than 1
billion monthly active users as a lot of
people using one that one chat service
and kick is Canadian they've been around
since 2009 in this game for a while for
the percent of the teens and young
adults in u.s. use kik it's forty
percent but by far the one that's been
the most successful is we shot in China
the rashad and China dominates this
market they've successfully created
their own ecosystem they have many apps
official apps official pages they have
more than 200 million credit cards that
their users have added to their reshat
payment and we shud payment isn't going
through the app store right it's their
own ecosystem but it's so successful the
more than 200,000 companies in China
except we chat payment as currency
and we shot I mean success story goes
down probably is vs startups they first
look to launch in reshat before creating
a native app that's how disruptive it if
I think it's cool another one that's
called skype we all love sky i love skip
the best thing about scope I've seen in
a long time it's a Skype translator so
Justin text it can translate 50
languages probably Mona but what's
really cool is that for eight languages
you can do voice and video real-time
translations so i'm going to show you
what i mean by looking at a short video
see if we got audio i can you guess why
i will thanks for investing memory kevin
norfolk yes see you live in central
Mexico see sync with us in this all for
me go get my stuff yeah he lives in a
capital city see discuss picked out of
ethnic they are very close to CF
I in Mexico City be discussed in Tacoma
yes very good get grass yes thank you
he liked living in Mexico City's the
Gustav EV de la ciudad de mexico i can
somebody so here is very nice what do
you do for fun que haces para divertirse
voy a la playa de mexico i'm going to
the beaches of Mexico I like to swim me
gusta nada mi tambien me too where in
the world they wish to travel haha en el
mundo de bateria viaja Olympian to
Russia gusto and you everywhere
sedia in gravely I will be a ver pin
missile it would be amazing to see you
something in Mexico I would really like
to live in some time me gustaria mucho
visita de algun dia mi tambien meet you
for me that's about as close to magic as
you can come within our industry I mean
that opens doors not just physical doors
but actually doors in the mind for those
kids to interact and to talk and you
just completely shatter the barrier that
is language so three things to to
consider so far in this presentation
that number one is that conversational
canvases are returning to front and
center center stage of our smartphones
about day-to-day life point is that they
flow across platforms so if we're
interacting we shouldn't be bound to do
near than our smartphone or doing it on
our on on the web or compute it should
be wherever we are at three we shot is
really really good at what they do move
it on so we got digital assistants ER
these digital assistants that help me
find London actually I used to live in
London sir complain lemon we sometimes
call them agents for God BOTS perhaps
you've heard as well everyone's sort of
done using word God pots so I tend to
not put any sort of DD within the name I
would use agents it's more cool the
Cortana Siri Alexa assistant or a Google
map the role trying to do the same thing
right they all want to be your new best
friend they all want to be the one that
gets your credit card that gets to order
your uber without anyone paying
attention to you strutted their on our
phones because we carry our phones with
us they're on the desktop
some of them because we set by our
desktops there on the web a few of them
because we use the web some one is even
like within our gaming consoles not
saying which one you can figure that out
when these digital assistants reach the
limit of their knowledge we have the
skills and actions that we can add to it
right till skills you got alexa skills
like thousands of skills already been
created now cortana skills still be
opening up soon Cortana skills you can
port Alexa skills into kirtana skills
you can create Cortana skills for
yourself quite easily the actions is it
just named that Google has chosen
instead of skills hello quiet entry and
the door slams so what's changed now is
that they've also moved into your
appliances moved into our homes so you
have the echo the Alexa you have the
home there speakers coming out from
level Harman Kardon with Cortana built
in there within our comfort zone they
live and breed with us they're almost
like part of our day to day life when
you go and lock the door at night that
Alexa is still there that Google home
sits there listen see so that whole
notion about oh I'm not letting anyone
have my data I'm not letting anyone
listen to me you are and you're gladly
dunes oh maybe this will be happening
more and more
don't get me wrong rivers is crucial but
everyone takes that seriously it's not
like it's not the Wild West sometimes it
can get out of hand though this is in
the news a couple of days ago looks like
weeks ago but there was this kid that
accidentally will not accidentally
probably ordered a dollhouse and her
mother probably thought it was cute so
she called the television and so you
gotta do report about that so they did
they interviewed her but they also
interviewed the young daughter and said
so what did you say and she goes I said
Alexa by a dollhouse yeah you can
imagine will happen so there is toll
gates like security toll gates and
parental controls built into all of
these platforms that is there to prevent
stuff like that from happening but if
you haven't done that it's like Cortana
you can train you to listen to just your
voice right you see this one this is
another fun example so the police
actually sees the echo device and then
they try to force amazon to give them
all the history from the device because
they wanted to solve a murder if you
think about it if you're committing that
vile act of murder you really stop by
the like single like Alexa where can I
hide a body you don't do that so true oh
so they should probably like gotten
their iphone instead so safely access
theory
what we need to do what is happening is
that these digital assistants are BOTS
our code it needs to advance with
intelligence kind of makes sense
advanced without intelligence would be
kind of hard but we're really talking in
this space is machine learning so
machine learning has been around for a
while but it has really sprung to you
everyone's attention all the big players
are very focused on machine learning and
AI right now things that develop fast
that comes into context here it's
especially neural networks and the deep
learning neural networks so I'm not
going to be trying to explain the maps
behind neural networks because I can
flip that upside down I have a hard time
reading it anyway but what you should
know is that it the deep neural networks
and neural networks in general they try
to mimic the way the brain works so this
machine learning the neural networks is
about trying to get the application to
learn from the self you don't have to
explicitly program it to do something so
how'd the children acquire language they
listen they learn when they get more
data they get more input they listened
more they learn more we don't really
teach them we teach them by keep talking
but we they learn when we talk to each
other not when we talk to them
the google has their google translate
their AI just swapped their algorithm
for foreigner on network all of a sudden
the researchers noticed that apparently
it created an inter linger so now that
algorithm so what happens is that
imagine you have english and you can
translate english to to japanese you
have that all down it's working
beautifully then you create English to
French now it's a good translation but
how about Japanese to French well before
that you have to find like a common
ground which was English you translate
to English and then some English to
Japanese in back so you lose in context
you're pretty much this student like
maybe phrases and we're translations but
you lose in contexts so what seems to
have happened this is also thing about
like deep neural networks no one really
knows what happens kind of guesses but
such as scientists they can guess it's
all right it's actually viable answer
which is cool but that that ain't
erlanger made it possible to translate
from japanese to french using bridges
that it had learned i think it's cool
what's also cool is that we reached a
milestone in the quest for computers to
understand speech as well as we do in
September we reached 6.3 in the word
error rate this was the best that has
ever been recorded in September but 20
years ago the error rate was above forty
three percent 6.3 awesome I was like
it's going to be a long time before we
find the milestone like the epitome but
computers can understand us as well as
we do
so that happened a month later so a
month later you reach that 5.9 that's
equal to one of us transcribing what I'm
saying right now so we can have a
machine doing that they can actually
listen just like we do so we're moving
away from a world where we must
understand computers to wear a computer
can actually understand us I think
that's awesome so just to quickly the
advancements made in in other areas like
how GPUs enables deep learning and how
fpgas enabled like the first AI
supercomputer in the cloud so as videos
weird Microsoft have been installing
these for more than two years in not
sure so they are now in like every node
and I sure in more than 15 countries
it's a huge network that you can use to
apply your algorithms own really
impressive so what Doug burger did at
the ignite keynote he took the entire
wikipedia and translated it in the
fraction of a second but using the first
AI to complete super computer they sold
boil down to cognitive services
everything every advancement that we
made every service that we create we're
infusing it with intelligence and
hopefully giving you cognitive services
that you can use to better use the AI to
democratize am anyways so the cognitive
services has everything from ready-made
api's for a visions for texts for
languages for speech search they're cool
I mean the image stabilization the
object recognition how you can get that
from a service
it's really awesome you imagine if we
did that man if it took all that smart
the first day I supercomputer would you
then get the end is near I don't know
I'm not sure Alexa will ever turn into
how about it I don't think Siri or
katana as much to do with the t100 what
we really have right now is something
completely different so we shouldn't be
worried about the ai's taking over
anytime soon maltese falcon is a
favorite i love anything film noir but
more recently inception yeah those i
mean they're um yes they are Italians
are also cool bad audio so what happens
is that they talk gibberish and they
kept on talking gibberish for like 12
hours that's a fascinating twitch
channel so three things do enable the
building controls for your digital
assistants or have a very flexible
credit card if you have kids look at
skills in action this as a way to
enhance the digital assistants and the
relevancy that they bring into into your
well into your custom as well because
you can all of a sudden surface your
applications and your products was soon
out today in a way that's never been
done before and the battle machine
learning you can do too you're in good
company all big players are doing the
same thing
so now that we're finding the area of
boston where the bot well i would say
that it's often just a facade it's a
it's an interface for an application
that crew performing one more automated
tasks chat bots are probably the most
common form of ops today others will
emerge as time comes users can start
conversations with bots from any channel
as long as you configure them davida you
can design the communication of your
BOTS to be free form free-flowing
natural language you can use foam guided
flows you can even use really advanced
context like actions and buttons and
cards and receipt it's all up to you
we're in London this guy was London one
there was 19 years old it created a do
not pay but this is simple questionnaire
and hands bought really but it has
successfully contested more than 160,000
parking tickets in London and New York
and it does so for free just by
following some questions and answers it
can determine if it should contest the
fine or not
so some channel examples as well this
Joshua guy the greater loop way back
should probably update him but this
isn't kick which is just one channel
when I greeted it already knows my name
so it knows who I am it keeps on knowing
me so yes they can keep state you don't
necessarily have to restart everything
all the time you can send pictures you
can use rich-media everyone's been
talking about like Tosh and all that
stuff I'm not going to do that I'll show
you so instead so so it's more like
funny it interacts and learns and then
response but so since funny photos funny
messages but this is proactive messages
these are not in reply to something that
I've stated so this is the bot reaching
out by itself probably like just
triggers but still and even though I
rush and type like crap she has a sense
of humor so the Turing test or not
probably shouldn't fail it
to the Microsoft bot framework then it's
probably familiar to you a lot of you
nowadays there's a comprehensive
offering but we got that you can use to
build a button to get on sort an
expressway in too many channels job the
bath builders decayed buck connector to
develop a portal and the directory so
the directory here is interesting
everything else is too but the directory
because discovery is a problem
especially in the world of apps today
right if you're writing an app you're
doomed well not really you can of course
succeed but most likely it'll take a
long time and you'll need someone's
money for it will we end up in the same
place with bots once we flood every
channel with what 3.5 million BOTS like
I don't know what sort of flour about
you were referring to you but I have
75,000 in your vicinity that's not going
to fly you need something more than that
though discovery is once everyone gets
involved in that and find sort of
consensus I'm sure it will be better but
right now we have to surface it through
bought shops or about directories and
and you have to really market them
yourself like Twitter slack all kinds of
channels 77,000 developers have created
bots within the bot framework so it's a
really dominant platform
if you're developing locally you need to
test locally so that's why we have the
bot framework emulator as well so let's
see if we can do a couple of demos first
ones bot framework how we doing on time
oh yeah not good let's do this duplicate
so I wanted to show you the bot
framework but I guess I don't need that
at all there we go so the bot framework
you can find the dev framework com this
is also where you find that directly
that I was talking about within the
directory yeah what we surface as
feature BOTS even have the all box where
you can learn more keep loading some of
them we created ourselves a lot of them
has been created by company's clients
lucky there's some great documentation
going on here some might be hard to find
out so if you want to develop locally
they say using vicious to do and you'd
like a template for it you'll first need
to find that template so you probably
got a box builder getting started
problem it'll sorry wrong soon it is
really hard to try and find the template
you can go and look everywhere so you
can go getting started with the
connector do too good to see this link
I'm swimming in boy so this is where you
download the template front and center
right
it actually does have a quick link but
it just says here so once you download
that it's easy to install you just go
here so you install it as a template
this will get better but once you do
that you can go to wishes to do and you
can go file swim in their file new
project and we'll find the right guy
sits on the templates vicious to do bots
application when that gets created what
you'll end up with is this something
that should be fairly familiar familiar
to all because it's an API this is your
pretty standard net API because the
price surprise a bodice just the facade
for an application in this case it's
sought for an API and what it does does
something brilliantly it takes the text
that comes in and counts how many
characters that's all it did and the
body framework emulator download that
too it changed its names now it's called
the emulator for the bot framework some
reason when you run that you can then
test these locally
if it will wake up so so the bot
framework emulator looks something like
this you select REM points and if you
have authorization or not they can go
hello and easy you send hello and easy
which was nine characters this is the
best spot ever written but it has some
it has some fun things if you look glad
a bigger and more detail example there
is the contoso flowers that is available
from the bob builder SDKs github repo
now this one is more full-fledged and
you can publish this to a sure probably
to any club but i would say to a sure
and then you can run so wouldn't you
publish it i can show you the bought em
let's do like that if we were to
register bought that flower bot you go
register bot tell it stuff about the box
you give it an app ID in a password and
then you create it and configure it once
you've done that you can connect it to
different channels now in order to save
some time I've done just that there is
flower for all it's a very cute little
thing so this is connected to my ass
your end point where I published that
now you can see in the shat it says
welcome to control some flowers it's
just for testing out here so
I've connected it to teams to skype to
slack into web chat but it's all just
using one code base so this is a power
with the bot framework you don't need to
write your BOTS for every platform
maintain separate code bases you write
it for one platform much easier so if we
were to look at that and say slack it
would look something like this cool
sites me scrolling like a madman go
hello I cheered wake up hello you know
well that wakes up I can go to skype and
show you in skype as well hello
see I've contoso flowers in skype i also
have controls of virus in flac I can
order flowers it knows my name it's
amazing well you can add addresses you
can use some maps you can get very very
detailed information because it's all
right for BOTS to request personal
information because they need to do
their job you can't expect a bot that
sends flowers or buys flowers by the
pizza for that matter to send you that
pizza if they don't know your address
will be really hard it's kind of like
that super bowl thing so let's um let's
quickly jump back to you this one yeah
can I do that can do that
oh I'm still in presentation mode ha ok
that was just a quick great bot
framework thing now if you were to use
this more seriously you still use bot
framework right you would add
intelligence using the cognitive
services API Brett slug intelligence
such as language understanding Lewis so
Lewis or Louise AI language
understanding intelligence service and
you would host it or you take benefits
of the cloud because it enables scale it
enables storing data because for a bawd
it's really important that you store
metrics and you store your logs because
you know what people will try to abuse
it they will call it names they will
flirt with it they will do all kinds of
strange yet but you need to act on that
so you need to make your bar better by
learning from what it actually gets
input to sew in actually we have
something called a shabbat service a
shabbat service is a service computing
enabled bot it's quite muffle it's based
on a ship functions which is asha
serverless computing and it gives you an
development environment it gives you
publishing environment it gives you
everything with an Asscher so let's see
yeah let's quickly show you that as well
we go por el Asher com
sooner or later
then we create a new pop service bot
service is located under intelligence
and analytics got a loved you non line
demos done it's like yeah it'll get
their intelligence and analytics it is
about service so i'll get so let's call
this one a pd and the seed vault lily is
an existing
put it in north Europe and we're pinning
into your dashboard so i'm doing here is
i'm giving it an app name telling the
resource group name what it is and where
in the world i would like this to reside
once I it create you'll run for a couple
of minutes it will create a functions
space it will wire up everything in
order for me to use this as a bot
service so when you're writing your own
bought services your writing functions
read your writing Asher functions but
when you're also writing but see here
comes this again you need to create your
own Microsoft app ID and set password
this runs fairly quickly see generate a
secret and you copy that secret then you
yeah sorry for the Swedish then you
absolute then go to book at the bottom
work yeah like you always do the reason
why they copy is that you really need to
taste it in here and voila doon copy at
all yours you can then go back and you
can generate a new key this happens
every time I run this demo so generate
knit allez note this is security by
obscurity turn into Swedish and no one
gets it okay let's just look at that
thank you okay
a little close that guy will paste it in
now we get to choose language see if I
can zoom in a bit so the templates here
of a little CTR of the node that are
different but you get some fun ones so
let's go with proactive bot right
practic bot sounds fun so I hate create
and you can barely see but there's a
progress thing going on it doesn't take
that long once it's completed the
function is there the code is there
actually the entire project has been
created run for a min arose oh don't
worry i will show you one thing that's
different about the function bought
compared to the bot framework template
perhaps some of you know this already
but the bots you ride in a shabbat
service there dot nightcore they're not
just thought that framework see you
going right now you get project jason
and all SF hope that's going to change
too because that's changing so when you
when you run when you debug a shabbat
service BOTS you need to approach it
differently when you're debugging it so
keep that in mind with that said there's
a good link to that on the actual a
shabbat service like tutorial page so
that should be all right ok demoing and
it just keeps spinning
I would say take my word for it doesn't
come up in like five seconds south and
can't just move on that was a threat
okay hey one so it is not my core you
get like a test page you get everything
you need within that environment you can
publish two channels you can publish
about to the directory or from with
their measure and you can also like to
continuous integration to it but once
you do that you cannot edit the code
anymore with inertia boxers like in the
IDE here just know that it was a fun way
to try it it goes really fast moving on
takeaways so dialogue design is really
important this is like the equivalent of
you I or UX of a bot don't mess it up
start by thinking about your dialogue
build your dialogue script it
so unless computing is awesome I like it
I like it a lot and bought slip natural
in the cloud but so jumping back to
point either if you were writing about
that no one was using up until like
December 24 if you were Santa Claus that
was your bot you wouldn't like to be
paying for that bot January until
December so Asher functions gives you
that option of just paying for when your
code is used it's really beneficial so
there are tons of opportunities like
tons people are calling this the fourth
Industrial Revolution it consists of a I
machine learning robots but advancements
in like good genetics a lot of things it
will take away jobs will also create
jobs it will create new opportunities
you can write a box straight away it's
like I was just thinking about this you
can write a think of it as a as one of
those speakers that you could build it
sits in a meeting room it connects using
Microsoft graph API or something to
build on bot framework to connect to
like channels and all that stuff it's
using cognitive services to recognize
who's in the meeting room using
cognitive services to transcribe speech
to text it's using cognitive services to
even do sentiment analysis of the text
to see if everyone's happy in the
meeting or not you can write that
application right now where you can
solar that little hardware thing
together and you can go and sell that
that's a start up right there
so this is one final demo the Q&amp;amp;A maker
so it's kind of like a bot that's a
service everything something something
as a service right now oh look okay so
here's the IDE for a shabbat service so
you're too late my friend I'm going away
from you kuna a maker just going to you
I'm going to close this one because I'm
angry at so cute I maker from faq to
Boston minutes it's pretty that you can
create new service give it a name like
NDC genie you can paste in the URL or
you can add files or something like that
so what I'm going to do is we're going
to do like this and you see London pages
faq right now go quick
so now it has created a Q&amp;amp;A bot from the
FAQ of NDC London start fast so we can
test this going to test hi I'm NDC
Jeannie yes you are will say when I get
my tickets ticket and it replies from
they're faking spread impressive
actually you can also choose another
answer if that's not like its quarry or
you can change and add new alternatives
for the phrasings as well then you can
retrain you can publish this thought I
runs this is Swift this demo yet that's
good so exited that one sorry about that
some things to consider if you're
writing bots oh let's go back if you're
using language translations like Lewis
it doesn't have a tree language sorry
language and I'm like language
intelligence services like list so
translate to a common ground translate
your language to English and then send
it to Lewis you get better results you
shouldn't train Swedish on an English
system ok when you do on birding like
just greet who's ever starting to speak
to the bot and have an escape route like
a menu or they allow scenario just click
help and save the metrics retrain your
models and just deploy deploy
final three things the cognitive
services are there you should use them
if you find other services of the AI
services intelligence services use them
the more we use these services of the
day become and the more services will
arise as well the fourth Industrial
Revolution includes a I and ml and BOTS
so machine learning is really vital in
Kevin Kelly is that an if ted talk about
the AI and the fourth Industrial
Revolution that if all else fails just
create a startup call it something
something AI and you will get funding
then you can figure out what to do just
name it ai so with that I would say
thank you for listening if you have any
questions feel free to pop them
otherwise send me tweet or an email and
that's it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
