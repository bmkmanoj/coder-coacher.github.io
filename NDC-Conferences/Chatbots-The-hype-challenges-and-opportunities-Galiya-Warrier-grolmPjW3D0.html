honored that you guys came in because I
thought if nobody comes in either you go
and see 300 resonation myself but thank
you very much for coming so my name is
Galya warrior and today we're going to
talk a little bit about chatbots
and we're gonna discuss what is this
whole hype about it what is the
challenges and opportunities right now
in this space
so among what's it eight of you how many
of you actually did talk to a bot talked
about yeah okay Cole did you develop
anything for the bot Aaron I know you
mentioned you did you tried okay right
okay that's good so hopefully I'll show
you what you can do and how you can go
about that so first of all so what are
chat BOTS it's something which is a
user's conversation as an interface and
they usually function on the top of
messaging platforms there lots of name
they were known for a while under lots
of names so at the moment chat bots is
the sort of standard in the industry but
again it might change in five years time
who knows they used to be chatterbox
talk about artificial conversational
intel entities even which is impossible
to pronounce but main thing about the
chat BOTS they are perceived to be
intelligent whether it's based on some
rules us developers provide and you know
rule by the engines or it might be some
artificial intelligence back-end yeah
Ivan as you can see Delbert already
nailed it on that there if we look at
the history very briefly so 1950s this
is where it's all starts with Alan
Turing's papers you know Computing
Machinery and intelligence
so the Turing test they're the whole
question of can machine think and
actually this is where it's all started
so chatbots is nothing new really it's
all back then in 50s the first major
rise of chat BOTS was in 60s and 70s
with the maybe so-called classic BOTS
now and it was obviously done mostly in
the Research Institute imit Stanford etc
so the two main examples you may have
heard of
it's Eliza dr. which was a scripted
conversation from the point of view of a
psychotherapist so you could actually
have a conversation as if you're talking
to your psychotherapist and he would
actually reply to you with using those
early language and that natural language
processing tools back then and it was at
that point it was really really exciting
and very cool the way it was replying it
was almost like a human was replying and
then in 72 Stanford University so they
they did they were joking a little bit
but they created another person peri it
was a simulation of a person with a
paranoid schizophrenia and again you
could talk to this person so he would
emulate the behavior of you know of
person with his mental illness and you
might want to ask did they actually meet
and they met quite a few times at some
conferences back then and I think it was
1972 one of the best ones when they
actually talked over there APRA net and
you know they had a proper conversation
between themselves so this was back in
60 70s then fast forward 15 years 20
years so 1990s we got the general words
which we you know we all knew those sort
of mainstream bolts the customer
services you know that IKEA bought you
know that service was very very simple
and reply but it was still you know
useful then there would be you know call
centers romance apps interestingly
enough dating apps application at that
point whatever they were conversational
toys which I was surprised but again
there was a some early natural language
processing backends there and also that
the Turing test which was based on that
Turing's paper so there was a actually
lobna price has been established to give
money to to an application to chatbot
which could actually trick the human
into you know believing it's human so
till now it still hasn't been reached
out so you know that that milestone has
been reached but it's been held every
year so far and then another type of
bots which became popular at that point
some of the malicious BOTS on the
instant messaging the fun fact I found
out I didn't know that but Wikipedia
apparently runs about 2,000 votes to
actually maintain the state of their you
know the Wikipedia which is I think
pretty cool and it's been again didn't
been there for a while it's nothing new
and then you know last year 2016 still
very fresh we came to the point where
you know there was an explosion so such
an Adela you know says what are the new
apps March 2016
Facebook releases the boat frame worker
on the same time also I think it was in
March you know they have a boat engine
hosted by the artificial intelligence
company called wit dot AI Microsoft
releases they're now in famous stable
and takes it back very quickly takes it
off and then launches of the cognitive
services I don't know if some of you
have been today Jennifer stock so she
was talking about cognitive services
then Oracle was there in September
Google was they in May
you know everybody pretty much was
suddenly emerging in that space and you
know you know Oh Riley is one of them
you know famous conference providers
conference organizers so they actually
held a birthday in October last year on
the topic of bots which I guess again
gives that validation is actually very
important in the industry right now the
reason why it is important and why it
became so important now is that there's
some research has been done recently
apparently eighty five percent of
customers time on smart phone is
actually spent within the five apps and
those five apps might be different
between you and me but essentially they
would be within the category of
messaging social networking games so
that's that's why we spend most our time
apparently on the smartphone so these
days and people like to chat you know we
all use our devices for that I gained
some statistic just for your you know
for your knowledge thirty two percent of
global population is now social media
the growth of the number of mobile
messages sent between 2012 I mean in
2012 it was around fifteen trillion
messages in next I mean this year turned
seventeen is about thirty trillion
messages so it's exploding again
and most of those messages down through
there you know messaging platform
applications and so all other factors
which I important is that users you know
we all tired of the searching of this
new yet new application on the App Store
or you know any other store and it's we
bound to our 10 top 10 10 20 20 probably
and that's it so we don't really use
anymore and this is from the opposite
side when you're a mobile application
developer how do you actually make your
application visible it's really hard
these days now and last and I think is
also very very important point why bots
are so prominent now is those advanced
natural language processing tools as
well as other capabilities on the AI
space but the NLP is one of the most
important for boats so they are now
available in a very easy way to develop
for developers to use in the
applications and again if you seen Jen's
talk on cognitive so so you're gonna
watch it later online take a look
because she actually shows there the
Microsoft toolkit on that and how easy
you could actually bring it together
with your applications and they're
important bit why is it you know what
are the opportunities for the companies
now for the businesses first of all we
are on messaging apps so you know brands
want to be there they want to be where
we are so you know that's that's my main
point for them then some of the ideas
around customer service has been already
bubbling out and can you make a customer
service simpler in a way that if I come
to a bot and if I come to that service
and actually I ask very simple question
coming from my FAQ do I really need a
human to respond to that or can it be
automated however if there is some
request which might be much more
complicated you need to be dealt by
human then you might want to reroute to
you know to human and to make things
even better if that question is angry or
you know somebody's not very happy about
the service maybe we need to top it up
in the queue you know so that person to
get attention much quicker so there are
opportunities in that space we all know
companies have a lot of internal data
sources internal data systems and
internal systems and quite often they
are not the
to use and we're quite clunky you know a
lots of steps to do something you know
booking your vacations might be taking
five ten steps and if there's something
quicker can be done and make you know
employees productive in the work space
that is another opportunity and all
sorts of innovations coming out now
you know I can maybe there are some
examples you think of a possible in that
space around text and voice interaction
around you know using dossier
capabilities how you build them up
together making better use of what you
have right now the data you have and how
do you expose it to the internally or
external world and one of the just
recent reports literally like last week
it was released so 80 percent of
marketing leaders who actually want to
have chat BOTS or some AAA capability by
2020 which is very soon actually so we
better to look at the space and see what
we can do but this is for the more for
the businesses and if we think from
developers point of view so what are the
opportunities for developers first of
all there chat bot application itself
it's a service you create once and you
you maintain it you deploy it but it's
it's a one piece it's not a you know
challenge of having iOS device you know
iOS called Android code etc etc so it's
all in one place and then you can
actually expose it to those different
channels where customers are whether
it's a Facebook Messenger whether it's
slack whether it's Skype and whatever
else might be so this is that
opportunity for developers also because
users use those chat platforms already
so you don't really need to introduce a
new sort of way of dealing with that
with your application so there it's
slack interfaces familiar to them Skype
they know how to use it and so on and
again API is using the NLP using search
using I don't know vision API etc so all
of those opportunities are there for
developers question is would BOTS be
used for everything and you know
searching adela bots are new apps is it
really true probably not we need to be
very conscious of that because bots are
not BOTS are good at some things but
they are not particularly great
so and we when we developed that we
developed those applications we need to
we need to keep this in mind so they are
good at something which is very
sequential for instance the number of
options and one of the examples is
there's a parking there's a lawyer bot
which allows you to appeal for your
parking it's actually was quite popular
in the UK I think last year or two so
you can actually if you got a parking
ticket you can go to that website and it
will ask you a few questions and then it
will just send an appeal to the console
and you actually might get you know the
parking ticket completely taken off you
also they are good for the sort of
simulating conversation which we already
know as a conversation you know ordering
your pizza booking an appointment you
know these sort of things again they
have very predefined we know exactly
what's the outcome and so very you know
there's a goal I need to achieve and
there are steps which are known there
may be some of the non time critical
queries also could be done through boats
I don't know booking restaurant booking
a movie you know movie ticket for
instance it could be done as well but
it's not I want to do it now but
something like I want to do it you know
maybe I'm Sunday I want to go to a movie
so what are the options and you can go
through those options iterate etc
through the boat however there are some
scenarios where boats will not be good
an application will probably be still a
good choice you know booking a taxi for
four o'clock today all Rach in 15
minutes it's probably better to do it
right on the you know uber or any other
device or any other application because
it just right there it knows your
location and says you really don't want
to have that long conversation with each
other but how you order your taxi and
maybe some of the scenarios when the
tasks are could be complex I mean there
might be singular like get the fastest
route from A to B but what is it fastest
for you what is it fastest for the
algorithm and so on there's so many
options and scenarios there so it might
not be the best way of you know exposing
that sort of behavior and using BOTS for
that and in generally you don't want to
have BOTS which do everything you want
to have what switch to something
specific you know which are they are
good at so this is just to give you idea
if you are looking at you
some ideas for building your boats just
focus on one thing which it will do very
well so there are some real-life
examples now which are largely wrong
productivity but it's personal
productivity but it's workplace
productivity traveling you know personal
assistance for hotels flights and so on
personal finance actually oops sorry I
quite like this one and I think it's
available in us right not trim but it's
a really interesting idea that actually
can you can upload your bank statement
and actually can go through that find
the recurring payments you do and
actually tell you I think you paying
Netflix you know every month and then
you might think okay maybe I'm not
actually using that service should i
cancel it and it can cancel it for you
through the text so again some something
interesting to you know to help you to
save you some money and then retail
space is a very big player for boats
because there are lots and lots of
scenarios where boats could be and
people in people you know they're trying
to do some things the for instance in
the UK I know the Domino's they released
they they bought on the Facebook I think
and you can order your pizza through
that again it's not nothing new I mean
it's they just doing it exactly the same
as they do everywhere else you can go on
the website do the same thing but you
know this is just a bit of fun for them
and a bit of publicity but I think we
will get further maybe this year next
year's will go further in what those
boats could do in for the retail so how
do you start and you know what is the
the easy way maybe because like I spoke
to the guys earlier so you know if you
tried
Microsoft both framework you know six
months ago it was really clunky it was
really hard to use because of bits and
pieces were not meeting you know fit
together very well so you might have
tried and I was like okay that's just
doesn't make sense to me so how do you
start
so the first dam I want to show you is
is actually something very very simple
and the premise is you can build your
boat in five minutes
also without writing any code and but
it's actually gonna be useful but not
just hi hello and you know you've sent
me this long message so let me just so
the but I'm going to use I'm gonna build
sorry is called well it will be doing
something around FAQ
you know lots of websites a lot of
companies have they you know I think he
was exposed and when you search for it
sometimes you can find a quick quote you
need sometimes it takes a bit of time to
actually find it so what you're gonna do
is you can create your own but it's a
cold Q&amp;amp;A maker and it's but it actually
it's a part of cognitive services
provided by Microsoft and you will
expose your fa Q's literally in you know
in that service so what how you do it so
you need to go to this website called K
and a maker dot a I and they need to
create new service you you put the name
let me write and then all you need to do
is you provide your FAQ page
or you can also you know upload a
question-and-answer file or you can
actually build it manually essentially a
knowledgebase can be built manually but
let's make it simple for now so let's go
literally on the bot frameworks
FAQ page and let's just say okay this is
where I'm very my where my FAQ pages and
then we do create so what it does now so
it basically goes through that content
of the page it creates those pairs and
creates that knowledgebase live in so
written there so what it has if you look
at this
you've got I've got some bit of a crazy
resolution okay so if you look here so
this
pretty much you know these are questions
and answers and they are all down there
so this is what we have exposed as a
question answer might be a bit too long
for you know what conversation but again
something you can edit if needed
you know Tremont train and what you
could do you can go here and test your
bought now and that testing will allow
users to sort of express different
Express what they are searching for in a
different way so you can train that
model and then say for instance I'm just
let me just damage instead of explaining
it so basically what is what framework
you might have a user coming and
checking what is bright right and given
our knowledgebase we've just loaded so
there are actually a few options around
what what the broad framework is and you
can choose and say okay I think this
particular piece of text is actually
would be the best answer to it right and
then also you can add alternative
questions so instead of what is broad
framework explain you know you can
imagine different scenarios ways like
you know people put the different
different variation of the same question
really and then for instance we can also
put in sport framework today publicly
available
and then again the one of their answers
from the knowledge base comes directly
and actually I think it's a it's a valid
answer so we can just say okay that's
perfect for us so when we did a bit of a
testing like that you know maybe you
just going through all the different
questions in our knowledge base we can
just save saving train right and then
what we do we do publish and that
creates an end point for your boat
essentially what what is happening let
me just click actually publishing and
then you will see
right so we've have created a an
endpoint which can be used now by your
application it doesn't have to be bought
but it could be used by application and
you know that's all that's all needs to
be done and then the question has to be
provided as part of the query right and
then you can edit it how you could now
actually expose it as a bot say on your
website even so you would need to go
into one of these ways to do it you can
just go to them as you're you know the
resource group where you want to publish
it so let's just do that and then you
just create a new so you can create a
new service so about service so it's a
currently in preview but hopefully will
be released soon enough so so how you
created is literally you provide your
application name because this would be
your web application on as you oh really
what how it is designed so let's say so
let's put it in the North Europe and
create so they'll take few seconds to
create hopefully
so while it's creating it and then I'll
show you how you actually connect to
that end point let me just show you how
you can talk to it I did it previously
so you can expose it through your you
know this is Skype so we can do the
usual hi hello
right and then we can ask the same
question you know what is what framework
and then you know it will bring you know
that the DEF a cue so this is how it can
be exposed into your Skype or in your
internal communication tools whatever
they are and so let me just double check
so it's yeah so it succeeded so let's go
now into that so when you create and as
you about you know using the pass
solution platform as a service you you
have a choice of different both options
so you can create a new board completely
blank and you know do whatever you want
to do with that or you can actually
create a bot and point it to the Q&amp;amp;A
service so let me just quickly register
our new bot okay just copy that very
important it shown once you can't
actually get it back again so and then
fine and go back to what framework okay
and then you select the language will be
using C sharp on OGS and then there are
a few templates available to you so at
the moment what we have is question
answer and then we create bot and with
this case we can just say okay I have in
my subscription I have this one
knowledgebase and I'd like to get that
up and running
and so what will happen now so it will
provision that boat and you will have
now the choices of you know
communicating through the web chat or
actually expose it through the different
channels so we'll come back to that
because it takes a few minutes as I
showed you there that the Q&amp;amp;A boat
essentially is done in five minutes and
actually if you come back you know next
week and your boss asks you what what
have you learn you can say okay I've
learned how to make boats and it might
take me a few days to do it but I can do
one for the company and you know you
just use this ten minutes but creator
and use the rest of the time to watch
the rest of sessions so on the boats the
stateless body is the one we just shown
the FAQ which is you know it's very
simple it's very static
it's useful in its own way but it it's
not capable of learning it doesn't
really remember anything you know you
come back once again you ask the same
question or similar question it just it
treats you like you know you completely
independent entity the more interesting
ones are those semi stateful boats where
you can actually track some of the basic
user details you might have an option of
signing it into the boat and then do
something about you know then use that
information about the user you might
have another three of options how which
goals they want to achieve and you can
guide those users through that
conversations you might have some
limited capability to remember just use
a session or if user speaks in a
different channels and actually you can
pick it up as well so this is where I
think a lot of useful boats will come
out you know or coming out right now and
the next one which is something where
the hype is I think is stateful boats
its those which can recall previous
conversation those which can remember
your preferences and actually you know
give you some recommendation based on
that you know have some AI capabilities
machine learning capabilities models
around that so they are really human
like you know those personal assistants
which everybody is saying that
replace humans so I think we are not
there yet not working so we are not
really there yet I think oh there's a
very few good examples of how it's done
so we I think went somewhere in the
middle right now
and where people start is those
stateless just what's for fun there's
some design patterns around boats I
think I've sort of already alluded to
that so the boats are really good at
transactions you know look up references
and so on some of the social
conversations conversations and being
able to sense of the sense sentiment
within that conversation is very
important there might be example some of
advisory role for the boats if for
instance you are you know it's an expert
system or you're trying to understand I
don't know what is my I'm currently on
this particular plan would say with an
energy company what would be the best
options for me given that you know how
much I pay was my expense of the you
know what's my usage of the electricity
and so on and they might guide you
through the different options or you
know finance car finance loans etc so
that might be an option as well and then
information retrieval is some of the
lookups big back backed by the data
source such as well FAQ boat is one of
the examples I guess so building a good
chat bot actually involves a lot of
things quite often we as developers
starts on that whole development bit you
know I have these bits and pieces these
are my channels where I want to expose
it to design API is I want to use
whether it's my internal systems or is
it some of the NLP capabilities and so
on but there are lots of other things
which needs to be considered and those
are you know how do you actually design
that conversation and that it's useful
to the user that user not getting
annoyed by that if it's repeated you
know there's a lot of things going on
behind the scenes how what makes a good
bot and I think we're still trying to
figure out especially you could see that
there are some books being released
around you know the design of this it's
like you know UX design but it's for
both now that that's conversation design
also how can you apply your customers in
learning models you're very
domain-specific machine learning models
deep learning and so on where do you
host your BOTS and
what actually do you want to do to
disrupt the industry because you know
this is what a lot of people are you
know now spending time and money on how
do I disrupt this interest using this
new technology and the landscape is very
wide actually right now and there are no
particular industry standards either and
you might have tried those of you who
looked at the development - you might
have tried with Microsoft services you
might have seen some of them you know
Facebook development options there are
some what's about lots of other
platforms which create you know allow
you to create BOTS like some of them at
the bottom like groups goop shop I think
it's called and then a few others so
they are might be popular as well
because some of them do not require
coding so you can actually do a bit of a
drag-and-drop and build your bot
interface there so this picture is
already update outdated I think because
it's September turn 16 this field moves
way too fast to actually you know to be
able to track everything but it just
gives you an idea of what what are the
options and messaging platforms again
quite varied and the options are lots of
them so what I want to show you that
second demo is is an example of just so
the second demo is just an example of
say you are a property you know real
estate property company in London and
you know you want to expose your
properties people want to go and search
for it search for rental properties
which is if you live in the city you
know it's a nightmare
and say you want to do those one second
give me
actually while it's loading so our boat
service has been deployed so I'll just
come back quickly on the demo number one
and and here you have a web chat where
you can actually talk to your what the
one you've created so it's already there
okay so bottom later let's just see it's
all up and running okay I was just about
to say we've Microsoft has released a
new amazing version of the emulator by
takes a while to load sorry
it's way too good come on
this is not quite working is it so if
you haven't used it before so this is
the way to you know debug your local
bots and you can select them the place
where it sits in my local host at the
moment and so so again so that this
scenario is your real estate agency in
London so people want to use BOTS to
actually talk to your you know to
understand what the properties you have
and how can they rent it so you know
they the good boat design actually when
person says but the boat says hello it
actually explain a little bit what is
what's its purpose so and you know maybe
some of the options so let's say with
help
so this bolt allows you to find some of
the rental accommodation in London using
Zoopla api's and data and then there are
a few options so I just want to show you
that you can do a sub guided search you
can do you know just natural language
queries and also the way I built it I
actually combined it with a an FAQ bot
around that agency so and I can actually
ask for just for the start we can ask
you know some of the questions which are
related to the FAQ so if if you move to
UK from a different country like I did
before you have all this what is a DPS
what is the tenancy agreement and all of
this sort of you know intricacies around
that so you might actually ask so what
is DPS because you see this abbreviation
and you're not sure and then the bot bot
FAQ might apply okay the DPS a knowledge
basis this is their government standard
you know definition of the DPS so if we
look at the sort of examples of guided
conversation or guided search you might
you know you can for instance say okay
let me give you a couple of options ask
you a couple of options first before I
understand what you're looking for and
say what type of property then you can
say okay I'm looking for flat
and then you know they could be some
other questions so how many bedrooms do
you need and then say well whatever I
have for my money
and then maybe some other conversations
you might include you know until the
user is I know it so it's better to keep
it short but say inside ok show me
whatever you have money is not an issue
and then but can go and actually queried
their back and query the internal system
the external system whatever it is it's
essentially a data layer now and then
present some of the options to the user
and then you can you know read more and
then just go to the website with more
detail and then maybe you can say ok
actually it's not exactly what I'm
looking for and I can say I'm I'm
looking for a two bedroom flat again for
the damp UPS is quite simple but you can
actually have more information on in
this budget in this area etcetera etc so
this could be extended by the game so
what will reply to you with some of the
options so these are the the
capabilities and again so this could be
expanded into your website it could be
expanded to different channels and the
way you've seen if you saw that I typed
I'm looking for a flat you can say I'm
searching for a flat I need a flat you
know insole will be going through Louis
that language understanding service in
Microsoft toolkit which will actually
narrow down user searching for flat and
this additional attributes is searching
for so that's the way it works and if I
switch to the demo sorry to the slide
deck so the the example I just shown you
he's using Microsoft bot framework and
there's a link up there if you if you
haven't seen it yet but it basically
connects combines of three parts so
first is that both bot builder SDK which
is the C sharp or not GS application
then you have a butt connector SDK which
allows you to connect your BOTS to you
know to various channels text
Skype slack and so on and then you can
publish your boat externally to the
world through Microsoft bought both
directory and at the moment it's that
place where you know you can find the
different different boats
I think it's that App Store for BOTS
probably will change at some point
because it's it's really you know it's a
lot of them are there not everything a
world not everything is working so it
needs to be curated and so there's still
work to be done but this is where the
place where you can publish but you
don't have to you can just keep it
within you know through as a web
application and just use it internally
the bot builder SDK is basically allows
you to have so the bottom the top is
your you know your conversation logic
which is essentially the SDK and then
anything business logic the data access
layer and any other logic needs to be in
that application and so that is you can
build you can build the application
using c-sharp not GS you host it
somewhere it's up to you where you want
to host it because in this case it's
essentially a web application so Web API
application so you can host it on Azure
you can host it you know in many other
places the SDK allows you to create the
conversation dialogues and we'll see
I'll show you the code later
you know how they look like and it
allows you to create a variety of
interaction with your BOTS so whether
it's through the text whether it's rich
attachments like I shown you you know
when there's a picture there's a link
and so on and also for Skype there is
support for calling I think it's in
preview at the moment so connect allows
to do the major part the routing part
between your web application and your
channels so it's responsible for the you
know state for the registration of the
boat you know it keeps the information
per user per boat there's a some storage
associated with that as well so the this
sort of the the smart part about the
communication of the boat and the
channels is done through the boat
connector the emulator we've already
seen so
cross-platform tool and it's open-source
tool and you know you can actually
inspect your jason response you can send
requests and receive them from your
local host as well as actually you can
set it up to your remote you know end
point and so you can actually emulate
various conversation through there
through the tool when you publish your
boat and when you want to say okay i
want my boat available through the
different channels so there's a there's
a special part in the portal where there
are both frameworks it's where you can
actually create that details around your
boat and then this is one of the
examples of one of my other boat being
available in the various channels and
again it's it sort of it depends what
users use and where they are so that's
that's what's important what directory
take a look if there's something
interesting you might find some of the
examples so Skyscanner is a really good
example of you know travel what and you
can actually search for for your flights
and I think hotels as well lots of silly
boats there as well there was one which
had fish I couldn't find it now it was
make me a cup of tea or something
similar and then you ask okay I won't
have a cup of tea and silver Diego this
is your cup of tea that would be the
whole conversation but you know again it
was just a bit of fun so on there so
just to show you how it all looks like
in the code so if you look first of all
so when we actually hold on a second let
me just go back one moment here so when
you create when you go into the boat
framework there is a documentation page
available and actually the you know the
overview and the starting point is quite
good because it gives you idea of what
are the prerequisites required you know
what version of Visual Studio which is
dk version etc so that's definitely a
good place to start and then you can
create a new boat application and in
it's all
it doesn't really do anything much I
would say it all it does it sort of gets
the message and says you send me a
message and this is the length of that
application of that message but it gives
you the idea of that of how the
scaffolding is done and so this is the
new that new about new application have
created so again it's a web app a Web
API application so it that control is
there the important bit is that message
is controlling and if you look here so
the the bulk of activities is pretty
much just in this post method nothing
else so you've got when message comes in
so this is a city with activity and then
it may have a various types so it could
be just a natural message from the user
but it could be also some of the system
message like if the user is deleted or
if there was a conversation update if
user is you know the some of the contact
lists removal and adding is handled here
if user is typing you might want to do
something on there you know on your side
as well and if if he's been typing in
and you know doing it for for 10 minutes
maybe you want to ask or you know just
interact somehow but there are lots of
other options but I think the most
important one is obviously then the
message bit and all we have here we have
a connector client and which picks up
the the URL from where user comes from
the where the activity a message comes
from and then you can having that
activity so you can pick up the text
which would be your user message and
then yeah do something about that in
this particular case we just figure in
the length of that text and then just
creating your reply saying this was
still text you saying this was the
length and you know and we wait for
another message to come in basically so
this is what it does in a very very very
simple case and now I've lost mine
so if you look at the example I have
shown you just now so it's again it has
the same structure so the message is
control is still there the only
difference is that all I'm doing here is
I'm just firing a new property dialogue
because that's that's all my boat is
doing essentially and all every all the
communication is just handled handled
there so as I mentioned them my body is
connected to Luis to the cognitive
services which allows you to do the
natural language processing and it's
actually integrated seamlessly with the
bot framework itself so the only thing I
need to provide to tell to my code that
it's Luis needs to be checked is
provided the model the the ID and the
key of my model and then create a new
dialogue which is you know from the Luis
dialogue and when Luis processes your
text what happens is it basically
derives what are the intents of the of
the text user sent and whether it's and
you actually in charge of that model
because you need to decide you know what
is considered our greetings what is
considered I don't know find the flat
what is considered fine rent rent a
house you know these sort of things and
what sort of text sentences would be
used to express that intent and so Luis
will use that and then will create will
pass you back from that respond that
request different intent so in this case
it's none so it isn't like Luis
basically doesn't know what uses and
that's that's one of the options and the
default options and then in might be
greetings and then when it says hi then
that's how we know it was part through
Luis first through Luis and then we know
it was greeting then we respond with how
can I help you
user ask something around help and we've
defined it through loose model then then
we might say okay I can help you with
XYZ and this is how you do it right and
then there's a different monster and a
flat rent a house etc just to point you
quickly is so with none intent by
default it's usually this is where both
may reply I don't know I'm still you
know learning to ask me something else
you know this sort of default answer
whereas here I what I did is I actually
connected to my other boat which was my
FAQ and point and that's what I'm doing
so if I don't know what they user asked
so maybe I need to check my knowledge
base maybe it's actually there so that's
how that what is GPS query has been
parsed so Louis didn't know about that
then it again it's gone to the FAQ page
and it found something relevant to that
and actually if you want to look at that
how you connected
Gary pretty easy one of the MVP so he
actually helped me literally a couple of
days ago because he just published
something about the cue name maker
his blog literally on do you see 17th of
January so that was very useful take a
look and here as well just to show you
on finding properties how's it rent a
flat so when they user ask some message
around you know how do I get a flat and
then you might want to go into your you
know how do you process that query that
that request and then you might want to
respond you know you first you might
have query your data access layer will
power it is with its journal external
you know database etc and then you might
want to build that you know number of
responses it could be those card options
and this is what I've presented to you
you know with the photo and the text so
this is one of them thumbnail cards
available and it's at the different ways
how you bought can actually return the
information back to the user
and sure you hear many questions
actually on that right so I the idea of
the demo was to actually go into API
because hoopla exposes that API so you
can actually just hook to it I didn't
quite get it working unfortunately I
didn't have time so what I did is what I
have at the backend I have a just as you
a sequel database and I'm literally just
clearing the database for now but it's a
data access layer you know how do you
access any database or any API that's
exactly the same way there's nothing
different yeah good question right okay
I think there's no questions around code
I will just switch to them or two slide
deck back so how do you make your boat
smart again definitely look at Jen
session because she covered all of you
know most of those API is but largely
they around language you know natural
language processing translation text
analytics of around the text you know
your messages your user sent speech
maybe vision because there's some words
which might just accept the photo and
then do something about it it might be
one of the use cases I don't know
submitting your expenses maybe might be
an option and then having OCR and you
know you can think of lots of other
options how you can use that vision API
vision API is actually a few of them
there the knowledge search game you
might just for the entertainment if you
have a boat you might want to apply you
know with some random gif around the
particular topic or something like this
so this is one of the scenarios so the
cognitive services they are available
again there's a link at the top so they
are basically the REST API is for the
outside world but at the back end
there's a lot of machine learning
algorithm and models which Microsoft had
developed for years and
finally had the chance to actually
expose it through that those end points
so they can be integrated with your
language and platform because it's a
REST API so it doesn't really matter
what you use as your development
platform a language you can use one you
can use few of them you can chain them
together it's really up to you and one
of the examples which are just fits in
with both the chat BOTS perfect is that
Louis won you know I wouldn't go too
much into detail here but this just for
your information that you know they two
important bits intents and entities and
on Dan just to start wrapping up maybe
so the challenges we have a lot of
challenges around BOTS because with all
those opportunities and possible
innovations so there's a still a few
questions first of all you know there's
um we have some AI services available AI
as a service but is it actually
sufficient to support our specific
domain case would it be enough or do we
actually need to build those machine
learning backends ourselves and do we
have capability for that user experience
and how to improve it how to make you
user come back to your bot and actually
use it after all you know for for
extended period of time is very
important and still I think people are
struggling to understand what makes a
good bot and what I designs they're the
commercial models are not particularly
understood right now because it's all
you know how do you actually how do you
make money out of what I don't know
Facebook released they you know they are
now allowed to take payments through the
boats again would it be an option for
some BOTS I don't know personal
assistants maybe fit in that space
because you know you can actually pay
for that service but again there's a lot
of discussions going on and it's a
challenge right now and the security is
a very big piece right now because it's
messaging platform what kind of private
data can you send where is it stored
how's it being treated you know it's
it's it's still there so I hope you
learned something today there are few
things I just put on the slides so
they're you know about the history
around the challenges I think the
Unity's are the most important that
boats are very good at specific tasks
and they are fairly simple to build if
you just focus on that task rather than
trying to build for every single use
case and you know trying to solve every
single problem because that's not what
they designed for and good use cases for
companies might be starting with the
internal systems rather than going bang
on with the customer service to the
whole world because internal systems you
have a smaller set of users you know you
you can fail and it's okay people will
actually understand that whereas if you
go outside it might be some reputational
damage if you don't do a good job and
yes some some of the industry specific
bots will definitely be much becoming
more and more like a CRM BOTS or some
other things happen and 2017 this is
just a few headlines I think I found on
the weekend so everybody is talking this
is again new year of of the bots
kilovolts you know both trends to watch
so I think this will be still very
important and you should watch the space
definitely and maybe try to build you
know your own kilowatt and see if you
can make money out of it me personally
well that's what that's the thing nobody
really knows people trying to figure out
so but you have to keep track of the
space because there might be some good
ideas floating around thank you very
