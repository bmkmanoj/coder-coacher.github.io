and I'm here to talk about designing
interfaces that don't suck when your
customers scale and I'm down for
Brisbane and it's great to be in Sydney
and I'm sort of honored to be a part of
NEC Sydney this year so Who am I just
quickly on the Canadian and I'm an
Australian so if I sound funny that's
why and I'm a developer but I'm not a
designer but that said I love product
product development and building
products I love happy customers in
custer's customer support and I love
Apple products so I think those three
things sort of give me an appreciation
for design and I've always liked working
on customer focus things and usability
yeah and I work at octopus deploy and I
mention that because a lot of the
examples that I'm gonna use throughout
the presentation are from the lessons
learned from some of the problems and
the solutions as we built and grown
octopus so like to kick things off and
ask the question have you ever used an
app where when you first start using it
it could be a mobile or a website things
just work really really well you can add
data you can find data you can associate
things things just flow really really
well but as time goes on things can get
janky and once the data sets increase
and once the once the application scales
you can get hard to use it's slow slow
to find things slow to interact and
you're forced to find workarounds to do
the same things that you always have so
we're gonna be talking about that and
first up number one customers come in
different sizes number two we're gonna
look at how to find problems in your
existing apps for those different
customer sizes and number three we're
gonna look at designing interfaces for
too much data because that's generally
where the problems come so first
customers come in different sizes and
I'm not referring to individuals like
one specific person but it's more
difficulties in can cause some weird and
wacky problems
so I like to think of it as in terms of
small medium and large and it's kind of
like your maccas meals and it's easy to
understand small you've got a reasonable
set of number of customers maybe in one
location or around the world but the
point is they they use your application
almost exactly the way you designed
things work beautifully and everyone's
happy when you move up to medium that's
where you start to add more users add
more teams all around the world and the
datasets can increase records accounts
can increase but it's more the
complexity and the diversity data that
starts to creep up and cause problems
and this can be really apparent for
large instances or large customer sizes
where those different and diverse
customers one customer in one location
or multiple customers where they're
using your application within the
boundaries of it but they're doing
things differently they do it pulling
their processes and it can push the
boundaries of your applications so this
is octopus deploy and we're a friendly
deployment automation tool you create
projects you define your environments
and you can deploy to them so this is a
small instance this is our main
dashboard we have a handful of projects
and a handful of environments it works
really really well nice and simple and a
customer is very happy if you move up to
medium instance you can add more
projects even different groups and
environments and things still work
pretty well throughout the application
but if you move up to a large instance
things can change so this is driven by
test data but it's representative of
what we have seen in the real world so
this is one one screen of about ten
hundreds of projects hundreds of
environments and the implication here is
that projects sort of scale fine but for
customers who have lots of environments
there's a few areas of our application
that really break down and aren't as
usable so if you look at those scroll
bars it horizontal scrolling it on a web
page really isn't nice so if you're
trying to find the status of a
deployment to a handful of alarm
if you've got I the the bottom example
has about 10 or 12 if you have 50 or 100
or you your point to lots of different
regions at lots of Pradhan garments
things are hard and it's not as usable
so we know customers come in different
sizes small medium and large but how do
you find problems for them in your
existing apps I think the best way is to
talk to your customers and to listen and
learn and customer support primarily is
absolute gold your customers tell you
directly that they can report small bugs
larger issues and even offer suggestions
and feature requests to talk to describe
how your application doesn't suit the
way they're using it you can also talk
to them when you're doing planning
testing in any ways but the key point is
you talking to your customers
alternately you can walk through your
own apps and we'll cap what you can look
for next but by doing those two things
and doing some analysis you can build a
list of issues you can identify them
prioritize them and tackle the ones that
are important so what do you look for
Vince Spielman wrote an article called
the nine states of design and if you
google that it's the first one it's easy
to find but in that article he talks
about modern web design in how it's
going in the direction of components and
he describes all the states that
component could have there's four that
are really relevant if we're trying to
find issues for when customers are
scared when customers scale the first
one is none or empty state how does it
look when there's nothing there one some
and too many and I think too many is
absolutely perfect
it didn't really even need to be there
but that can help you pinpoint problems
and if you walk through your application
look at all the different places where
there's an interaction components large
or small or where you associate data too
many is really really telling if we
quantify things just quickly let's say
it's 0 1 maybe 10 20 or a hundred things
but what's too many if you have a
component and it can handle you'd think
the worst case is all
reasonably we net we wouldn't have more
than 500 things but how does it handle a
thousand two thousand even ten thousand
doing at just looking through your
applications and asking that question
can help you pinpoint problems so we
know we've got different customer sizes
and we found some problems how do we
design interfaces for too much data
throat well throughout my career I've
sort of found two main approaches this
isn't exhaustive but it's some common
ways that you can handle working with
lots of data or too much data the first
is to summarize or aggregate information
make things easier to work with so your
customers can review and move forward
the other way is to divide and conquer
so you've got too much data you can push
it away and let your customers focus on
just what they want so one of the
summarized approaches is dashboards and
dashboards are a fantastic way to
summarize large amounts of information
and dashboard design can be really hard
but there's a few things that you can do
to help you on that get started the
first one and probably the most
important is that a good dashboard has a
single purpose and a single audience
keep things simple one sort of one
purpose one audience and then you group
the related data together as best you
can and sort of build it up and it
becomes almost more important what you
don't show than what you do show and so
the example here is our octopus
dashboard this is the simple case but we
answer the question what's the status of
my deployment for a project in an
environment I care about and if you
remember the the large one this is still
an area we're working on closely rate to
that for summarizing information is data
visualization and simply put a picture
says a thousand word words and so you
can summarize vast amounts of
information if you look at a data set
think about how could you visualize some
of the information by using a chart a
graph an infographic or something like
that just some other way to represent
information this is a screenshot of a
github github account and if you look at
the little spark plug and graphs down
this
enter they're summarizing lots of
information and making it very easy to
work with so just by glancing if you're
looking at two different accounts or two
different repos you can see which one's
more active showing the number of
commits over time very very effective
and it's great thing to consider if we
move on to the divide and conquer
patterns octopus itself uses the show
pattern quite a bit and this is a
pattern where you push information to
your users and where it's where they're
working with a familiar data set
information there I understand but you
push all the information to your users
as much as practical and then you give
them tools to chop and change it so they
can focus on just what they want the
example here is the octopus deployment
process or a project deployment process
page where you add steps to define your
to define your deployment process that's
used when you execute deployments and so
we push all the different step types and
we offer or let our customers chop and
change it we give them the tools search
first and foremost we group data and we
sort it to put the most important
information at the top and secondary
information down the bottom and the
second group of information is further
categorized so it's easy for them to
browse but the search goes across all of
them and just makes it easier for them
to following the information there they
want to find last up is tables and you
might not think of using tables commonly
to handle lots of information but how
many times have you heard someone say if
I could only get this data into Excel I
could really work with it and it's that
familiarity that we're trying to
leverage so the example here is the
octopus project variable screen where
customers can enter in variables and
that are used when they do their
deployment and this can be hundreds of
items long in for lots of customers but
what we're doing it's a tabular data
structure and we're leveraging search
and filter and sort so it's familiar
they can zero in on exactly the
information they want get rid of the
information they don't
save and move on and so in summary we've
seen that customers come in different
sizes small medium large and the largest
can push boundaries of the application
we've explored how to find problems in
your existing apps and we by talking to
our customers as well as walking through
the applications ourselves and finally
we looked at designing interfaces for
too much data including summarizing data
as well as divide and conquer and that's
it
any questions I'll be around but thank
