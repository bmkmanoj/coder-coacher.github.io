work with Microsoft primarily creating
teaching materials for dotnet and
c-sharp the focus of this talk he is
going to be going open bringing c-sharp
out into the wild and how we're going to
be evolving the language from this point
forward so first just a little bit of a
recap from last year where we are and
what the really big goal is for the
c-sharp team and for my team helping
developers work with c-sharp
stack overflows most popular
technologies nice c-sharp is sitting
there in the fourth place we'd like to
be higher stack overflows most love
technologies once again we're in this
list interestingly the languages above
us in the most loved technologies
typescript is getting quite a bit of use
but a lot of them are and python is very
popular but a lot of the languages are
very niche very small communities one of
the things that we're really proud of
that we want to continue is c-sharp and
typescript which is quite a ways down
but c-sharp and typescript
are the only languages that appear on
both of those lists as of the end of
last year so we're one of very few
languages that are both used by a very
very large community and loved by a high
percentage of that community that's our
goal and our mission is to stay on both
of those lists and hopefully to move up
on both of those lists by keeping
c-sharp relevant keeping it modern and
investing in it in ways that help
developers build what we're building
today so here's a lot of what we're
gonna be going over today so I'm going
to talk about different things that we
are doing to be going open with c-sharp
open source open platform open language
API Kross IDE
open design and an open mind so that's
basically our agenda
I'll take questions throughout the talk
from anyone who has them if they're on
something I'll cover it later I'll defer
to that point but in general I'm happy
to take questions as we go let's talk
about open source the runtime for dotnet
is open source the framework is open
source the compiler is open source our
documentation is open source now you've
seen a lot of things whether it build or
other Microsoft events where we talk
about what we're doing in github so very
briefly as far as that goes in a lot of
what we are doing with documentation
we're also trying to bring that out into
the open and learn more about what
people are struggling with what
developers need to know where we're not
explaining things clearly one thing
you're going to see light up this week
is you've probably seen a fair amount of
confusion on the terms that framework
net standard net core net this net
everywhere and so on we've put a lot of
work into a new glossary to really
define those terms very clearly to make
it very clear exactly what we mean when
we say dotnet standard or die net
framework this is one that I'm working
on right now anything in the docs repo
which is Keep Calm Slashdot net slash
Docs where I'm looking at a possible way
of redesigning how most of the c-sharp
content is put together so I've already
got comments from a couple MVPs from a
couple of members of the compiler team
from Mads and so on this will probably
stay with this label of discussion for
another month or two to get more
feedback find out exactly what people
think of the idea refine it then we'll
start to build a planned around it so
we're doing this for a lot of the things
that we're looking at is we're going to
start by trying opening a discussion
going here's what we think we need to do
here's our proposal how do you like it
how can we refine it what we'll do more
to help others if you go to the dotnet
organization one thing I want to point
out for a group here internationally is
in addition to get up slash docks that
all of our localized versions of the
documentation are open-source as well so
if you're a non-native English speaker
if your preferred language is something
different and you find a bug in any of
the translations those are all open
source as well happy to get PRS or
issues on any of the translations so
everything we do is open source there's
also a button if you find something very
quickly if we look at the documentation
under Doc's like if I were to go to the
Torah c-sharp if I were to find a bug
here if I click on the edit button
it's going to take you directly to that
file in our github repo if you were to
hit edit make a change save it it'll
submit a PR for us so we want to make
that as seamless as possible for
anything that we might be doing
cross-platform c-sharp runs almost
everywhere it's really kind of nice with
xamarin we've run on iOS we run on
Android we run on Mac just in case
anyone's wondering we do still run on
Windows as well if you look at unity one
of the leading game engines 2d 3d game
engines massively cross-platform c-sharp
compiler runs there you may have seen
the network go down late here Monday
night Tuesday morning here when we
shipped dotnet core 2.0 and visual
studio.net core is a lightweight
platform server cloud workloads
Linux Mac and yes it does run on Windows
as well so c-sharp is available on all
those different platforms C sharp
everywhere we have this one dotnet
concept so this is one that still causes
a lot of confusion so who knows the
difference between done that standard
dotnet framework that's kind of what I
thought okay
it's a very briefly dotnet standard is a
contract anything that says we support
dotnet standard that's a set of api's
that should run on anything that says
it's dotnet dotnet framework is what we
would have historically referred to as a
dotnet framework that runs on Windows
and it implements dotnet standard okay
dotnet core so you've gotten that core
2.0 release implements dotnet standard
2.0 and runs cross-platform xamarin dot
Android for instance would be a an
implementation of dotnet standard plus
other things for Android that runs on
Android so for any of those
implementations it may and very likely
does include more than net standard
dinettes standard is the set of API is
guaranteed to be available on all
platforms okay now at the moment there's
a bit of an asterisk there because some
of those api's may throw not implemented
exceptions that's because we're trying
to move to get to this as consistent as
possible now the reason this is
important and the reason that standard
is important is for as many libraries as
we can especially nougat packages we
want to say that your dependency is a
version of.net standard so then you're
going to compile against dotnet sane or
2.0 and that means that the binaries you
create will run in an environment where
anything that implements that in a
standard 2.0 is running so if you take
that library or that nougat package put
it on Windows and a full framework app
it's going to run against that net
framework if you put it in a diner core
app it's gonna run against dotnet core
but your dependency is dotnet standard
yes
right mm-hmm I I don't believe there is
a timeline established for that the way
I like to explain it is there are we
think of four buckets for api's okay
first let's take an API that's all
managed code something like systems that
collections then that should run
everywhere so that's going to run
everywhere that's good that's the easy
bucket
now I'm really simplifying some of them
aren't easy but that's the easy bucket
there is a set of api's that are
implemented on all platforms but their
implementation is different so let's
take system dot IO works with the file
system a Windows file system is
different than a Mac file system so it's
some layer that's going to be different
implementations networking is a
different one the system networking
api's are built into the Windows OS on
Linux we take a dependency on an OSS
library to do HTTP and TCP and other
networking so the API surface is the
same the implementation is different now
we get to the two really hard buckets
where there's a fair amount of
discussion the first really hard bucket
is because in its original
implementation dotnet framework had some
windows specific api's there isn't
something like the registry on linux
those throw not implemented exceptions
in some cases we may try to implement
something underneath it that acts like a
registry for application only don't know
but those may for historical reasons
just continue to throw stuff why would
they be in the standard because taking
them out would break a lot of other code
that for historical reasons put things
in the registry so we can fix some
things remove some of the dependency
where a path goes through certain bits
of code but still has to compile against
something that might not be there the
fourth path that is a little bit tricky
is where it relates to reflection
okay so and in this path we have a few
different interesting things coming up
keeping dotnet modern if you think of a
device like a phone in an ideal world I
don't want to jet on my phone all right
because that uses battery uses memory so
on and so forth in an ideal world I
upload packages into the store that have
already been turned into executable code
compiled and I pull down those images
that means reflection won't be available
because they've already been compiled in
the metadata is removed so that's a
different engineering problem and figure
out what do we really need for
reflection and standard to do certain
things and what kind of things can we
live without so those last two buckets
especially get hard okay if you watch
the core CLR and core effects repos
you'll and especially the dotnet blog
when emo talks about these problems you
get a good idea where it's going so I
don't know that there's a timeline for
saying that no API and dotnet standard
will ever thrown out implementing
exceptions I don't know if that's even
something that is feasible okay but it
is for historical reasons to try to be
as backwards compatible as possible okay
other questions on dotnet standard and
where that parts going so now you can
all tell your friends and explain their
difference right secular cool okay going
open working with Rosalyn so Roslyn at
one point was a code name for the new
compiler it's now the API is to work
with things about that so we have syntax
trees and more the goal behind Rosalyn
and the c-sharp language engine also the
vb.net language engine is there should
need to be only one code base in the
world to understand c-sharp so if you
want to build an IDE or an editor if you
want to build Lin tearing analysis tools
code checking static analysis fixes
factorings source generation scripting
rebels maybe compiling you should be
able to use the Rosalynn api's to do
that one tree to rule them all builds an
expression tree let's go climate since
it's do that across ide omni sharp
project so it's a open source community
project leverages Rozlyn language
services and is used by all of these
editors in order to provide intel asan's
syntax coloring and so on in any of
those editors all leveraging Rosling
open design so language design really is
a conversation how do we want to extend
the language to make it easier and to
make all of you more productive using
c-sharp what things can come next you
know there's a discussion around this
where we have things that i'll hear
people in the community say oh gee
c-sharp it's already 7 it's mature lets
isn't it done yet no we think there's
some stuff it could be cool i'll show
you some of the things we're looking at
for c-sharp 8 in this talk get some
feedback on some of those ideas and
especially having an open mind c-sharp
started as an object-oriented language
there's a very interesting thing that
we're finding right now is that believe
it or not not every problem should be
solved with objects
who knew but it's kind of in the DNA
that c-sharp started that way so now how
do we break it out of just that paradigm
and make it a language we can use in a
lot of different ways in a lot of
different paradigms and yet not make it
the language that has every feature in
the world where you really wish stuff
was missing because then it's just hard
to use
going back briefly c-sharp with the open
language discussion there's a language
repository dotnet slash c-sharp lang
which is where language discussion goes
on so to the extent that you want to
participate offer feedback discuss
issues in there is if we look at the
issues list there are two really
important or actually three really
important labels to look at if we look
at the discussion label some of those
will be the language design meeting
notes comment threads on any of those
discussing different features to to stay
really close with is there is a proposal
label so these are the list of features
that are being proposed for language
design we got a page where it's 22
different open language design proposals
another one that's reasonably close to
that label is the proposal champion any
of these talk about exactly what will be
done and how things work so there will
be this template at the top proposals
added and you can see this one none of
these things have been done yet
proposed so proposals been added
discussed in the language design meeting
decision in the language design meeting
finalized so it's done rejected or
inactive if it's going to be worked on
is its fact for any of the proposal
champion this issue will track how that
features moving through the language
design process
many of those issues are going to have
fairly good lengthy discussions on them
participate as a feature you care about
if it's something you think would make
the language look really bad weigh in
with your feedback so where are we right
now and where are we going okay c-sharp
7.0 it's there use it who's been using
c-sharp 7 oh features come on people
let's go there's more fun stuff there
see c-sharp 7.1 our first point release
tiny features really small don't be
afraid of them it's okay it's there it
shipped dropped Monday I'm gonna be
demoing each of those features or at
least see the ones that we really have
code to work with seven point to the
next point release the features that are
targeted for that release from that
c-sharp lang repo safe efficient
low-level code think of now that unity
allows us to write cross-platform stuff
with this game engine game developers
really want to get some performance so
do some of the people doing ml or
artificial intelligence or other related
things we want to be able to write
low-level very efficient code but
because we're C sharp we want to write
it safely don't want to have to drop
down into C or C++ and go tracing void
star star pointers everywhere we've been
there we've done that it hurts it's not
fun c-sharp 7.3 maybe next steps for
pattern matching now we're starting to
get question marks you look once again
at that c-sharp language repo if I go
back to the issues page and I click on
the milestones you can see things that
have been set out here 7.2 Candidate
7 dot X so this might be another
seven-point release some other major
release
some other minor release a tow
candidates and so on c-sharp 8.0 major
features so here's a theme in this if
you look at the point releases the
features that are going to be added are
going to be small things that can be
shipped incrementally major release is
going to be c-sharp 8.0 at this point in
time the thinking is that the standard
and the language specification is only
going to be formally updated on the
major point releases okay or the major
releases seven eight and so on rather
than go through the standards work for
each point release doesn't mean the
features won't respect just means we're
not going to go through the whole formal
review and standards process so let's
slide over here let's start looking at
stuff that we can do with c-sharp 7.1 so
a lot of these kind of just tweak on
some things added in c-sharp seven so
what this application does as part of
our group working with Doc's we have a
meeting once a week where we triage any
issues any plans work for the
documentation website god-willing with
our network what this app does is it
goes out uses octo kit it's a dinette
core console application grabs all our
open issues run several different linked
queries and gives me the list of things
we do and this is basically the agenda
for our meeting issues that have no
milestones that means we haven't looked
at them yet
we're going to look at them figure out
where they go we have milestones based
on the month these are the things that
we intend to get done in August we're
probably a little bit behind there we do
things by quarter as well to have a kind
of a longer timeline of what kind of
things we want to do each quarter and
then we have the backlog bucket where we
look at thankfully there's no part
zero backlog issues which is good
probably one and pry to and then
anything that wasn't prioritized often
those are going to be things that might
be discussions where we're not ready to
start on yet so that's what the
application does right now it's written
in C sharp 7 has using most of those
features and what I'm going to do I'm
going to now convert this slowly into
adding some of those 7.1 features one of
the first ones is C sharp 7.1 supports
async main methods for council
applications because async in a console
app is hard the correct way to do it is
what I have written here where I'm
calling this private static async task
returning method I get it's a waiter and
I look at its result okay it's because
those are won't block the threads so I
avoid deadlocks and it forces waiting
code we've seen in the wild and we've
seen this question answered on Stack
Overflow several times is if I remove
this and I run this app I get a warning
and my program exited how come I started
an async task I didn't wait for that
task to finish my program exited so I
never executed the stuff that happens
after it comes back you can also get
into deadlock situations with this if
you're doing something where you block
waiting for another task to finish that
task tries to send a notification back
into the first context you can end up
with deadlock so this is something
simple the programmers can get wrong so
let's make a nice simple feature to make
it easier to use so I'm just gonna
remove a few lines right here
okay so now I have this static void main
which thankfully won't work and I'll get
to that in a second but if you notice I
now have red squiggles on any place
where I'm awaiting because I have not
turned on the 7.1 features and the error
message here says that the weight
operator can only be used within an
async method so on and so forth we all
know that okay fine so I'm gonna go
static async void I feel bad just doing
that but I got rid of all a fair amount
of my squiggles so we'll go ahead and do
a build and right now it says program
does not contain a static main suitable
for an entry point okay so now I've just
compiled this thing but there's no main
that fits in 7.0 that would be true so
I'm going to change this to tasks I feel
better already just returning a task
from an async method rather than async
void and now if we try to do a build I
still get an error it now says program
does not contain a valid entry point
okay well now we're gonna have to do a
little bit of actual work so right click
on our project node go down to the build
tab click advanced now here's one
important thing as we go into this world
of point releases with nothing in your
CS proj the default for this language
version setting is going to be the
latest major language version in this
case C sharp 7.0 so if nothing's in a CS
proj the latest major version of the
compiler on the machine you've installed
is the version that will get used to
turn on the seizure of 7.1 features I
can either set it to latest which uses
the latest c-sharp minor' version on
this machine or i could specifically set
it to c-sharp 7.1
say okay another new feature that came
out in Visual Studio is I can now edit
the CS proj we loading and unloading and
all that nonsense what got added was
this one property group condition C
language version latest cool
other versions I can set would be
anything all the way back to c-sharp one
and any specific version that the
compiler on this machine supports one
two three four five six seven and 7.1
now the reason for this decision and now
my squiggle should go away the reason
for this decision is if we think of CI
bills we think of building things in the
cloud and containers or any of any of
these new thing new workloads that we're
trying to do we would like to be able to
separate delivering the tools and
installing new tools with the version of
the language I want to use for a
particular project so now if I'm on my
machine where I have 7.1 if I load an
open source project and they're still on
seven oh I will get compiler errors if I
accidentally sneak in a seven point one
feature nice building the cloud the same
kind of thing from working with a
particular customer that's still on six
I can specifically set that project for
that compiler version and in my
environment even when I have the newer
bits installed the compiler will
validate to that version of the language
okay separating the between the two it
is just a setting in CS proj well I'm
using Visual Studio to show the IDE this
will work on core projects on the Mac
just modify it in an editor just like we
do with anything else one last bit on
this feature that I do like is if I
change this now to a sync void which is
bad we won't do that I do a build
I will now once again get an air
that I don't have a suitable entry point
the main method now must return either a
task or if your program returns an error
code an integral error code it can also
return tasks event so you can return
void int synchronous main task task
event asynchronous main anything else
will not compile and effectively what
the compiler generates is just like the
code that I started with if I go all the
way back to there it will generate a
hidden main entry point right that you
know main dot get a waiter so on and so
forth so that's our first fun feature
async made you that first bracket there
we go okay
second interesting fun feature is a
couple worthwhile changes involving
involving the default keyword if I take
this method right here which displays
the issues where I'm going to do a few
other changes to it as well if you see
the second parameter there I've got a
header string I want to print out if I
don't specify anything I say it's
default of string basically the null
string seems redundant to give the name
twice so let's just remove that and it
just equals default in places where
default of T the type can be inferred
the string header equals default works
very nicely one place where I really
really like this feature is it for a few
very interesting reasons we can't assign
var to a lambda or we can't declare
lambdas using the VAR keyword if I were
to try to change this from func of issue
bool to save our okay at that point it
doesn't compile because it can't figure
out what it is
because lambdas don't have type
information so it's I don't know what to
make it well if I have not declared it
yet if I were to separate it out for
whatever reason and I wanted to
initialize this you know this whole
default of issue func
of issue comma bool that's kind of an
ugly expression I've got the type on
both sides doesn't really add anything
so we'll just say equals default cool so
in any place where the type can be
inferred default keyword can be used
instead of default expression with the
type inside it
the third real interesting little tidbit
that we're trying to add is that we've
added is if I go back down to this
display issues you can see I'm passing
in that that lambda I'm now going to run
a link query and a my select I'm
creating a tuple which is a new 7.0
feature so this tuple where you see I
have number : issued that number title :
issued that title so on that's just the
tuple think of that is a very very
lightweight type that carries across
bits of data it has three fields named
number title and author which are number
and two strings integer and two strings
now for what the compiler does with
tuples that is magic is with tuples in
general the field names the type that's
used system value tuple has field names
item 1 item 2 item 3 and so on and so
forth those names don't have a lot of
semantics by specifying them here I've
given them those names in c-sharp 7 L
and C sharp 7 point 1 if the field name
can be inferred I can remove that
declaration and this will give me field
names number title and author what you
can see that I'm using here when I print
the message out okay if I switch back to
c-sharp 7.0 the field names would be
item 1 item 2 an author so again a small
little feature designed to mean that we
have a little bit less code to work with
a little bit less
have to type especially repeated things
to have to type question on that and
that shipped this is it all those
features shipped earlier this week makes
you sheriffs having a little bit nicer
okay questions I need those those are
the major features that came out in
c-sharp 7.1 the big key that we want to
talk to you on any of those is in seven
point one tiny point release it will be
turned off by default you will have to
turn it on by adding that Lang inside
your CS proj file and it will be on only
for those projects so now let's look at
some of the bigger ideas that are coming
for or planned for c-sharp eight at this
point what we have to say is none of
these may happen they're all in
discussion
these look like likely candidates but
this is not saying that these are the
features
the first one is async streams and
disposables they deal with two
particularly thorny problems than
asynchronous programming the first one
here is that if I am grabbing things out
of a database get people async I now
that this async innumerable I can await
it do things with those people inside
that loop it may actually do another oh
wait as it reads further in the stream
right if we think of either reading from
a file I might read the first thousand
bytes and I want to have to await for
more network traffic or more file
reading to get more things out this is
kind of ugly code in current async I
have to do a sync read a block fill a
block deal with it make another async
call and so on and so forth generate
some very thorny stuff so async stream
hopefully we can be able to await each
element if they're handed to us or await
blocks of elements async disposable this
is the other really interesting problem
if I write an async method if I write a
task returning method that does async
work and sometimes in that method I
allocate a disposable resource when do
you dispose of it it can be easy to
write code that accidentally disposes of
the resource before you're done using it
because you've hit in a weight he
returned from a method yeah exit a using
block so if stuff gets disposed you wait
for task finishes you go back into the
method and you're using a disposed
that's bad that's not good
so let's introduce this is ink
disposable interface so now I'm going to
await doing something I'm going to do a
bunch of stuff inside there I can await
anywhere inside this that I want and it
will only get disposed when I'm done
with the block that I'm awaiting on the
outside that using a wait adding that
new keyword there which says don't
dispose of this thing until all of this
stuff is done right simplifying that
resource management for async
programming okay I'm seeing some very
thoughtful looks here people have had
this book haven't you yeah hopefully
making that easier the idea of extension
everything so let's look at what this
code is trying to do and this is code
written as a demo of what the language
features would be we believe that the
typical use of this kind of construct is
going to be where we're not adding that
many methods here I might use typical
normal inheritance but where you might
just want one or two things to add to a
class to make a new class so here's the
idea behind what is designed here is we
have a person
and we are going to extend it by making
an enrollee in a class an enrollee has
one new property which is the supervisor
which is a professor but other than that
it has all the behavior of a person okay
and we're going to do it all with
extension everything's so first we're
going to make a static field just normal
static field we know how to do that
person professor we've got a dictionary
people - professors now let's look at
the instance constructor this is an
enrollee constructor but notice that it
says person but it's got an extra field
on it it's going to call one of the
person constructors and then it's going
to also call an instance method to
enroll and set the supervisor so if you
look at enroll this is a static instance
method that is an extension you see we
have the extension keyword on the class
definition enroll we're going to use
that static field to set this extra
property we can retrieve that property
from that static collection and we have
the static property to get all of the
students which is every single one of
the enrollees so we've built this whole
new class not by building a class but
just by using extension methods because
we can now have more extension
everything this one is my favorite one
quick show of hands who's does anything
with Jason type data some of you are
lying because I didn't see every hand up
here's the idea as we move more and more
toward this world where programs are
broken up in microservices I'm sorry I
did have to use that buzzword or broken
into other different services that talk
to each other we move further away from
that idea of object-oriented oriented
programming we said objects have
properties and all the methods and
transforms that work on them and they
travel together as
checked that is a quite work in this
service-oriented transferring data back
and forth between machines mode so well
so now we separate data and the
functions that work on them for some at
some of these end points so we find
ourselves building types that don't have
any behavior they simply store data one
way they simply store data we've used
two poles we can make simple classes
getters and setters or just get instance
and so on and so forth let's make it
really easy that declares a person and
it is a person that has two fields a
first and a last to believe their names
what the compiler will generate for this
class definition is something that looks
like this okay so we built a class
person the implements I equatable person
we've got to public get only fields
we've got a constructor that sets those
get only fields we've got deconstruction
so we can pull out just the first or the
last or deconstruct it into a tuple
they're deconstructed into variables and
so on and so forth we've got it equals
we've got an override of equals and
we've got an override of get hash code
where we're going to wave our hands and
say it's this great hash function that
the compiler will generate for us that
we don't have to ok and that's the idea
of what we will build for a record type
you get to type this and you get that
all of that sound like a big win
what's that sounds like f-sharp one may
think that the F sharp and C sharp teams
do talk to each other about things like
that and I think here here gets to one
of the the comments that I made earlier
that I think is really important about
how this is going to evolve F sharp is a
functional language that works in dotnet
so it can kind of use some
object-oriented stuff now and then to
deal with the framework but F sharps
syntax and the way you program at F
sharp is primarily functional c-sharp
sits at the other end of the table it's
primarily object-oriented that's how it
you know started that's what it was in
the beginning it does something things
in a functional way now in that link
being a good example reactive extensions
things like record types pattern
matching are starting to come into the
language but it probably will never be
the functional language F sharp is F
sharp is great as a functional language
but I still hate creating all those
types to do D serialization stuff so
this is cool okay so open for business a
little bit little final sections on some
of the things that we're doing in terms
of where we're going with different
directions that was a look at C sharp
eight and so on now you get to a lot of
the resources and things that are coming
up language strategy we have a couple
different blogs there on what is the
dotnet framework or got net manage
language teams strategy in terms of
where does F sharp go where does C sharp
go
where does vb.net go all three have
strong futures F sharp is used it's a
very functional language has some very
key constituencies in analytical
programming be a financial other areas
c-sharp is meant to be a very powerful
general-purpose language vb.net very
powerful general-purpose language
a little bit different community more
built on productivity so on see sharp
design as I mentioned there's the
github.com dotnet c-sharp language blogs
that MSDN this was from March new
features in c-sharp seven it's also now
covered under Docs our Docs repos github
calm dotnet slash Doc's ask us questions
participate there as well help us build
things that make it easier for you to be
more productive a couple I have grayed
out because they're not turned on just
yet but they're going to go live shortly
one thing we've learned when we started
the docs project the repo wasn't you
know really large repo it was the stuff
that we'd written when we added all the
different versions of all the different
dotnet frameworks clone can take a while
clone can take a long while on the
network like here at the hotel so we're
going to split out the API Doc's into a
different reference the Roslyn API Doc's
we're starting to tour with the idea of
how do we manage Doc's for all the
different nougat packages so we're
probably going to end up with more repos
there as well and then of course github
commnets left Roslyn that's where the
compiler lives some of the things to see
from the future there this is one of
exploring what c-sharp does internally
if you were to make this a little bit
larger see there we go is that a
reasonably large good a real sharp dot
io allows you to type any code or copy
or paste any code in the left-hand side
of that window and in the right-hand
side using Rozlyn you can take a look at
what it will generate and c-sharp and VB
what the JIT will do for actual assembly
you can see the syntax tree and you can
see it for either debug or release
builds so if you're ever very curious
about what different constructs
set up this is one good way to do it
final thing I want to show that in terms
of putting these together I took this
demo app and know this is fairly small
this is what 80 lines of code if I go
back into my property page here first
I'm just going to turn this back to see
sharp seven and point out a couple of
the errors there and there we go
come on dry start getting all our
squiggles for any place that I added one
of the new features the one I did want
to point out is here where I have the
tuples the field names now if you notice
number and title no longer have semantic
names the only way I could refer to
those is as item 1 or item 2 don't know
why I'm not seeing those as
there we go but in terms of how far
c-sharp has evolved just because they
can be everyone so it's fun to see if I
went back to C sharp one there's almost
not a line in here that does it make you
some something that's been added other
than our using statements any of my
awaits any of the link stuff any of the
generics it's been a pretty long fun
trip so far var it's all I think we just
grown quite a bit over the years
fine a little bit and reach me on
twitter at bill was published in march
so is certainly available the
publication date for more effective C
sharp is in August so if it is not
available today it will be very very
shortly effective CCRI reorganized all
100 items around different themes
release wise effective c-sharp covers up
through six more effective covers one
through seven on different themes the
places you'll find me as I will be it
and ask me anything this afternoon at
130 or 140 with Bart to Schmitt and
Richard Campbell which is always fun any
other questions on anything too sharp
related yes
yes why
I believe that is primarily based on how
CS proj parses it I think a typical use
is going to be to set it for all
configurations because I agree I can't
come up with any reason why you would do
it right right but even when you do that
now it writes the property group twice
or for as many different configurations
you have I think that is based on how
it's set up
I am gonna it might be just the visuals
let's try this let's this may be a
visual studio thing let's just try this
let's just change this to latest because
I'm pretty sure I've done this on core
but I put it in there so it's just in
the property group for everything if I
look here I'm not getting any errors
yeah that's a Visual Studio IDE thing so
I don't have to put it there that's just
what the IDE g-i
that that's what Visual Studio is IDE
editor generates so that was a great
question you can put it there I will
also I think I kind of glossed over this
that flag and cos project runs on Mac
and Linux and if you're on Mac future
studio for Mac obeys this flag but
doesn't have a UI to set it any other
questions yes
right I missed the last part desert
yes yes I will give you the order of the
tasks so if you look here once again the
labels here give a hint to a couple
things if you notice one and two are
labeled ISO one and ISO - those were
official ISO standards that effort
elapsed for a while and for a period of
time the ACMA c-sharp standardization
committee has been working on taking
everything from three four and five
applying it to ISO - and getting a
standard for c-sharp five okay that work
was taking priority over moving beyond
draft 4 6 and 7 because understandably
Mads a few other people who work on the
spec are in the Standards Committee as
well which I am a member of by the way
so the C sharp five official ACMA
standard is getting very very close so
the order of things that we are going to
do is send out the five standard take
the six draft which was based on the
Microsoft version of c-sharp 5 find the
changes to that apply it to the standard
5 and make standard 6 and so on and so
forth so the reality is we do have some
spec debt to pay off so beyond getting 5
Dunton which is soon I don't have a date
for the other things some of it will
probably happen in the open you know in
the c-sharp lang repo one of the things
that is
I thought there we go in the c-sharp
language repo one of the directories
there is yes I am hey wait there we go
in the c-sharp language repo one of the
folders is for the spec and that is the
C sharp six draft we are pulling that in
the dock so it's also published on docks
we'll be doing the same with every
update that comes out okay any other
questions thank you very much for your
time hope you enjoyed it and I'll be
around for lunch if you want to chat and
upstairs after lunch thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
