I think they deserve a round of applause
because they literally had to replace
her projector so thank you so much for
doing this I think the worst thing that
could have possibly happened in any
presentation has actually happened so I
expect my demos to be flawless and for
all of you to watch it and say oh
alright so for those of you who stuck in
here I want to say a big thank you for
sticking with me I think when you walked
into the room so this huge things like
this must be canceled so enough of me
blabbering and let me introduce myself
my name is Maria Naga and this is my
first time back in London in 15 years I
used to live here when I was little so
it's really exciting going back to my
old neighborhoods and it's really
exciting to be back in London and most
especially to be at MDC so if you have
any questions about any of the
information that I will be presenting
today and all you missed a link just for
to tweet me at Lady nough Gaga so think
of Lady gaga and then Agra guy it's kind
of easy to remember and it's a really
great way for people to know how to
pronounce my name so I really enjoy her
music you know okay
so Who am I so I am a program manager on
the visual studio.net community team and
we are a team of four people
my boss is next door like doing a demo
so everyone is there so thank you for
coming over here and every single member
of my team is responsible for different
things and the community team works with
the developers that we've been working
with for a number of years as well as
many developers and getting them excited
about the dotnet platform and I am
particular I focus on getting net new
developers excited about dotnet and C
sharp and F sharp so that's a pretty big
audience I'm also I think the only hack
artist who actually exists in the entire
world because I coined the term and I'll
explain what I do I like to put a frozen
iconic character so this is Wonder Woman
with an afro this is Amelia Earhart with
an afro
frida kahlo and Princess Peach this is
my most recent and after the talk I
actually have some stickers so if you
want to come and ask me a question I do
have the Wonder Woman stickers and I
think I have enough for every single
person in the room it's like Oprah well
everyone gets a sticker alright so thank
you for coming to my talk which it
starts with a search and this is really
my process on how we got dotnet and
c-sharp running in the browser and the
work that I did to actually push that
forward and convincing my managers on my
skip levels and why this kind of
experience is important so this all
started about a year or more ago I'm
kind of hazy on how long I've been at
Microsoft slash I don't want to tell
people so they'll figure out my age and
I remember I had been an evangelist at
Microsoft for four years and I just
joined the dotnet team and I had dinner
with my skip level who's my boss's boss
and I said why do you see me working on
and he was like many developers and he
said it was such excitement and he was
like dotnet course open source it's
cross-platform so we should be able to
get a whole bunch of brand-new devs onto
the platform and this will be excited
it's going to be super easy Maria don't
worry about it and the Evangelist in me
who is so energetic and excited said
absolutely that's not a problem
whatsoever go around the world do a
couple of workshops go to all these
places where people don't speak or do
donate and I will I will rock it and
then after he went away and I came back
to earth and I realized what this huge
thing was I went from absolutely to like
okay basically I went and I was
petrified I like I like say I was okay
I was literally petrified because when I
looked at all my peers and my friends
and my mentors and my mentees I was the
only C sharp dotnet developer and I only
got excited about dotnet because it had
become cross-platform and open source so
I knew dotnet from 2014 going forward so
those this hesitation do I have enough
historical context how can I start
having conversations and I realized that
doing workshops and doing talks and
doing
videos simply wasn't going to cut it so
I started to walk around and do a lot of
conversations and do a lot of research
and I reached out to a whole bunch of
different developers from different
works of life so if anyone has followed
me on Twitter they probably know I do a
lot of stuff with boot camps and I've
worked with them to build dotnet courses
from scratch I worked with non debt Don
non net devs at startups and different
companies to to see engage their
perspective or what the situation was
and what was holding them back and there
were a couple of things what's holding
you back from exploring don't near
Corinth C sharp and F sharp and there
were a couple of things for a lot of
people are like where the jobs and I
showed them the data of like look how
many dotnet jobs there are in comparison
to other languages or like okay how many
customers do have who are using dotnet
core I see a lot of things about it
being cross-platform and open source and
really really fast where I can get all
this information and there was one
consistent thing that came from startups
and hobbyists I knew devs and teachers
and it was always I don't know where to
start and this was a huge anchoring
point on how people think about and
learn how to code today so let's talk
about that right now
when you are teaching how many of you
have taught I don't net course or
c-sharp course or anything like that yes
Joan I have your book I wish I brought
you to sign the copy later and how many
of got this question of where do I start
learning how to code only one person ok
ok bill ok ok ok ok like there are a
couple of people where this is a
consistent one and how are people
learning how to program today how many
of you learned in school yeah ok ok sure
how many of you learned by yourself okay
that's a fair number how many of you
learn through community and online I
still do community and online right so
the way we learn new features right and
the way we explore new features is very
very very different today and it's
expanding
it is expanding before beyond very text
heavy documentation when you go onto a
site and they actually should tell you
what every single line of code does that
line by line before you actually write
your first land write your first line of
code it goes beyond copying and pasting
and we have these really great
documentation where like we're gonna
teach you how to build an asp.net
application over these series of blogs
and before you know it you have a fully
functioning form that people can go and
submit data to but a lot of people who
do do the copy and paste and are
teaching themselves how to code on their
own especially for brand new developers
if they hit a bug if they hit an error
they're not going to figure it out
they're going to try and start it right
from the beginning so something that
you've estimated to take someone two
hours takes them for six eight one week
and that's a huge commitment you have to
install the tools you have to know how
to do everything and sometimes I've
written blog posts where i forget to add
the using statements all the api's that
they require and then people get
completely and utterly lost and videos
only also doesn't work at all right I
don't think let me take that back videos
only work but it ends up taking a much
longer time than you think and this was
a really hard one for me to think about
because if you do watch any of the nba's
or getting started with asp.net core you
tend to you see my face around right and
we actually did those modules in a way
that it's supposed to take you 15
minutes but every single time I give
this content to instructors and brand
new devs or startups they say okay I'd
have to pause the video but since it's
15 minutes now it takes me about 45 an
hour two hours to get through the
content and get the application running
the way I would like so we're actually
expecting people to spend this huge
amount of time on actually running
learning new languages when you're lying
and exploring today it's more about the
ease of acquisition how quickly can I
get up and running as fast as possible
how easily can I write my first line of
code
without having to change my entire
device like I do not want to change my
dev environment I don't want to install
something as I'm completely committed to
the to the language and we have to begin
to think about the acquisition of
languages the acquisition of tools
that's why we're shorter in the visual
studio time in time that you can
actually install it that's why we've
created Visual Studio code that's why we
brought vias to Mac to actually create
an acquisition process that was better
for all and I want to give a really good
example as when I was a Technical
Evangelist in New York I went to
Columbia University and there was this
huge auditorium with about 200 kids and
this was during Windows 8 Windows Phone
x I think you guys can kind of see where
I'm going with this and they come in
they're super excited because I'm giving
away 3 X boxes and all of them want one
and I remember walking in and I was like
let's get started and then I just had
day and it was a choir of Mac's just
rolling through the entire auditorium
this is a beautiful auditorium so it
actually echoes and it sounds like a
melody and it's going line by line and I
was like ok we're gonna learn how to
build a Windows 8 or Windows for an
application even better you're gonna do
- I sounded like a Salesman on TV and it
was just like it was weird and I said
how many of you have windows and it just
went quiet I was like okay go get
parallels get go get boot camps I have
copies of Windows and I'm like yay we're
gonna get it done
two hours later how many of you have got
Windows installed and then you notice
that that 200 has been going down to 80
people and I was like okay how many of
you have Visual Studio no one so let's
go download Visual Studio in this really
bad Internet right at the University
three hours later
how many of you have Visual Studio up
and running the room is 20 people now
and I was like okay let's go in look
into the templates and pick the ones we
need how many of you actually install
the right workload and a lot of people
are actually installing C over C sharp
so they're like I can't see the
workloads
and then the obvious three people who
stick it out to the end get the Xbox so
we ended up losing people and we also
left a very negative perception of what
Microsoft is because what we're looking
for is the easiest path to happiness so
when I actually looked at all the
different things and I gathered all this
data and I looked at all the research it
was time for me to go and convince my
bosses my CV Pete actually invest
engineering time and money and pay a
huge cloud bill so we could start
experimenting on these things so along
with everything else I had to show some
data so I had to show them some of the
facts so I'm showing you the facts that
I showed them earlier last year this has
changed so I'm gonna pick the wine from
stackoverflow though a whole bunch of
data that I used so 90% of people are
partially self-taught so people love to
learn there's a general interest in
learning how to code 55.9% 56% of them
are willing to invest their money in an
online coding school so being able to
learn and write code right in the
browser and the next group of people are
learning on the job which is very
typical for a lot of us where you're
given a project or you join a new team
and your skills are changed or ramped up
so okay so you've shown me the data and
there are a lot of faces like that in
the room what does this mean and as you
can guess people have been writing in
droves to the Internet to go and learn
how to code and this isn't a new thing
everyone goes to the internet to get
information every single day but how
many of you for any language have always
typed something like this in a browser
of your choice of Google or Bangor you
know pick your best you've done a
tutorial tutorial and c-sharp you have
done something in expression trees even
something very specific copied and
pasted your error right there hoping
that someone on Stack Overflow has
answered it for you and the issue today
is that there's so many options and it's
it's it's a dog-eat-dog world out there
you had the video training how the
online
arian says you have the free code camps
where they give you such certifications
you have code pen which really isn't
designed to be a teaching tool but I
personally have used it several times to
teach people workshops especially when
it comes to HTML or JavaScript and it's
all about first impressions so I'm going
to walk you through the feelings that
people get when they walk through their
documentation so that's that in a good
place
the yay moment the excitement javascript
calm which is owned by pure sites which
used to be owned by : a it's a whole
story has this really good thing where
they actually walk you through how to
build your very first JavaScript
application from the moment you land on
the screen you're writing your name
you've done your first screen of your
first string and you're just like what
is this you're given instant
gratification you have that moment of
success and within about 15-20 minutes
people are writing their very first
functions and are ready to actually
transition into an editor with the first
impressions it's about easy to find like
you type in something and find that
first thing that you its Hank Reilly you
find exactly what you're looking for
it's easy to navigate JavaScript calm is
a great example because you don't click
on any single thing you're actually
going through the workflow and ending up
where you need to be at the end it's
easy to understand like anyone could do
this I have shown it from my
seven-year-old niece to my uncle this
weekend
who's 55 and they was just a broad
understanding of how they easily adapted
to this and it's the immediate success
the moment someone hits your
documentation they feel like they can
move to the next step the next moment is
got it that moment where you understand
how all those different pieces come
together and I'm going to use the
example of code pen a lot of people
always told me when you're teaching
people how to do HTML Javascript and CSS
one of the biggest hurdles they face is
seeing the immediate results and also
seeing how all these different elements
come together
how does my JavaScript impact my HTML
how does
ss make my page look pretty and this is
an example that was created by Lloyd
James that I've used several times at
code schools and our of codes and it
gets general excitement because they can
see immediate results and get that
instant gratification
it's a click moment for people in teams
when I have a situation and I don't
understand how something's working I can
send someone a pen and they can send it
back to me and say ok this is a generic
mistake and this is how you can fix it
so it's being used for different things
and to solve different situations
this gives people success in the browser
it encourages experimentation it
encourages the easiness of learning it's
also really really good for sharing now
the last one is you know I'm genuinely
worried by what I see but the
documentation that gives you worried and
there are many examples of this and and
I like to call them the golden oldies
I've done this presentation in front of
people born in 2000 and they're like
what what is that in the corner I was
like that's a cassette we used to wait
for music and press record like guys go
to youtube we had to wait for our
favorite songs to come on and there are
so many people who do this but I always
say start at home and we've done great
improvements to this but if in the past
when you could looked up a c-sharp
tutorial the first thing that you would
hit is this and it's from 2003 and the
first thing you see at the top is this
document a document is archived and is
not being maintained so whenever I would
go to code schools and go to boot camp
and they'd say ok I'll go and start
building my courseware and they would
see the old documentation they would
just walk away walk away from the entire
situation how many of you have gone to
documentation it's been way too much way
overwhelming maybe old and you're just
like I'm done right I'm done and I
remember walking with this good camp in
Colorado an amazing boot camp where they
actually gave free lesson
to every student who doesn't have
financial aid at all and I love this
school I was like I was so excited about
them signing up because Colorado has a
huge amount of Nadezhda he's like I
can't teach this course because when I
see old languages and I see that
Microsoft isn't updating their
documentation it shows me that you're
not investing in the language and it's
like I can't I can't invest didn't and
he just walked away from building the
dotnet course and I was like okay so the
problem with all documentation and the
worried feeling is there a couple of
things the documentation will be old it
will be text heavy where it's just too
much text before anyone actually writes
a line of code
there's assumed knowledge where people
are constantly referencing older older
versions of the language or referencing
api's if you have no idea about and it's
expensive it takes a lot of time for
people to actually narrow down and find
the documentation that they need to get
started so it's all about creating new
experiences right now and after I showed
this to my team and I I told my bosses
that we need to make a change they're
like here's an engineering team go make
it happen so what I want to tell you is
what we've been doing to create new
experiences and the different steps that
we've been doing and the experiments
that we've been running to actually go
forward so first of all the first thing
that we wanted to look at was exposure
how are people being exposed to the
language so everyone is doing it
JavaScript Haskell Kotlin go all have
these really great experiences a moment
that you land on the page you are
interacting with the language
immediately redhack made a commitment
and both code and MV which is an online
editor to encourage developers to start
experimenting with Red Hat more in the
browser
step 2 is creating the learning
experiences how do we get people
successful and learning the things that
they need to do in the browser a good
example of this is code school how many
of you have
or heard of code school right code
school you watch the videos you interact
you actually have a light debugger right
in the experience you're notified when
you're making mistakes so it's like
beautiful mix between the video and the
online editor with instructions and tree
house has the same thing and when you
actually talk to these people cuz I had
conversations with it that you have a
higher retention rate than their other
competing companies that are doing the
same thing because of the mix of both of
things and the third one is
experimentation being able to create
great experiences in the browser where
people can start experimenting and
sharing of code and that's how we came
up with try dotnet so I didn't name
tried or net I went on vacation to you
guy and I came back and was tried at net
and people are picking it up which is
great I tried at net is a great way to
learn explore and sure dotnet without
ever having to leave the browser and
that's what we set out to build and what
we are building right now is we want to
try to net with Microsoft and build
wagner's in the room and he has been a
great in the back go out there and he
has been really great in creating those
experiences for us where he's been
leveraging what we've been doing we try
to net and with containers and being
able to compile C sharp in the browser
making sure that it is as fast as people
expect it to be locally dealing with our
unhandled exception errors and our
containers being overwhelmed and timing
our errors so bill thank you for all
your hard work so that is really console
applications the next step is learned
net with c-sharp imagine being able to
do model views and controllers and being
able to actually run it right in the
browser and see the updates as it comes
thirdly learned on net with your
training providers so it's one thing if
Microsoft creates great documentation
but I want to make sure that every
single dotnet documentation online has
an interactive experience other things
that we want to do is engage in net
content everywhere so in the near future
anyone who has a dotnet blog we don't
net code samples you will actually be
able to embed
in your blog and people will be able to
run the samples they won't be able to
edit it they'll be able to run the
samples which is great and finally being
able to share and collaborate with
dotnet being able to tweet it out and
people are able to run it run your
tweets as a snippet that is where we are
going
Wow did you just kill me yes we are
we do have a demo like that at the end
and we built it Tuesday night so yay
right but yes we will be having that as
well so before I go in and show you what
we're doing I had to say a huge thank
you to all the people who have been
building try it like dotnet experiences
on their own in their free time and if
you know anyone please feel free to go
to our github page and just plop their
name in there because they've just been
doing a stellar job and we need to have
more dotnet experiences everywhere all
right so let's do some demos
I'm usually a lot smoother than this so
don't judge me right now okay yeah okay
let's do this can you all see that okay
should i zoom in a little bit more is
that good
yes no yeah okay so the wonderful author
of this document is in the room bill
Wagner and this is a QuickStart tutorial
so it's really focused on getting people
have no experience with dotnet or
c-sharp whatsoever and having them go
through the series of steps right here
in the browser so this is something in
the past that would be written similarly
but we'd expect you to have an editor
online we'd expect you probably in the
old days to be on them on Windows or
have Windows running in an instance and
it's supposed to take a series of 28
minutes for new people it usually takes
me about 2 minutes because I'm usually
like copying and pasting and demoing
this but I want to show you what we've
done so this is running your first
c-sharp program you can copy the code
over here and paste it run and it's
hello world right there in the editor we
also have intellisense as well because
this is all using Monaco and these are
features that if you use it you can turn
it off and on so let's test this out and
see what happens if I do something like
this right it actually hits an error
does it automatically say okay we're
just going to put some imaginary
quotations and make it a string for you
the person will actually be able to have
this simulate experience they would if
you are running locally on their machine
we're not hiding anything
oh this smiley face over here oh that's
really just feedback it is just feedback
so the user can go through a series of
steps information gets more heavy as you
go through and it's that rich experience
so this is something that exists today
and people can start leveraging it
another one that we have that had people
go completely crazy when it was added
was in our API Docs so you read through
these API Docs just like okay how does
let's see
you'll notice a run button on a couple
of them so I could just run this and it
gives me an output now this is cat yeah
it just gives me an output so your API
documentation is coming to life and when
Bill tweeted this we went a bit crazy on
the Internet
like people my inbox was full and I got
like a hundred followers that's brick
for me of people asking when they could
start leveraging this experience we also
have tried Annette in its raw form so if
you go to and this is a really you know
don't judge me on the URL it's try dot
do T dot any T I know I know it's
terrible it's a terrible terrible
terrible URL I this is what isn't in
what you would use on is embedded iframe
that you could put into your
documentation you can use this as your
playground when we first launched this
page the most common URL that got
requested was tried dot dot net slash F
sharp and that just showed that's okay
we need to do an F sharp experience
immediately so that is coming it is in
our roadmap I run the code already but
like you can run the code put the output
in there you go the next page I want to
show you
is tri-dot net slash our docks now this
is pretty ugly now but I am actually
working on building a better page but
well I could have step-by-step on how
you can start embedding this in your
documentation but everything in blue
over here are features that we have
added to try the net so you can start
setting your own custom themes and what
you want to do you can set your code you
can actually start adding in things
within Monaco
they are a lot of challenges that we
faced and we've noticed one of them is
try to net in the browser is not in our
mobile browser it's not great so we have
to actually walk on this because most
people who are looking at this looking
on they're looking at this on their
phone and that is our biggest complaint
so far and as someone who comes from I
grew up in England from Uganda I come
from a developing world where everyone
uses the internet on their phone they do
not have internet at home this actually
showed me that this is something we need
to do immediately and we've got
complained not only from our customers
and people are trying it's like in Kenya
Uganda Nigeria of like I can't see this
on my phone we've got this from people
in Australia we've got this from people
in Singapore from Hong Kong or just like
I need to have this experience another
known issue with Trident net is that
it's currently not running in Safari but
we noticed yeah but we are working on
figure we have a couple of security
issues there that were working on as
well so let me go into our next demo and
we are going to do something with Twilio
so I am going to be using the tweeny or
API and this is running locally I have
my agent and my orchestrated running
locally on my machine and I am going to
use a Treaty of API to send a text and I
actually need a volunteer otherwise it
will just look that I've done this
earlier so first thing I'm going to do
is grab my code because I'm not going to
code in front of you that's terrifying
I'm not there yet
gotta grab that
there we go please don't steal my API
key and I have to add someone's phone
number manually so do we have a couple
of volunteers who are willing okay let
me grab your number okay okay there you
go okay
seven nine seven mmm so it's gonna give
you send you a code and if you could
read that back to me
all right
so let's get this a try any other takers
let's make this fun alright alright so
let me just go back over here oh it's
this number okay Oh - OH - six zero Oh
today today was it wrong okay let's go
back let's do that again
- six Oh
I'm not messing up your international
rates I'm
fingers crossed and toes okay
any other takers I want to test if this
works for bill are you and I you are you
joining in on the fun
okay okay nine seven seven nine okay
I'm please changing numbers once this
video goes live just joking
oh it's calling you sorry let's do that
yeah let's try that
is this your number okay let's just
let's run this and fingers crossed you
should get a text alright I got a text
but you didn't get a text wait let's see
let's try it this way
a one-way between that the zero okay oh
right here Oh seven zero one five there
we go that okay let's see
maybe doesn't eat the plus okay let's
try zero zero no luck
okay hold that no I think I grabbed the
wrong number
is this yours maybe it'll work let's
give it a try
all right how many people got texts yay
okay think clap please capped I'm sorry
if you're American you kind of got the
please clap reference maybe you got it
because like okay it's mean for me to
setting' during the election last year
which is really bad to talk about Jeb
Bush was at a talk and he said something
and no one clapped and he said please
clap so I feel doing that is the tiny
little demo and what this is showing is
this is our team's way of getting to a
state full experience and saving
sessions
we're also pulling in external API so
you can see we're using video we are
using Newton soft we're actually using
external API sand you get packages and
this is just the start and something
really really small it's nothing really
really big so we're really excited about
that sing so we did that yeah sorry that
was supposed to be their thing so again
that was supposed to a point where I
suppose say I hope you this is brilliant
okay so things that we are working on
right now with Trident net and getting
it to the next place because now we've
realized that we've gone beyond just an
experiment and that's always a scary
time within a big company and so I was
like you have to start producing revenue
or you have to start moving forward so
things that we've been walking on
Trident net is wine we're finally
sitting down with our engineering team
and we're figuring out how our Trident
net roadmap I was going to talk more
about the architecture today but we
changed it last minute last week we
decided to go in a different direction
what an unsession based work so being
able to actually come back to a session
and start all over again or being able
to push it to a github repo and we'd
actually provision that for you if you
actually supply us with your github
information and go back and forth we're
working on multiple file support so
being able to do Envy's
see or razor pages right within the
browser streamlining for acquisition
right now acquisition process is a
little bit messy yeah tÃ©a's iframes you
have to whitelist your your URL
we're actually streamlining it so you
can actually easily grab it and go and
also provisioning the containers for you
as well and Azure so we're creating some
work with our elastic pooling and we're
also improving our documentation because
from my entire experience I realize
documentation is literally everything so
for more information on trident neck you
can go to our really lengthy i should
have got an A kms link when I think
about this you can go to our page which
is try dotnet God actually I was really
bad to say try dot DL T dot n et / Docs
for more information if you see anything
missing or some features that you would
like to see please feel free to tweet me
at any point and we will work on that if
you have any suggestions if you see any
issues our issues have really helped us
push the product father go to our github
page which is github.com slash dotnet
slash try and continue to see the docs
give the docs team yeah
yeah yeah and that's I don't know if you
guys get the slight afterwards do they
get the slights afterwards they do okay
so you guys without yeah so you have
access to all the links I'll make sure
to embed them and correct the URL so
it's local to England and thank you so
much and let's open it up for questions
before I give you stickers okay that's a
really good question so one we are
really relying on the docs team to kind
of help us build with any of the
companies that we're doing to actually
create those experiences and set those
expectations another thing that we're
working towards is also transitioning
people from the browser to an actual IDE
so it does not stop here we're going to
also limit what you can do we try not
net as well to show them that the
limitation and what they need to learn
next those are the tiny things that
we're doing we're not going to go and
big build a debugger because that way
we're actually creating an editor online
I don't know if that really answers your
question
oh yeah now that is okay now I get it
that is a huge issue not only learning
in general even with people in boot
camps who have not had a traditional CE
s degree there are a couple of programs
that people have set up so instead on
what companies are doing what people
should be doing individually so
Microsoft for example has a program
called leap which is basically the
transition between graduating from a
boot camp and our people familiar with a
boot camp ok I'm going into the job
market and leap is about teaching those
skills of understanding algorithms and
understanding security and actually
building particular code bases and
actually have to go and build visual
studio for like three months before they
actually start interviewing for a job on
the team because what you tend to find
is someone will know how to build an app
like they'll know how to build an
Instagram or they'll know how to build a
version of an e-card but they won't know
how to do anything beyond that so we
have to set expectations on what their
limitations are and it's a
responsibility or a lot of training
providers to do that as people who are
teaching people keep to the basics right
encourage people to ask questions when
they can I'm not a supporter of too much
of historical references right in the
beginning like telling someone you have
to know the history of dotnet before you
build the first doughnut application but
having those conversations back and
forth and setting those expectations is
pretty it's pretty high that's a
difficult one that's actually a really
difficult question that we struggle with
yeah
it is hard like I I've had the same
conversation with people who do like
JavaScript's getting big and the
JavaScript frameworks that people need
to get up and running like you learn
angular 1 and then it becomes irrelevant
and then angular 2 is different from the
other versions so yeah it's a huge huge
disparity any other questions well you
sold Oh Oh beg your pardon uh I could
but I have a feeling that my engineering
team would kill me because they don't
share the information yet but we also
made some changes to the way we scale
the backend so anything that I shared
today would not be accurate to what
we're doing currently with a new pool
yeah but we we have a blog post coming
out in two weeks that is going to
describe in as much detail as possible
on how we are building and scaling the
backend and how we're leveraging Azure
and containers to do that so we're using
a lot of darker and kubernetes to do a
load of spinning up of the pools and the
containers any other questions so we are
going to open source at some of it
because we do want the F sharp committee
to go and build their version of it so
open sourcing the agent would be huge VB
and once we have a strong foothold in
those languages everything that start
net based maybe will explore what it
looks like for other languages as well
that are supported in our editor and
visual studio experiences but yes it's
coming
yes we can definitely we've had a couple
of requests for that so yes that is
something you can do any other questions
any any feedback yes this is exciting
okay thank you so much for coming for
being patient for letting them work on
the stuff in the back and if you have
any questions and want to talk to me are
we here I think we have the room for a
couple of a few more minutes okay and I
also have stickers if that helps and
they're really very nice everyone you
can get one okay thank you so much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
