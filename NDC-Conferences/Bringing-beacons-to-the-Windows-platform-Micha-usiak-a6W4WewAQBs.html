name is mija woo Shack I I came here
from Sweden although it's a bit
complicated story I really like this
picture this picture from international
space station and it shows my both
current homes right now we're somewhere
around here an original I come from here
from northern Poland and now I live in
southern Sweden if some people say it's
technically Denmark yeah I work for this
company we're consultancy focus mostly
on dot net projects and also web
projects we also like to say that we
create value by sharing knowledge and we
try to not only be like consultant hired
by hours but also like consultant
consultants that we like help our
clients reach their goals and share our
knowledge with them and organize
knowledge activities and so on we're
mostly based in Sweden if you came here
because you said he read something about
bacon that's the wrong talk we're going
to talk about beacons and beacons are a
small bluetooth low energy devices that
that you can use to add physical context
to your mobile applications how many of
you have do anything close beacons so
far okay how many of you know what
beacons are all right cool I seen this
before when I just talked two weeks ago
so I changed a little bit and much more
about becomes much less about windows so
you get a grasp of what they are and how
we can use them
so let's roll back a bit and talk about
Bluetooth Low Energy first blue flow
energy is also like marketed as
Bluetooth smart and it's part of blue
240 specification and it's not your
mother's Bluetooth that you have to pair
that was very slow and has very low
range bluetooth low energy works more
about on a on the basis of broadcasting
so there's a there's one device that
broadcasting and your other that can
reach out to them there are also like
sense of pairing and you can also do it
and you have G ATT services like what
normal bluetooth but we're going to
focus more on broadcasting part of
middleburg low energy here today and
technically I saw in specification that
they say they round up 200 meters my own
experience it's more about 70 or even 50
enclosed spaces you'd use the same
frequency as ours normal Bluetooth also
as the Wi-Fi and the microwaves and the
reason microwaves use them is because
water resonates onto performing and mega
Hertz or gigahertz gigahertz yeah thank
you gig art and this causes some
problems with becomes because bottles of
water like disturb the signal and humans
are big walking bottles of water if you
look at it
so they kinda there will be some
problems because we're very crowded
spaces yeah so let's go to becomes they
were like the technology like a flute of
lower injury was there a couple years
ago already or even more it was like
cool I love energy was co-invented with
Nokia and few other companies and but it
was got really much more traction when
Apple came with something they called
ibeacon which is a nothing else than
just specification how the pockets look
like and how they should be interpreted
and
as I said you don't really have to pair
with those beacons and primarily what
they do they just broadcast few bytes of
data and what you do if this data is up
to you so so they cannot track people
but you can make up like use the data if
within your app to track what people do
so for example you set up in space like
this my 46 becomes and they broadcast
some data basically identifiers and your
app is aware where those identifiers are
physically located because you deployed
them it by yourself and based on those
like signals you can triangulate and
provide into a location without their
place or you can provide information
that I'm close to stage and display some
information based on that and so on yeah
it can also broadcast additional data
this really depends what producer put in
there for example dos those are my
favorites they were made in poland and
they were pretty quick to market they
have temperature sensor and also a
accelerometer and yeah so basically they
know if they're in the move for example
or how hard it is and they have another
feature because you can like switch of
them by turning them upside down for a
saving battery for example you can do
any office but it's quite useful if you
do it for deployment and you just don't
use them all the time
yeah they can also be updated over the
year because they can receive some data
we'll talk more about imputed data too
because later because there are some
other possibilities and they usually
battery-powered although that's not the
case and they could be much smaller if
not the battery usually battery
determines how big they are those
batteries again theoretically are for
two years I managed to run them down in
a few months so i have to like open up
and switch the battery but they come in
very many form factors they're like many
producers and they made them in a lot of
shapes there are different sizes there
are beacons that are like socket powers
we connect them to electrical socket and
you don't need to care about battery
there USB dongles that you connect into
speed there are key rings and so on I'm
going to apply a short video from from
producer of those beacons that they
explain few use cases how you can use
them in real life so let's go
smart beacons present relevant
information to your device based on the
context of where you are now in android
and iOS 7 your device scans running
nearby beacons in the background as you
move around and when you want info about
something you're near it's ready to
swipe on your notification screen so if
you take out your phone as you pass a
new restaurant you can see their lunch
specials or menu reviews
since your phone knows that you just
arrived at the table with the red beacon
the menu will be ready when you pick up
your phone so if you're in a hurry you
can send your order straight to the
kitchen you can have beacons at home too
so if your context of the kitchen and
you're near the fridge your shopping
list will be ready and waiting when you
look at your phone and then when you
walk by the beacon of the dairy aisle
your phone can give you a reminder to
make sure you don't forget to pick up
milk
and because the range awareness for
beacons is sensitive down to a few
inches it can tell what's your closest
to or what product you pick up so when
you look at your phone it'll already
show product information or let you know
if your sizes in stock or let you see
what other colors are available
and then you can order it right from
your phone
and if you win at the restaurant for a
while your phone will be ready if you
want to order another drink or pay the
check with a push of a button
your phone is always with you smart
beacons give it some context
yeah this guy didn't pay me for that I
just really like their product just a
disclaimer so let's not move to let's
now move a little bit to technicalities
and what exactly is transmitted and what
use you can make of it that's how a I
pick on the format a bucket looks like
it's a African or 26 vice or something
like that we go through all of them
basically first two are just indicator
it's a Apple Apple manufacturer ID it's
like normal in the beacon standard you
have manufacturer ID and some flags on
the first two bytes then you go to a
what type of data you have and how how
long is it and those things are those
things are fixed for ibeacons then you
have uuid which is like identifier and
they have two other identifiers major
and minor so this is like what you're
going to use mostly with the ibeacons
you will use those three identifiers for
example you see oh let's say you run a
cafe in Oslo that's part of a bigger
chain so probably all have the uuid for
for your whole chain like I don't know
NDC coffee and then you'll have a first
major ID for like coffee I a coffeehouse
a located spectrum and some become
located at once similar space will use
some minor ID or you can use some other
idea basically those like three
identifies that for your up to you to
use and how you interpret them it's
pretty much up to you those are the the
one case I show is just one of the
suggestion most commonly
suggested and yeah and as I said based
on this part you're up can oh I received
this ID which means that the person
using the app is a new displays let's
show them this notification or this
context or something else and the last
part is a TX which is measured power so
device and also information with how
much power they're broadcasting because
thanks to that you can calculate
actually how close you are to the beacon
because you can know you're somewhere
within 50 meters of beacon or dirty or
70 depending on the power settings but
it's usually not enough information for
you to give any real and context we also
want to know how close we are usually
and the other thing you you know like
when you receive the packet your your
device will show you how how strong was
the signal you received so we have to
information how strong signal should be
1 meter from the device and how strong
you received that and based on that and
some muff you can figure out how far you
are right but I'll show you later that
does all bit shaky but that's the basic
math for that so basically eres SI is
this received signal that's the formula
for that and n is a constant you use to
is usually how you use it in a empty
spaces like out considered is pretty
much empty space you'll other I think
you have to bump it up higher yeah it
makes sense to and
if you have like more abstractions it's
a lot of like trying and failing because
you can't really figure out what will
bring how much distortions you probably
have to like when you like deploy
becomes into space you put them you have
some idea how they should be and then
just adopt slowly to make better
solution it is this distance in meters
so when you like Turner out this formula
you get the formula for for distance in
meters and also what I mentioned well if
you have like more because in space
technically three is enough to do
triangulation as the name suggests four
or more is better and the bigger space
that the more because you will need to
like cover the area to have a good
precision of indoor location now let's
talk about other solution or
implementation it's google's eddystone
that came last year as a response to
apple's ibeacons and they have more
frame time so you don't only have like
one identifier type that the 1i beacon
said but you have few other types of
data you can broadcast this is a this
one is really cool because you don't
really need up for that you just have
broadcasting URL so so using ibeacons
force you to your customers to have your
app for example for your cafe but what
if you don't have what they don't have
those up installed so Google came with
that which is broadcasting URLs and it
also ties to their concept of physical
web you know we have also internet
surrounding us
so let's say you come New York FA you
don't get some random and notifications
that your phone doesn't really
understand so you wouldn't even get them
but you get pop up with with URL and
this works fine on Android and what they
did on Apple is really really smart
because they put it in all their
applications so if you have google maps
google chrome google anything on your
iphone you'll get that too which is
pretty sneaky whether i like that
there's also a dastan you ID which is
the same concept as I become the format
is slightly different because they have
to level of identifiers but the idea is
the same so on and there is telemetry
which allows you to do few things first
is like you can give have packets that
send information about health of your
beacons which makes a like fleet
management easier because all fine line
you have to like deal with three or two
big runs in your room but if you deploy
six thousand beakers to the airport it's
not that fun to actually maintain those
and they also send like some beacons
have additional sensors I I mentioned
that so those packets also used to send
information from those sensors which
makes much easier available then
actually have to physically connect them
and get those sensor data to GA TD
services because that's how it works
with apply beacons
and and right now I think it's good
there is some competition and there are
a few other proprietary packets for a
for beacons and I think like Apple will
probably follow URL format and so on
which I think it's good example
application that I I've seen done to use
ibeacons mostly like museums it's like
indoor location or showing some
information about what you're actually
seeing getting links and so on but a
very cool application I saw was a guide
for a visual impaired people to go
around museum and like telling them what
they're saying and saying and what their
can experience retail space is a pretty
big because there's a lot of monitor so
retailers are would be really happy to
know we're actually spend most of the
time in the shop and so on this is
really like I think it's not really good
for customers I mean who'd like to be
tracked so the business models who
should probably include some
gratification for people also that
they're using an app so there are some
coupons and so on airports are pretty
big in this I know like he drove in
spiked with beakers and british airways
is using them in their apps and that
there are many other airports that
trying out of this also stadiums i know
that the barcelona stadium in in in
barcelona is it's also full of becomes
they actually posted a blog post
yesterday about a remote the producer of
the beacons so really interesting
because they was also telling a lot of
about issues they have with placing
beacons and different heights and so on
public transport is something I've been
working with in recently so ideas like
you get to the bus and you get
automatically started your trip and when
you get out of bus you get your bus trip
stopped and you get charged
automatically and so on so things like
that also I heard about some uses in
health care so on there are some beacons
in rooms of patients and when doctors
run around to get information that
something is wrong and so on that's
connected it's really experimental and
didn't see like real life application of
this but I've seen some demos of that
and it's also probably interesting and
how automation is too like one those
example and that's people who are like
nursing IOT that's what first they do
these spike their homes with our dueños
and cables and stuff and they have their
coffee pots connected I haven't seen
anything that was really sensible but
there are a few things funds you can be
for example a lot of those smart light
bulbs can connect with St mode and give
you some things working on together so
or with other becomes too and the i also
told about like inputting data and
basically custom data for beacons so as
we mentioned there some ways that you
can like connect over the air to beacons
and get the data from sensors and there
are some custom as the case that makes
it harder to do on different platforms
it's fine it's all fun and then
different android and iOS but then
things get slightly complicated
like this one because that's that's
something we've been working on last
month and that they have gpio input and
you can send data over you art and
create own packages so pretty much we
have solution that sends custom packages
due to our application and it's based on
some external factor from some external
devices connected to its one using the
actual public transport area so the idea
is that the beacon is connected to bus
but we simulate it with or to the train
but you simulator with raspberry pi for
now and the client tries to use location
with GPS but it didn't work well in in
like big cities with skyscrapers and
underground but their their trains have
the data where they are based on some
other things and they want to connect
those beacons to the trains or buses in
the future and just send the information
about where you are and some other like
messages for example about traffic
abstractions so on so that interesting
concept and there are also ways to
manage your fleet through fleet of
beacons to cloud services there's also
want sneaky things that that's that's
been done because let's assume you have
like beacons deployed all over some
Airport you don't really want to go like
physically within one or 50 meters to
everyone of it just to update them so
what can do you can set the updates or
some settings changes in the cloud and
then everybody who actually use up that
based on SDK of beacon vendor or or use
their apps will will basically be used
as a way to carry up the updates so
it's like very distributed way of use
your customers to update your beacons
also very sneaky so I have liked it very
much so yeah let's move to a main topic
of today which is a beacons and Windows
Phone i I've been using Windows Phone
for three years now and I'm also using
iOS for some time and when I first like
heard about beacons I was really like
excited okay let's let's bring it
somehow to windows because it should be
easy and it wasn't because first of all
none of the major vendors officially
supply with support Windows Phone I mean
why would they it's like so so small
market and but the hard words they're
like oh higher and Lumia said that the
radios that supported bluetooth low
energy after all it was Nokia's
inventions so why wouldn't they put it
in that the problem was software because
windows 8 on the computers has some has
some ways to deal with Bluetooth 40 and
like with much of a pain you can
actually do something with because you
could receive those signals and a very
low level talking too hard or pretty
much with Windows 10 but there was like
no support on unlike phones because
there was some difference between a PS
only those eight the windows 10 the
api's are consistent and their support
bluetooth low energy on all devices and
they also specifically support the blood
of advertisement pockets which is what
we exactly want
which makes things a lot easier so when
you start working with with big guns and
you store your Windows Phone project
very important is to manage to take
capability Bluetooth because without it
you nothing will work and you won't know
why actual you don't receive any signals
so that's very common mistake and very
important to turn on bluetooth on your
phone and turn bluetooth in your
capabilities of application and the way
you do it these days is a you have a
bluetooth advertisement water you said
some filters so here I set up
manufacturer ID for apple and some like
low and high values for when I consider
begun to be in a range those values are
between a minus 127 to around plus 16
and so basically when you're becoming is
touching your phone it's going to be
very like slightly over 0-1 27 it's
usually means that the packet was
wrongly formatted that's when you get
this number so that's the deranged I
usually used to have like when my
beacons are getting in the proximity and
getting out of proximity and then you
have like time so when you don't see the
beacons for like two seconds you don't
you consider it like the water want will
like stop show it as visible and then
we'll pop up again you will see it again
okay I'll try to connect my screen and
 sauce so what we can see
ah
Oh
Oh
I want this this yeah so that's that's
the application that's coming from a
sample universal Windows platform sample
it's an agate hub full open source so
I'll link that in the presentation so
you can use those examples to start
playing with the beacons I'm going to
run now water that will start getting
information but my beacon cell or switch
up so I'll switch them out and hopefully
we start seeing something coming in oh
yes so you can see like information type
is a type of connection this is like
bluetooth thingy basically we're not
going to bother about it and do you see
those exercise going which is like the
signal with how much strength we
received the beacons and you can see it
it shakes a lot because it really
depends a lot of features I have some
electronics here around that disturbs
that I'm a bottle of water i disturb
that too so what you gonna do probably
what you would like to do in a in the in
real life is probably do some smoothing
over time so do like a verte over last
second or something like that
so you don't get like this data very
chaotic and spiking but a little bit
smoothened what's going on
just wanted to show you something else
but it doesn't cooperate with me let's
try again
okay so i just have only one beacon
going on sending messages a nurse's I
are on the levels like 60 or minus 27 if
there's some problem of the so yeah you
can see it's 60 70 there is a I see with
Windows Phone especially there's a lot
of packages like with- 127 like it has
some problem parsing it I don't know
it's like problem of software or quality
of the radio and so on but in my
solution I just try to filter them out
because there's usual I just rubbish
data so like when I put it a little bit
more far away you should probably get
worse right now it's stopped yeah
it's really
it's dead now wonder why let's write
another one
so yeah as you can see it's not always
very reliable Windows Phone for some
reason we'll get back to this later
sorry forgot
fine now yeah
so that usually looks like and when you
do something more interesting like we
have like full-blown bluetooth device in
this phone so we can also transmit
bluetooth so if we know how the package
look like can we fake the beacon and
that's the code that's pretty much does
it I put in the data the usual pocket
that's used by by this company by st
mode so it should shown up in there up
and i'm going to try it out and also i
put like the last bites are
miner ID and a major ID and also some
power so i put minor and major ID to
1337 so hopefully we'll see them on a
iphone up looking like that so I'm just
going to switch to the my iPhone and
show the st mode app that shows their
beacons and hopefully i will see my
spoof to bikaner i first fire it up so
yeah should be running right now so
yeah so I have four becomes on the on
screen but only for only three that are
like legitimate st modes well lets them
put far far away so i know which one is
the one that i actually created you can
see it's slowly you can see it has some
slow updates so you can all you have to
also include that in your application
that the objects will be you won't see
instantly that we can quantify way we
went we can ferry there's some wonder
and one even went blank because I
switched away but I think this is the
one that to do with my finger that I
found which also shows that i cannot
connect to estimate cloud because they
don't really recognize this as their own
become even though I'm faking and there
is major and minor 1337 which I set up
in the in the in the bites so yeah you
can fake beacons which all which like
like bring some security considerations
but I'll get to that will be clear later
let's get back to a presentation
hopefully
nope
perfect
yeah so what I did is like right now
it's a lot of pain to unpack those
pockets because you still get through
advertisement pockets which is like 26
bites so I started doing some small
library that will make it easier I
called smokey beacons already in very
alpha stage on github so basically I
provide the water configuration this way
its plan I put it on for a demo perverse
hard coded but there are some options
right now but this is basically a
configuration you need to listen for
beacons that are I becomes and i also
like add some like structures you have
objects with a UID major minor
calculating distance and so on and and
that's the way you listen for beacons
pretty much when in your viewing windows
phone you start the water you start
discovery and then just add the evan
handler so on every advert of adverse my
advertisement a you you fire up events
and yeah you could becomes listed so I
make very simple demo application at
least the beacons going around so all
I'll show it to you now kill this
because I had problems when testing with
demo because I technically connected to
beacon that was my phone and I'll block
any communication because now it's like
very occupied to talk with my ala phone
pretending its beak on so I demoed even
work but hopefully when I kill the app
this should work so let's see i'll
switch the screen again
yep and
we're up the other range and this up
shows a because that we see in range
I'll bring them closer we get all three
and on the left there is a minor and the
major ID on the right you have received
you are SSI and the distance i
calculated so right now they show for
example that there around 1 meter when
there's no 127 now 60 centimeters and so
on and so you can see it's like the
formula i use it's probably like the I
should probably adjust the constants the
rooster to be more reflecting the
environment that's in this room and as
you can see it's also very jumpy so as I
said you should really provide some
smooth in ink and that's one of the
plans I have for this library like make
those beacons using from windows on
painless oh yeah like I want to go back
to ace one ways I have you have full
control so you can basically do this
moving yourself if you wish to provide
your own formula for distance and so on
and like full automatic so basically
give me those beacons and how far away
they are with all the stuff hopefully
this this will evolve although as I said
it's more of a fun project to actually
prove something because windows phone is
not growing in popularity anymore I
think it's going other way around it's
interesting what Microsoft we're going
to do with this i think the the Lumia
line is slowly going to die and maybe
the investing surface more so we'll have
you see more surface phones so maybe
there's still hope for windows phone
we'll see so yeah
let's move forward a bit I'll get back
to a presentation
cool okay so there are some security
implementation as i mentioned like the
problem is that let's say you don't like
your competition and you know they have
begun set up in their store you can put
your own weaker the same uid
transmitting with very very high power
to over and there becomes and send some
other information that's maybe come to
us we have better prices or stuff like
that and that's really bad so beacon
providers games with several ways to
solve it and for example one of them is
a secure uid so the way you act and work
with because through their sdk is that
you still use the same you ID so you
know that which becomes you're talking
about but what they do they actually
algorithmically switch the UID randomly
every sometime and you're up also is
aware because the sdk is the same algert
the problem of that is that you
basically render those become unusable
without their sdk and this will prove
problems for using them with windows
phone because right now whatever you is
it we just use the official
advertisement packet and non an
unofficial IP is the good side is deep a
lot of them put their libraries in on
the internet and they're in the java and
java because for android which means
it's easy to
see the code by decompiling them which
it's probably not very III don't say you
should do this because it's probably on
the gray side of legality but that's the
way you can see how they do those
algorithm and the other ways probably
work with those suppliers to have
working solution with them so so I'm
because they the the one of the vendors
is got interested that I'm doing this
windows so application so we'll probably
do a fool thing for them which is cool
and maybe we'll have also those security
features but yeah the implication is
that usually when somebody enables this
security ID or another way of securing
those beacons it's not gonna be easy to
use them then the the way they were
designed so just reading the new IDs and
because this wasn't very secure solution
and they realized that very quickly that
it's probably not going to work well
they're probably going to be some other
ways of securing them so we'll see so
for example with those beacons again I
talked about them a lot because I all
working with them for two years so I
have the most experience of them they
have this cloud service that if you want
to change any settings or even then you
have to actually log into your cloud
account so you have to be logged into
cloud account in their application then
you can update the because even though
technically you don't really need to do
it but they have security measures put
in that that do it
okay so there are some code repositories
I mentioned there is a Microsoft Union
those universal platform samples that's
where I took the first demo they're very
useful to like play around with them you
can just change things and fire up and
you have some something's working
there's a my library and last week I
discovered there's some other library
that also helps to drink with beacons on
a windows phone this is much more mature
and complete so I'll link that here you
can also use that to ya and that's all
from me thank you for coming and if you
have questions I'll gladly take them and
yeah
like so you mean like updating because
you want to change some yeah yeah so
yeah the problem is that usual you have
to do it manually but as I said like for
example st modeling is with that that
you can change them in a cloud i think i
can show you my cloud account how does
look like
oh I didn't connect to internet
just quickly share connection for my
phone
yeah and you can connect to the cloud
and and then set up all the settings for
the
for the separates beacons and then a
while they will be updated over the air
while well your phone is close to there
for some other person using their app so
you can do it like no you can you use
people to actually update your because
you just have to
so you I think the way it works they are
broadcasting and when you when your
phone that you used to update will see
the broadcasting they can send like
request to connect through
not at all the superb excellent
the policeman so I was wondering how
yeah because those are the pockets that
I was reading too and there's like
they're those what we seen was just
packets and they're probably sending
some other packets also like because
it's a bluetooth and I was just looking
for those advertisement pockets so those
are my because I have connect connected
and I can change settings here have
information of battery I don't have any
analytics setup so I don't see it but
when you have like your beacons set up
to send a telemetry then also other
people will receive them and just send
up to the cloud so yeah I can edit
settings so for example change name
change mine or mean or their own
security ID and so on so and when I save
the changes there will be somehow
populated to my phone probably very
quickly because my phone running app is
very quickly to the beacon but that's
how it how it works
okay there's one more thing there are
two my colleagues speaking from my
company co Henrik is on the next slot
and also today evening and tomorrow
morning about history mostly about IOT
and there is an week on Friday he will
talk about what you can do with get that
you can do with you I but you can do is
call online and rick is really hardcore
kid guy so if you're interested also
suggest you not so thank you for coming
please vote and have a great conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
