that's exactly what I want right now
I've rather that's confusing yeah
perfect all right good afternoon home
waste hello
actually that's going like it's give me
a big loud hello it's not bad it's not
bad I did that in a couple of countries
back and so I said give me a big hello
and I went hmm
to be fair it's the end coming towards
the end of the conference although it's
not really because pub comp is coming if
you're not going to bub conf unless
you've got a fantastic reason not to go
unfortunately I have one I've got a
daughter I'll go and pick her up but if
you've got a fantastic reason not to go
you should be going the most
entertaining highlight of the year
frankly okay so I'm who has seen me do
talks before excellent I can completely
reinvent myself okay so you don't know
how bad I am with the guitar that's a
good start if you're down you probably
want to come in okay so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna start off with my talk with
a bit of a song hopefully something that
you relate to don't worry I don't sing
but the song hopefully explains some of
the context to what I'm going to talk
about in the rest of the talk so let's
get going
[Laughter]
thank you and now to the serious stuff
okay so hopefully from that little ditty
you've got a slightly different view of
something that we all rely upon which is
production you see I have had a few
people in history say that production is
the place where things work in my
experience production is where the place
where things don't work in fact I think
production hates me
with a passion oh no it's not it's not
distributed it's not like it doesn't
know who I am it knows who I am
it knows when I want to be asleep it
knows what I want to go on a romantic
evening out really knows those it knows
how to destroy my life and it's not
afraid to try let's switch over to a few
slides don't have many okay so before we
get into the depths of what production
is like let me start with a quick
introduction of myself like recycling
commits you reinvent myself since you've
never seen me before which is fantastic
first of all I'm on Twitter I live on
social media I'm unapologetic about it I
really rarely read in emails so please
don't send me one at any moment's time I
have 90,000 unread emails in my inbox
I'm purposefully stress testing Google
but but everyone says me an email please
don't because it ends up being one of
them I treat email like Twitter it moves
past is a continuous stream of something
okay I'm also a dad so I do have a
responsible side and yes we are those
irritating people that get into
Christmas way too early
this was actually roughly I think August
or September last year we were out
Christmas shopping which was fabulous
fun because frankly we've got so many
horrible looks from people it's great as
well as that I've been writing some
books and I do courses on kale
Engineering which is what today is all
about as well as that though I have to
tell you something else before we get in
because it's actually related quite
closely to my attitude to this subject
and that is I clearly believe I'm a rock
star and I'm not one but I'm also a
biker very serious bite well as serious
as you can with what is essentially a
sofa connected to some wheels and as a
bike anyone here a biker you've got most
locals right fantastic
now when you're learning to ride a
motorcycle as I was only a couple of
years ago that was my first bike by the
way I went from a one to five on the
weekend to the following Friday on 1,600
CCS of heavy beast that wants to kill me
fantastic fun now it's a motorcyclist
when you're learning to ride a bike
you're not taught the way that car
drivers are taught to drive cars
generally when it's got cars actually in
London this could be tricky hey
excellent there's a decent amount of you
that have cars which is rare for London
because good when you're going to drive
a car you probably get told do it
depends what country you've learned in
of course you put a get told that we
have to drive like no one else can see
you all right you drive defensively well
on a motorcycle we're not told that
we're told that everyone can see us and
wants us dead the road is a hostile
environment populated purely by
psychopaths and that's how we get by
that's how we live a little longer and
enjoy it while we're living and this is
relevant to the subject at hand because
that's what I want you to be like when
you deliver your software to production
and I'm going to explain to you how
chaos engineering helps you think like a
motorcyclist when you deploy and run
your code we get probably get there I
just have to plug very quickly the fact
that there's now an announcement I'm
actually doing a tour across the u.s.
this gives you an idea how crazy I am
I'm doing a tour in April across the
u.s. most of it on a motorbike doing a
talk like this every night
for 26 days so either I'm gonna be very
good at giving talks by the end of it or
I'll be dead just to let you know how
bad this looks this is the first half
you know you're doing a long tour when
Google cannot handle the whole route I
think it's about 11 waypoints and it
says stop it you're not doing it so this
was the first chunk of the journey I end
up in Dallas which I'm fat is he happy
about and then the second half and I end
up in Chicago which is where the
conference is so everywhere I stop I'm
doing talk so anyone is coming from
comes or any of these vicinities across
April give me a ping I'm I tried to you
and have a conversation about chaos
which you're now going to find out about
so does this make me athle insane should
you not really be listening to me
possibly but at the same time don't
really think of myself as insane I tend
to think of myself as an agent of chaos
see I'm constantly stressing my life and
I do the same thing to production I
stress it in ways where life can be
better and more interesting admittedly
I've had two divorces now that's not the
best dresser I can't recommend it but
that is an example of the fact I do
stress things as I go and that's how I
want you to think about your production
experience you see there's a fallacy out
there people tend to believe this is
what this is what production looks like
serene beautiful polished you ever see
those photos of the Operations Center
the data center where it's all that blue
lights and calm I should I should point
out this is not far from my house and
this is actually the south coast of
England and the beautiful thing about
this picture is if you were to look
there there is the UK's biggest suicide
spot which i think is quite related to
production it's actually behaves beachy
head just over there uh-huh
but yes serene and beautiful that's what
we think production might be and
whenever I hear that my reaction is
usually along these lines I mean I had
this conversation recently where I was
sitting with a relatively new group of
developers and they said to aim
production everything it always works in
production we have to build big
pipelines of checking and gates before
it gets to production
because then it'll work when it gets
there and I watched the senior
architects in the room and he just his
body language was beautiful it was and
he just muttered in that way that
age-old pain has on a tone of voice he
muttered now it doesn't and they all got
a life lesson right now on how
production doesn't want your stuff to
run because rather than it being this I
think it tends to look a lot more like
that we're really rather than perhaps
putting fuel on the fire
Fela desperately trying to put the fires
out and then desperately trying to
figure out whether this next piece of
kindling is going to be lit okay so the
first thing you need to know about chaos
engineering which is often done in
production is it has nothing to do with
chaos we as an industry should stop
naming things we're not good at it I
mean don't get me started on no sequel
who decided to define something by what
it's not and then get it wrong it's
actually something that you can have you
know taking a beautiful renaissance in
data access and persistence technologies
and we call it by what it might not may
not have and it wasn't even a problem
the first place okay so chaos
engineering has nothing to do with chaos
that's the first rule what it has to do
with what it's trying to help us deal
with is a natural occurrence in our
systems so I'm not gonna ask you who's
using kubernetes who's down the cool
kids who's got pivotal Cloud Foundry
because I got a lot of money or any of
those things
well I'm gonna ask I'll point out to you
is if you're doing anything like what
you could potentially call micro
services you are creating a wonderful
problem for yourselves don't get me
wrong as long as you're doing micro
services for the right reasons like you
want to evolve your system quickly and
organize your people around the code
effectively fine
however there's a cost and the cost
looks like this when we look at King
Evan this is the Canadian diagram I'm
going to sort of abuse it a bit today we
tend to think we're about there with our
systems unless you're I mean down here
it's hello world all right unless you I
mean if anyone here is professionally
paid to write hello world programs well
done
respect um but generally speaking we
think and we believe we're up there in
complicated land where there's good
practices but we might not be aware of
them yet they're good practices that's
when we come to conferences to find
those good practices that we can apply
and we can just apply them to the system
and it will probably make things better
probably if you're doing micro services
or anything we are starting to call
under the umbrella of being cloud native
then you're probably in complex land
you're going complicated anymore you're
in a world where really there are no
great and good practices there are ideas
there are things you could try because
it's called quite unique and different
and painful to look after but you've
hopefully done it for the right reasons
and so you paid for that ability to
evolve the system with complexity then
comes the nasty awakening moment if
you're building cloud native micro
services and they should be able to
evolve quickly that was the point a
system that can change as quickly as the
business changes its mind
you've got constant change on your
system and that shifts you periodically
every now and then you're shifted into
the chaotic which is where chaos gets
its name from it's a recognition that
the system is complicated complex and
then at times chaotic enough but the
only way of dealing with it you can't
formally define it you can't sit back
and go it's perfect it now works if
you've got a perfect system there's a
hundred percent up no no it doesn't
exist 99 point whatever many nines you
want to add to it up
I'm if you've got that it can never
change
that's what start site reliability
engineering starts with is if you've got
a system that's going to change accept
the fact that there will be failure so
we want change that's what we were
trying to by with doing these
complicated systems but now we've got
this issue of anyone responsible for
saying it's all all working it's in a
difficult place they don't really have a
tool for that didn't really have a
philosophy for it even at that not that
long ago so what we're going to look at
today is how we deal with this system
you see this is where chaos engineering
comes to the fore it's about taking this
happening and trying to drive us back
into the system just being complex ok
just have a look specifically chaos
engineering is about one thing it's
about availability you're trying to look
at your system from the perspective of a
user and see what parts of it are
available given a certain set of
conditions and then you as a chaos
engineer you're looking to cause those
conditions that potentially challenge
your availability ideally before they
happen sometimes after they've happened
there's value in recreating those
problems ok so it's about availability
availability gets destroyed at lots of
different levels everyone's kind of
familiar with chaos monkey I suppose and
chaos Kong and those sorts of things
that tend to hit it down here and beat
it up we talk about why that's a great
thing in a bit you probably haven't done
as much or experienced as many things
that are doing it at the platform level
yeah maybe killing kubernetes pods or
something application level there's an
interesting stuff you can do to
applications where you've assumed that
things will work and the best place in
my opinion to start doing chaos
engineering is the biggest cause of
system failure you I mean everyone
or people what we do developers our
system destroyers we have the best of
intentions so what we do at the top
level is a great technique in chaos
engineering called game days where you
get a bunch of people together and you
try to stress the whole system what we
call the socio-technical system of
software delivery you're taking all
aspects of it and going
when this happens because it probably
can or it has what do we do what did
this group of people do to handle this
it's kind of like disaster recovery okay
but it's kind of a practiced disaster
recovery a repeatable disaster recovery
something you do more frequently so who
here does disaster recovery executions
at work how everyone does it has a lady
once a year keep your hand up do it once
a month keep your hand up yeah my hands
have gone down right so now here's the
skinny on chaos engineering I mentioned
the titles terrible now you should never
say to your managers bosses stakeholders
anybody that you want to do chaos on
production you will not get a good
answer I did I had this conversation
with a bank they said you're interested
in what you're doing Russ sir whatever
what it's all about and I said well it's
we're gonna do chaos in production they
said nananana no no no we had 2008 we
know that looks like they were very much
no no chaos no why would you want chaos
has to work that's the thing you don't
want there are other nasty phrases you
could use we were going to break things
on purpose no you're not that happens
accidentally enough thanks but I found a
phrase that work I'm gonna give it to
you today it's something you can take
back and say you can get interested in
chaos engineering this is the thing you
can use you can say we're going to do
limited scope continuous disaster
recovery that works that that verse of
all disaster recoveries in there banks
go yet we kind of do that already
sometimes then you say limited scope
continuous because we're going to build
confidence in our system
who wouldn't want you turn around say
I'm gonna cause chaos not quite the same
reaction since I get limited scope
continuous disaster recoveries that is
the technique I've found works okay and
we do it over all of those levels
because all of those levels can attack
availability so you've got a rapidly
evolving system and you want to gain
confidence in your availability chaos
engineering is for you so how do you do
chaos engineering a lot this is straight
out of the free book there'll be a link
to the free book at the end you must go
grab it it's a free book why not read it
the first thing you do is you don't
there's a bit of a debate in the
industry at the moment about whether it
scales testing or chaos experimentation
I prefer experimentation even though
really we're not very scientific about
it actually I think it's an industry
we're not very scientific I mean we all
most of us have studied perhaps computer
science as it was called back at
university who actually does science I
play Wii computers a lot but I don't
remember ever doing a double-blind
formal experiment not on not on my own
on my Mac anyway so yeah this is
actually though an experimental
procedure a scientific method you start
off with a hypothesis or in fact what
you do is you start off like most
scientists you poke things in
interesting ways go oh that happened
that's not supposed to happen so you
start off with that you had to start off
with a method where you actually poking
stuff oh you start off with a hypothesis
and the hypothesis can go along the
lines of this I believe if service X
dies in a fun and interesting way like
it exhausts its memory then the system
will survive and the availability will
look like this as far as our users or
whoever your consumers a system are okay
says your hypothesis I believe this will
happen if you start your experimental
hypothesis with I believe this service
will die and it will take the whole
system down you're missing the point if
you know it will destroy the system
don't do it
sounds kind of obvious like
but it's really obvious if that chaos
engineering is not about destroying the
system now it's going knowing it's going
to kill it if you already know you don't
do the experiment you improve the system
you've already learned the lesson okay
you might still do the experiment to see
what interesting ways it does die if you
don't know that but still you probably
don't want to be just knowing it's going
to die and run in chaos experiments I
actually have that a lot reason time put
put that in the talk is because I do a
lot of chaos consultancy these days
don't please don't Danny for it
I also build software but the calls I
get sometimes start like this and I'd
hate for your call with me if it ever
happened to start this way the call
usually goes we've them we've been
running chaos monkey in production it
destroyed everything right yeah that's
what it does yeah but we we didn't think
it would destroy everything well so you
miss the limited scope part of the
statement I think so once we've got a
hypothesis one of the things where I
tend to focus on next which helps the
business understand his technique in the
first place is I tend to limit the blast
radius I talk very early on about when
we're trying to do chaos engineering we
say what was the smallest thing we could
do to learn something about the system
you know you could go and run chaos Kong
which if you're not familiar with it
destroys regions of Amazon actually no
it doesn't pretends they're gone you
can't destroy regions of Amazon if
unless your Amazon or a hurricane mainly
because they've got other customers so
what Cales Kong does is it pertains that
you know the apocalypse has happened
with blast radius you probably don't
start with chaos Kong you start with
okay what happens if the routing here
goes a bit rocky what happens to our
system if it should be alright should be
self-healing let's see
or what happens if that service goes
down does the you know what happens to
the user when this occurs so you're
exploring very small things at first and
then you get a bigger blast radius Oh
you start getting good at this you don't
start with Kong you very real world
events so when you're prodding the
system you're not just coming up with
flights of fantasy you it can be
tempting I admit to sit there and go
what happens if every service dies in a
strange cascade that I've just made up
the problem that experiment is that the
point of an experiment isn't to harm the
system in a fascinating way in fact if
you want to be a chaos engineer there's
one personality trait that you
absolutely must have in spades
empathy you're going to be in a position
where you can destroy people's stuff you
shouldn't be doing that to surprise them
and you shouldn't be doing that because
you can okay but also you shouldn't be
coming up with crazy stuff because an
experiments purpose is for people to
learn and if you say to them if I do
this crazy experiment your stuff doesn't
handle it the response might be of
course it doesn't
you'll never handle that that never
happens fair point unless it has
happened you really have no leg to stand
on what you want to do is find something
that has happened and vary it a little
bit the best way to start chaos
engineering is to get everyone together
and go when was the last time production
failed on how and then what you do is
you start to go well are we any better
now if that happens to get can it happen
again and you start to explore what you
might need to do to deal with that
real-world situation and you cause the
real world events against your system
hey this is controversial the best place
to run chaos experiments is in the real
world that is production it's where
you'll learn the real lessons the
problem with lessons that you learn from
staging are they are only applicable to
staging or at least anyone who's told if
you do this in staging things bad things
happen
people will go turn around and go yeah
but I'll never happen in production even
if they if it has in the past oh we
can't ever happen again
someone's coped with this so what you're
looking to do always is to get it the
biggest leverage to the lesson we're
going to go to the effort of trying to
harm the system in any interesting but
real way and we want that lesson learned
once we've done it and then we automate
these things because they're not one
offs you could run a chaos experiment
today where you destroy micro-service X
and everything's fine you do it tomorrow
when you've just launched Game of
Thrones that service X might have a
problem the whole thing could go
cascading me down so it's important to
continuously run it now there is a
cadence to these things
chaos Kong as I say pretends that the
apocalypse has happened that is not run
continuously because it will affect you
it will affect customers so you run it
but you run it in a very careful way at
a certain period of time not when you've
just launched house of cards or
something else that people like to watch
so run continuously like continuous
delivery it's not about necessarily
running it all the time it's about being
able to run it whenever you'd like to
within the bounds of the impact that you
expect to happen and now I can show you
how to get started with this because a
while ago it was actually quite tricky
to get started the tools themselves were
often quite specific you know you'll
probably not anyone here from Netflix
I'm about to say you're probably not
Netflix but if you are great but you're
probably not so a lot the tooling they
have great as it is open source as it is
isn't necessarily tuned to what you
might be worried about so what my friend
and I did and a few others in the
community is we created this little
toolkit that would help us do chaos for
anyone who is trying to approach the
topic I'm going to show you a little bit
of it now okay
so these things are available and free
online as well if you want to see the
cows toolkit it's that's one way but
let's go look at github all the cool
stuff there this is it made of budget I
should warn you it's written in Python I
am proud of that I should also point out
that I'm not the best Python programmer
by my best friend Sylvan is he is French
it is piped and it was his rule okay so
we've written these little tutorials to
help you get started the main thing to
point out is that it's really simple to
use we have three main steps to it you
can install it obviously you can run
your first cow experiment we'll look at
that in a minute
and then you can discover initialize
your experiments the cool thing about
running a cow experiment is it kind of
demonstrates what I'm going to talk
about or when we show you now okay so
the first thing is there's a chaos run
command so we do our Python thing we've
activated our virtual environment we can
now go ahead run it now we can't because
it's still catching up there is it's
there we now okay or something sorry if
it's smaller back I don't know if I can
zoom in no sue me on this is terrible
idea oh okay okay you see at the back
now vaguely cool right so chaos has a
counter points just to see Ally now I
can't get over to the left sorry after
teasing you with it I now need to zoom
around here we go
so first thing we need is something to
test now I'm not going to create a big
complicated system here because creating
a 10,000 microservices and running out
in kubernetes will probably take longer
than the weekend or certainly longer
than i've got remaining on the talk so
instead what I'm going to do is create a
highly complicated one service Python
file and run that up instead so it's
just a Python file if you don't know
Python don't worry it's just gonna put a
little web server on port 8080 and
respond with something half intelligent
I could run it it's probably best to go
ahead and think about the experiment now
now in chaos toolkit at least an
experiment is described
you write it descriptively you don't
have to get down into the me to the code
you can write it using Jason I apologize
if Jason it's not your flavor if you'd
like it rewritten in the Amal please get
involved in the project and write it in
the Amal I personally have wasted too
many days of my life on Yammer so I may
I tend to avoid it but we've got Jason
for now but it's certainly not the only
thing you could have main thing the
point and this is we've got a
description for our experiment it's
going to does our service tolerate
because our system tolerate the loss of
its exchange file very simple there's a
little file that this service is
probably assuming should be there but
it's possible it could go away so we're
going to see what happens we now add our
steady state hypothesis which we can't
see from the back is very simply saying
the exchange file must exist now point
something out about steady state
hypotheses they used twice this is a
major difference between running chaos
experiments and what I understand in
most testing techniques the closest
testing technique to chaos engineering
it's probably exploratory testing where
you don't really know what's going to
happen that's closest I can think of we
use this steady state hypothesis and
what that says is when I look at the
system in this case we're just gonna
look at a particularly URL we believe
we're going to see one of a few set of
return status codes even when we've
changed the system conditions which is
what the rest of the experiment will do
and I mentioned it was used twice it's
used at the beginning of the experiment
there's no point doing a chaos
experiment against the system that you
don't recognize so the steady state
hypothesis is also used as the gate it
says okay things look like they should
be in fact the steady state hypothesis
can be thought of as this defines what
normality looks like so we start an
experiment if the steady state
hypothesis passes what we can do then is
add in our method and I won't move
through it all with it remember all it's
doing is taking a file out
now there are schools of thought on this
some systems attempt to have automatic
roll back for your changes this system
doesn't the reason it doesn't is
automatic roll back only makes sense at
the infrastructure level it never very
rarely makes sense at the application
level so most experiments that I end up
writing tend to hit all those different
levels and when you do that you realize
that roll back automatically is
impossible because the system has become
potentially quite corrupted at that
point now you can put a block in there
to say here are the roll backs that I
would like you to do but it's not
automatic and we're going to it's going
to run this method and then what happens
is we then take that steady state
hypothesis and go does our system still
look within the tolerance of normality
okay I'm not going to run it for you
here but you can run it for yourselves
online this is all available for free
but what you will see when you do run it
run through this tutorial is that when
you run it the first time the piece of
Python code has been written naively to
assume that exchange file is there and
it does not respond well within these
tolerances when the file is it then what
you do is you improve the system so we
then improve the Python code so we now
don't assume that file is always there
because it might not be there and then
we run the chaos experiment again and
you can see that the service still stays
within its tolerance even when this
dependency has varied now it's a trivial
example but hopefully it's illustrative
of what you can start to do this is what
this is the thought process which is
what can we do to the system and what is
normality look like and we'll try to
stay within those bounds and if we
deviate that's when we go and look at
our system and go what happened here
that is here something that's an
important message there is a low bar a
rule if you like to do in chaos
engineering you can't do chaos
engineering if you don't have good
observability of the system already I
don't if you go to many theme parks but
you know you have a theme park and
there's a bar there and it says you have
to be this high to get on the ride I'm
always worried by that be
short person and one day I'm gonna be
walking in there with my daughter and
should we taller than me she'll get on I
won't but that bar for chaos engineering
ease observability so you will invest in
observability first because the one
thing you want to do is when you do a
chaos experiment you want to be able to
go look at the system and go what
happened okay the cow experiment can
tell you where we deviated from the
steady state hypothesis but it can't
tell you why so that's why you need the
observed ability as well okay so it's a
little bit on the cow's toolkit and if
you want to go start using it like say
it's free open source please do we're
always looking for people to play with
it and to let us know how it went right
now I'm gonna go get back to the slides
okay okay
so there are some rules of chaos club if
you're interested in doing this
technique then there are some rules to
live by and I want to make sure that
these sinking number one we're doing it
to learn about the system we're trying
to figure out where the weaknesses might
be in our whole socio technical system
when it comes to these extreme
conditions the system can come under and
then we're looking to improve on that so
it's not really about breaking stuff
this is the major for me the major
misunderstanding of chaos monkey is that
when you do look at it and it says I
break stuff for a living you do sit
there and go why that can't be good the
thing about chaos engineering is it
lifts hopefully it makes the awareness
and lifts the awareness a little bit
higher and says it's about learning from
that harm in fact it's not even
necessarily harm it's learning from
real-world conditions and small
variations hole number two chaos is not
a surprise can't hammer this home enough
if you decide to become a chaos engineer
in whatever capacity and the first thing
you do is destroy some stuff in
production and it surprises
everyone involved you lose no one is
going to be happy with her chaos starts
with a conversation what you do is you
go and speak to the teams that look
after that software whether they be
DevOps or whatever so you're going talk
to them and say what worries you about
your stuff is there anything in there
you think might be a little fragile you
want us to see if it's fragile and then
do you want us to figure out how we
improve it so it's a big dialogue and
what we have is the whole you know chaos
automation and cows toolkit is a it's
all if you like just from tolling to
support that dialogue around how we
improve the system there's about
learning not harm and it shouldn't be a
surprise to anybody because you've
already spoken to them about it in fact
it's a great little this is actually
true anecdote what happened to me
recently just telling people that chaos
is coming can lead to awesome
improvements I said to her there's a
system running over in the states and
lovely group of people around it but
they were like all developers they
didn't want to use circuit breakers
because it can see the point never need
it they're always going to be there it's
fine and so I said okay in about two
months time I'm gonna run a limited
version of chaos well Cuba Nettie's
chaos monkey against your system and I
okay why I said what you said be fine it
happens pods die so I'm gonna make it
happen a little bit okay I get great
they worked so hard for the host few
months before the chaos cube turned up
and I was very proud of it as well
because when I did put it on the system
they said it does survive it's great
fantastic you've improved the system
beautifully and then of course is a
chaos engineer you say what else makes
you nervous and then we try and do that
to rule of earth
I mentioned it before you don't do chaos
if you already know if you already know
the system's going to collapse in flames
then it's not an experiment
it's just sadism so don't do it it goes
hand in hand with this idea of being a
very empathetic individual if you're a
chaos engineer and that dialog you're
supposed to be having if you have a
dialogue and they say well please don't
do that it'll kill it
your next step shouldn't be to do it so
this is all part of the chaos the chaos
world is we're interested in learning
and if we already know the answer we're
not learning anything so it's not really
our game so when it comes to chaos
engineering be able to leave you with
today apart from the toolkit I hope you
go and play with is the book itself if
you haven't got it get it this is I
should point something out about this
industry I've been around long enough in
this industry to watch us do a lot of
things cargo cult I used to be a
consultant for being it like a
consultant agile person right I used to
get phone calls where someone would say
we've just done this agile
transformation thing for a couple of
years spent a lot of money could you
come in as an expert and tell us why
it's better what didn't you know why
what you were trying to improve no no no
we knew we had to be agile we've done
that now we're not sure why and someone
at the top is asking all quick questions
about it so can you come in and convince
them that we're a lot better now than we
used to be and there are lots of other
things in our industry that we do that
way they in micro services which I'm
relatively moderately famous for for
talking about a lot and building a lot
of you can do micro services where you
can recreate all of the problems of a
monolith and you do it in a distributed
system that you can't manage and so it
might even in terms of Micra so if you
just do micro services because someone
else has done them you'll get them wrong
recently out of fact I was on a phone
call with a client and they don't mind
me mention it to you they said to me
they start with the question they said
how do you deploy 40 micro services at
once
you don't ever one at a time you should
always be able to deliver one at a time
if you have to do two or three you've
got the wrong micro services and so I
long conversation with about that and
that's because but we tend to in this
industry cargo cult new things so when
it comes to chaos engineering I feel
very privileged but the people that came
up with it even though the names
interestingly bad it's cool enough
though you can be now a director of
chaos which is not a bad thing we
actually have a technique that I think
is hard to get wrong as long as you
understand that you're not just hurting
stuff and people then it really is a
genuine way of improving systems and
it's nice actually to be able to say in
a world where we don't have a lot of
best practices or even good practices
this is one of the few things where I
can say just do it get into it now
because you're gonna see value even if
you just do a game day even if you just
get four or five of your friends
together and go what happens if the
system dies how are we gonna deal with
this I'll give you a cut a last story I
was talking to a great friend of mine
Alexis Richardson and he was delivering
a talk that day and the talk was about
how quickly they could reproduce their
system which is weave and the story he
tells is he's sitting there in the
office with one of his developers and he
suddenly the developer turns around says
I found a big red button if I press it
production gets wiped out gone from the
history books and Alexis tells us his
next moment Alexis is just turning
around when he hears click because if
you see a button you're gonna press it
right this is why we have a big red
button on Donald Trump's desk that is
not attached to anything
okay.you we are slightly advanced
monkeys or great apes or whatever we
will press a button what Alexis then
found out was that they could recreate
the whole their system in 45
minutes she's pretty damn good under
that level of stress but if you're a
Kaos engineer right so Alexa cease
response to this was then we're going to
get rid of that button as a Kaos
engineer your mindset should be can we
press that button more often will
improve we get that 45 minutes down
pretty damn quickly if we press it once
a day do you see what I mean harm the
system in intelligent ways because it
can happen but these buttons exist and
then you can see how the system improves
on the back of it okay so go grab the
book please have a look at the chaos
toolkit that's who I am so if you want
to get in touch please do otherwise
thank you so much for hanging in there
to the end of the conference
you are the diehards or like me you do
not have a life one lit but thank you
very much for being patient and hanging
in there till the end and I am I'm open
for questions I do want you asked to run
and go get my daughter but other than
that I will happily answer your
questions or I'll give you business
cards and we'll start a dialogue not
through email emails a terrible idea
we'll start a dialogue through LinkedIn
or something thank you very much Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
