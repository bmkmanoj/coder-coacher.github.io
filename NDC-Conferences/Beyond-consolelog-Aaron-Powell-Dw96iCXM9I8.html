session beyond consoles or log my name
is Aaron Powell and kind of the the
reason or the catalyst we wanted to do
this presentation was i duel consulting
work and so I'm often working with
people that are a new web development or
having been doing it for a particularly
long time or have transitioned from
maybe server-side development into front
of web development and the only thing
they seem to know what to do with
browser devtools is the console dot log
statement and all they can do is they
can output an object or the output of
spring so I wanted to put the other a
talk where we explore some of the other
things that you can do with browser dev
tools beyond console dot log some of the
other things that happen in there but
first off I just wanted to stop with a
bit of a history lesson about browser
dev tools so I've been working on the
web for about 11 years now so I remember
the girl days of like I e5 and I 55 mac
and Netscape and stuff like that and I
remember back when we didn't actually
have dough tools this is one of the
first if not the first of the major dev
tools that was ever released it was the
IE developer toolbar that came out in
2005 or preview for it was was done at
PDC 2005 and it was available for a six
and seven it was looking back it was it
was not great so if you look appeared
what we've got now but at a time it was
fantastic before we had something like
this all we could do was right click
view source and that was the HTML
excellent that was how we had our Dom
inspector was view source if I actually
wanted to see what the styles were on an
element well I was going to have to
write something a bit of JavaScript that
would run at the end of the page and
find the element in the Dom that I
wanted and output some information of
that onto I into another div or doing
alert or something like that and hooves
was alert basically bugging if I was
trying to do any kind of debugging and
and and this thing for for all its
problems that it has had when it by six
hung around for longer than it should
have hung around in its time it was
great but
what it really did was it started the
kind of a revolution the idea that
developer tool tools are really
important for web developers and that's
where we saw some tools like 5050 for me
was when it changed it wasn't developer
tool what the tools were no longer this
supplementary thing and thing that you
it was an afterthought by the browser
vendors a Firebug was originally a
firefox extension or in by some people
on the fly Fox team but it brought this
really dynamic interactive development
experience to the browser which is then
evolved into what we have today so I'm
going to be focusing on evergreen
browsers in particular chrome edge and
Firefox I'm sure that opera has
developer tools I'm sure that there's
someone out there that's using them and
I'm sure that person doesn't necessarily
work for opera or at least not anymore
and Safari oh look I don't have a Mac
I've heard they've got developer tools
as well I've heard that there yeah okay
but most people I know that are using
Mac's are not using a safari anyway so I
said I'm going to focus on the three
browsers that if we're doing development
we've been in Microsoft shots were
probably most likely having a
windows-based machine so chrome I edge
and Firefox so start the talk I want to
focus on the beloved console object hey
that's that's kind of I said the
catalyst for where this talk was we're
starting with the console and the
console dot log and I wanted to start
with what are the other things that we
can do with our console object it's
going to be more than just being able to
do a log statement and this is all the
different methods that we've got on the
console object this is currently running
in this is running in Chrome so this is
what we get if we do a four of loop
across console object we have a heap of
different things we do have our log
method hits it is in there but we have a
whole bunch of other things that are
useful for different kinds of
development that we're doing and
different kinds of debugging analysis so
we want to do one that I'm really
popular I find is really useful is the
debug.assert assert sorry console assert
what that does is it takes
two arguments at ruthie statement and a
message to output when that truth d
statement fails so we can littéraire
code base with this and have variable
tests or conditional any other
conditional tests we might have with the
inside of our application if that's
successful that statement is just
ignored we never get a message out it's
only when that's invalid that we get
that message out we're really good when
combined with test runners so that we we
we gettin our expect fails at the end of
the end of the test but what was the
information that we had leading up to
that what was some assumptions that we
had with inside of our code base that
resulted in that that we can output to
the to the user briefings really
powerful particularly when you start
playing into middle web based systems be
that react angular or any of the other
popular front-end frameworks that are
popular for the next half an hour until
we go write some new ones this afternoon
plug in something like a group that when
a method starts and ends we create a
group for that we can then put all
messages that happen after that be they
assert statements log statements info
warn etc etc they all fall under that
group and we can expand collapse hide
that group if we don't need to see that
information and look at other parts of
the debugging that we get timing is also
really useful if you want to do very
simple profiling against what's
happening with inside of your
application you start a timer started
tyrants now and stop the timer you give
a timer an ID so that they can be used
across multiple scopes with inside of an
application so you can profile as a
single function you can profile a
pipeline within your application and
table is actually one that I Eve always
forget is there and I'm console using
some why consult dr. and putting
information out table if you've got an
array of data and you've ever tried to
inspect that she's a large array of data
that you're looking at we're inside the
console and then you expand expand
expand expand its band and they're like
oh I should know have a look at the
second night of expand expand table
flattens that array down into a table of
data so that we can inspect that in a
whole lot easier manner so the way that
works so I've got a couple simple demos
here this one's combining groups and
different ways we can log out messages
so inside of here I have
the joys of doing live demo coding and
running something with inside of a
browser on a awesome Wi-Fi network is
whether or not your scripts actually run
in the background so here we go I've
done a I've got an edge a school that
happens it starts a new group which is
based off of the argument that passed in
all that as a group name could be
anything an aj schools responded and
I've table doubt that information
because I know it's going to be in a
rape you see this is a whole lot easier
than I just had that object structure
and I wanted to what is that would
handle or what is the email address
having to to look at each of those for
every individual person if I had a very
large data data set there I was working
with so this is and here we can start
see how groups can become useful because
I've now done two different requests and
I can see actually I'm no longer
interested in that one rather than
reload the page or clear the console or
something like that just hide that
information out so you can imagine in
obviously a larger application we're
executing a whole bunch of different
code a bunch of different groups that
represent the context of what we might
be interested in analyzing interesting
now putting into our log at their
console window at the end of the day
also got a timer that's been run starts
when the Ajax call starts and then
closes itself off from the age I school
call completes closing off that or
immediately just dumped out the the time
in milliseconds of that that took
generally speaking in between
milliseconds unless you've got really
like high network latency and you're
doing AJ's call or you've got a really
long running function so that sort of
information like this is a great way
that we can really enrich the way that
we can get information out of our
executing JavaScript to a debug window
essentially
so naturally this is browsers so there's
going to be some things that don't work
the same in every different in every
browser and we're going to have some
browser nuances a message a message
actually has some fewer features than
you see in some like Chrome or Firefox
predominantly things around timelines so
the timelines are for the profiling
tools that will have a look at a little
bit later there's a method called mark
timeline and it's also a listers time
stamp these allow you to put check marks
that will then appear with inside of
your profiling session so you can say
something particular happened to that
profiling point and you just want a
check mark so you can easily find that
point in time if you say doing a
minute-long profiling session you want
to seal a every 10 seconds you want a
timeline or you know you know that an
asynchronous calls happened at this
point in time you want to mark the
timeline of that so you can easily find
it back when you're an Eliza ng in your
process it also adds a method called
select so console dot select and that
allows you to then reselect an element
back into the into the the Dom Explorer
so if you're writing some code some kind
of operations happening you're just
executing that in so via script tag but
you want to know where that relationship
back is into the Dom node you want to be
able to like launch back across there
without having to use the inspector or
inspector option with inside the
devtools you can get that you can just
use the console codify everything rather
than having to use the mouse of it
amounts to go back and find things also
interestingly enough it binds methods
all the messes methods of console in
edge are bound to the console instance
and what I mean by that is let's say I
open up the dev tools here in Chrome so
I had an array of data and I just want
to I want to log each other out
individually or maybe more accurately i
want to just dump the each individual
item with inside of that crime actually
throws an exception because it gives you
a pretty poor exception message and
given Chrome's history of making really
good exceptional messages this is not
right I basically it doesn't understand
the scope because the this scope of
all has been lost because we've passed
in a reference to the function that
we're trying to evoke rather than an
actual invocation of said function
whereas if we're in say a message and
there we go we can kind of see that so
if I just do one two three and that same
thing again it's able to do that so this
means that so so with inside of our code
we could write a whole bunch of
shorthand aliases for the different
console methods that we might be using
and then just use that method on its own
inside of edge that will work inside of
the other browsers that actually won't
work you have to then do like your own
bind on top of that so as I said you get
I have not as great a error message if
you're using that in chrome you try and
just pass the method of across chrome
also gives you a warning if you use mark
timeline to try and put profiling points
in that's been obsoleted it's actually
been replaced by timestamp I'm not quite
sure the the reasoning behind that
they've changed mark timeline and
they've renamed it to timestamp the
chrome also doesn't have console dot
exception this appears in both firefox
and an edge it turns out that the reason
that that Sun in chrome is because
consult that exception was what Firebug
originally used for console instead of
console dot error they eventually
decided to normalize that as consult on
terror across dev tools but because edge
or Internet Explorer back in the day
originally implemented all the feature
set that was in fly like they've got
that carry on so consult on arrow and
cause a lot exception actually work
exactly the same way there there's
there's also a really interesting thing
that you can do if you ever been to
facebook and open up the devtools you
you'll get this big red error message
and and I only found out about that the
other day I don't tend to open up the
devtools one while i'm on facebook but
someone pointed out to me they're like
oh have you have you seen this error
message because what you can do is you
can actually style the console messages
that you're writing and this only works
in
chrome and I think in Safari I don't
have a safari answers that I can test
with that I've done a lovely red bit of
text with comic sans as the font because
comics fans out so that actually works
with this feature of console dot log and
this is actually a legitimately use of
console log I've got a message of I can
provide different kinds of strings and
different kind of strength for matters
so there's a % c formula that allows me
to pass in some CSS that I want applied
to that message that's being output now
the value that that's going to give you
inside your application I'm not entirely
sure I also did try and find out whether
or not it can access the stylesheet that
you've got running of the web page that
you're on because I really wanted to
make like a spinning console message
turns out you can't damn that was that
was really depressing for me and and I
blame the person that pointed this out
on Monday I was like hey that's really
cool i'm like damn it now i have to
debug facebook to work out how they've
done that so i can use it in my talk on
on wednesday firefox it actually gives
you a warning when using the console
methods in an unbound method like my
show before in chrome and tells you why
you've received that warning not just
invalid invocation which chrome gives
you it also ignores the mark time
timeline methods because it's been
Chrome's marks as it is obsolete Firefox
doesn't tell you it's absolutely just
flat-out ignores the calls so that's
something worthwhile knowing if you're
doing profiling of your application you
want to relate things by and do time
line marking always go with timestamp it
seems that mark timeline is deprecated
and some browsers just don't tell you
why or don't tell you this being
duplicated at all so how about the
console itself so the console object
that's that's available with inside of
your your execute JavaScript it doesn't
you don't actually have to have the
console open to see those messages or to
have those messages captured they'll
just be capturing the background
kind of buffered until you open up the
console but the console itself has a
couple of interesting things that it
does the first one is that for every
element that you inspect inside of the
Dom inspector it creates a numbered
reference for that dollar zero will
always represent the current element
that's selected in the Dom inspector
dollars the zero plus one or that
reference the one before and so on and
so forth all the way up to two dollars
in so let's come through and inspect an
ailment we go come down and pick that Li
jump back to the console clear off our
lovely Comic Sans message but for dollar
zero there ever is the DLI so i can now
let's say i had jquery inside of here or
something like that i might want to
interact with that Dom element I can
pass it through to a jQuery selector if
I'm using this in an angular application
it makes it a whole it easier to say
find the find something that's got scope
on it and then pass that through to the
the angular help that I can then inspect
scope rather than having to like write
an element selector query myself with
inside of the console dollars one
represents the body tag because that's
what I had selected prior to to finding
that Li and all those two doesn't exist
yet because I haven't gone I've only
selected two items so far zero current
arm and then one being the the one that
I had before that so now that's not
useful that's across all browsers and
and really really handy and i've i've
been doing demos to working with web
developers and showing them that and
they're just like what kind of magic is
this like where did like where did you
define della zero i'm like it but you
didn't know that's actually just built
into the console so that's available
there that's not available with inside
of a running script just because the
running script doesn't have context of
the debug the dev tools in terms of
browsing nuances we have this lovely one
where in all browsers except for edge
hitting escape hides and shows the
console because you someone has to be
different in that kind of thing so say
I'm on the the elements panel I can
escape and bring up the console so that
I can work with those in context of each
other edge users can control backtick
that actually
does work inside of chrome as well I can
bring up but control back tick inside of
chrome doesn't make it go away so yeah I
don't know why there's that stupid
difference but it great for muscle
memory where we have to have two
different things that we remember
alright so so on to debugging yeah being
able to put all these messages that just
execute why I can't well application is
executing is great but sometimes you
actually gonna have to debug code every
now and then we do right bug zone I know
generally speaking we try not to but
let's be real codes for bugs source maps
is something that's been growing in it's
the accessibility of it over the last
couple of years essentially a source map
is debugging symbols for JavaScript or
CSS so if you're using a compile to
language so SAS or less for CSS you
probably want to debug where you
originally wrote and that's the point of
a source map is that it will give you
that translation back because if we've
used though if you use SAS or less or
any of the other compile to see assess
languages there things like nesting and
variables and all those kinds of things
are really powerful but what does that
actually become at the end of the day in
our CSS selectors with JavaScript let's
if were you using a compile to language
like typescript or heaven forbid
CoffeeScript or you're using some kind
of library light react on the JFX syntax
which is just not valid JavaScript
that's not going to run in the browser
we want to be able to debug that
original code similarly then we have
this ability to do multi-level source
maps which is where we take the source
map of compiled to JavaScript language
which is then passed to a min afire so
we have this just one single line of
JavaScript which we're serving out to
our users which was actually made up of
50 files originally some of those files
weren't written in traditional
JavaScript language they're written in
something else we've compiled down we
want to be able to debug that original
set of code and that's the point of
source maps and multi-level source maps
essentially they're like PT bees for
JavaScript and CSS so from a from a net
analogy there what your pdb would be
it's not that one I want ok so i've got
an angular certain a react application
here it does some lovely things but
if I come across to here inside of my
rights in that out a touch because they
need a little bit more screen real
estate so I'm using webpack to do my
bundling minification here and doing all
the dependency management it also does
the trans piling and all that sort of
fun stuff now I have bundle jeaious
which is this large file that is what I
what a what I'm actually executing the
browser but I have this node here with
inside of the source explorer which
gives me a representation here's all the
files that I originally started with i
have appt jsx which is the the code that
i originally wrote and you can see that
this is jsf syntax this is not valid
JavaScript it's been compiled down so I
can put a breakpoint here and I can hit
a break point with inside of this code
that I originally wrote which is no
that's been converted into heavens knows
what at the end of the day but i can
still debug this as though it was the
original code I wrote this could be
really this is just save my house so
many times particularly if you have
source Maps you put those into
production you've served out this minify
to combine javascript file its that
would be a nightmare to try and debug
well I can use the original debugging
symbols and I get that back a nice thing
about the edge devtools relative to the
the other browsers is debug that's the
one I wanted oh is that there really
zoomed in at the moment really zoomed in
so if I've got I've got my source Maps
turned on here and they don't have like
the web pack whole thing here they just
have this no domain so let's go and find
my particular file put that break point
there again hit reload collapse that bit
down all right so it's flawless hear
that it's detected that there is a
source map and you're viewing the the
source map file I can turn that off and
this is the code that's actually running
in the browser so i can go back and have
a look so what's the actual code i find
this useful for is working out what is
the
what is the code the browser's actually
running not necessarily the code that I
wrote because while I have a lot of
faith in the code that i right and I
have a lot of faith in compiler authors
sometimes I want to understand precisely
what they've done so it's very easy in
edge to flip back and forth between
source map and non source map in chrome
you have to go into the settings you
disable source wipes and you have to
close and open the dev tools again which
can be a problem because you lose
context for debugging you break out of
your debugging scenario to go back and
forth between those two things there we
go another feature of the debugger that
I find people really don't seem to be
aware of is trace points now trace
points are actually an MS edge feature
so if you're a dot net developer you're
probably familiar with the concept of
trace points from Visual Studio the idea
is that you is a thing like a break
point but instead of pausing your
application at that point in code that
point in time it executes a bit of code
in context the idea is that you would be
wanting to put out some some log
information or something like that and
that's the and you've added that at
runtime to your application while you're
doing your debugging rather than having
to stop your application add that
statement in and then restart your
application that's that's the point of
trace points but I said it's actually
features it's only in ms edge but we can
actually simulate trace points by using
conditional breakpoints in the other
browsers now this is a thing that we can
exploit by the way all the console
methods return and undefined now in
JavaScript an undefined is a faulty
value point of a conditional breakpoint
is will only break when something
results is true so if we execute a
console method so the log order or a
certain something like that it returns
undefined that evaluates is false so a
conditional breakpoint doesn't stop so
we can always tell you so we can have
these air they're always executing don't
just never pulls our application I I
find that it's a really good exploit or
start an exploit of the way the debugger
works so if we were to say chuck in a
conditional breakpoint here and just to
console dot this stop props about the
props so this is executed then in
context of that function without that
chunk of code that you're pointing at
the scope that you're in so you've got
access to the the variables that are
there that this scope you won't have
access to closures that things outside
of the closure scope that you haven't
previously used with inside of that
function so I I wouldn't have inside of
this particular method access to the
actions that i'm importing on line two
because i'm not using that already with
inside of my render method you see a
conditional Bray point break point the
turns orange if i run this
I have something that stumped out here
and that's the insight into our our
props of my right react render method
this is also a slightly more complex
example of using groups so groups can
have nested groups with inside of the
debugger sorry with inside of the
console so I've created some stuff
that's that's nested and nested and
nested so I can collapse down groups
that I'm only I'm only interested in not
the one called on to fine but load
people and it's all complete the another
thing that we can do with conditional
break points so we can actually execute
multiple things by exploiting another
feature of Java which is the comma
operator so i can use comma to chain up
a bunch of statements and the last
statement in that is the one that gets
returned so i could do say another mess
of the method Oh NDC execute that reload
so now I've got no to two statements
that have been done so i could i can if
i knew i had something that was in a an
array of data right into a console table
and then i could do a consult der or a
concert after that because i want to
have other things that execute and I
want them all done with inside of that
single line I could also do something
like I could start an open I could open
a group at the start of this render
method oops oh and just remove a
conditional great point I can do open a
group called render and we'll also do a
time called render because I want to
know how long this render method is
going to take and then down there here's
one I prepared earlier it ends that
console time and will also close that
group and render reload that so there's
no each of our indicus so these are also
being fired off by react they're
automatically we're just being able to
inspect those suffering because it's all
codes it's just running within context
of that function that we had had
executing and we're able to hijack that
add things that we want to add down
specifically
just my code or black boxing depending
on which browser dev tools you're
working with they're essentially the
same thing again it's if you're familiar
if you from a dotnet background you're
probably familiar with the concept of
just my code in visual studio
essentially this gives us the ability to
ignore particular script files with
inside of our application that we don't
want to debug into who's who's ever
accidentally hit f11 while they're
bugging something and stepped into the
core of angular or the core of jQuery on
oh here we go tried to step back out and
then realize that you're stuck with
inside of like three methods DPM bucket
f5 i'm going to start again to just my
code or black boxing depending on which
browser you're referring to allows you
to mark files as things that you don't
want to debug into so just collapse that
down a little bit and inside of here we
have some scripts and you'll see that we
have a little iphone against jquery ms
edge there's a whole bunch of detection
about known libraries or known third
parties files that you'd be likely to
use with inside of you go things like
jquery angular bootstrap react etc and
by default it will turn them into
library code so things that were
immediately ignored now if I hit that
the arcana that goes away and I can now
step into j.crew if I wanted to but when
it's marked as library code let's just
zoom back out we'll pop a break point
there I'll start that and then if I
hitch step into it immediately steps
over that that particular function
because I didn't actually I didn't want
to step into that selector call i can
now step into code this so this is my
own code that I've written so I video
step into I go into that the other
interesting thing is if we have a look
at our call stack you'll see that we
have library code so
the anonymous function is where we just
came from but then we have library code
so that's so this is where execution has
come from something that I I've marked
as library of marked as the black box
and I don't want to step into if I come
through in turn off library code on
jQuery we now see that we have the
expanded call stack to I had to method
calls with inside of jQuery that
happened that I was able to that I could
have debugged into if I wanted to but I
don't want to so I can mark that as a
library so that's that's in both edge
and chrome chronicles of black boxing
edge calls adjust my code for a doubly
because the guys that are at the edge
dev tools are the same people that write
the ones in visual studio so performance
tools now this is something that's
you're not going to use these tools
until you need to use these tools and
it's it's like windbg you've always
forgotten how you use the last time
because you only use it that fairly
infrequently I have a random be with
inside of my coat with inside of my
slides excellent that's that's not meant
to be there but ok so the idea between
performance snapshots is that we want to
execute something with inside of
application we we know it might be it
might be taking a bit longer than it
should be taking but we don't know
precisely what it's doing that's
becoming really slow so how do we work
out where where our app is spending time
well we just reload this page here have
a very lovely demo is it you know I
click on something that should have
happened a whole lot fast like moving
those around particular on the first
request so to do that I've got the
performance tab within sight of edge and
we've got the same tools exist within
side of all the evergreen browsers I'm
just more more familiar with the edge
ones but now there's there's stuff in
chrome that has some slightly different
features but ultimately they they're
attempting to achieve the same thing
which is showing you what's happening
within South Dakota and being able to
inspect where time
spent just going to start this up and
hit that and then hit stop so we can see
that over the over the course of the
three and a half seconds between me
hitting start button and then stop we
had not a whole lot happened except we
have this big thing here in the middle
and that's thing that's of most interest
to us so let's just zoom into here and
pop that up into a full screen so now
we've narrowed down the timeline to a
thing that I've noticed with the inside
of my performance run that is of
interest to me that so something's
happened here in it's taken a bit longer
or it's it's indicated that there might
be a performance bottleneck in here I
can start having a look at what's
happened with inside of of that
particular point in time so there is an
indentation graph which is what happened
over time and how long things took it's
fairly similar visualization to what you
get with inside of the network tools in
all the different browsers if you're
watching all the incoming requests let's
narrow it down a little bit further
clear out that white space so we see we
have something down here that took a
long time and it's it's highlighting the
different kinds of events that happened
so this is a paint event so it's it's
caused by visual changes of the doms
edge is telling us like what this
particular thing is doing and that's
made up of finally the root element and
then essentially a series of cascading
CSS updates we also have something it
took a little bit time up the top here
which is a style calculation which is me
interacting with the button we have some
layout stuff that was happening and then
if you can see the the web page behind
me it would actually selecting the
appropriate element as I inspect through
all this stuff but on this kind of
resolution it was going to be kind of
challenging to look at all of that
together and this gives us a good idea
of okay well this is where my
application spent time and start having
a look at the JavaScript call stack and
looking at what took time with inside of
that now admittedly this isn't a
particularly complex application with a
complex bit of code but we can see that
ninety-six percent of the time was spent
with inside of this particular method
and the majority of it was inside of
stuff like this which is it's been a lot
of time doing CSS interactions so doing
some jquery CSS stuff so we start
drilling down to where things happen we
can see that like the file that happened
within I can jump through to a
particular line of code where that first
started in chrome this will also give
you a time at the different lines of
code of like how long those talk so like
performance snapshots then related back
to the code of like this line of code
took half a half a millisecond around
this line of code took a millisecond to
run those those sorts of useful things
that you can you can use to to cross to
correlate between what's happening in
your running application and what you're
able to observe through performance
metrics if you're using something like
the the console port time stamp those
will appear with that with check marks
across this on an edge though there's
edge doesn't support that stuff by
random be okay so haven't certainly
unique features things are only existing
in different different browsers then the
sum of the different browsers have some
features that only exist with inside of
themselves with inside of their dev
tools and there's kind of the top the
top view that I like so i'll start with
firefox so we actually haven't really
had a look of firefox yet mostly because
the dev tools in firefox are very
similar to the stuff that you get in
chrome you I differences but
functionality wise pretty much the same
but there is one feature that using the
Firefox dev tools that I really like and
I have been known to use quite a lot
because it's here it's save me from a
fairly big annoyance that I have and
that's being able to execute multi-line
code so if you say you've got a file you
just want to like how does that run i
want to buy execute just a chunk of code
see what happens and interact with a
page or just new test something out
Firefox is this feature called a scratch
pad so rather than trying to do this
multi line on this one tiny little beer
with inside of the console window as you
would in
chrome or a dressing like that firefox
gives us a lovely big editor for that
okay so with this on firefox we have to
go into settings by default they turn
off a bunch of their stuff one of the
things they turn off is scratch bed I've
turned it on and it then becomes a new
that's right I forget the new settings
actually becomes a panel you have to
click off it whereas I'm used to Chrome
where you just close the settings /
settings tab so scratch pad is this
point here zoom that out here so we have
this lovely big editor surface great for
like I said creating big chunks of code
that you want to execute and test
against it also so it executes in
context of the page so you can access
the DOM and interact with that but it
can also just execute as a standalone
script I'm not going to use it in
context of the page so I'll just pop it
out into a full window it gives you it's
got some comments in there that talk
about what the scratchpad does how you
how you use it control our to
immediately execute something you can
also then have an inline inspector of
the coder you're executing so you don't
have to keep trying to write to to
console if you want to do anything you
can run something in life so far as to
create a person first aim of her own
last name look I can't even spell my own
last name that's how say on the ball am
today now if I was just do person and
then do control I I'm i get an inspector
of that object so I can have a look at
that I can play around with the the
objects that that's there and have a
look at what's what's in it this is this
is good if I'm say doing an AJAX call
and I want to just see the response of
that I can have a look at that I've got
a filter here so I could type down first
name and it removes all the properties
that match that alternatively I can do
so that's control i will give me the
inspector control l will call to string
on whatever the last statement is and
inside of a comment which is really
useful for the most of most of the
things we're doing in JavaScript because
we yet object object because that's what
to string gives us for our for pretty
much anything other than just a comp as
simple value so ever did the first name
last name and then did and now get my
actual AI get something useful there but
if I just did the the object as you saw
we get back nothing of particular use I
can load up an existing JavaScript file
surfer I have been working something
inside of inside of code or inside of a
dab'll whatever my editor of choices and
I want to test that running a copy of
pace back and forth i can just load that
file up now makes it a whole lot easier
i'm going to write code in here and just
save it straight out so that's really
useful one of the downsides of this is
if I had something that was executing
within the loop so I'm just going to
create a function I've created a
generator function that will yield twice
and I want to be able to inspect like
what would happen when that generator
function executes so so I've got
something that's essentially executing
asynchronously and I want to see each of
the values each time through 4x of and
if I did that and then do console
control L it only gives me at the last
execution because it's the last
statement that gets run with inside of
the code that that's what it puts inside
of the comment similarly if I didn't
control I the output that I do have
console dot I can do console dot log
oops oh no control art that's right so I
can run that but now I have to jump back
to the console tab and I see the values
to get executed air so I can inspect it
inside of that instead of a so that's it
that's one of the that's one of the
downsides of the the scratchpad is that
anything that is done with inside of a
loop you then going to have to kind of
swap back forth between tools but we do
have the comp lit and and we can do
split view escape doesn't actually work
with insider scratch read because the
escape it does have intellisense and
gate collapses your intelligence and so
nuances between them that i find this i
said really useful for trying to test
out large chunks of code as opposed to
trying to squish it into a single line
of code here and then realize that that
doesn't work and will collapse that off
is that um there's another feature of
Firefox I will bring it up and I will
make sure that i have my in on mute I do
have my thing on mute excuse me which is
a Web Audio dev tools let me just
reattach that on to the site where was
the demo ahead oh yes i ah oh so the Web
Audio dev tools ok I will be very
careful about using them because if
you've done anything with Web Audio
you've got to be essentially executing
something inside of a loop or otherwise
you get this high-pitched squealing
noise because it's just playing one
single sound the Web Audio inspector
will show you the chain of audio
elements that you've got connected to be
able to interact with what your
oscillator is what your your pitch
modification is and what your audio
destination is this is useful if you're
say building a game or building some
kind of application that has audio
functionality to be able to interact
back and forth with um but it's a little
bit difficult to demo as I said I don't
want to blow anyone's use your arms out
today so come find me afterwards if you
if you're interested in web audio and
you want and I can do that and somewhere
that won't have quite as high pitch I am
quite as surround sound so on to
everyone's darling browser of
development browser of choice which is
chrome now I I can spend it like an
entire talk just talking about the cool
things about the the chrome dev tools so
we've got like their ability to do
mobile device now testing is fantastic
it's it's second to none
well no it's it's second to actually
testing on a device but they have a
whole bunch of other really unique and
interesting features that they promote
really well but one feature that I've
found that they don't promote promote
particularly well is this idea Dom
mutation events it's on mutation event
basically it gives us the ability to
attach a debugger when something happens
with inside of the browser DOM and this
could be something that's very
frustrating particularly if you're
dealing with a job from UI framework
like angular or you know whatever
elements are appearing or removing from
the dummy like Hannah say why did that
go away I expected that elements still
to be there what caused that to vanish
so jump over to something here and now I
have something that's just executing and
I have items that are appearing on
Turing I want to work out well what's
causing those those to appear with
inside of the Dom now I know that
something is happening here here's one
that I prepared earlier but I know that
something is happening to that UL there
is some bit of code there's modifying
that you well that is then that is then
causing its tree to change so i can
right click on the element and go to a
pitch down here called brighter and says
break on I can break on different kinds
of things and break on a modification to
the subtree so do that we go what
amenity that attaches a break point that
is just waiting for something happen to
that that Dom element and any of the
children of that I found ok cool here is
what's happened it's gone and we're
doing an append child right here so I
haven't had to work out where this line
of code is chrome knows where that line
of code is by virtue of the fact that
I'm calling a pen child and can pause
when that happens take me straight to
that line of code and now it's just as
though I had stuck a breakpoint right in
this particular point in time as soon as
you attach Dom breakpoint you get a new
tab with inside of your element
inspector which is dumb break points
which shows you the ones that you've got
so on
going to turn that off because otherwise
it's going to break every second and
that will be really frustrating when
you've got Dom break points to find you
end up with a blue icon against that
element with inside of the inspector
there are two other kind of dumb break
points that we can set attribute
modification so save though classes are
getting added or removed other
attributes to getting modified for
whatever reason you can pause when those
happen so you get to automatically break
when you're those sorts of things happen
so it does have to be sub free it can
also be that similarly you've got node
removal so when that element is removed
from the the Dom you want to pause on
that because hang on so why did that
element go away and again that can be
really useful with you if you're using a
I can Auto binding system such as you
find with inside of angular all right
let's close that because I don't need to
continuously tick away in the background
yeah a message a message is it's still
kind of playing a little bit of catch-up
in terms of devtools they're pretty much
on par in terms of the common features
but in terms of unique features is
there's one really interesting unique
feature that i think i saw was popping
up with inside of a chrome canary build
but i can't remember and i couldn't find
where i swear i think i saw that so
maybe I was dreaming about browser dev
tools and yeah that's my life and the
idea and this is I'm the ability to
track changes with inside of your style
editor so as someone who does a lot of
front-end web development and if you're
trying to make something pixel perfect
you're modifying CSS rules and it's like
sweet it's done what did I change f5
start again start writing down as I do
that as I did the changes so I will use
this page that I've got open here which
is going to be lovely and terrible to
try and interact with so let's just
reload that page I seem to have break
points tool set
f8 continue on okay so yeah the dev
tools not working so this is one of the
other unique features of the msh dev
tools is the ability to not render a dom
explorer i'm not quite sure why they've
added this feature I find it a little
bit of a hindrance to particular when
I'm doing demos but you know they have
that feature there kudos to them I would
really like it if they remove that
feature so let's just try that again all
right there we go we've got a dumb
Explorer excellent will zoom too far
okay so let's find this particular
element with inside of our Dom tree and
and I want to put some styles on that
color of this is the one color that I
always remember off the top my head that
is very obvious in standout ish which is
f0a it's a lovely fuchsia shade remember
that one or the other the other color
always remember is a bad ass yeah ok so
I've done that actually well let's put
it let's create a new rule against its
create a rule against all L eyes and
that will have a font family of comic
sans ms because Comic Sans ah that's not
right dad I can't really what it is off
the top my head Oh cosmic sense um it
sounds there we go yeah ok sweet so I've
done a whole bunch of CSS changes it
looks amazing my applications ready to
ship production with this badass color
scheme and it's Comic Sans but I need to
like I need to work out what was changed
so there's this changes tab the that's
with inside of the inspector and click
on to that and I guess well here's all
the star rules that we had so green ones
the things that have been inserted if I
came up to the body styles let's remove
that width I'll see down here I've got
something red that was removed
let's do a padding top 2 30 and we can
so we get a very accurate looking def
like this is a diff that you were kind
of see with inside of any young any
decent diff tools rather the red-green
color scheme the one downside of this
it's a feature request that I've made
when I've been talking to the guys that
work on f12 is I love a way that I could
export this as a JSON file or something
other than I can copy and paste this but
the problem is that as soon as i'm going
to copy and paste that i'm going to get
padding twice and i got to just then
remove the ones that and no longer
relevant i'm also gonna get the width
still there because well it's been
removed and copy and paste doesn't
understand that concept of a rule I'd
love some way that I could export this
file or export this deer for click a
button and have it sink back back to my
original source file particularly its
source maps and all tracks I don't know
how they do that with additions been
here that's not my problem so that's
their problem solve Shh the last feature
if I can remember where it is so the the
last feature of ms edge devtools i feel
just wild let them open talk about that
is this this special type of break point
so that they've got trace points which
is now a special ish type of brave point
they also have another one here which is
called ad I'm just gonna remove these so
I get some better more space so it's
it's a xhr break point so if I add this
this will automatically pause my
application when an XML HTTP request
comes back when Ajax call completes rats
it it seems like it's not been wired up
to fetch I've just started converting
all my code across using the fetch API
instead of the traditional xhr so don't
like jquery ajax and stuff like that it
seems that that doesn't break on it on
edge Don fetch sorry this is really
useful though say you're using the the
Ainge
the HTTP service using jQuery to do aj
school stuff like that i can stick that
and that will cause the application to
break when any xhr comes back so you
don't have to go hunting through your
code to work out so it's as soon as that
request is finished it will pause your
application and you can then start
debugging from that point in time that's
all I had for for today left a couple
minutes for questions or feel free to
run off and get in the queue for food
for before the next session starts um
I'll be I'll be around for the rest of
the week feel free to pop by ask me
questions I'll be at the red flag booth
for most the time or shadow questions
now but thank you yes so I deliberately
didn't talk about browser extensions and
dev tool extensions here because that's
opening up a can of worms with react
apps the reactive tools from facebook
are really really good they give you a
great visualization of your virtual Dom
if you're combining react with Redux the
Redux dev tools are also really
fantastic actually this is a react
application so i can bring that up
previously so this is the this is the
reactive tools from facebook gives me a
visualization my virtual Dom related
back to the the physical Dom so i can as
you see inspect through back here but
you also see my component hierarchy that
i've got i think this is a yeah this is
a redux application but I don't have the
dentals enabled in that but that's
that's also really good if you if you
can money react with redux there's
similar tools for angular the angular
battering if you're using that that's
pretty good it works for the most part
it just it has some really bad issues
with them with tracking updates that
happen and displaying those and and
expanding collapsing objects with inside
of itself and they just I'm not a big
angular fan now it's that's a rant for
another day
cool thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
