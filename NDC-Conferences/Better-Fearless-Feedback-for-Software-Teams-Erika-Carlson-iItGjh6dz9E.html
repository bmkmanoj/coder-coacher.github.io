seat there's still a couple down front
and I promise I don't spit first I want
to thank you all so much for being here
this is one of my favorite conferences
in the entire world it's the first
International Conference I still get
last year I got to go to NBC London
earlier this year so this is a wonderful
conference series and you see I really
appreciate you having me and I really
appreciate all of you for being in here
multitrack conferences are so hard
because especially when there's eight
tracks going on I want to be at like six
other talks right now I'm really excited
to give this one but I also want to be
at like another six so thank you so much
for choosing to spend some time here
with me and to talk about feedback this
is me America I am EA Carlson everywhere
on the internet that you might care
about I am a software engineer I started
out as a web developer with a back-end
Java developer primarily an iOS
developer these days and I work at a
wonderful little company called Detroit
labs in Detroit Michigan
we make primarily iOS and Android
applications and we're mobile
consultancy so my primary job there now
actually is not just to write code
anymore my big job is to run our
apprenticeship and train programs
we created our apprenticeship program
about three years ago when we were
having a hard time hiring enough mobile
developers I always say this mobile
developers can get paid a lot of money
and they can get paid a lot of money to
work somewhere that it's not winter 9
months out of the year so we were
struggling to hire enough people and we
thought okay teaching and learning is a
huge part of our culture the huge part
of who we are what we do every day what
if we could hire people who have all the
things that we look for in developers
they have curiosity great persistence a
love for learning collaborative skills
and they just don't know how to be
developers yet and so we did we hired 10
of those people and we created a
three-month program to train them to
become developers we paid them during
the program we hired them as full-time
team members at the end and I think we
had we hired six out of that first group
of ten we did another program in a fall
we did I OS the first program we taught
Android in the fall we hired 12 people
and we kept them all we hired them all
full-time at the end of the program
so since then we've done another iOS
program we've done JavaScript programs
we've actually even done a QA program
and this is my job is to run this
program it takes people who have no
prior experience and move them into
professional roles in software it's a
big part of why I'm giving this talk so
before we get started I wanted to
establish a shared definition of
feedback so we'll do that we'll talk
about why feedback is important to teams
I think it's really important I'm going
to tell you why we're going to talk
about why teams struggle with giving and
receiving feedback and then we're going
to get to the big purpose of my talk
which is how do we get better at giving
and receiving feedback as people and as
teams and there's this last piece just
how do I know I have a really weird and
varied background before I got into
software my background is in psychology
and my job was to mediate and help
people figure out how to get divorced it
was less fun than it sounds but I
learned so much about communication and
feedback and what we hear versus what we
say I have about 15 years of experience
as an orchestral and chamber musician
which is a whole different way of giving
and receiving feedback and then I have
the job that I have now which is
building software and teaching people to
build software teaching is a constant
exercise in feedback when I'm talking to
a roomful of people just like you right
now I'm looking and I'm looking at your
faces and do you seem interested and are
you leaning forward now you're nodding
your head or smile you're laughing at my
really bad jokes which thank you so far
and if you're not then I have to change
I have to modify what I'm doing to make
you engaged and to give you value from
what I'm doing so I am constantly
receiving feedback as a teacher I'm also
constantly giving it because to become a
software developer in three months is
like kind of a funny joke right like
really we just we get them to the very
very beginning of where they have to be
in their career but it's so much to
learn it's enormous
and so I constantly have to give
feedback and adjust and say do this
differently change this in your code
change this in how you collaborate
change this change this change this so
giving feedback is basically my job
one more thing before I jump in here
this is a talk about what I've learned
which is a lot from all those different
contexts over all of those years but
what I've learned works for me and
sometimes doesn't and might work for you
and sometimes might not so I would
encourage you with this top to do what I
would encourage you to do with feedback
which is take what's useful to you and
leave the rest all right having said
that I like shared definitions because I
like us to all be on the same page
before I jump into this stuff so when I
talk about feedback here's what I'm
saying
I think of feedback as a response to a
person's behavior performance that we
share with them either to increase their
awareness to improve their field of
vision or to shape and change their
behavior or both and these are the types
of feedback we're going to talk about
the first one affirmative feedback is
the fun one for the most part you'll
also hear me say positive feedback
interchangeably with affirmative
feedback and this is the good stuff this
is when we say yes I love that do more
of that
then there's the scary one I say
constructive feedback instead of
negative feedback because negative
feedback scares people constructive
feedback still scares people so does
really helped me all that much but you
know sometimes I call it gross feedback
if I'm feeling really touchy-feely and
that still doesn't seem to help so this
is always a scary one this is where we
say that was not so great don't do that
again do it differently this last one I
won't talk about a lot in this talks but
I feel like it's important to bring out
passive feedback is the feedback that
we're always giving if we are not
actively saying yes or no we're still
saying something we're saying that was
great but not good enough that I'm going
to encourage you to repeat it or that
was bad but not so bad that I'm going to
you know let a young I'm just gonna let
it go
so we're condoning bad behavior if we
don't care enough to call it out and we
are not encouraging good behaviors we
don't care enough to say something about
it
so even if you aren't doing anything you
are giving feedback if we focus on these
first two types of feedback we minimize
undesirable passive feedback which is
why I'm going to focus on these two in
my talk but it's worthy of note but even
when you think you're not giving
feedback you probably are Isis junior
developers which means that I teach them
a lot of really abstract concepts that
they may or may not care about at this
stage in their lives and so we learn how
to write a for loop and we say yeah we
can write a for loop and then they go
okay why do I care so my lecture slides
are now full of these slides that say
why does it matter why do I care that
you can write a for loop why do I care
that you know what a linked list is so
here's your why does it matter slide I
think feedback is the best thing we've
got to make team performance better we
want to build great things we want to
build great things quickly and I think
feedback lets us build better things
faster it improves their communication
it helps us trust each other it helps us
collaborate better it makes our
problem-solving faster I think about
problems in kind of two big categories I
think about problems in terms of
mosquito problems and monster problems a
mosquito problem is when I met mine at
my desk and I have my headphones on and
I'm really deep into something and I'm
super focused and I've been that way for
like 90 minutes and somebody comes over
and taps me on the shoulder might feel
like a monster for a minute because like
I was right there I almost had the thing
but I'll take my headphones off and say
okay yeah what do you need now that
person does that 14 times in like two
hours then it's not a mosquito problem
anymore then it's a big problem the 15th
time they might get yelled at so
problems would start small get bigger if
we don't address them if I don't say it
any one of those 14 points hey my
headphones on is the signal that I'm
trying to focus I want to help you but
can we figure out a way for you to
communicate with me that does not
disrupt the flow of my work that's all I
got to say most of us don't say that
though so um we're neighbor season my
job is to help teams
are struggling and one of the first
times I did this with the team of 23
developers which is a problem all by
itself and they were really really
struggling they were kind of like they
were all down in the fifth floor of our
space and the rest of us were all about
six and nobody wanted to go down there
because they were all so mad each other
all of the time and nobody could talk
and certainly nobody could work together
and so a colleague of mine of mine and I
were asked to go in and facilitate and
try to improve the situation for them so
we spent a whole day together mostly we
let them talk and as they talked and as
they told us about the problems they
were having the challenges they were
encountering every time somebody would
tell a story all I could think was this
would not even be an issue right now if
it had been addressed the first time or
the second time or maybe even a 17th
time we were at the like 85th time at
this point so we were way past the point
of helpful intervention but feedback
helps those little problems not become
big big toxic scary problems that damage
your team and why is it hard first of
all is it hard I'm going to say yes I'm
going to say yes because every single
person I've ever asked has said to me to
send some some form yes I find feedback
to be hard to give and or hard to
receive it's hard for me and it 'smoke
basically my entire job it's my job to
give and receive feedback and it's my
job to teach people to give and receive
feedback so my whole days are filled
with feedback and I still struggle when
I have to have a hard conversation I
still lose sleep about it I still avoid
it for a day or two if I can so it's
hard feedbacks hard for teams because
feedback is hard for people giving and
receiving feedback are skills they are
both complex skills now the good news is
that because their skills they can be
learned but most of us don't get the
chance to learn them or practice them
they're also hard for this reason I have
a whole list of words up here that
giving them feeds receiving feedback
effectively require and they are
openness maturity and self-awareness
encouraged and vulnerability and
confidence interest no big deal right
how about you guys but like I have
trouble with some of those in a
relationship the people that I love the
most in my closest relationship some of
those things are still challenging for
me let alone with my coworkers let alone
in a professional context this stuff is
hard and I think that you can
acknowledge that it's hard and then
still move forward and say but we can be
better the words fearless is in my title
which is kind of a misnomer because if
there is a way to eliminate fear I have
not found it and if you have found it
please come tell me after this talk but
that's okay I think fearlessness is less
about eliminating fear than looking it
in the face
I had this project manager who was this
wonderfully bubbly upbeat person and she
would come in whenever we had a big
issue like the client wants this now
where the deadline just got backed up
two weeks or you guys blew this entire
thing up and took down production and we
don't know why and she would come in and
she would say we have an opportunity and
I hated it so soon but I think she was
right because when I look at my biggest
fears
I see the places where my life could
change three years ago two of my biggest
fears were getting on airplanes let
alone actually being on them led to
anything and talking in front of people
and now I fly around the world and I
talk to people like this and it's
amazing and I have learned so much and
met so many people and I have changed
and I have grown and my life looks
totally different from how I would have
pictured it without those experiences so
I think fears are clues they are clues
as how you can be amazing we do this
thing
where we say to ourselves I'm just not
good at that I'm just scared of that
I'll always be scared of that that's who
I am that's crap my sister moved to
Finland five years ago and I said guess
I'll see you when you come back to the
States because I'm really afraid to get
on airplanes really like one of the most
important people in my life I was going
to not see as much because I was too
scared because that's who I am
fears are very very real I don't want to
undermine Matt there were times when I
got on airplanes and I was a hundred
percent sure I was going to die like
completely convinced even though in some
rational part of my brain I knew that
was probably not true I still really
believed it and it was terrifying my
heart race and you know I got sweaty and
Sierra and all this stuff
tears are real but they're not
irrevocable we can change them we can
learn to manage them I give you a little
fear inventory that I use here these are
the questions now that I ask myself when
I feel myself resisting something
because I am scared and giving feedback
can be scary and receiving feedback can
be really scary and I say okay what am I
afraid of it might be I'm afraid of this
conversation and then it's what am I
really afraid of and if I'm receiving
feedback I'm really afraid that I'm not
doing as well as I think I'm probably
going to get fired every conversation
with my boss I convince myself that I'm
going to get fired like been five years
hasn't happened yet and yet or maybe the
underlying fear is this person is going
to perceive me as me this person is
going to be hurt by what I say to them
they are going to think that I don't
care about them because I have to give
them this constructive feedback and then
I say okay what could I do about it
in the case of airplanes and conferences
it was submit to a CFP and take a xanax
and then what could I gain I couldn't
have imagined what I could gain from
overcoming those particular fears but
it's been incredible I told you about it
you can gain a lot by opening
communication with your team by stepping
out into that scary vulnerable place
where you say here's what I really think
and I want to know what you really say
and how you really feel what you can
gain is incredible so if you were about
to hit that post lunch coma and fell
asleep five minutes from now at least
you got to this slide so good job you
good feedback is specific to be
effective it's got to be specific nobody
benefits from you did a good job that
feels great and if you want to tell me
that up at the top I will be super happy
to hear it but it doesn't tell me what I
did or what I should try to do in the
future and if you say to somebody that
could have been better
that doesn't help them either tell them
what tell them why and tell them how
good feedback is thoughtful if you
approach feedback as a collaborative
process between you and another person
instead of you dumping your opinion on
them and leaving you will find that they
are more open more receptive more
willing to take that feedback and work
with it and this is the hard one for me
good feedback is direct we'll talk more
about that in a little bit good feedback
is structured this is not my structure I
did not invent this as research back
then a lot of people use this but the
structure is this we name a specific
situation we name a specific behavior or
several and we say here is the outcome
of that behavior in that situation so
here's something that I might say to a
client project manager hey we were on
that phone call today and you told the
team that our demo was really great you
told us how it was really great and that
really inspired the team and they are
going to give you killer demos from now
on yay for everybody
and here's constructive in that meeting
yesterday I felt like every time I
opened my mouth you kept interrupting me
or talking over me and that was
frustrating and hurtful so these are
pieces of feedback affirmative and
constructive where we give a specific
situation we name a behavior and then we
say the outcome
with that overview I'm going to jump
into strategies on the topic of
fearlessness I think that one of the
best ways to fight fear is information I
learned for example that I am actually
much safer in an airplane than a car
which is not great for my daily car
driving experience but was great better
for the airplane right so this talk is
full of information
it's full of strategies that you can
take and apply to these very tough
skills and these scary situations and
hopefully make them a little bit easier
so there are 10 and the first one is
this you will notice that we start with
strategies for receiving feedback that's
intentional I think that if you receive
feedback better you give it and more
compassionately and more effectively so
this is the first thing that we learn in
professional communication training
active listening
most of us listen to answer you ever had
that experience where you're in a
conversation a person's talking and
they're really into what they're saying
and they're kind of explaining maybe
they like golfing a little bit of a
tangent you're just kind of 9 your head
and 9 your head and you're not good a
little less patient as you go and you're
kind of like you're attentive learning
you're like yeah I know ok I know what I
want to say I want to say the thing can
you please stop talking so I can say the
thing not listening so it starts with
teaching ourselves to listen just to
listen not to respond if you come up and
talk to me and I'm looking at you like
this do you feel like I'm listening do
you feel like I'm receptive to what you
have to say probably not if you come up
to me
I'm staying here like this my body
language is open and I'm smiling at you
and I'm making eye contact and I'm
nodding my head
then maybe you feel like I really am
interested in what you have to say to me
so be conscious of your body language
the the status something like
communication is 70% body language and
20% tone or only 10% what you actually
say I don't know how we actually figure
that out but I do think there's a lot to
it so be conscious of your body language
be conscious of your tone be conscious
of what you're communicating beyond just
the words that you are saying
this is another tactic that we learn in
communication training and I call it the
what I'm hearing you say when somebody
says something to you they give you
feedback
pause digest it and say okay what I'm
hearing you say is that when I interrupt
you you feel disrespected and maybe if a
person goes yes that's exactly what I'm
trying to say and maybe they go no
that's not quite when I'm here so here's
what I actually mean but either way you
get really valuable information because
communication is hard because it's like
a constant game of telephone what you
are saying is not always what the other
person is hearing and vice-versa so when
you confirm understanding you're
eliminating that communication barrier
you're making really sure that okay
here's what I heard is that really what
you meant to say so we listen and then
we do the really hard thing and we say
thank you and then we shut up this is so
hard this first one I was writing this
slide and I was like nobody's kind of
thinks everybody knows this but I know
that not everybody knows this I know
that most of us don't do this well if
you come up to me after this talk and
you say hey Erica I'm so-and-so I really
liked your talk I will try really hard
to like be open and smile at you and
make I kind of can say thank you but
what I might do is go oh my god I like
said this and I told the wrong story
there and I forgot to do this and I did
this really awkward thing with my hands
and I think I like invented a
catchphrase in there somewhere and it
just was I'll do that I'll minimize I'll
deny I'll say here's one here's all the
reasons why I'm not really so great so
think about you when somebody
compliments your work what do you do do
you minimize it do you brush it off do
you give somebody else the credit that
you deserve are you unwilling to
acknowledge that yeah I did that and
that was really great so try not to do
any of those things when you receive
positive feedback just say thank you
if that one's hard this is the worst
because this is about constructive
feedback and I don't know a single one
of us who doesn't respond to
constructive feedback by going like even
if it's just internal you feel something
when somebody says to you hey what you
did was not right or was not okay or was
not as good as it could have been that
first we have feelings about that and
that is okay because people are people
and people have feelings but what we
can't do is react from those feelings so
when someone gives you constructive
feedback don't fight with them and tell
them why they're wrong don't push back
don't get defensive at the very most
confirm understanding say okay
when I did that here was a negative
outcome make sure you've got that right
and then say thank you for the feedback
that's it I mean for now
you can respond but do it later when we
get constructive feedback most of us
have feelings about it and that is fine
imagine that you just had a meeting with
your manager and you are not going to
get that promotion or that raise or more
direct reports or more time to work from
or whatever it was that you were asking
for because they want you to improve a
couple of things before that happens
your manager said well you're doing some
things right but here's thing 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
that I want to see get better before you
even have that thing that you want and
you manage to suck it in and say okay
thank you for the feedback I'm going to
I'm going to go and consider this and
you start walking back to your desk and
your head you think but she didn't
understand she's missing like half the
story there and she has no idea that
when I did that I was actually covering
for so-and-so and here was my logic in
fact if she considered this she'd
realize that I was really in the right
and you know it really is just having a
bad day like you actually I don't even I
don't think she likes me anyway I don't
think maybe she's jealous of me I don't
what and that's all before you get back
to your desk we have feelings and we
don't typically respond well we are an
emotional place so look at the emotion
ask yourself how you feel about the
feedback I feel anxious I feel hurt I
feel misunderstood feel disrespected
whatever it is give it a name and then
sit with it and don't respond until the
emotion has died down feelings do this
great thing where they come then they go
they just want to be felt so give
yourself some time for that usually it
takes two days or less and then decide
what you're going to do look at the
feedback is there value in it if it hurt
there's probably value in excitement hit
those close to home probably has some
piece of truth to it and
and decide what to do decide how you're
going to change if anything this is one
that I've been working on for the last
year and that my entire team is working
on for the last year or five and it's
hard but we always want to assume
positive intent whether we are giving
feedback or receiving it when we give
feedback let's assume that the person
who did the jerk thing is not actually a
jerk willing to bet that probably nobody
in here is actually a jerk but we have
all done jerk things I've done plenty of
them like five in the last week we all
do stuff wrong sometimes it doesn't make
us bad people and so when somebody does
something wrong and you give them
feedback about it you are not judging
them for being a bad person you are
saying this particular thing you did was
not great I'm going to assume that you
didn't do it because you're a bad person
to assume you did it because you're a
good person who made a mistake and when
you receive constructive feedback the
other person is probably not giving you
constructive feedback because they hate
you and want to ruin your day they are
probably giving it to you because they
care about you see a lot of potential in
you and want you to be better when you
say thank you for the feedback you were
thanking the other person for their
positive intent that same project
manager likes to say feedback is a gift
hated that too but it it absolutely is
it's somebody taking time to consider
the work you did see the value in it and
tell you that that was good
on the flip side it is somebody taking
the time to think about what you did how
you could do it better getting over the
scary piece of giving feedback and
saying to you here's how you can grow
either way that's we're thanking that
person
be specific I talked about this earlier
but it deserves its own slide but it's
really really really important when you
give feedback name actions and behaviors
and this is important because we are not
giving feedback about who somebody is we
are giving feedback about what they did
we care about behavior we are not
focused on character we are not saying
you were a jerk in that meeting we're
saying you did this this and this in
that meeting so name actions quote the
person directly if that seems like the
right thing say you said these words and
here is the impact that had like I said
generic feedback if it's positive feel
nice but it doesn't do a lot for the
other person so if you say to somebody
boy you did a good job and then walk
away they're probably going to feel good
for a second but it's not going to
change their behavior but if you say you
did a good job and here is why you were
engaging that story you told brought the
point home it was fun to listen to you
they go ok I should remember to tell
that story in the future stay engage
with my audience and show how much I
care about this topic because that gets
people interested I also don't think you
should try to do too much at once unless
you're dealing with behavior that is
destructive or dangerous focus on
incremental changes when you give
somebody feedback before you go into
that medium think to yourself ok when
this person leaves the meeting if
somebody else asks them hey what was
that mean about they should say it was
about how I interrupted meetings so you
should be that specific that should be
the feedback and that's what they should
take out of that me
this is the hardest slide for me in the
whole deck Sam they're they're all hard
you know it's like a really funny joke
that we call this stuff soft skills
because it is so difficult but it's
great that their skills because skills
are things we can learn so this is the
hardest slide for me because I think of
myself as a nice person and I'm trying
to stop doing that I'm trying to think
of myself as a kind person because
kindness says what needs to be said even
if it is hard for me to say and hard for
the other person to hear when we give
difficult feedback we have to let it
land we need to be direct and give the
other person the respect of saying I
think that you can hear this and respond
to it it sucks it never feels good so
just like put that in your head and know
that when you have to have those
conversations they are not going to be
fun and they are not going to be easy
and they're going to feel really bad
just be okay with that because that's
how this goes and once you get past that
don't do this thing where you say hey
person I have to give really hard
feedback - boy you are so great you are
really really great like let me tell you
here's you did this this week and that
and the other thing in all this is your
team love you and we invest the office
dog loves you like all this stuff also
you did this really awful terrible thing
we can't have that ever again or you
might get fired next time please undo it
again you are so great it may not be
that pronounced but that's how a lot of
us deliver hard feedback we do the
compliment sandwich we say here the
great thing here's a really not great
thing here's another great thing and
that doesn't let that feedback land it
doesn't communicate to that other person
how important that critical feedback is
and it doesn't show them the respect of
acknowledging that they are a grown up
and they can probably take it even if
it's not son even if it doesn't feel
good that compliment sandwich is not
about that other person that's the thing
it's about the giver of feedback it's
about making it feel easier for me to
give you hard feedback it's about making
me feel better not about helping you
and that's how I know that I went off
the bat so if I care about helping you
grow so I'm going to give feedback in
the way that it's hard for me but good
for you I mentioned this earlier I don't
think that giving feedback is the same
thing as dumping your opinion somebody
and then walking away and letting them
deal with it
and I don't think that that's
constructive I think that there are
little things that you can do in your
delivery of feedback to make it feel
collaborative the first thing is to ask
so I'm going to go up to somebody and
say hey I have some feedback for you
about X are you open to that right now
and most of the time people will say
yeah sure I'd love to let's sit down and
talk about it sometimes they'll say no
if you're going to ask you have to be
ready for the no and then say okay when
would be a better time and maybe how
would you like to receive that feedback
I have one junior developer who when I
give her constructive feedback in person
she cries and has a meltdown and gets
really really upset and just we just
both know that it's coming at this point
like we just both know it's going to
happen so what we do now is the day
before our one-on-one I email her and I
say here is the constructive feedback
that I have for you and then she gets to
cry and have her meltdown at home by
herself without me staring at her which
feels better for both of us and then she
comes in and we can use the time we have
together to talk about productive ways
forward that works for her and it works
for me competin do I hate people seeing
people cry but we accomplish the same to
the same goal I don't hold back on the
feedback that I give her the space to
process it in a way that works for her
now if somebody tells you they want your
feedback three years from now by carrier
pigeon while that's a different thing
right so within reason
give the person options how do they want
to receive the feedback when do they
want to receive it when you give
feedback confirm understanding this
works the other way say to them hey what
did you hear me say this works really
well in relationships too
um with the guy who is now my fiancee I
did this thing for the first like four
months we were dating and he finally
went you're doing that what I'm hearing
you say thing on me and now he just does
it back but it really works say okay I
just gave you a bunch of feedback I
realized that might have been hard to
hear what did you hear me say what was
your understanding of the feedback that
I gave you and see if they got it see if
you communicated what you think you
communicated because about half the time
you didn't and that's okay they're going
to tell you what they heard and then you
were going to clarify so they can take
that feedback and hopefully act on it
and then follow up if you say to say
this a to somebody hey I need you to
speak up and means more often and they
do in the next mean circle back and say
I saw you make an effort
I saw you raise your hand I saw you
share your opinion and that was valuable
and I really appreciate that you took
the time to take that feedback and act
on it step 8
here are some things not to do I
mentioned this earlier but I bring it up
again because the thing that we tend to
do we tend to say you were disrespectful
that doesn't mean anything actually the
problem is that it means a lot of things
to different people so what you think
was disrespectful that person may have
got well okay that didn't seem
disrespectful to me so we don't talk
about character we talk about actions
and impacts we talk about what that
person did not who they are nobody is
going to give feedback if they feel like
they are going to get payback for it if
they feel like somebody is going to
retaliate they are not going to do it
because that seems like a really bad
idea so if you want your team to have a
strong environment of giving and
receiving feedback retribution cannot be
allowed there's a caveat to this next
point normally I say critique and
private praise in public and that's
usually the right thing however if you
have a team member who is really really
causing a problem and just hurting the
rest of the team and they're all going
somebody needs to do a thing about this
at that point the team needs to know
that that person is receiving feedback
that a correction is happening so that
you don't damage the overall team morale
but in general critique and private
praise in public alright you will note
that I circled this with opinions
because this is a capital o opinion that
I have and it is right for some people
and not for others and right for some
situations and not for others I
generally think that anonymous feedback
does the opposite of building trust I
think that it hurts trust I think that
it creates suspicion because you're
totally going who gave me that means
feedback I'm gonna fight with you wasn't
it
and this is the most destructive thing
if there's somebody in your team with an
axe to grind boy is this a great way for
them to do it and that is also hurtful
so in some cases I think anonymous
feedback is necessary if there is a
large power differential between two
people it might be the only way that one
person feels safe giving feedback if
there is already established trust in a
team it might be the right thing I get
360 feedback from my team about once
every six months so I get 15 people and
they all just tell me what I'm doing
well when I'm not doing well and I
everybody on my team is not my best
friend but I do trust and respect them
all in a professional context and so I
don't need to know who said this because
I trust that it came from the right
place so in general I would say direct
feedback is always the right thing
anonymous if you really have to
raise your hand if you are a senior
developer and architect or a team leader
any of that stuff oh boy it's a lot of
us okay all right I have bad news for
you as a leader you have a much higher
responsibility for self-awareness and
for the kind of culture that you create
on your team even if you are not
officially a manager if you were a
senior developer you can be darn sure
that your team is looking at you and
what you are doing they are doing so
know that people are looking at you
seeing what you model and going okay the
way we deal with problems on this team
is to talk about that person behind
their back got it don't communicate that
because what you also the power to do is
to say that person the way that we deal
with problems in this team is
transparently and openly and if we have
an issue with somebody we talk to them
about it correctly and if you model that
you will see people follow you structure
is important because feedback is hard
and it is a skill in an ideal world
feedback just happens organically in the
moment you're pairing with somebody and
you're going to estimate this is and
then make a joke and you go that was not
super okay with me can we not make jokes
like that anymore
and they go oh gosh I'm sorry I won't do
that again then you move on and
everybody's fine that's really hard to
get to that point like deceptively hard
to get to that point so until we get
there we build in practices here are
some of the ones that my team uses we do
mutual one-on-ones so I meet with the
apprentices and I say to them here is my
affirmative feedback for you here is my
constructive feedback what do you got
for me I have to earn the trust for them
to do that because they're going to go
oh god if I say a thing that makes her
feel bad she's going to get mad at me
I'll probably get right I can't I can't
have that so I have to build trust if I
want usual one-on-ones if I want true
feedback to come back from somebody who
is on my team but is incredibly
effective when it works we do peer
feedback exercises and we first learn
how to do this I sit them all down in
pairs and I say look that person the I
use open body language use situation
behavior impact and say a
good thing to them and they all like
giggle and get awkward and then they
practice it and we do that for a few
weeks we just do positive feedback so
it's a little bit easier and less scary
and then one day I say okay now take 60
seconds and really think about it and
now give your partner some constructive
feedback just one piece it can be
something it's not even that big of a
deal but use the structure and give it a
try and practice you practice giving and
they practice receiving and then you
switch it feels a little bit silly but
it's a skill and skills need practice we
don't develop them or they deteriorate
and we do team retros so we all get
together and we all say okay what did we
as a team do well what did we not do
well and what do we want to change and
all of these are feedback practices they
let all of us practice and build these
skills so that hopefully when the moment
comes and something happens and somebody
goes oh gosh I have to respond to that
because that was not okay they feel
strong enough to do it because they have
had that practice and they have built
that trust structure is scaffolding and
hopefully gets you to that point where
the feedback just happens we're at the
constant exchange and then that is the
point where that feedback is a tool that
makes your team better I just said this
a bunch of times for them to say it
again its own slide this is the only way
to get good at this and it is much
better to practice before you really
need the skill the first time I had to
have a really really difficult
conversation with somebody I was firing
them and I did it so badly that they did
not understand they were being fired
true story hmm so the next time that I
had to fire somebody I got in a room
with one of my colleagues and she said
you fire me you fire me ten times and
you're not leaving this room until you
do it and it was really awkward and I
hated it and I like cried a couple times
and I had just like practice and change
the things that I said but I walked out
of that room and I went into the other
room and I let that person go and it
sucked and it was horrible and I hated
it but I did it and I did it effectively
because I
practiced so maybe you find a teammate
or a friend and say hey I want to get
better at giving a receiving feedback
how about you they probably will say
yeah me too that's the worst and you say
okay let's practice together maybe you
find somebody that's already really good
at this
maybe there's a senior dev in your team
who gives really good feedback maybe you
have a great manager well I've been
working with a coach for the last year
and it is the best money I've ever spent
and I have gotten better at feedback
because the lessons I've learned from
her so you find somebody to coach you
maybe you get your team together and you
say hey our organization is not good at
feedback what if our team figures out
how to be better and then we can share
that knowledge with the rest of the org
or you can go to your boss and say hey I
think our team could benefit from better
feedback practices can we bring somebody
in to teach us lots of ways to practice
I'm not going to go through all these
questions so there's a lot of them but I
wanted to show this resources with you
this is something that I do about every
three months with myself when I want to
know how I'm doing in the feedback
department this is a great question it's
usually the first question that I ask
when I do feedback workshops I'll say to
report full of people okay what is the
first word that comes to mind when you
hear the term feedback and then I write
them all down on a whiteboard it's
usually eliminating because almost every
word that we hear is something like
anxiety fear critique defensive scared
fired nervous worried my favorite is
like and it always shows up there's
usually some version of horrified so do
that with yourself what are the words
that pop into your mind just now when I
asked that question how do you feel
about giving positive feedback this is
probably the easiest thing for most of
us it's fun to tell people that they get
a great job and how they did that's the
best part and then how do I feel about
receiving same thing with constructive
feedback we're doing you to get better
am I getting enough feedback for me to
improve am i giving enough feedback for
my team to improve
what am i avoiding because there's
almost always something or someone and
then what should my next step be again I
do this about every three months it
helps me a lot to know where I am where
I need to get better and how to get
there and I have a couple of specific
challenges for you to take home to your
team this week so when you go back on
Monday everybody says what did you learn
and you see ozlowe you can start with
one of these the first one is so easy
and fun think about somebody in your
team who does some great stuff go find
them and tell them why the stuff they do
is great if you want to make it a little
harder pick a teammate and say hey I'm
trying to grow what's something that I
do well and what's something that I
could do better I suggest doing this
over email to give them time to think
about how to respond and then to give
you time to process when they email you
back this is something my seam does that
we really love we have a channel in
flack it's called thanks and the whole
point of that channel is to shout out
and say hey so including this really
awesome thing and we appreciate them
it's a really fun happy place on flag to
be and the last one is the hardest so if
you raised your hand when I said who's a
team lead this is for you go talk to
your team ask them do you think that we
are using feedback as well as we could
as a tool to be better and if not how
can we get better
I have a couple of resources in my
slides I read all of these and they have
all contributed to the knowledge that I
take into my work I recommend them
highly and finally here's how to get a
hold of me you can find me on Twitter
you can send me an email I would love to
hear from you I would love to hear what
you thought of this talk I would love to
hear about your experiences with
feedback I would love your feedback this
talk has changed and grown and shifted
over the past year because of feedback
that I have gotten from people that I've
given it to and that's really great and
I love that a lot and it's something
else if you go on Twitter you can see
Cuba's my dog thank you so much for
being here with me today
I really appreciate your time and your
attention and you're laughing at my
jokes I hope you have a great rest of
the conference
