all awake Wow there's a
hands going up that's surprising cool
well my name is Jeremy Clark if you
haven't figured that out yet and I'm
gonna be talking about focusing on the
user and that's because basically I can
trace my successes and failures on the
projects that I've worked on as a
developer to how well I understand what
the users need and it's it's something I
think I've always been doing but haven't
really recognized it and it's one of
those things that's kind of like design
patterns it's like okay once I put a
name to this and understand it now I can
use it more intentionally it's like this
is something I've been doing all along
but now that I see what it is I can do
it on purpose and hopefully be
successful you know really the title of
this talk is making the world a better
place because as a developer that's what
I feel my job is and it's really hard to
get trapped and say well you know I'm
not I'm not writing software that's like
sync with sequencing DNA you know I'm
not writing anything that's curing
cancer you know I'm not even writing
anything that keeps airplanes from
crashing right I'm just writing everyday
software for corporate corporate
applications for lying to business
that's where I spent the bulk of my
career but really what I doing is I'm
making other users lives easier I'm
making their jobs easier and in a way
that's making the world a better place
so that's what I focus on I don't think
about you know how impactful is this you
know is it impacting thousands of lives
or hundreds of lives maybe it's just one
person and it doesn't matter whether
we're writing software that helps people
communicate better doesn't matter if
we're writing games to keep people
entertained it doesn't matter for
writing corporate applications that just
make someone's job easier we're all
trying to make the world a better place
we're problem solvers and that's one
thing that I really love about being a
developer and you know like I said it's
really hard to think about that when
you're just a corporate developer does
anyone hear just a corporate developer
no never raise your hand to that never
never
you don't have to just be a corporate
developer I hate that I actually have
done some interviews with companies you
know and I wanted to get into a
consulting company and one person
actually said oh you're just a corporate
developer like that's a bad thing it's
like no I'm a kick-ass corporate
Jennifer that doesn't mean that you know
I'm some kind of drone that doesn't know
it doesn't care about anything no you
can be awesome in whatever job that
you're doing
so never never say you're just a
corporate developer I'm a corporate
developer and I'm okay with that because
I can be awesome so like I said I'm
gonna be talking about some successes
and failures and I'm gonna talk about my
biggest failure which actually has
nothing to do with software actually has
a little bit to do with software because
I was attending a software developer
conference and so what happened is I was
at this conference center and I was just
walking down the hallway on the second
floor and my phone rings and I knew
something was on fire at work already so
I like take the call you know and then I
I see there's a door out to the smokers
patio so I go out the door and I take
the phone call and you know it's like
okay this is I got to take care of this
this is amazing you know and so I'm on
the phone for about five minutes and I
as I'm there you know I get this stuff
taken care of and then I go back to go
inside the conference center and I go up
grab the door handle and pull it and
doesn't move I'm like crap it's locked
so I tried the other door grab the
handle pull it I'm like okay I was on
the phone when I came out I wasn't
paying attention was this a door I'm not
supposed to go out so there's a big
glass window next to it so I go up to
the window and I knock on it to get
someone's attention and and I like
pointing at the door and the person just
looked at me and they said one word to
me push
that was it
push and in fact when I push the door it
opened now how do you can imagine this
made me feel like a complete idiot and I
spent the rest of the day analyzing the
situation right because I'm a programmer
and so you know the door kind of had
handles that look like this and so I'm
thinking okay what's going on here am I
really an idiot
I don't know how to use a door there's
something wrong with me but I've done a
lot of analysis on this over the years
and I found out no I am NOT an idiot the
person who designed this door is an
idiot and there's a couple things about
it so first of all if you have a
vertical handle there's these things
that are known as affordances and a
vertical handle tells a human I'm
supposed to pull this a vertical bar
tells a human I'm supposed to push this
so so that's kind of the first thing
that went wrong on this design they
wanted it to look nice these nice glass
doors with these handles so they had the
same kind of handles on the inside and
the outside so I'm sure whoever designed
this thought it was beautiful there were
a couple other things going on with this
and that is normally I'm from the u.s.
in case you haven't figured it out yet
and because of fire codes all exterior
doors generally open outwards so that
you have a nice egress out of the
building well I was outside the building
so I would have expect the doors to open
outward so I could go in but I was on an
enclosed balcony so actually the fire
exit would be me going into the building
so the doors open inward due to fire
codes can you tell that I did a lot of
analysis on this now what made me feel a
whole lot better was when I found this
amazing book called the design of
everyday things by Don Norman if you
haven't read that it's really awesome
and so there's actually a term for these
in the wild they're called Norman doors
because he describes the scenario and he
actually describes a time where he was
going into a hotel and they had two sets
of doors so that there's a little air
gap in between and he went through the
first set of doors and he was you know
distracted or something and he couldn't
figure out how to get through the second
set
doors because it's hard to tell like
where the hinges were and where the
handles were and it's a typical thing so
I don't feel bad about this now but at
the time I felt like a complete idiot
and this is what I want my users not to
feel like they shouldn't feel like oh
man I must be stupid because I don't
know how the software works that's just
not acceptable and so what I found is
that the best way for me as a developer
to really make the world a better place
I want happy users is to really focus on
what their needs are and make sure that
my software is supporting what they need
to do now what they want to do and what
they need to do aren't always the same
thing so there's some things that we
have to kind of do to get past that but
what I found is that the applications
that I've worked on that have been most
successful are ones where I've been able
to build a partnership and building
partnerships is actually a tricky thing
because we have to build trust with the
people that are using our software and I
was working on this you're gonna hear a
lot of stories by the way I hope you
don't mind I was working on this large
application it impacted probably 20 or
30 different lines of business at the
company that I was working with and in
that scenario pretty much everybody had
similar needs except for one or two
groups now this one group they were
actually the administrators for this
application and so they had a very
specific job and our application was
actually split up into two pieces so we
had this cool Windows app which is shown
here in blue and this was basically the
administration application so you could
use it to go in and enter new items and
do approvals and maintain the look-up
tables and things like that and then we
also have this application our Green
application here which is a web
application that handles all of the
reporting and we did that as a web
application because it had to be wider
distributed and people could just walk
up to any machine and use it so this
particular you know the the particular
users that I'm thinking of where
the administrators kind of the primary
administrators for the system and they
were responsible for approving the
events that went through
now I worked pretty closely with these
people when I was going through the
requirements for this when I was
figuring out what they needed and how
things went but it turned out I didn't
really understand their workflow because
I was in their office one day just
talking about something else and I'm I'm
just watching this one person do her
work and what she did was she would open
up the desktop application and go to the
approval screen and that had a list of
items that needed to be approved and
then what she would do is she would
review the item make sure everything was
okay and then she would click the button
yes this is approved awesome but then
she did something I wasn't expecting
because then she went to the web
application that does the reporting she
used the search tool to look at that
same item she was just on and once she
found it which wasn't all that great
because the search function in this
application was a little quirky so once
she found it she would click the print
button print out a hard copy of this
item and put it into her file cabinet I
didn't know she had she was doing that
and I didn't want to tell her not to do
that because that was part of their
process that was how they kept track of
their events I don't want to go in and
say you don't need to file cabinet
anymore but as I watched her do this I'm
like you know what rather than doing all
that you know going to the
administration application approving an
item flipping over to the web
application printing out the report then
going back to the desktop application to
do more approvals how about if I just
put a print button on the approval
screen and that was literally five
minutes of changes that I had to do I
already had that code it's just a button
that sends an ID to our reporting server
that's all it does I think so all I had
to do was put a button on that screen
but I didn't know that that button was
needed until after I watched them
working and I found that you know really
understanding that
has has changed my outlook a lot and I
try to you know think about what are the
things that I can do that are small wins
because when we're talking about
building trust if I can make these
little five-minute changes now my users
think something amazing is happening why
because they're thinking I'm on your
side that's what they're thinking
so now instead of IT being a service
provider you know we got to go talk to
the developers and they're always nasty
and they never want to do what we want
them to do now what I've shown them is I
am invested in you oh I can look and
make really small changes that make your
life easier and you'd be amazed how many
small changes you can make that will
improve a process like this I turned a
15 step process down into a 9-step
process and this was something they did
all day long but again it's just from
understanding what my users actually
need that that made that successful now
I can't always make those kinds of
changes because sometimes we just have
restrictions so in the same application
we had a lot of data entries we had a
lot of people doing data entry and we
had a standard data entry screen that
worked for most people but there was one
group I was actually working at the
Disneyland Resort and there was one
group the entertainment group and their
needs were a little bit different
because they were putting in things like
parade times the times the fireworks
would go and I live in Anaheim
California and there's like seriously
fireworks 3,300 nights a year because
Disney lands right down the street you
know so they would put in all of these
times and the data entry screen wasn't
really designed for the type of thing
that they needed to put in you know we
kind of the kind of shoehorned it in a
little bit I always wanted to write them
a custom screen but I was never able to
do that but what I did to make up for
that to show them that I was on their
side is whenever they had a problem you
know sometimes the report would come out
there'd be something that went kind of
wrong with it because their constraints
were kind of different from the
applications constraints I would jump on
that immediately and I would look at the
data and we'd say okay it looks like
this record has this problem and here's
how you can fix it and again what that
showed is I am on your side
so even though there's kind of a known
problem with the system and it's
something I'm not able to fix I can
still help them and let them know that
we can be partners and here's how I know
I was successful with that because I was
working primarily with this this one
person over the course of years and when
it was time for her to leave the company
and someone else was coming in and
taking her place one of the first things
she did is she called me up she said hey
Jeremy can you come down and meet the
new person cuz I want to introduce you
and I did and she's like this is Jeremy
he's gonna help you out if you have any
problems and I love that because I don't
want to be a supplier I want to be part
of the business if I'm a corporate
developer it's like I'm not somebody
that you go to to you know have have me
do things no it's like I'm part of this
we're all trying to be successful
together and when I've had that when
I've had that situation it's just worked
out so awesomely and you don't know how
hard it was for me to leave that company
because I had built so many awesome
relationships over the years now
unfortunately things aren't always
puppies and unicorns failure happens and
man this other application oh man it
failed like really hard so I was working
on this application and for whatever
reason the project manager was very
protective of information and the
project manager didn't want to let me
anywhere near the users so I was just
given specifications like here this is
what you're going to build and it's like
you know what I'm not a coder I'm a
problem solver that's what I do my job
is a creative job I solve problems I
don't just write code
and so I was very frustrated because you
know I would come up to a particular
item in the specification I'm kind of
like okay well I could conan up this way
or i could code it up that way and these
are kind of like completely different
things and of course i go to the the
typical question of you know what are
the users doing today I want to go look
what's your current process how are you
trying to put the stuff together in the
manual form so that I can hopefully make
something that will work for you in an
electronic form but again like I said
unfortunately the project manager was
acting as a gatekeeper here and I got
the you shall not pass to go talk to the
users and I found that incredibly
frustrating because what would happen is
I would I would pass something off and I
go to the project manager and I'm like
okay so how do the users do it now and
they'd say here you know I think we
could do it this way I think we might be
able to do it this way and the project
manager is all okay let me go talk to
somebody I don't even know if the
project manager was talking directly to
the users they might have been talking
to management at that level instead of
the people who actually use the software
and you actually need to talk to a
combination of bowls if you want to be
really successful so you know the answer
came back and I was kind of like okay
well you do want this one or do you want
that one and the project manager said do
this I'm like wait what is that are you
are you sure are you sure this is what
they want and then it was even worse
because this was like a two week process
whenever asked a question because that
project manager was busy doing other
things and so this project just dragged
on and on and on and I was never
confident that what I was building was
something that the users actually could
use and something the users actually
needed and man it frustrated me to no
end and because of these big gaps in
time of getting answers you know there
was one other person who was working on
the project he actually ended up leaving
the company so I got his piece which was
in progress and I was building all of
this cool stuff too
on a mobile device you know I'm really
excited about building kind of my first
mobile website and I'm doing this really
cool stuff with MVC that like web forms
would be impossible to do with you know
and I'm like really proud of what I've
come up with I'm like I put a lot of
work into this but until we kind of got
some of these answers we can't complete
this application and what happened was
it was put on the back burner and
because I couldn't go talk to the users
and find out what they needed
basically my manager said you know what
work on it in your spare time and we all
know what that means it means this thing
is never gonna get done and so this
application never got released and as a
developer that's terrible for me because
did I just make the world a better place
no what I did was I wasted my time
building code that nobody actually used
and that's time I could have spent time
I could have spent building code that
people do actually use so to me this is
like making the world a worse place
because you're keeping me from making it
better and throwing away code is really
painful
I mean sometimes we have to do it
because the code needs to be thrown away
but in this case it was it just never
made it to the user they never got the
benefit out of this and you know the
thing is the main reason I hate coding
the specification is because
specifications never ever match reality
I mean people think they know what they
want and then you build it and you
implement it and you're like yeah that
didn't quite work out so well did it
reality doesn't always match what
specifications were given and I love
that picture but the thing is I was able
to use this as a learning tool because
it's really easy to treat failure as
something that you get depressed over
and you want to give up and you say I
never want to do this again and quite
honestly that's my first reaction but in
this scenario I'm like okay
this was such a terrible thing and I
feel so bad about you know having this
wasted time and this wasted code and
even this thing I was really proud of
building I was really proud of this
mobile website and nobody ever got to
see it except for me you know I'm still
proud of it I'll tell people how awesome
it was but nobody ever got to see it so
to try to keep that from happening again
I thought about okay what was the real
problem here and again in my scenario I
was thinking well I never was confident
that what I was building was what the
users actually needed and so how can we
make sure that doesn't happen again and
in fact this happened to me again I was
working as a contractor at another
company and there were three levels of
project manager between me and the users
and the same thing was going on you know
I was like I don't even know your
industry I am brand-new to your industry
and I'm pretty sure this is not what you
want but instead of just sucking it up I
spoke I went and voiced my concerns to
the manager of the project and I said
okay here's what I would like to do you
know what I would like to do and
realizing I wasn't going to be able to
do it but I figured I got it I got to
voice my opinion said here's what I want
to do we were rewriting an application
so there was a current application out
in the field that was a little bit
broken and the rewrite would use
different technology and hopefully not
be as broken in the same ways and I said
you know what I would like to do I would
like to go out into the area where the
people are actually using the software I
don't want to watch them using it and
then after I watch them use it I want to
ask them what they think the problems
are then I want to talk to their manager
and say what are your priorities and
what do you think the problems are if
there are any and then we can build the
software and again move forward
confidently that what we're building is
something that's actually useful I
didn't get to do that but I felt better
for saying it out loud and it turns out
it made an impact because after I was
done with that contract about six months
later I got a call from that manager
and he's like so Jeremy can you like
come over and do some some training and
a little bit more work with us so I
obviously made an impact that I care
about the success of their business even
though I'm an outsider and you know I'm
there for six months I technically don't
have a stake and whether this company
succeeds or failure fails but you know
again me personally I'm trying to make
the world a better place and so if I see
something that can make that easier then
I'm gonna want to do that and that's
where I love this slogan I fight for the
users I've even got a t-shirt you know
it's like that's what software is for
software's for people to use and it's
for people to use and make their lives
better the biggest frustrations that I
hear about oh man this story almost
killed me because you know I have a
friend that I worked with at this
company for years and years and she's
not in a technical area she's in another
area and they have a CMS system that
they were using in their department well
because big corporate enterprise you
know we're gonna merge all the systems
together so we have a single unified
system bla bla bla bla bla and their
process that used to take them 12 steps
in the old system now took them 25 steps
in the new system and someone in that
department even quit over that issue
they quit they said this is ridiculous
and they left and I thought how can we
as an industry fail so badly without
anybody recognizing is it a failure
I'm sure the company said this is a
success now everybody's using the same
system but you know what my job isn't to
make my life easier my job is to make my
users lives easier so when I see that
kind of thing I'm just like come on and
there's a reason I'm not working at that
company anymore you know I mean that's
just unfortunately you know political
environments change and you know
productive environments can turn into
not so productive environments and like
I said it was really really hard for me
to leave because I had developed this
relationship with my years
and I'm like you know why after I'm gone
I know they're not gonna be as well
taken care of as they have been that was
really hard for me I I don't know am I
too invested in the users what do you
think no is this a good thing I think
it's a good thing that's why I exist now
there are times where failure is on the
horizon and you can get around it so
there was this other application that I
was working on at this the same company
again I spent 11 years as a corporate
developer this particular company and it
was one of those applications that was
written by one of the users you know so
every so often you'll get a department
and they have someone in the department
who's kind of technical so hey they can
build this little thing in Microsoft
Access and it'll be fine you know we
don't have to go to IT for an official
project and it'll be cheaper and bla bla
bla bla bla and then it gets too big and
the data base falls over and some other
things start happening and then they
come to the development team and they're
like okay this runs our entire
department now and it's not working
anymore so we need you to rewrite this
and I'm like okay that's fine we can we
can rewrite this application and I went
to my manager and I said okay so here's
what I'd like to do I'd like to go meet
with the different lines of business
that are using this because it was kind
of you know kind of used by various
areas in this one section of the company
and you know take a look at what they're
doing today and what they need and how
we can fulfill their needs and get
everything good and my manager says nope
we we don't have that as part of the
project so what we want you to do is do
what it does today this is a straight
approach rewrite that's all you're gonna
do that does not make me happy because
obviously this was software that was
built for a purpose but it's also on
fire right now so I figure okay you want
me to do what it does today isn't it
broken today isn't that why we're
rewriting it well yeah yeah yeah but
just you know straight across
functionality
and so I saw this failure coming up I
could see it on the horizon mm-hmm and
I'm like okay let's do this now
unfortunately the person who had wrote
this application
you know I dealt with several you know
different people in the business areas
that we're doing this kind of thing some
of them were really good because they
knew their limitations some of them
thought that they were geniuses and
built stuff like this and what happened
is you know I started going through the
code and there's like thirteen thousand
lines of VBA code and I'm trying to
figure out what this thing is doing
based on the code and the tables and the
forms and all that and I came across
this interesting issue now I am gonna
teach you a little bit of geography
today I hope you don't mind but it had
this function that said hey what time is
it in this particular city in the United
States so if you said what time is it in
Omaha Nebraska it would come back and
say oh it's 2:38 in the morning right
now man I'm about 10 minutes off aren't
I yeah bummer because I think it's it's
only 227 in Omaha right now I would that
would have been awesome if I nailed that
one in it but the problem is if I asked
what time is it in LaVista Nebraska it
said oh it's 138 and that probably
doesn't mean anything to you and quite
honestly as someone who lives in
California which is where the blue dot
is and Omaha Nebraska which is over here
that wouldn't mean anything to me either
unless I actually looked it up so here's
our geography lesson so here's a picture
of the United States and you can see
Omaha Nebraska is marked and it's kind
of almost right in the middle okay so
here's where LaVista Nebraska is yeah
did you see that here let me do it again
Omaha LaVista Omaha LaVista turns out to
be like a suburb of Omaha they're really
close together and so you're probably
thinking okay I know where this is going
cuz time zones are really messed up and
there's probably like a time zone line
that's going right through the middle of
the city
and it's like
no that's actually not what's going on
you know what's actually going on
this here's Nebraska's zoomed in and
there actually is a time zone that goes
time so in line that goes through the
middle of the state so you can see the
pink stuff over there is what is known
as Mountain time for the Colorado Rocky
Mountains and then on this side this is
Central time because it's kind of in the
middle we're not good at naming time
zones we have Pacific mountains central
and eastern and it's like okay
close enough
so here's Omaha and like I said La Vista
is just on the outskirts of Omaha but
here's what this application did so what
does this application that was on fire
did it didn't have a connection to the
outside world so two two time zones he
was using a lookup table and it had a
list of all of the cities in the country
and so it's a Omaha Nebraska has an
offset of this and so that's how it
would figure out what time it is but
there was a problem with this because
the list did not include all of the
cities in the country as you might
imagine that would be a very extensive
list so I had kind of the major ones you
know so maybe the ones that you might
see here when you're zoomed in at this
level on Google Maps these are the kind
of cities it would have but obviously
there's like more than ten times as many
as that well the problem was is it
couldn't find a specific City on your
list like LaVista is not marked on this
what it would do is it would use the
first city in that particular state so
in this case it would use Alliance
Nebraska because that was the first one
alphabetically and it happened to be in
a different time zone so that's why this
was broken and obviously I wasn't going
to recreate the broken code right so
they do what it does today that would
not work because in that case you know
I'd be basically saying okay this is
going to be wrong and you know like I
said on fire
and then my brain starts spinning
because these are all internal
applications and they're just on the
corporate network and so I'm thinking
okay can I like poke a hole through the
firewall maybe get out to the time
servers somewhere in the outside world
you know pass them a postal code or
something and they can give me the
current time and you know I'm just
thinking of all these different
complicated ways of doing this so that
it could be correct well fortunately I
had a really good partner a partner
partnership with the administrator of
this application so there was this one
person who was out in the area he was
kind of the superuser administrator for
this application and so he knew what all
of the lines of business were doing and
so I tapped into him all the time and I
went to him and I said hey what is this
function actually used for well it turns
out this was being used by the concierge
at a hotel and what they would like to
do to kind of promote good service is
two weeks before your stay they want to
call you and see if there's anything
that they can do for you have something
waiting for you in your room when you
show up you know some spectacular guest
service that's what Disney does right so
that's what it was actually used for and
I said okay so do they really need like
this specific time what why do they need
this time and they're like well they
just kind of want to make sure they're
not calling too late in the day
yeah because again we're on the west
coast and the rest of the country is
later than us from time perspective and
so I'm like really so they don't kind of
need this granular specific thing it's
like no not really
and so here's what I gave them I went
out to the US government site national
atlas gov and this is the official US
time zone map and you can Nebraska is
kind of in the middle there and you can
see it's straddling the time zones and
so what I did was I made a screen in the
application that had this map on it and
then I replaced these little clocks that
it has there with the actual time so I'm
like okay well I can calculate the
actual time for each of these time zones
and let me go ahead and just put those
on the screen and that's all they needed
I didn't need to replicate this detailed
functionality that was broken obviously
I couldn't replicate something that was
broken but because I had this good
partnership it actually worked out
really well so again kind of people say
here's what we need it's not always what
they actually need sometimes it's what
they what they think they need and so
having that partnership is really really
important you know it's really kinda
difficult to build these relationships
this talk is actually based on a series
of articles that I've been writing over
probably the last five years and
sometimes I'm thinking how did this
happen is it by accident and then I'm
like you know what it really isn't what
happens is I'm really paying attention
to what my users need and how do I know
that I do I've done job shadowing before
job shadowing is one of the best things
you can do if you're in an environment
like that obviously we all build
different kinds of software but if you
are building line of business
applications and you can actually go
spend time with the people who are whose
problem you're trying to solve that is
amazing and if you have the ability to
do that take it what I what I kind of
discovered as I was going through and
ruminating on all this was I kind of
figured out this is actually something
I've been doing for years and I haven't
realized it so even before I became a
professional developer I was in a
communications department at actually
the same company and in this
communication department one of my job's
was managing data in a CMS and what they
wanted me to do was okay this is gonna
tell you how old I am and how long ago
this was but we had a boss based CMS and
it had you know Greece green screen
you know they had monochrome monitors
out there and you know all the keyboard
shortcuts for looking things up in
function keys and does anyone here like
remember having templates on your
keyboard yeah I know it's hard to raise
your hands because you probably have
arthritis like I do but you know it was
one of those kinds of systems and we
were moving it up to a new CMS system in
Windows 3.1 you know so it was going to
be amazing but the thing was we didn't
want to just reproduce the data because
it's like oh well now we have the option
to do linking and put in you know kind
of hyper hyper linking type things and
put in images and all this other kind of
stuff so what I what we really wanted to
do is make sure that when we move stuff
over it was still just as usable as what
they were already using so what did I do
I got to go spend time with them now
this information held basically all of
the information for the Disneyland
Resort that a guest might want so if
people called in our guest services line
you know and they're wanting to know for
example about assistive listening
devices at various locations that was
confirm a ssin that was in here the
person on the phone could look it up and
they say oh yes we have you know this
available here and we have this
available here and we have this
available over here so they'd be able to
help them with all of those kinds of
questions if they if they say okay do
you have designated areas for service
animals because service animals still
have to kind of do what animals do you
know they could look at that kind of
information you know and of course they
got the typical information of what time
is the parade you know whether the
fireworks
things like that and so what I did was I
went out and I spent a four-hour shift
sitting next to someone on the phone and
it was an eye-opening experience because
they got a lot of the same questions
over and over and over again you know
what time are you open how much does it
cost
when's the parade and they weren't even
using the system for that
because that was the question they they
they knew those schedules they repeated
them all the time and so they never used
the system for that kind of stuff you
know but then when some of the stuff
that doesn't get asked quite as much
they'd go in and look
system and I'd see how that works and so
that was an eye-opening experience
because I'm like okay well you know all
of this stuff that I thought was
important right because it's the
questions everybody asks turns out to
not really be that important in the
system because that's not how they get
that information and so I got to think
about okay well how do we actually put
this together in a way that you know we
can we can get to easily and after I
spent that four hour shift watching
somebody talk on the phone I spent a
four-hour shift to talking on the phone
so yes there was someone sitting right
next to me making sure I didn't say
anything wrong but they actually let me
sit there and answer guests questions so
I could get a feel for exactly what was
going on and I knew how to use the
current system not as well as they did I
mean they would do it without looking at
the keyboard and hitting function keys
and control this and all that you know I
had to look up it's like okay I need
this and this special keystrokes but you
know I had someone there I'm making sure
that I was saying the right thing but
again that was really useful to me
because I got to see experience
firsthand exactly what these people are
going through and I you know as I'm
thinking about it I've been doing this
other times too because there was a time
where we were doing something that had
to do with the people who are working
out in the ticket booth the people were
actually selling tickets to Disneyland
and I went there and stood and watched
somebody for four hours how did the
ticket booth I stood behind them and I
was amazed at how much money came
through that window they wouldn't let me
touch the money so I didn't get to
actually work in that case but you know
I was there to observe and see what they
went through kind of see what are they
doing all the time what are they doing a
little bit of the time what are the
things that are difficult and being able
to do that man it just it just is an
eye-opening experience because you're
like okay all those things I assumed
were important are totally not important
and now I'm going to build the system in
a completely different way
man that makes you feel really
inadequate because we feel like geniuses
most of the time right like oh I am
solving this problem you're like I did
not solve the correct problem you know
it's not a good feeling to be so because
I've had all of these experiences over
the years I've really come up with kind
of you know how do we for me a way to
form these partnerships a way that we
can go out and figure out what our users
are doing and what what people need and
it's a simple five-step process the
first one is the watch step the watch
step is where we actually go and see
what people are doing and this is really
difficult especially if you're rewriting
a current system because we have to
treat this like a wildlife photographer
would and that means that if you see the
zebra get stuck in the mud you're not
allowed to go pull the zebra out of the
mud you have to watch the zebra struggle
and struggle and struggle and hopefully
get out and that's exactly what you need
to do when you're observing users and
trust me developers are really bad at
doing that because how many times you
have you like watched a user try to stop
do something and you can see that it's
not going very quickly and you're like
um can you just give me the keyboard and
just give me the keyboard just let me
have the keyboard that's what we - you
know so this is really painful but what
you need to do is step back and this is
where you see where they're struggling
because if you don't know where they're
struggling you don't know how to make it
better so let them struggle through the
process see what they're doing today see
if they're taking weird shortcuts that
you never knew existed
and you're like oh I know you could do
that that's pretty cool and you're
basically just taking notes the whole
time saying okay they had a problem on
this they're always on this screen and
they always go back to this screen and
then go back to the screen again
you know so that it's like okay well how
can I make that process easier or can I
just have it default when they're done
with something I take them back there
automatically I mean there's a lot of
things to think about there but we have
to observe and watch the zebra struggle
in the mud
I'm sorry zebra okay I already
apologized for being American deny we
have zebras in America actually we don't
what we do in the zoos but you have to
let it struggle and figure out okay how
can I make this easier now the next step
is listening this is where we actually
talk to our users and we ask them how do
you think it should work and what you'll
find is the things they struggled with
and the things they think they struggle
with are not the same thing
the other thing that you'll find is in
addition to talking to the people who
are actually using the software I want
to talk to the people who are kind of in
charge of those people and say okay what
are your priorities what do you want
your people to be focusing on and can we
get the software to help them focus on
that a perfect example of that
was you know I mentioned doing a
contract job where I didn't know the
industry it was actually a gym it was
software for gym memberships as was it
what it was so people could sign up for
gym memberships so of course you know
it's one of those things everybody uses
in January and then doesn't use the rest
of the year and the particular screen
that I was thinking of is all of the
list of the different plans you could
have because you could have a five day a
week plan or a three day a week plan or
one that includes a personal trainer or
one that includes this other class or
this to this to this and they they
seriously had hundreds of plans that you
could choose from and so we had this
list of hundreds of plans and we had
this little filter thing at the top so
you could you know filter by different
price ranges or different aspects so
they could narrow things down but the
list itself wasn't in any particular
order and that struck me as odd I'm like
okay here's
what I think the manager would want but
I don't know that without going and
talking to the manager because I later
found out that the way that these clubs
work is they would have promotions they
would have so obviously after Christmas
and before like January 15th they have
the special New Year's resolution plan
Hey but when everybody signs up for he
never uses well if you have some kind of
plan that you're promoting what did it
make sense if that was at the top of the
list and that way you know the manager
could say okay here's the plan that
we're promoting this month or this week
or today and then whenever someone's
using the system and they go in and say
okay let's go over the list of plans
that we can get this person to sign up
for you've got that one at the top of
the list oh here's our special for the
month let me tell you about it that
makes perfect sense to me but you don't
know that unless you talk to the people
who are in charge that will tell you
what their priorities are so when I'm
listening to people I want to listen to
the people actually using the software
and I want to listen to the people who
are in charge of the people using the
software because their priorities might
not line up and so once I've gathered
this information and you know got my all
of the things I took down while I was in
my Wildlife Photographer phase after
I've talked to people then I start
analyzing the situation and this is
where I go crazy because when we're
talking about analyzing making solutions
I love making solutions that's what I do
and I love looking for the right
technology for the job you know I've
always I've always I saw this go by on
Twitter a couple weeks ago and they said
if so like if you're a consultant who
goes into companies to solve their
problems they said okay so if you go
into a company with a solution already
in mind you aren't a consultant you're a
salesperson it's like yeah if I don't
know the problem how do I know the
solution that I'm proposing is the right
one well you don't
until you analyze what's actually going
on and so in the analysis phrase we're
looking at all of the different pieces
that we've collected and trying to come
up
something that we think might be good
and after we analyze the next step is to
contribute so here's where we go back to
our users and we say hey what do you
think about this here's what I came up
with and again from your observation
what you'll find is what the users think
they need and what they actually need
might not be the same thing and there's
actually a really good reason for this
it's because our users don't understand
what we do and that's okay because we
can understand that now after we
contribute this again shows them that we
are on their side we keep doing it we
continue and so we just continuously run
through the cycle so we watch them see
what they're doing we listen to them see
what they think they need we analyze all
of what we've collected to come up with
solutions we contribute it back to them
and then we implement and we start all
over again and I have done that
in for a whole lot of different
applications and again I can trace every
successful application to the
relationship that I had with the people
who are actually using the software so
if you have the opportunity to interact
with your users do it if you think
there's a possibility try to get there
and again I realized where we all have
different types of software different
types of companies different types of
organizations that we're building for
and we don't always have that
opportunity I worked at a start-up for a
while where we built security software
and I I never saw a user I got to talk
to some of our users on the phone but
then again in that situation I wasn't
actually building the software because I
don't want to build security software I
want to leave it to the people who know
how to build security software so I was
doing other things more customer
relationship helping people get our
project installed and things like that
so in it's not always possible but when
you can do that
man you can make some really good
partnerships
I had a cio of a company that I worked
for and his dream was to be asked about
the color of the carpeting in the
executive meeting room sounds like an
odd dream doesn't it do you know why he
said that this was interesting I loved
this guy he was awesome he said okay
when we're talking about things that
really kind of you know are just about
general stuff like what color should the
carpeting be in the executive meeting
room they asked the heads of all of the
departments they asked the head of HR
they asked the heads of legal they asked
the heads of finance and accounting they
asked the heads of operation but they
never asked the head of IT they only
asked the head of IT about things that
specifically have to do with technology
why because the company sees the
technology you're just a service
provider you're not really part of this
company you don't have a vested interest
in this and I see it completely the
opposite you know and again that CIO did
too he's like you know what I want them
to ask me about something other than
technology and I've you know that that
made an impact on me obviously because I
remember it all these years later
because it's like yeah I'm part of the
business I am not you know a service
provider that's just giving software to
people now in order to form these
partnerships again like I said we have
to understand the users and what they're
doing so a question is why do we have to
spend so much time understanding the
users well we have to know our users
because the users don't know the
technology they don't know what's
possible and we shouldn't expect them to
know what's possible I've kind of come
across two different types of users in
my experience I have users who ask for
everything and I have users who ask for
nothing
the users who asked for everything are
just like okay can I have this and this
and this and this and this and this and
this and oh I need one of these and then
the users that you ask for nothing are
just like no it's okay and you know what
these two types of users stem from the
same problem and the problem is they
think that everything we do is magical
we're wizards they don't know what level
of effort it takes to do anything and we
can't really blame them for believing
this because we do kind of talk that way
right so use fourth normal form that
sounds like we're casting a spell
doesn't it you know and then we're
killing demons all the time that's
another awesome way they're like what do
you guys do over there and then of
course we've got cool things like regex
erm right I think regex is in fact a
magical incantation because nobody
actually understands but you know these
are the kinds of things that we talk
about and these are the kinds of things
they're hearing and so they don't know
what's possible they don't know level of
effort I mean the reason why that user
didn't ask for a print button on that
screen is she didn't know it was even
possible and even if she thought it was
possible she's like oh it'll take them
like two weeks to do that it's not worth
it for that they don't understand the
level of effort because again it's all
magical so the people who asked for
everything ask for everything because
they don't understand the level of
effort so they're like must be free and
easy I'm just gonna ask for everything
the people who ask for nothing don't
understand the level of effort and they
say you know what this is probably hard
for them to do it's not worth it I'm not
going to bother them with it so this to
me is why it's really really important
for us to understand our users because
you know we need to know our users
because they don't know the technology
and there was another time where I knew
that I was successful and I was
successful because of a bad situation I
knew I successful because of a bad
situation so at this company we kind of
went through a round of layoffs you know
they cut staffing by ten percent across
the board the first thing that happened
is I had three different of my user
groups call me and say hey Jeremy
we just lost some people who are doing
work for us and so we have all this
extra work can you help us automate it
they came to me because they knew that I
would I was a good partner and that I
was willing to help them out now
unfortunately our department had also
been cut by the same 10% we didn't have
the bandwidth for it so I wasn't able to
fulfill those needs but it did tell me
that I was successful as a partner
because it's like you know what when
they had a problem they came to me
because they knew that I was someone who
was able to who is I'll say willing to
help not always able to help due to
extenuating circumstances but they knew
that they could count on me and that I
was on their side so again when I think
of what is my job as a software
developer it's about making the world a
better place
and it doesn't have to be big things it
can be little things we have an awesome
opportunity as developers because we can
multiply our impact you know I can build
one application that impacts thousands
and thousands of users potentially
hundreds of thousands of users that's a
really cool thing to be able to do now
another thing I do is I like to share
what I've learned obviously that's why
I'm here
every time I share what I've learned
whether it's the projects that I've had
experience with or the technical things
that were difficult for me to learn I'm
able to multiply my impact so now
instead of me writing an application
that impacts a thousand users I talked
to a hundred developers and they each
impact a thousand users so I would
encourage you to share what you know you
don't have to get up on stage because I
know we're not all cut out for that but
write a blog answer questions on Stack
Overflow here's the thing you know
something that somebody else doesn't
know there's always someone behind you
on the path you don't have to be an
expert so help the person behind you
find a way to do that multiply your
impact and make the world a better place
and whenever I think about you know what
maybe I should just coach especially the
specification I don't really have the
energy to go figure out what my users
doing you know what I'm just gonna sit
and not think about I'm gonna code up
whatever they ask for you know I get
passive-aggressive from time to time and
I found that there's only one thing I
have to think about in that scenario one
word that will pull me out of that and
that word is push thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
