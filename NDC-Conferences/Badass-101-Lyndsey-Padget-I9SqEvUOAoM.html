started can everybody hear me all right
this is badass 101 I I assume that most
of you are here because sex robots would
be too difficult to explain to your
manager so I hope that badass 101 is
slightly less awkward my name is Lindsay
Padgett I'm a senior software engineer
for a company called freight View in
Kansas City Missouri
that is right in the middle of the
United States we have a web-based
solution that helps small to
medium-sized businesses manage Freight
online as you can Majan by the name so
I'm a developer I have a degree in
computer science I did Java for many
years and then I switched over to
JavaScript and so I mostly am a back-end
developer I do no js' for the most part
restful design and micro services are
sort of my jam so so I want to want want
to get into some disclaimers we won't be
talking about any code today hopefully
you've had your fill of that by this
point a-- here at the last session so
you hopefully learned a lot what we are
going to be discussing though is feeling
a human emotions it's going to get weird
and you know if that if that weird
anyone out I understand I just wanted to
warn you ahead of time
and speaking of things that might make
you feel uncomfortable
we will I I tend to curse sometimes it's
just naturally part of how I speak and I
hope it doesn't offend anyone it's not
intended to but you know you might hear
a word now and now and again and then I
also wanted to mention that neither I
nor my employer nor the NBC conferences
is responsible for any sort of ragequit
but might result from watching this talk
today that's not my intention my goal is
to motivate you it's to inspire you to
get you really jazzed about what you do
every day
because that's how I feel when I go to
work every day and so I don't want to
discourage you in the least but you know
if if angry ramps laced with expletives
is really your thing then you should
check me out a pop comp tonight I will
be there giving a more ranty version of
this talk with a different set of slides
that is wholly inappropriate and and it
should be a really good time there are
quite a few other talented speakers
there as well so I want to start off by
saying that I didn't call this talk how
to be a badass because I don't believe
that that is a thing that you can simply
accomplish so easily right building
badassery is a journey it's not a
destination
the closest comparison I can make is
that it's much like getting in shape
it's becoming fit and staying fit you
know you don't just do that overnight
and you shouldn't expect to become a
badass overnight you can't come into a
session at a conference leave in an hour
and say tada kind of badass your
co-workers would look at you a bit
strange
so the first step though in becoming a
badass as far as I'm concerned is
recognizing that you have a brand and if
you don't like the word brand maybe
think of it as reputation everyone has a
reputation no matter what they do and
you might think well I'm a code monkey I
just said and I had code in my cubicle
all day long and I am happy doing that
and I don't see why I have to prove
myself to anyone on on the internet or
in my office and that's understandable I
actually did that for many years I was
sort of off the grid and I thought ah
I'm going to let my skills do the
talking you know but the truth is that
the way you are perceived can both in
the workplace and out of the workplace
can really impact the kinds of
opportunities that you're presented with
and it certainly impacts how people
treat you how they whether they respect
you or not
and and what they say to your face and
when you're away right so we all have
how the issue of how we are perceived
and so when you're talking about
building a brand for yourself I'm
generally speaking in terms of things
like LinkedIn building your CV maybe
your github presence and then most
importantly actually is how you interact
with your co-workers on a day-to-day
basis this is a good opportunity to
remind you guys that software is
intended to help human beings you know
as developers we're pretty lucky to do
what we do every day
and I meet so many people who really
just enjoy the process of learning and
hopefully that's why you're here right
we all want to learn we all want to grow
we want to gain new skills and and I get
that and that's great you should learn
right you should continue to learn
otherwise you will get stale in this
industry but I think sometimes we can
become a bit addicted to the learning we
have to remember that the software we're
building is for humans it's to help them
do their jobs better or it's to make
their lives better in some way and I
think it's more useful at times to
consider how we fit into the betterment
of society than to always focus on me
and what I'm learning all the time right
unfortunately has you're probably quite
aware you are a human and I am also
human so at humans I feel like I can
relate to you in this way it's a it's
sort of an issue where we have some some
maintenance requirements some flaws if
you will we are not perfect beings as
much as we hate to admit it so let's
talk a little bit about some of our our
flaws first simply just remember that we
are instruments in our in our social
groups right whether
at work at your organization you are an
instrument to their goals and what they
want to accomplish or if it's in your
home life if you have a family with
small children you are you are an
instrument in your family circle you're
your instrumentality is to help your
family reach its goals right to take
care of your children to help your
spouse etc your energy is finite as much
as we hate to admit it we all need sleep
and listening to your body it's
something that always felt very
touchy-feely to me like listening to my
body like hippie jargon but in reality
you have to be able to know when your
mind is not functioning at it's at its
highest capacity right there is a point
I'm sure we've all had experiences like
this where we're coding late into the
night and even if you think oh I'm a
night owl I love this I'm going to be up
all night this is great
I think because we enjoy what we do we
tend to get again carried away with it
and and you simply can't sustain that
for long periods of time
besides sleep you have other maintenance
requirements this includes things such
as food which I should be clear not just
food but nutrition okay
Mountain Dew and Cheetos doesn't count
yeah so so that's something to be aware
of as well you have to fuel your body
appropriately even if you aren't going
out on a bike ride every day or going
for a run every day maintaining proper
nutrition is again fueling your brain
and that's what we're getting paid to do
is use our brain to build amazing things
you are illogical and and it sort of is
a Segway because if you are not getting
your maintenance requirements met such
as food and sleep you become more
illogical
the decisions that you make are more
likely to be wrong or nonsensical at all
and so again listening to your body
knowing when you reach that point is
critical because you start writing code
and maybe you come in the next day and
you're like who wrote this this is
ridiculous
oh yeah that was me at 3:00 a.m. so even
if you have met all your maintenance
requirements you you're well-fed you're
well-rested it is still quite likely
that you don't know everything and so
it's really helpful both for yourself
and for your co-workers to remember that
humans are just trying the best that
they can with what they have the
information that they have is limited
and you can only make a decision based
on what you know and so we need not beat
ourselves up for potentially bad
decisions and the same goes for our
co-workers when they make a decision
that that sort of backfires finally life
is not fair even if you work hard and
you deserve a promotion it's possible
that your coworker might get the
promotion and you might not understand
why that is and it might even be true
that your coworker truly does not
deserve the promotion right you win some
you lose some
it's how I have to view it there are
opportunities that occur for you that
may not occur for other people and it's
probably a completely different talk to
talk about socioeconomic status and race
and gender and how all of those things
factored in but the truth is we're all
different and the best thing you can do
is be aware of how you are being
perceived treat others with respect so
that you maximize your opportunities but
it's still no guarantee because I think
we all know that that co-worker who got
promoted and didn't deserve it or
perhaps in personal lives you know a guy
who has a beautiful smart wife and you
have no idea how that happened
so we have to handle our exceptions if
you will
first and foremost just just
acknowledging being constantly aware of
all the limitations I just mentioned is
extremely important again that's sort of
like listening to your body or knowing
when you've had enough or setting
boundaries for yourself to know that
okay I've had I've had a nine hour work
day or however long I've worked one
extra night this week I'm done now right
that being said it's really important I
think to separate a bit personal life
and work life the best example I can
think of is you know coworker who might
be late to a meeting and coworker comes
in maybe this has been you before I
think we've all been in this situation
it's like oh I'm so sorry I missed the
train or I have a flat tire you know I
let me tell you all about it I'll start
from the beginning see first I woke up
you know and and then I went to the
train but it was late and so actually I
tried to catch this other train but it
was it was the B train it routed around
the city and it's like you know what I
don't care nobody cares just say you're
going to be late that's fine if somebody
asks you then you explain the whole
story so a big part of like having your
 together is just knowing what how
much information is appropriate
I always err on the side of caution I
always say I'm going to be five minutes
late to the meeting that's it you know
that's a that's a pretty good way of
just summarizing the information that
the other person needs to know and care
about
so who here is familiar with the term
duck typing you guys okay you guys know
what it is
so the concept of course is that in
programming you have an object your
phone your function takes an object and
you have to figure out what that object
is you try to duck type it meaning if it
walks like a duck talks like a duck must
be a duck so you try to determine does
that thing fit in certain categories
which is ironically what people do
when they meet other people in fact most
of the time this happens within the
first few minutes of meeting someone new
they try to figure out you as a person
put you in a nutshell and tuck you into
a nice category and say yeah
you're this kind of person okay that
makes sense to me and it's quite
difficult for them to manage you know a
relationship with you if they don't
understand what kind of person you are
if they if they are really confused
about what category you go in it's like
I don't have a box for that not quite
sure so I like this picture because I
feel like it encapsulate how we should
view ourselves within our companies
really any kind of social group you
might have a religious organization or a
large family and so you know you want to
conform but yet not you want to you want
to adapt to the company's culture so
that you know you're you're relatable
and they kind of understand you they
know what box to put you in and
obviously because if there are certain
rules and things you have to conform to
that but you also want to express your
individuality and the reason why I like
this this photo is because all of these
ducks are unique they're they're
expressing their uniqueness and yet
they're all still ducks so I like to
remind myself of that and I've not
always been successful at it you know I
tend to think that I have a lot of
enthusiasm as an employee and so my
biggest hurdle is when I start at a new
company and I come in in a month I could
do everything this is going to be
awesome down my way you know and people
don't really like that as I've learned
they understandably want want me to you
know get the lay of the land before I
start going around and changing
everything so everybody has their own
unique challenges but that's mine
so here's an example this kind of goes
back to the marketing yourself so this
is a screenshot of someone named John
Smith don't worry I changed his name to
protect the innocent
LinkedIn screenshot showing that he's a
contractor
it shows the contracting firm and VML is
the company that's a company I used to
work for so you know I look at this and
I'm not a recruiter I don't know you
know technically what is most
eye-catching but I can tell you one
thing John Smith doesn't care that's
what I get from that screenshot I don't
see that he's a very enthusiastic person
maybe that's not a fair assumption
but it's the conclusion I'm going to
draw when I view this image right
conversely here's an example of how John
Smith very handsome guy from stock photo
website he he's now a bit more specific
about what he does he's not just a
contractor because who knows what that
does contractor could do anything
usually does everything from what I've
seen and specifically now he's saying
that he's an application developer oh
well that helps what kind of apps do you
build like that's a great starting
question for someone who's who's viewing
this and you know it doesn't even
specify that he's a contractor because
as far as I'm concerned that's that's an
arrangement of payment or schedules
it's an employment agreement right he's
working at vml and he's specifically
doing application development that tells
somebody a lot more about about this
person so as far as photos go to I just
wanted to mention I know that some
people have good reasons for not sharing
a photo and that's understandable
but but I I tend to believe that people
want to connect right they want to
connect with other people and seeing a
photo helps them understand who this is
it puts a face with the name
and it becomes much harder to sort of
dismiss this person think oh he's a real
person I want to meet this real person
okay so I want to talk a little bit
about the very fine line that exists
between an apple and a badass because I
think that the two sometimes get
confused so here here are a few traits
some some traits we're going to scroll
through about the difference between the
two
a naval talks a lot but a badass mostly
listens
a naval complains whereas a badass seek
solutions and that can be a fine line to
write I think we've all had situations
where we complain and we think no no I'm
trying to help find a solution really
which solution did you offer because it
sounded like you were just complaining
right it's it's tough and sometimes that
complaining can lead to a solution but
we have to be cautious of again how
we're being perceived an a-hole grumbles
when there's a problem and a badass
voices concerns appropriately I had a
situation once where it was like a large
town hall-style meeting at a big company
I was working for and the CEO and all of
the executives are up on the on the
stage and there's you know Q&amp;amp;A time a
guy raises his hand in the back and says
what am I going to get my parking spot
back it's like well I'm not sure let me
look into that it might have been a
perfectly legitimate concern right but
that certainly wasn't the time to air
that grievance and and it didn't it
wasn't perceived well by his co-workers
as you can imagine unable interrupts
people and a badass controls the floor
that's a really important one for me
interrupting occasionally very very
occasionally consumed collaborative like
oh yeah I know what you're trying to say
yeah yeah
you know or simply confirmation like
I've got I've had a co-worker who says
yep uh-huh yep yep
yes yes so you know is that interrupting
I'm not sure it's something to be
cautious about I will say that and I
because I don't like to be interrupted I
have a technique that I use and I
noticed after encountering quite a few
people who have tried to interrupt me
over time that that they stop doing it
once they realize that I'm not going to
allow myself to be interrupted so my
technique is simply to talk louder they
start talking and I'm like aha
let me continue talking and but I do I
do make sure then to give them the floor
that's why I say controlling the floor
because it's really important that they
have time to speak also I don't want to
dominate the conversation I simply want
to let them know that I wasn't finished
talking but soon it will be their turn
right
so I also saw a session recently on
conflict resolution with your coworkers
which was fascinating a lady named
Lauren Schiffer in back in the States
does that talk and she mentioned that it
helps generally in in relationships with
their co-workers if you always let them
start first
generally speaking you will more likely
have the last word in the conversation
and not only that you will learn where
they stand on an issue so I think we
should have tabs not spaces how do you
feel about that right it it immediately
lets them know that you care about what
they have to say if you don't care and
then and then you say what you want and
oh well that's the last thing that was
said so it's I'm not that sounds a bit
manipulative but it it truly is
important to help people to have your
co-workers know that you you really do
value what they have to say
I think in that case Lauren was
specifically talking about a manager who
has already made a decision and yet
wants their direct reports to feel that
they have input on that and not only
that but maybe it's maybe it's an
opportunity for her to change your mind
right like I'm thinking about doing this
but let's see if anyone objects if they
have a good reason I might change my
mind so very very important an a-hole is
self-centered and a badass understands
his or her instrumentality so again the
community that you belong to how you fit
in and what the goals are a nail is
complacent and a badass is tenacious I
had a boss who used to call me
persistent pageant because I would not
give up asking him until I got what I
wanted an a-hole fights for his own
needs really only cares about himself a
badass fights for the needs of his or
her team an a-hole makes excuses and a
badass admits fault and that's extremely
important if you're leading a group of
people to have the accountability that
if something goes wrong on the team it's
my fault
right even if it wasn't your fault you
you accept the fault and you admit it
when necessary an a-hole flakes out and
a badass follows through an a-hole
commits on behalf of others whereas a
badass only commits for themselves and I
believe that that's one of the reasons
agile has gained such popularity is
because it puts the commitment in the
hands of the team you know before that
there was a lot of committing on behalf
of others like yeah my team will do that
it'll take six months you know we're as
agile not only breaks down that work so
that it's easy to easier to estimate it
it also then puts it in the laps of the
developers and says well how long do you
think this will take right which is
really really important an ahole trust
no one but a bad-ass trust but verify
an a-hole procrastinates and a badass
makes a plan and then execute the plan
an a-hole puts others down versus a
badass who lifts others up mostly by
action not by words an a-hole gossips
I'm sure you none of us have ever done
that right a badass remains focused it
doesn't get distracted by the rumors
around the office an a-hole expects
others to carve a path and a badass
continually improves and grows
regardless of the path in front of them
so I want to talk a little bit about
appearance now unfortunately a lot of
people even still in this day and age
have this picture come to mind
when you might say I'm a computer
programmer or I'm a developer this is
what they think of and I can assure you
that no one in this room hates this
stereotype more than me so I'd like to
change the way that our field is
perceived I will admit that this is a
bigger problem in the States than it is
here you guys are much more stylish and
conscious of you know hygiene and things
but uh you know far be it from me to
dictate how anyone should dress or groom
themselves but I do think it's important
that we all look like we got ready on
purpose that we didn't just roll out of
bed and show up for work and say on here
you're welcome you know so a badass owns
the look I don't care if you are wearing
sneakers and a t-shirt and a pair of
jeans you should look pulled together I
don't care if you have a beard you
should look like you have a beard on
purpose
does anyone know can anyone guess who
this is Santa Claus that's right or a
human nestled in Norwegian yeah this is
a yeah this is this is Santa Claus he or
Sinterklaas is the other one I know him
Dutch this is York Dale fashion Santa
which is a campaign that was put on by
the Yorkdale mall in Toronto is a very
posh mall and it was wildly successful I
mean look at this guy he's amazing he
does not have time for your you
know he's he's a busy guy women want to
be with him didn't want to be him you
know he actually had lines out the door
you had to schedule an appointment to
come see the fashion Santa Claus at
Yorkdale mall so I like this because it
shows pretty clearly admittedly just
men's fashion that you can wear jeans
and look pulled together you can wear a
scarf you can wear a leather jacket like
just look like you care a badass put
number one first
and so I I like to call this the oxygen
mask principle that if you're not
helping yourself you're not helping
anyone else again that goes back to
those requirements we talked about if
you're not getting your needs met then
you're not going to be very useful to
your organization to your family and I
want to go further to say that it's not
just the bare minimum requirements right
I think that's kind of where the line is
drawn like I have food and and I have
sleep so I'm good you know I don't need
to have fresh air or exercise or you
know peace and quiet at home or whatever
it is like whatever it is you like to do
go have a beer with your friends you
know go play some sports like those are
those are the things that keep us
well-rounded and happy individuals and
so it's really important to carve out
for that and to me the calendar is king
if it's not on my calendar it likely
doesn't happen and so if something is
important to me I will put it on my
calendar block that time off and say
this is my time to read because I enjoy
reading working out is the same thing I
go to the gym every Monday and Friday
and then I work out on the weekends and
somebody says oh I need to have a
meeting with you Friday at noon I'm like
I'm sorry how about Friday 3:00 no say
oh yeah no problem
you know I don't change that schedule so
that's important a badass commands
respect one of the things that I love
about Chuck Norris and hit the
characters that he plays and a lot of
other fictional characters as well is a
he demands respect through silence so if
you've noticed like the the paw on
little house from the Prairie is another
great example right powerful people tend
to say little and I found that people
generally value what I have to say more
when I speak less often and and so
that's something to remind myself every
time I open my mouth and I'm about to
say something
is it worth saying does it help or hurt
me right and many times it's it's not
necessary so generally speaking you
command respect by remaining silent more
often on the other hand lighten up you
know a badass is also approachable there
is a fantastic book called no one
understands you and what to do about it
by heidi grand Halverson she explains
the dichotomy or the combination of
competence and warmth that if you have
those two things in the workplace you
seem competent you can get work
done but at the same time you're a warm
caring person that is a very powerful
magical combination and that's how you
tend to move up within the organization
is that people really put a lot of trust
in you this is a quadrant system that
was developed by Kim Scott I believe she
worked at Google she she had since this
was originally on a blog post and she
has said posted or published a book by
the same name called radical candor this
quadrant system is excellent I think for
categorizing relationships between two
people so from your perspective you can
imagine that the y-axis is caring
personally about someone so at the top
you care about them a lot at the bottom
not at all and on the x-axis challenging
them directly so this person we're
talking about do you challenge them when
appropriate or or do you just remain
overly silent right you just let them do
whatever they want no matter how
ill-advised radical candor is where you
want to be that quadrant means that you
are challenging someone to grow to be a
better person to question their own
decisions but in a way that is
respectful and timely if you don't care
about them but you do challenge them
then you fall into the obnoxious
aggression categories and I think we've
all had coworkers like that someone who
just liked to argue it seems the other
quadrant adjacent is ruinous empathy so
that's where you care about someone but
you don't challenge them and so in a way
you're enabling potentially poor
behaviors right a friend who drinks too
much let's say you know you just let
them like it's the
they are I've had a great many people in
my life say well this is just how I am
what a sad statement it means that
they're never going to grow or change
and I'm not the one to tell them that
they should change but I like to grow
and change and so that kind of a
statement is quite defeatist I think
manipulative in sincerity is of course
the worst category to be in where you
don't challenge anyone and you you don't
care about them either so the link there
is live I'll post these slides later by
the way through Twitter and and you can
get a link to Kim Scott's book there so
I have an audio clip here this is
another fantastic book called you are a
badass I actually read it after I made
the title for this talk but Jensen chero
is the author this was a rare few set of
books that changed I think changed my
life for the better so I'll play it for
you now
hopefully audio is on this is what it
means to make a decision
for realz when you make a no-nonsense
decision you sign up fully and keep
moving towards your goal regardless of
what's flung in your path and stuff will
most definitely get flung which is why
making the decision is so crucial this
 is not for sissies the moment it
gets hard or expensive or puts you at
risk of looking like a moron if you
haven't made the decision you will quit
if it wasn't uncomfortable everyone
would be out there all in love with
their fabulous lives so often we pretend
we've made a decision when what we've
really done is signed up to try until it
gets too uncomfortable Henry Ford didn't
even make it past the sixth grade and
there he was bossing around a bunch of
the world's biggest engineering
smartypants --is setting himself up to
look like a total idiot by spending
large amounts of money and time
on the proven impossible Ford was
determined and he trusted his guts and
his vision more than the small sinking
of others
he'd made the decision that he would
have his engine the way he would have it
and nothing was going to stop him this
is why the decision is so important if
you had an idea and had to go up against
a room full of people who quote-unquote
knew better than you did and demand they
do what you say in spite of all the
proof they had against you would you
stick to your guns or if you needed tens
of thousands of dollars to start your
new business and the only person you
could think of to ask was your scary
rich uncle who never remembered who you
were even though you saw him every
Christmas would you ask him for it or if
you were sick of feeling fat and unsexy
and out of shape and the only time you
could make it to the gym was it's 5:00
a.m. on freezing winter mornings when
you were all snugly in bed would you go
if you made the decision that you were
going to reach your goals you would do
whatever it took if you merely wanted to
but hadn't made the firm decision to
you'd roll over and begin convincing
yourself that your life is fine just the
way it is
damn that's what I thought when I
listened to this audio book and the car
that that's that's what we call drive
way moment or I just had to hit repeat a
few times to be like wow that that
resonated with me
probably because I used to try to
workout in the mornings and I would hit
the snooze button and go back to sleep
so I work out at lunch now so to clarify
to put a finer point on it a bad-ass is
not a mean person you don't have to be
mean in order to be considered a badass
don't have to be rude you don't have to
be an unfeeling robot like I mentioned
warmth is an extremely part important
part of the equation a badass is not a
manager a badass can be a manager but
it's not a position you hold and I know
a lot of developers who
haven't moved up the ranks in the
company's corporate career ladder and I
consider them to be badasses so it has
nothing to do with your title badass is
not rich that's another common
misconception it's quite easy if you're
rich to look pulled together to have
people waiting on you or a fancy car and
and it gives the illusion that you're a
badass but in reality it actually has
nothing to do with money it's all about
the way that you carry yourself and so
when we think about a nice car or nice
clothes that simply gives you the
confidence to feel good about yourself
but you don't need those things right
the emperor's new clothes you don't need
to have those nice clothes but when you
put them on you stand tall and that's
really what being a badass is all about
a badass is not popular you don't have
to be the most you know outgoing person
at a party so um I also want to say that
the word sorry comes up a lot and
there's this illustration it's actually
just by this this Chinese guy I think he
goes by that Twitter handle there which
will take you to his Twitter or the
hashtag I guess but he does these little
drawings and this is a great one this is
just a clip of the overall comic strip
but we we need to be cautious about how
we use the word sorry
how and when we apologize sorry is to be
reserved for certain cases when you
really truly are sorry right I had a
friend back in Kansas City who gave
keynote speech and I I completely spaced
I just I missed her keynote I think I
woke up too late
I got there when I got there and I was
like oh when are you speaking she's like
I already spoke that was that was a bad
friend moment for me and later not in
the hustle-bustle of the conference but
later on I went to her in a private
moment and I said I am so so sorry that
I missed your talk it's you know I was
disappointed I didn't mean to I'm please
accept my apology that's the kind of
thing you're sorry for you know sorry
for being late
yeah that's really more like thank you
for your patience
so this comic strip I encourage you to
check it out through that link there
it's more about replacing sari with
thank you
thanking people for their patience and
their understanding when you feel bad
about a situation time is finite that's
a that's something we all kind of have
to remember you're you're going to die
someday I'm sorry to break it to you
we all will so it's really important
that we respect our time we use our time
wisely and this is a system developed by
President Dwight D Eisenhower back in
the States
he developed this to categorize all of
the things that he had to do on any
given day so you've got important and
not important and you've got urgent and
non-urgent can you guys tell I like
quadrants now I don't actually I think
he actually had notes and he like pasted
them up in the quadrants I have a color
coding system like I use a notes app on
my phone to keep track of all the things
I need to do and I categorize them by
color and each color corresponds to a
quadrant and it's kind of important to
realize that your Casa list is
never-ending
you will never get to the bottom of all
the things you have to do your to-do
list will just keep growing and growing
but the things that
are important and urgent obviously need
to get done urgently as you can imagine
from that point it's a bit difficult to
figure out are they urgent and not
important or important but not urgent so
that's a pretty careful distinction that
we need to make with the tasks that fill
our our to-do list as developers I think
we have a tendency I know I do to start
things and then almost when we're
finished with them find something shiny
to go do instead new technology is like
that right like I've mastered this one
you know and especially if you're
thinking about the learning part you
think yeah I've mastered it you know it
doesn't matter I've mostly got this done
somebody else can finish it or I'll
finish it later and what that means is
that you have a lot of balls in the air
right and it's a much nicer feeling to
stop starting and start finishing no is
a complete sentence you don't have to
explain the know I suppose you can if
someone asks right so you're your son
has a birthday party on Friday night and
your boss really wants you to come to
some sort of social hour for your work
you know you could say I'm sorry but I
can't if you're not sorry just say no I
won't be able to make it again
separating work and personal life means
that you don't need to go into all the
details about why you don't want to or
can't though there's a shirt I really
like it says sorry I'm late I didn't
want to come
and I've really had to restrict myself
from buying it but that's sort of how I
feel sometimes right and and I've found
that good friends and good co-workers
understand that I have another life that
doesn't involve them they understand
that I can't be all places in all times
and so they'll let me know if something
is critical for me to to be a part of it
otherwise I'll see I'll commit if I if I
if I truly want to commit but I won't
commit out of obligation and so remember
that when you say no you're also saying
yes you're saying yes to yourself your
own desires and what you want you're
saying yes to people that are close to
you people you care about and you're
saying yes to causes that you care about
this might be volunteering this might be
religious organizations other kinds of
social groups that aren't work that's
pretty much all I have I was going to do
a QA and I thought well Chuck Norris
wouldn't have a QA so if you do have
questions feel free to come approach me
after after all the wild applause that
I'm sure will happen thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
