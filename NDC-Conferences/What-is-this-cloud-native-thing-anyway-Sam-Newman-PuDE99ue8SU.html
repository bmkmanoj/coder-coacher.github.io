people at the back hear me okay perfect
thank you I kind of almost lost my voice
last week which it's probably the worst
thing I think ever happened to anybody
that's what I felt all the time because
I like talking and so I've been trying
to protect my voice which didn't help
what I went out on the boat last night
and it had a lot of fun but I'm not
drunk I'm not hungover don't worry but
it was that whole quite a noisy echoey
boat and so I woke up this morning
worrying that I've ruined my voice again
so I'm gonna try to speak more softly
than I normally do but it sounds like
it's projecting over there if my voice
does give out halfway through we will
continue the presentation through the
medium of dance which may not go down
well but it'd be fun for videoing so
thank you so much for coming along to
see this talk about cloud native stuff
and actually thank you very much for
being part of the NDC conference here in
London one of the things we do is part
of the organizing committees we're very
careful to take feedback around how the
event is running and the sessions you
like in the sessions you don't like and
so it's really important for you know
for all of our speakers and the
organising committee as well to get your
feedback so please if you do have an
opportunity to don't just vote on the
outside I mean we definitely like it
when you vote on the way out but if you
can also you've got any other notes or
thoughts or feedback that you want to
give us about the venue the way the
things arranged anything at all please
just do that I'll snoke's it really does
help us run a better event and yeah
hopefully going from strength to
strength also the food he's been really
good so I've been quite happy about
looking for to lunch
anyway you here to learn about cloud
native stuff I hope otherwise you are in
the wrong room but that's fine and just
a bit of background so my name is Sam
Newman I tend to write about
microservice e type stuff I now run my
own company which it should really be
Sam Newman and associate rather than
Associates plural but we'll skip over
that bit and I do sort of training
consultancy advisory workforce of
startups and tech companies and things
like that as well as sort of bumble my
way through as a lifetime conscious
incompetent when it comes to all things
technology related which is partly what
inspired this talk
because I frequently find myself sort of
befuddled and confused about the state
of the world and what's going on and
increasingly people are talking to me
about saying well I've been told I've
got to be cloud native but I said why do
you need to be cloud native and they'd
say because yes my boss says we've got
to be cloud native which is not you know
new to me because I've spent many years
with people saying my boss told me we've
got to be micro-services and beyond what
that meant I wasn't yeah that's what I
do I help people do that and so now I
but they're now a cloud native and
apparently cloud native is also the same
thing as micro services and so I got
very very confused for a while and so
I've kind of spent the last year or two
trying to pull apart what this means why
it's important when it might mean for
all of us and what technology around the
space might be and so you can kind of
see this as a look both the history of
where cloud natives come from the
opportunities it gives whether it's the
right thing to you and what you know
what it actually means to some extent
because the term is the term is sort of
it's like it's like digital native
almost in a way like it's like I'm being
brought up in the body in the warm
embrace of the cloud like I've been
birthed out of the cloud
whereas I just thought the cloud is
where I stored my documents and this is
you know we've got to get through a lot
of the a lot of the marketing fluff and
a the fact that we are in IT very very
good at coming up with terms and then
rapidly rapidly devaluing them what
we've seen with Moore's law has been
doubling the transistor density every 18
months and that used to you know
increase our clock speeds right with
double our clock speeds every 18 months
that's typically what happened to a
certain point now I think transistor
density is just helping us devalue IT
teams at CIT terms more quickly than
ever before because we can more quickly
put out rubbish and marketing on the
internet and you know we have mass
confusion about what leaving the cloud
means but let's talk about history a
minute and when you start talking to
people especially developers about the
cloud and the cloud as a tool for
building applications and for building
develop you know for building and
developing applications your a lot of
people will point to
sort of things like Amazon Web Services
right as being the first platform out
there that was really giving us as
developers the ability to build
applications that were on the cloud the
focus on creating a cloud-based offering
they were far from the first person that
allowed you to run services somewhere
other than on your premise but the focus
on giving us the ability to write a line
of code to do that work was really the
the moment that changed for most of us
as developers in this environment before
that you would typically have graphical
based systems maybe of human beings
being involved and so just the fact that
your work clothes were running somebody
else's machine the only thing that you
gained from that was that somebody else
was managing the machine there was no
real moment of empowering control that
like we do yet now for Amazon we sort of
take for granted it's very worth
reflecting on the fact that Amazon
stopped Amazon Web Services isn't
actually that old in the grand scheme of
things I mean the very first cloud
offering that AWS put out was actually
sqs was just their little queue service
was back in 2006 I started using Amazon
stuff around 2008 2009 I sort of
accidentally ended up helping create the
first public training courses for Amazon
Web Services and back then you know you
only had about 40 different things you
can do with it now when you go to the
Amazon console you have a little search
box in your console and you have to have
like a regular expression match her to
even find the product you're trying to
bloody use and it's get very confusing
but it did start very modestly back in
2006 in a way though the the you know
this was this was already this was
always going to happen the idea that we
as organizations would be happy taking
control away from ourselves actually
giving control to other people because
precedent had already been well and
truly set and really that started not
with this stuff but actually started
even earlier and started with software
as a service it started with people
offering us capabilities inside our
organizations software to our
organizations that was being run
somewhere else rather than having to
come and set it up inside your
infrastructure
it was now viable things that are inside
every every sort of organization whether
they realized it or not and when I was
first having initial conversations we
cry
about whether or not they wanted to
adopt Amazon Web Services they said oh
well we can't have things running on
other people's machines that's scary and
that's bad things will happen you know
we can't do that it's dangerous and then
you'd have few explorers a bit more with
them and say so you're any Salesforce
like oh yeah of course we've got
Salesforce everyone has Salesforce right
Salesforce launched in 1999 believe it
or not it's now going to market cap
somewhere north of sixty billion dollars
a great success story actually for a
java monolithic based system by the way
and all these organizations that were
quite happily already putting a
significant amount of their data and
processing out of their network
perimeter into a centralized SAS base
product and and once they realize that
that solitaire is we are actually
already doing that okay so maybe maybe
we can go a bit further I think in terms
of cloud native applications and
thinking more about an opinionated style
of developing for the cloud
I think another watershed moment was
probably Heroku your Amazon's approach
early on with AWS was was sort of trying
to position themselves to an extent like
a utility like we provide electricity
you use it how you see fit we're not
going to let you we're not going to be
opinionated about how you use it and if
you were an early adopter of the AWS
technologies you'd realize that
frequently you were just using their
technology but also managing to
electrocute yourself frequently around
that as well because they weren't really
strong opinions about how that stuff was
used at all right Heroku was very
different as a platform they still I
think the the gold standard for a
developer focused platform as a service
it's no surprise that multiple
organizations have basically come up
with command lines for example that just
copy what Heroku does and copy the
Heroku lifestyle let's say lifecycle you
know some of you may have used cloud
foundry inside your own organizations
that was completely retooled to copy the
lifecycle and command line and
abstractions from Heroku back in 2007
Heroku had been trying to create a
platform as a service that was developer
friendly and started trying to think
well this is this introduces interesting
balance that comes here right so create
a platform as a service you have to
create a level of abstraction you have
to hide away some detail
from you from the developer but what
levels of what parts of those
abstractions do you still make visible
to people as they started thinking about
the primitives that we cared about from
a platform as-a-service
point of view sort of out of this work
came something called the 12 factors I'm
sure anyone here still have heard of the
12 factors or 12 factor wraps yeah and
this was sort of the actually remains
one of the best examples of somebody
trying to put together a playbook of how
to build applications that work on the
web as they work on the cloud the thing
to understand about the 12 factors is
they're actually quite nice and
prescriptive it's actually a combination
both of a collection of constraints by
that I mean it you know you have to do
these things otherwise your application
won't work well on the Heroku platform
but also there's a whole lot of here
which is just about good developer
principles and good developer practice
so although the 12 factors are now much
you know used much more widely its
history in its background was very much
a a set of principles that ensure that
you can work well with a Heroku platform
so there's some interesting stuff in
here some of it is still quite
detail-oriented and I think doesn't
necessary stack up and we look at the
more modern ways we now deploy
applications but there are still some
really good pieces of advice in here you
know we look at something like backing
services will start actually trying to
push us away from this idea of thinking
about you know trying to actually move
our thinking to saying a database Ajit's
another service and a network it's not
something special it's just another
thing you talk to or looking at things
like how we think about processes
scaling via separate shared nothing
stateless services and you know break
Leros about it part of doing that meant
you got the most out a rocky platform
this is also partly about them steering
their customers away from behaviors that
would make it really hard to use their
product but also it's just generally
good advice and so much of this sort of
mindset comes in to what we talk about
now in terms of micro services micro
services just being an opinionated form
of service-oriented architecture so the
12 factors are great and they're sort of
useful but when people say cloud native
I look at this and still think well this
it's not quite the right level of
abstraction to explain what cloud native
means or what a cloud native
even is so I went digging around and
Google Google is always as your friend
and you turn up some all kinds of
interesting opinions and views from
different sort of agencies and analysts
type firms one of which I turned that
was from the Open Data Center Alliance
and they have a maturity model now I
have imaged in general I don't like
maturity models because I feel that
sometimes maturity models can always so
that they they say that you know level 4
is better than level 3 it tends to imply
a linear journey and I know I lived
through the software engineering
Institute capability maturity models in
the 90s and no didn't really help
deliver better software and so I'm I'm
naturally pessimistic about maturity
models from that point of view but
nonetheless diving into the detail and
can be interesting to talk about a
journey you might go on so let's take a
look at what the Open Data Center
Alliance talked about in terms of cloud
native they have these nice levels
rights we start a virtualized which is
you're just on virtualized
infrastructure so that means your level
zero cloud native I'm gonna get a
t-shirt with that I am level 0 cloud
native and we go up and got loosely
coupled we've got abstracted with where
services become stateless sort of
interested that you know I'd argue it's
quite hard to make so it is nicely
loosely coupled if they're also stateful
again this is why maturity models can be
quite confusing because it's sort of it
doesn't quite that's not how things
evolve and to be level free adaptive
you're gonna be an adaptive organization
embracing the full power of cloud native
if we hit one of the early things we do
when we start exploring the cloud native
space and this is this idea that we
should be cross cloud across vendor so
to be adaptive an application can
dynamically dynamically this isn't a
good word
you know migrate across infrastructure
providers without interruption of
service which I don't know anybody that
does this literally I don't know anybody
that dynamically manages an application
a non-trivial application across
multiple cloud vendors with zero
interruption of service does not exist
doesn't you think the big the big
organizations the big coms they might
make heavy use of other cloud providers
they might have multiple cloud providers
in their mix but they're not in the
dynamic keep managing workloads across
different cloud providers guess who
doesn't get to be adaptive in this model
Google and Netflix do not according to
this model fall under level three so
which need to poke at this a little bit
there was this fixation to an extent on
abstraction away from different
underlying providers early on which I
don't think is always helpful and this
is the term that gets talked about
lock-in you're worried about being
locked into a provider and this is one
of the big scares and fears that put us
away CTOs and CIOs I don't to be locked
into a provider I don't to be beholden
to somebody for so long a lot of
organizations have been bitten from
being locked in to you having to pay IBM
or Microsoft big license checks at the
end of each year because there's no
other choice and I think well why she
we've got portability now again partly
because there's some of the lies we were
told or maybe the lies or the other or
the lies we told ourselves about the
nature of cloud because yeah we're
worried about being locked in we're
right about being stuck somewhere and
that's not great it's embarrassing being
stuck somewhere and we shouldn't be
stuck somewhere should me because we
were told we were told that the crowd
was utility right we're told the cloud
was utility utility like the electricity
that comes out of the socket over the
water that flows out of your tap so in
the UK we've deregulated a lot of that
stuff so I can go up to a web browser
and say I'm I want to change my
electricity provider and it's magic just
happens the nature of the electricity
coming out of the wall doesn't it
doesn't change voltage right you know
the frequency isn't changing I don't
suddenly dropped it to 120 Hertz and
have to play somewhere appliances know I
flick a switch and it just works because
the different providers are providing
effectively an equivalent service just
at a different price point and maybe
from a different electricity source the
cloud isn't like that
these these artifacts these different
product offerings are not replaceable in
the same way in the same shape or form
we don't have a you switch for cloud
providers you can't click a button and
go okay right and this is this leads
though to some fuzzy thinking well we
can and we should and because we can't
what we're going to do is we're going to
like another abstraction layer on top
and so we'll go out to a third party
that will give us the ability to
transparent you move between vendors and
that stuff never works because you end
up with the lowest common denominator
problem where you can only use the
services that are common to all cloud
providers which means you get to take
advantage of none of the underlying
fundamental benefits those platforms but
still pay the cost for the abstraction
layer so the first thing I'd say here
when you're thinking about cloud and the
cloud strategy is don't actually fixate
on lock-in actually I think a better
thing to think about is migration cost
you're picking a cloud service first
understand that not all things that that
cloud provider offers are equally you
know complicated in terms of a migration
away from some other service if you
think about the cost of migration let's
take a few cool product type offerings
that as your Google and AWS all have
right now if I've got something like
blobstore which a binary large object
storage now those services across the
different providers are pretty much
equivalent you might play around a
little bit with the exact number of
nines durability or resiliency of those
services there's different price points
but primarily it stores binary data and
I get binary data out and actually their
migration cost there is typically
putting data on a drive and moving it
right so it's actually quite an easy
undertaking the semantics the difference
in semantics between those services is
pretty much equipment is pretty much the
same compute it's a bit more work right
because although once you've got a
running machine
it behaves yeah a running Windows
instance on AWS behaves pretty much like
a running Windows instance on Azure on a
zero or some other cloud platform
typically the life cycle of management
around that machine is different you
know you've got to spin it up the api's
are subtly different and distinct
finding the right size machine for you
it's a bit more work but once you're
there it's not so bad low balances well
these are different okay so you know
with I'm using an elastic load balancer
but I could I could actually replace an
elastic load balancer on AWS with my own
mod proxy little software load balancer
and I can kind of see how I could rework
that into a and as your load balancer
nice work but it's manageable right and
then we start looking at some of the
higher abstracted services like function
as
service or back-end as a service type
offerings you know these things that we
typically talk about as being parts of a
service product suite we especially
start looking at something like a
back-end services databases like Google
BigTable or AWS is DynamoDB those type
of no sequel oriented data stores are
have very different semantics the way
you store data across the different
offerings is quite different than way
you retrieve data is quite different the
way those systems scale is quite
different porting from an application
that might be using Google's BigTable
over to Amazon to now make use of
something like DynamoDB it's probably
going to require you to actually rewrite
parts of your application stack
therefore and migration cost is going to
be higher and so if I'm you know working
with a client we're looking at a cloud
vendor you're gonna pick and we're
saying well where do I how deep do I go
into a platform this is the kind of
conversation you have you said look
these are all the things that could be
really useful these things if you pick
them and you realize you've made a
mistake with this cloud vendor they can
be quite easy for you to migrate these
things that you picked these things are
going to be more work if you need to
move provider are you okay with that and
then what you need to do is well list is
think about how beneficial these things
are going to be right so you can
actually start I've turn it into a
quadrant I do apologize it's kind of
what I do I turn as an independent
consultants we turned caffeine into
quadrants so now you know you can start
thinking for your given problem space am
I going to make use of backends or
service is that a really great benefit
to me well yes then maybe I'm okay
running the risk that later on I need to
change my mind and this comes then down
to a pay now or pay later
type decision-making process right if I
really embrace what this cloud platform
gives me I get to take advantage today
after some really awesome stuff and
there's a risk that later on
I might have to move provider and so do
I take advantage of the cool stuff now
and worry about that other risk later on
or do I instead say no no this is really
really awesome but it's not a very
portable thing great example would be
Google's bigquery or or AWS is redshift
both fantastic systems from fantastic
products for looking and querying large
100 data but as the semantics don't
really exist anywhere else
so yeah I could get great benefit from
using redshift today but actually
because I'm so worried about the cost of
potentially moving out service I might
instead use the service it's not quite
as good but it's maybe easier to migrate
again and the reality is even for
organizations that have made those
choices they tend not to switch later on
because they build up a skill sales at
one certain platform so even then I'm a
bit suspect but it does come down to
this or pay now or pay later another
question you'll often get at this stage
is talking about mixing different cloud
vendors so actually there's a hedging a
risk so actually worth we're not sure
what if we've Amazon jack their price is
up this is always a concern once they
get a significant share of the market
they'll start increasing their prices
and we'll be locked in hasn't happened
and they do have a significant share of
the market it might still happen right
so organizations say we shouldn't mix
mix different cloud vendors the
challenge with this of course is that
there's actually quite a deep body of
knowledge you need to build up in terms
of these sort of quite nuanced cloud
platforms from Amazon Google and
Microsoft and accommodating in your
organization a deep skill set around
shows platforms is investment it's an
undertaking you know it's much more
cost-effective for you to be really up
to speed with one platform than trying
to be up to speed with three platforms
again you might end up with a problem
where you've got a bunch of people that
have very broad knowledge but not very
deep knowledge now I think across an
organization this can still make a lot
of sense if you're across a big
organization you might actually want to
have workloads running in say all the
big three vendors knowing that an
organization will never at a global
level you're hedging your risk and you
have expertise inside the organization
for all those three vendors I think it
makes very little sense though within a
single team within a single solution
space you know if you've got like 20
people getting 20 people up to speed or
two or three or four different cloud
vendors there's a lot of work and it's a
significant portion of your time energy
and investment quite aside from the fact
that this would quite often result in
some really nasty latencies when we
start thinking about interconnected
systems and the reality is as well when
you really fully embrace a system and
let yourself be you know locked into an
extent that can sometimes be okay so I'm
a diamond I I'm an apple
I'm not an Apple fanboy but I'm an Apple
user and some people you know a lot of
people especially who used Android and
gravitating more towards the Android
ecosystem early on said the thing is
you're in a walled garden Sam you're in
a walled garden and as his assumption
that the walled garden is always a
horrid place to be because you're
trapped you know you can't get out you
know you're stuck there forever
the thing is though like some all
gardens are really nice like you've got
nice relaxing like deck chairs in front
of a babbling brook you know someone
comes over and brings you a nice dry
martini and you and you sit the martini
in his lovely Sun dappled Sun coming
through the trees and you can watch the
cricket and inexplicably England they're
actually winning the ashes this time and
it's a lovely place to be right it's
fantastic and though you can't get out
very easily but why would you be it's
awesome there some walled gardens are
not like that are they some got some
some walled gardens are full of you know
knives and broken glass and it's barred
wire on the walls and it's prison
wardens in there and they beat you and
take your money and that is the thing
you sell more guns and thanks you
sometimes being stuck somewhere it's a
good thing right sometimes it's like
actually it's right here and this is the
thing for us when we're thinking about
adopting a cloud platform you can really
throw yourself into it and use all the
really really cool awesome stuff like
that that's in there you can use those
features which aren't don't exist
anywhere else and take advantage of them
and hopefully those products have been
created to work together and so you can
kind of get ecosystem effects I think
it's interesting to note I don't
actually think that happens as much with
AWS I think that's partly a function of
how the Amazon product set gets created
right you know they have these
autonomous teams that come up with
product ideas and they get things out to
market that's why they roll out features
way faster than the other cloud vendors
but sometimes that means that they don't
always communicate with themselves in
terms of the product offerings and so
they don't often integrate with each
other so you know some of you may have
seen at AWS reinvent they announced a
managed kubernetes service which was the
least worst kept secret in in cloud
computing but everyone knew it's going
to happen so they launched this managed
Cooper net
servus they also managed us they're also
released a service called Fargate that
allowed you to run container work close
price per seconds there are only six
months behind Microsoft and that one but
you can't use these two things together
and it's like there are laws by
different bits of the organization
different product sets it's like well
how do you make these two things to work
together that's actually primarily why
lamda got launched when lambda was first
launched on Amazon the function as a
service it was primarily positioned as a
way of gluing together Amazon's own
services they admitted this thing
doesn't sometimes always talk to this
thing and so you often have to end up
writing your own code to make these
things connect and so that's what lambda
was about initially was about having
event-driven JavaScript glue between the
products it hasn't worked together I
think Microsoft has a better job
different trade-offs as an organization
right if you have a more connected
product set it's gonna slow your time to
market and lets you know a more
autonomous team structure you'll go
faster if you might not be as joined up
okay so don't worry about lock-in
embrace the platform we're going to come
back to sign you embracing the platform
a bit later on but we're here to talk
about cloud natives so let's also take a
look at another definition so we didn't
like the open data center Alliance
definition of cloud native so it's got
to be somebody else out there well why
don't we go take a look at the cloud
native computing foundation because
they've got cloud native in their title
so they clearly know what they're
talking about and they've got some
really interesting definitions which I
think get much closer to what cloud
native is and seem to be much more
university adopted as its kind of that
the big the beat so that we want to hit
around these sorts of cloud native
definitions and so here's the big three
points that they talk about from their
definition from the from their charter
container packaged dynamically managed
and micro service-oriented okay so
dynamically managed means flexible right
it can scale up it can scale down not
necessarily inherently fault-tolerant
but certainly something where you have a
level of dynamism and and and the
application itself is built with that
level of dynamism in mind let's talk
briefly about container package why is
that even a thing right why are we
talking about containers well partly
because you know they're so hot right
now
but also partly because containers when
it comes to cloud platforms and cloud
platform deployments give us a hole and
a nice benefit right so isolated
execution is a big one when you run a
program inside a container you have an
isolated set of resources and varying
degrees of isolation from a security
point of view that allow a workload to
run in isolation now if you're building
an application is going to work on the
cloud this is very useful because why it
allows for multi-tenancy it allows you
to have lots of different containers
from different workloads running
side-by-side on the same infrastructure
allowing for much better
cost-effectiveness whether or not it's
your cloud or somebody else's cloud it's
also great for us from a point of view
of Universal deployment I deploy a
container that happens to be running
Java another one that happens to be
running dotnet core another one that
happening Python I don't care I just
launched the container and either spins
up or it doesn't so uniform deployment
which again simplifies your deploy chain
in terms of managing cloud applications
you don't care what's inside the box you
just deploying the box and also actually
from the cloud native point of view is
portable there's a portability around
containers because you have uniform
deployment because isolated execution
they are a unit theoretically of
redeploy ability not only across other
machines but potentially other providers
talk about that a bit later on so okay
but so container packaged but everyone
now is talking about service actually
where people are talking about service
what they're actually talking about is
fast most people make that mistake they
say service is just function as a
service the term service has been around
for much longer than function as a
service has so function as a service
things like you know as you allow
functions and lambda write little little
bits of code that spin up on demand and
when they're not needed are not running
really useful there's varying qualities
in terms of the tool chains around this
I think AWS lambdas experience is a
trainwreck but it actually has got quite
a rich service offering once you get
beyond those problems so but these
aren't container where's the containers
here well actually these are using
containers staged an implementation
detail I one of the first little tricks
I saw when lambda first launched or
someone worked out how to bust out of
the lambda sandbox
you could see the running docker
container those things are running on
right so containers are still there
they're just being hidden away this is
the future for containers for most of us
by the way containers and yoonah kernels
as well are just going to become an
implementation detail behind high-level
abstractions okay so we've talked about
why container packaged could be useful
in a cloud environment where you want to
spin things up and rescale and move
things about what about microservices
well we have to address what I know is
the biggest concern that all of you have
right now and that's the - here which is
concerned me deeply I mean I write a
whole book without hyphens and yet the
cloud native computing foundation is
backtracking on that but we still fight
the good fight
now pivotal is on my side pivotal zone
sort of four pillars of cloud native our
DevOps continues delivery containers and
micro services which is an interesting
set of things to pull together I think
they are reinforcing but they also have
this idea of micro services as being key
to building a cloud native application
now oddly for somebody who is the person
who's talks about micro sources more
than most I'm actually less on board
with this being an essential part of a
cloud native application and I think the
reason I'm less on board is because
there is this assumption that cloud
native is kind of thing you either are
or you aren't it's like a switch click
come on so that means I can't be cloud
native unless I'm using micro services
but if I've got an application that
really embraces my platform that can
Auto scale is resilient where I've got
like a nice abstracted dynamic
management and it happens to be a
monolith still a cloud native
application maybe I'm not taking as full
advantage of the cloud as I could
because it's not broken apart it's still
a cloud native application and so I also
want you to think about that a little
bit it's not a switch it's more like a
dial right you can be more and more
aggressive and how you embrace the cloud
platform right micro services allow you
to more fully use those those the cloud
platform underneath but they're not
necessarily essential but nonetheless
they do have benefits in in a sort of
cloud environment right firstly by
breaking things apart we allow our
different parts of our system is their
separate services to be scaled
independently this can be really you
because it can begin to be their
cost-effectiveness I can scale up just
those parts the system that require
additional scale that require improve
performance I can also scale those
things down that don't need it make more
money right if I reduce my operational
costs I increase my profit margins
I also allow for independent
employability therefore I can take
advantage makes it much easier to make
my systems robust and resilient in a
cloud environment because again with a
cloud environment you typically don't
have an SLA for a given unit of compute
so Amazon have never had a service level
agreement for the uptime of a single
unit of compute F er they actually only
have an SLA for uptime of compute in a
given availability zone and that's only
97% which is why you should have your
solution scaled across a whole region
inside AWS which is more problematic if
your system is more monolithic and can't
be easily scaled around those
environments it also allows you by
breaking things apart to use the right
tool for the right job for example I
could break apart my system this service
I can look at this data storage
requirements and realize well actually
this Maps really well to Google BigTable
so I'm going to make use a Google beat
table here you can actually pick the
different cloud offerings where they
give you these heart more powerful use
cases and they're offloading more the
administration work to the cloud
provider and it's much easy when you
break a problem space apart to match
those to the right cloud service for the
job
this can actually allow you to take
advantage of these benefits so I'm not
saying you have to do micro services
cloud native at all but I think if you
have an architecture which is broken
apart into independently deployed
processes I can micro service
architecture it's going to give you more
opportunity to really use the underlying
platform and usually it's good for ok so
enough beating around the bush let's try
and distill this down a little bit and
talk a bit about what cloud native II is
based on my research at least what I
think it is and coming back to the idea
of a journey that we're going on you
know let's talk about how we get
applications on the cloud and
historically how we do it and we start
with something like a lift and shift now
I spent many years railing against the
lift and shift and lift and shift is
where you you sort of you get like you
scrape all the bits of your application
out of your own infrastructure
you put it in like a bucket and then you
go over to the cloud provider and you
sort of pour it into the cloud system
it's not quite right is it it's there's
things that don't quite work as well and
it probably cost you more
most lifts and shifts end up with higher
operating costs than leaving things
where they are but sometimes it's still
beneficial I mean let's be really honest
some people get a lot of value out of a
cloud lift and shift they're not taking
the advantage of the cloud at all but
often just being able to turn off or not
you know their data centers are not by
new hardware that can sometimes be
enough of an economic reason for a lift
and shift and so yes we should fight
against it because you're not really
getting the value out of it but it works
so this is where you're on the cloud but
you're fighting it it's like your
application is there it'd rather not be
there and you're doing all kinds of
things that don't work very well on the
cloud but it's there right
well then kind of start thinking about
applications that are being built in a
way where they can at least not fight
the cloud anymore you know so they're
working with not against they're not
taking full advantage right this is sort
of and then we've got the cloud native
stuff which is an applications that are
built for the cloud and only a cloud
provider where the the nature of the
application means that you really do
need a cloud platform for it to run it
could be yours it's more likely going to
be somebody else's cloud platform so I
think that when we think about
traditional view of the 12th factor
application this is where they are
they're working with not against a
platform they're not necessarily
embracing fully embracing a platform
cloud native applications are going to
be making use of things like service
technology I don't you know I'm making
use of these sort of much more
dynamically highly abstracted services
so as a definition this is this idea of
embracing the platform to be cloud
native really living in the space you
are in is sort of key to this you know
so I sort of talked about cloud native
application as being an application it's
built to take full advantage of the
online platform you're optimizing for
use for the specific platform in mind
and that's the key thing you're
designing it and building it and
evolving it with a specific platform in
mind and you know you're being very wary
about about your abstractions let's come
back some other our characteristics that
I think come out of the cloud native
application a cloud native computing
foundation but
talking more detail about some of the
characteristics of a cloud native
application okay so built to scale so
you're building an application in order
that it could be scaled more easily
again a microsomes approach can help but
again I think premature decomposition
into market services can be a very
expensive undertaking so again as you're
starting off stick with them on list at
the beginning still buy my book right
definitely still buy my book like a 5 or
6 copies is fine write one for each
member of your family is alright but
start with a monolith but it be thinking
about how could we scale the application
and things like that and again fault
tolerance fault tolerance is where you
start looking maybe more towards a micro
service architecture because by you you
can if you break apart your
functionality into different services or
different components those components
give you a degree of redundancy
resiliency new allow for partial failure
which is a very good way of maintaining
with an insular system so maybe
decomposing into services to achieve
those goals we're pushing the work into
the platform and really really key is
this thing is fully fully fully fully
fully fully automated and automated you
know it was really interesting I tweeted
about how much of a train wreck the
lifecycle was of managing an AWS
function and then someone said no it's
really really easy and then they sent me
a tweet which was about 20 tweets of
screenshots of how you click the buttons
on the GUI to make a lambda function and
it's like no that's you said it's at one
of those times where I didn't even have
enough strength to explain why the
premise of the answer was wrong ignored
it but this is thing fully automated and
automatable right your everything is
scripted and reproducible as well we
should talk a little bit about platforms
here you know I said embracing the
platform doesn't necessarily mean
embracing that a single provider it
means buying into a platform and
typically when we talk about a platform
we're actually talking about really is
buying into a certain abstraction and
probably an opinionated abstraction and
normally it's not your opinions and
that's the problem right so you're
buying into somebody else's view of how
we should build and manage our
applications and you hope it's an
abstraction
that sort of stacks up with how you
think about the world and we were
actually getting better at this by the
way you know I think the slur you know I
think function as a service it's a
really good conceptually even if the
implementation isn't always great I
think conceptually is an excellent
abstraction that is to developer
friendly so let's take a look at
different layers of abstractions that
we've seen in the cloud world we you
know we started off here right we
started off down infrastructure as a
service this is really an ops level of
abstraction I have abstracted away the
detail of how a machine gets somewhere
but your provisioning you know the big
three your provisioning storage compute
and networking abstractions at this
level it's a low-level abstraction and
you can absolutely use this to build
really effective cloud based
applications but it's more work because
you're having to deal affected with the
lower-level building blocks increasingly
so well over the last two or three years
we started seeing the emergence of what
we can kind of consider as container
orchestration as a service so platforms
that allow you to deploy and manage
containers over those multiple machines
so someone gives me something like a
kubernetes cluster or Amazon ECS and I
can take my container and I say like I
want 25 of these can you work out where
they should go so a high-level
abstraction I'm further away from the
detail I'm still talking in terms of
scaling a container or a pod on in
kubernetes land and then you know the
higher level above that we've got
platforms of service-type abstractions
this is where your Roku's kind of Heroku
is you could argue blurts it up here
you're thinking of the cloud foundries
and stuff like this this is also very
much where you know there's some of the
service offerings live right we think
about function as a service and back-end
as a service these are sort of primitive
building blocks in the context of
platforms of service a higher level
abstraction and kubernetes is sort of
wandering around in the middle at the
moment probably working its way upstream
as it as it absorbs more and more smarts
and intelligence if you're interested in
kubernetes she's going to see Ben halls
talk which may have been yesterday I
don't know no it's today or tomorrow but
go Ben's doing a talk actually all about
using kubernetes on Windows you should
difficut
check that out now some people rail
against abstractions I'm sure some of
you have read Joel Spolsky post for many
years ago called the law of leaky
abstractions he signs off this whole
blog post by saying the abstractions are
dragging us down and what he's really
against here is the fact that some
abstractions are leaky there's the some
instructors say yes you don't have to
worry about any of the detail underneath
until you have to worry about all the
detail underneath and then what happens
is people have to change the abstraction
to open up the power to configure the
things underneath because you need to
get hold of them and then suddenly you
need to know not only the abstraction
layer you're dealing with but also the
thing underneath I spent many I've spent
about a year working with some
technology called GWT Google web toolkit
which was often called wit which the
sort of running joke in the team I was
working at the time was I've got Virg
wits because it wasn't very nice it was
basically a an attempt to abstract away
the web and allow developers to create
graphical interfaces using Java without
even having to know anything about how
the web works turns out if you're
delivering a web application knowing a
little bit about how the internet works
might be useful and so there are very
few of those applications left any of
you use Google Wave you've got a sense
of the kind of user interfaces that go
it could deliver the experience of
creating those applications was not much
fun at all and not all abstractions are
great but I actually think the function
as a service say is actually I think a
really good abstraction the key thing
here is that those platforms don't give
you a lot of power then here's the other
thing right abstractions are often only
leaky when we want to really configure
them I think the better abstractions are
opinionated there are things they don't
let you do they don't let you do certain
things and that is hidden from you and
that makes the platt for the babes
tractions nicer for you if they fit your
mental model but the more we want those
abstractions to be able to give us the
more power the more we open them up and
the more they become problematic and the
reality is look as developers this is
what we do
okay Brian Merrick once said you know
developers turned caffeine into
abstractions which is you know quote
demonstrator and coffee caffeine into
code but it is true that we like
reading instructions we like making
things easier to use the difference with
the cloud native application is you have
to buy into a different person's opinion
it might match yours it might not but
but abstractions are valuable they are
useful they are powerful
no one codes in machine code anymore
here do they probably I suspect there's
O's one or two of you might like maybe a
couple of you use assembly but no
because we know that yes well that gives
us a lot of power we're closer to the
underlying hardware we can theoretically
use that to get to optimize write
specific use cases in reality most of us
are a much higher level of abstraction
because that's actually a much more
productive place for us to be and yes it
restricts us from being able to do
certain things but that's okay that's
the trade-off we make we are also
getting ourselves into a bit of a mess
now especially when we start running
more complex systems and thinking about
all of these different abstractions in
terms of how our systems are built right
you know I've got my underlying hardware
and on top of that I've got my operating
system and yet ok we're on board so far
and then I'm gonna put a hypervisor on
that so I can virtualize my stuff and so
now I've got my virtual machines and
they're running their own operating
systems and now I'm gonna run docker
inside my virtual machine layer as well
because that's so I want containers why
would I want virtual machines and now
I've got my container operating system
in top of that and now I've got my
application sitting on top and it's like
this sort of being crushed by the weight
of abstraction to a certain extent and
as I made the point recently you know by
the way you did your patching all this
stuff right
you're definitely patching all of this
because it look I used to not talk about
needing to patch my CPU turns out that
is a thing we might want to be able to
do in the future right so now I've got a
patch everywhere as well but again we
don't actually worry about that too much
and again this is the whole thing you're
not just buying into somebody else's
abstraction with a cloud native
application or cloud native strategy
you're also offloading work you're
letting somebody else deal with this you
know typically this is what we're doing
we're saying look I know conceptually
this stuff exists but I've built stacks
like this inside organizations right
they were paying to run they could be
very powerful for the people that live
at the top of the platform it's not much
fun if you're down the bottom
now we don't do it we just say this is
yours again you know we're having to
offload that work but we have to trust
the partners we work with as well we're
sort of an interesting world you know
coming back to that the stuff that the
pivotal talked about you know they said
they see cloud native is also being
partly about DevOps and partly about
about continuous delivery we've always
seen that you know containers and micro
services might have a plateau part to
play so in many ways I sort of see the
the idea of a cloud native application
as being the coming together a whole lot
of different ideas we've actually lived
in the last 20 years or so and I t's
been quite an interesting time you know
we've had the emergence of agile
development and lean development people
some of you here have read the agile
manifesto right we sort of shifted how
we think about building software when I
first was professionally writing code
from money you know we'd be talking
about things like the rational unified
process and different sort of forms of
codified waterfall development and you
saw things like dsdm and thought there
might be something better out there and
now we we don't we don't think about
waterfall development you know we think
instead about you know smaller iterative
based development embracing those ideas
you know coming out of that mindset
about you know increasing our feedback
cycles was also you know the DevOps
movement and DevOps being a cultural
movement not a technology movement a
cultural movement that said maybe we
should talk to people that don't do the
same job as us maybe rather than bring
you know as a developer working for six
months on my application and then sort
of dropping it presenting it to the ops
team is saying I made this for you like
your cat when it brings in a dead dead
rat or something as a present to just
leave it on your desk we thought well
actually if we want to go faster maybe
we should be talking to each other and
having this thing that some people here
called empathy am I saying that empathy
right for our for our common co-workers
yet continuous delivery came directly
out of agile it's actually you know if
you look on the agile manifesto the 12
principles at the back continuous
delivery of functionality is there early
on around agile of course we weren't
doing continuous delivery you know how
many people here were delivering
software once a month or more more
quickly how many people here at living
once a week hairy people doing more than
one
release a day right okay how many people
here were delivering once a year only
once a year just the one person so if
I'd asked it the same question ten years
ago that would have been completely
inverted you know when I first started
where I used to work at ThoughtWorks or
say for quite a while but I first done
it thought was about 2004 the research I
thought that point said that the average
took deployment time of the large
corporates we were working with was they
were deploy software and their systems
would be every 18 months to two years
and the average tenure of their
employees was less time than the average
release cycle that meant there have been
some developers that had moved from
company to company that never actually
shipped any software now that's changed
right at mindsets change you know all of
us have applications on our phone that
get released multiple times per day the
expectations of what we have as a
customer has shifted because the things
that we use in our day-to-day lives have
changed we get lots of features shipped
to us quickly right now we expect that
of our corporate software so this is why
this shift right continuous delivery was
all about making that stuff a reality
and of course these things reinforced
each other the DevOps movement and the
continuous delivery movement you know
work together they're different things
but they're also overlapping in their
mindset and they couldn't either them
would have existed without agile
beforehand if we look at what AWS was
about the Amazon Web Services stuff when
it came out that was a product a
commercial product but that was inspired
by their own internal requirements to
enable continuous delivery endeavor
sinking
Amazon wanted to have small autonomous
teams that were able to own and operate
their software to be able to ship
software more quickly they wanted high
degrees of autonomy they couldn't
achieve that though when they were
spending all of their time having to go
and provision things manually themselves
raised tickets rack up kit connect
cables so they had to create tools
internally to allow them to
automatically provision the
infrastructure they needed this is what
you know when we start thinking about
cloud and IAS it came out of these
worlds the desire to ship software more
quickly and the idea that actually we
can bring together development
operations roles microservices is an
architecture that wouldn't exist without
all of these things as well Micro
Services is a form of SOA an SOA is just
a type of distributed system so from
that point of view the fundamentals
really changed that much but the way in
which we approach a micro service
application develop deliveries is is
very much informed by these ideas micro
services are an opinionated form of
software our service-oriented
architecture the optimize optimizes for
autonomy and optimizes for independent
employability of services it's very hard
to pull those things off without cloud
continuous delivery and DevOps you don't
have to use cloud to do micro services
bit definitely helps you absolutely need
to think about the cultural side of
DevOps and the and the mechanisms and
practice around continuous delivery to
do micro us as well and so of all these
things again are coming together to give
us the ability now to create our cloud
native applications it's all these
things these ideas these themes these
tools these these learnings of the last
20 years we have created better
abstractions to allow us to do more and
more things and we're bringing all these
tools and practices together so it's
been a kind of a fun 20 years roll
forward we've now got people like the
cloud native computing foundation which
are trying to make these things easier
for us to build the inspiration partly
behind the cloud native computing
foundation although those who have
initially just seen as being the front
for kubernetes in reality it's more
complex than that it's an attempt to say
look this is the promised land is that
we should be able to build offload a
whole load of our concerns buy into
these other people's abstractions focus
on what makes us special get software
delivered more quickly make our
customers happy but there's a
recognition that there's still the
process of putting together lots of bits
to make your application work and that
was quite painful right you're still
putting together lots of different
abstractions don't always work together
the cloud native computing foundation is
attempting to actually bring together a
whole other projects that work really
well together
the idea being these things should fit
together there's a whole lot of projects
underneath it the goal isn't actually to
have only one solution for every space
they have lots of different solutions
that fit under their balance they
actually effectively like they like
they're like a curation body right they
help support these projects they make
sure they work together they helped put
out training materials and things so as
loads of really interesting projects up
there and you know coming back but one
of the thing that is happening and we
talked about strap
we worried about the locking and
portability that there's there's they're
actually looking at those things as well
right but coming back to the Charter
there's some more stuff here you know
the cloud the foundation's mission is to
create and drive the adoption of a new
computing paradigm that is optimized for
modern distributed systems system
environments capable of skÃ¥ne to tens of
thousands of self-healing multi-tenant
nodes and then alarm bells start ringing
because how many people here need tens
of thousands of self-healing nodes I
didn't think so
I knows people don't write ten is fine
so you know now sometimes right you you
want to be able to scale to tens of
thousands of nodes just because it's fun
or using a conference track motors don't
have to worry about this stuff but
that's okay right
because these are platforms that will
work and will scale down well be worth
noting for example that kubernetes
doesn't actually scale to tens of
thousands of nodes it's not capable of
doing that at the moment might be in the
future
so okay we're talking about now
standards emerging in this space which
is actually helping interoperability
this is this is also useful for us as
people building applications more
abstractions that we can buy into now in
the past I've been deeply skeptical
about bodies coming up with standards as
you know I lived through the first wave
of service oriented architecture
implementations in industry where you
know we had things like Oasis doing a
lot of great work in terms of chemical
specifications but we ended up with the
ws Deathstar set of standards you know
like this huge heavy weights so
protocols are theoretically were going
to make our lives easy and it did
nothing of the sort at the moment I'm
cautiously optimistic the spans are
coming out in the cloud native space
seem to be being driven by successful
projects a great example of that be
something like the open tracing API
people were using tools like Zipkin to
understand the frupa
of distributed systems and out of that
and seeing how their projects work they
came up with open tracing API there's
now making it easier to interoperate
with other tools like vendors are now
integrated with open tracing API there
even hardware vendors that are now
supporting these API standards so when
you get look your Zipkin traces you're
going to start getting data points even
from your own underlying network
hardware which
really kind of interesting stuff this is
the old part of the charters kind of
interesting platform-agnostic you know
the specifications developed will not be
platform-specific such they can be
implemented on a variety of
architectures and operating systems now
this was kind of a bit of a joke for a
while the reason was because for a very
very long time everybody was in the
cloud native computing foundation apart
from one person which was Amazon and it
was very much seen as this is all the
other parties ganging up to try and fail
the Giants in the fate shape of Amazon
so we're going to talk about being
platform agnostic because we want people
to be platform agnostic because
everybody's on Amazon and although
Microsoft is the clear number two in the
cloud provider space Amazon is out in
front by a country mine at the moment
that has now changed Amazon have
actually come on board because they've
realized if they can make it really easy
for you to run you know solutions
locally as well that make more money and
you know one of the big drivers behind
this idea of platform agnosticism is
being kubernetes now kubernetes as a
platform if you build your application
to work on a kubernetes platform it is
portable across providers so now we're
starting to see those abstractions that
might be closer to utility all of the
main cloud providers have a kubernetes
offering you can get people that are run
kubernetes clusters for you in you know
on your own provider that you can run
the own kubernetes cluster inside your
own organization and you can build
applications that are portable across
those abstractions that again is that's
kind of useful right now with my CTO hat
on I'm thinking well maybe I target that
unit of abstraction and yes maybe I'm
using Amazon's
service for today but I feel that we
could actually move it somewhere else
again we just sometimes the abstraction
game is just about spending a bit more
time and a bit more care and thinking
about things and trying a few different
things out and every now and then we get
it right and kubernetes might be the
best we've done so far in terms of
finding a developer friendly abstraction
for building more complex software
I think functions as a service is still
a great abstraction for simpler types of
workloads so is it for you or is it for
me
I want to be cloud native I think it's
maybe right I think the first thing
you've got to get your head around is
you've kind of gonna have to buy in to
another cloud another vendor you
probably don't want to try and build
your own platform internally to deliver
cloud native stuff unless you're an
organization of sufficient size there's
some organizations theme it's
financially viable to run a your own
internal cloud found you set up for
example those things could be quite
expensive undertakings if you're a
smaller development team you're going to
have to buy into another platform you
would have to buy into a vendor and
you're probably going to have to accept
that to really get the value out of this
I am actually going to buy into this

great meetup that means that my friend
Cheryl runs and they also have like
loads of interesting people vendors
