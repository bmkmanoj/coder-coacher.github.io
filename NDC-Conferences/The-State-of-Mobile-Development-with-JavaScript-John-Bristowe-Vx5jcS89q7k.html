coming I hope you're all enjoying NDC I
know it's day two I know I'm probably
between you and the commute home so I
really appreciate you coming and hearing
more about the state of mobile
development with JavaScript my name is
John Bristow I work for a company called
telerik otherwise known as progress we
were recently acquired so if you weren't
aware if you were former customer or
customer of ours and then weren't aware
that we got acquired that's why it says
progress up here but we make developer
tools you Ike it's a whole bunch of
other things for developers we have over
1.6 million developers using our stuff
we hope you're a customer of ours if not
you will be soon so at least I assume in
this session i'll be covering the state
of mobile development and in particular
i'm going to focus on mobile development
with javascript you may notice that the
title of this talk doesn't specifically
call out hybrid it is something i will
be talking about but that's intentional
hybrid is just one of many ways in which
you can actually target mobile
development using javascript so if
you're a mobile developer today and
you're wondering how you can leverage
maybe javascript or vice versa if you're
a JavaScript developer you've never
touched mobled for this session will
help you understand what tools are
available what the state of the union is
right now in our industry as well as
some of the techniques and processes you
can go about doing it I am going to try
and do as many demos as I can some of
them may fail spectacularly so your your
understanding is much appreciated i'm a
bit at the whim of the internet here so
if i'm going to download NPM packages
and things like that and it goes slowly
i might just kill it so anyways we'll
try we'll see ah javascript everyone's
favorite language I assume it's really
been interesting to watch the evolution
of JavaScript I've been in this industry
for a long time I started cutting my
teeth way back when in the early 90s on
on software development and JavaScript
was one
one of those early languages that I did
way back when and it's been interesting
to watch the evolution of JavaScript
over the past number of years where it's
been sort of this toy language for kind
of adding dynamic elements to web pages
and now it's actually used for very
complex systems both on the client and
on the server side and this is obviously
best example by where we've come from
and where we are now there's all just a
lot of complexity inherent in JavaScript
today and I don't think that's really a
fall to the language the language itself
is evolving quite nicely I think if you
look at es6 and beyond i think what's
really been problematic in this space is
just the amount of churn and the amount
of adoption the amount of frameworks and
the amount of basically open
contributions that have been going on
but the reality is doing mobile
development with javascript is a bit
tedious it can be a bit problematic
there's a lot of problems inherent with
this if you've ever watched this this
movie this is Christmas vacations is one
of my favorite scenes and this is where
cousin Eddie basically walks up to the
mobile and trashes in one go if you've
done any mobile development with native
you know you can shoot yourself in the
foot definitely but with JavaScript it's
especially awesome how well you can
actually trash your own app space and
crash spectacularly but that being said
I mean it's not just mobile app dev with
JavaScript for hybrid and and other
sorts of domains we've also have sort of
competing spaces for this html5 in
particular a lot of people have been
talking about html5 for a long time and
basically what's available there you may
have heard of this term called
progressive web apps which is being
pushed heavily by Google the latest I oh
they talked a lot about this and really
it's it's a culmination of things that
have been going on in the browser where
we actually have access to things like
file i/o and other things that have been
basically closed off to us in the web
space it's getting a lot better but the
reality is it's still a bit of a
challenge when we talk about mobile app
development it's also a challenge in
terms of getting an app that is actually
working well and addresses the need of
the customer and
so when you target this using native
technologies like you know uwp or
objective c or java for each of the
platforms you wish to target ie Windows
Phone iOS or Android it has a lot of
twists and turns it can be very complex
to build something native and there's a
lot of maintenance that goes into that
if you are using a framework like
PhoneGap cordova does give you sort of a
clear path towards one direction but the
end result of it may not be as beautiful
as as perform as you may have liked so
there are some sort of competing
concerns here when looking at this space
so truth be told there's a lot of stuff
involved in this and there's a lot of
things that you need to look at so I
understand if you're confused or
frustrated I've been there for a long
time and in fact we build tools to help
ease your pain but the reality is if
you're going to target this space
there's a lot of tools to install
there's a lot of frameworks that are out
there and so this is just a subset of
some of them that you'll have to use now
just so you're aware I have all these
installed but there's more than just
this this is just sort of some of the
ones that you may have heard of there
are many many other frameworks that you
can also integrate with this and yeah
just just one of those things I guess
you'll have to to explore so if you're
going to tackle this space make sure you
have a large hard drive and a lot of DMS
that tends to be important but look at
this space it's not too bad so what are
we talking about here when we talk about
mole development well in terms of native
obviously this is where you're
addressing each platform with the
runtime the SDK and the languages that
are basically pushed by each one of the
broad offenders so in the case of Apple
and iOS that's Swift or objective c in
the case of android and google that's
java and in case of microsoft with
windows phone etc that's net now when we
talk about targeting mobile development
using javascript we actually have this
nice sir scenario where we can cross cut
every platform with this sort of
universal language and really the the
design decision comes down to what
platform do you want to target right it
doesn't actually matter this sort of
debate
do we have to target Android or iOS kind
of goes away so to kind of lay the land
of what this looks like from a high
level perspective I'd like to go over
some of your options so at the bottom we
have really this spectrum of what we can
do traditionally and I say traditionally
up until relatively recently like in the
last few years you've had native on one
side where you have the native
technologies pushed through scks on the
other side you have web which is very
broad but in some cases hindered by
restrictions of the browser and
somewhere in the middle you have this
large gap in between called hybrid
hybrid is where you typically see a lot
of frameworks like PhoneGap cordova
operate in each one of those you have
app stores and in case of the web you
have the world's largest app store which
is basically a URL so that is the world
largest app store in a sense and you're
putting all of these of course are the
operating systems and then on top of
each platform of course you have
different runtime characteristics
various sort of SDKs things that you
need to target and then you have
applications which are your packages
that encompass the various assets that
comprise your application so the gate is
some native it's relatively simple in
the case of hybrid it gets a little bit
more complex because now what we're
talking about is a sort of native
container that encompasses your web view
so hybrid applications are typically
ones that incorporate a webview
somewhere in the app in most case it's
going to be a full screen webview so if
you're not aware you know apps like the
NDC Sydney app and others that you may
have used there are many that
incorporate hybrid will use this model
where you have a webview at full screen
and then you have various assets running
inside of that context now the way that
this operates is that you'll have a set
of what are called plugins that interact
with the operating system in the case of
Cordova they come with a number of them
built into the the SDK itself you can
create your own as well so these allow
you to interface with the underlying
operating system in a native way in the
case of web this is where html5 operates
and we actually have a lot of power and
flexibility here there's more and more
AP is available on the html5 side then
people realize
so things like file i/o is possible but
again it comes down to browser support
so one of the things that comes up often
is you know what about this divide
between native and hybrid is there a gap
there that can be serviced by a solution
it turns out there is and this is
something that I'll talk about later on
in the second half of this presentation
which we're coloring hybrid native
hybrid basically so the idea is we want
to get the benefits of web-based sort of
development but leverage the native
api's without all of the sort of
nastiness that goes along with using
plugins so how does this one work and
and how does that also address other
aspects like progressive web well in
both cases it's a similar sort of model
you have an operating system you have
app stores and you have ways of
addressing them in the case of native
hybrid you have various frameworks react
natives one native screw which is what
we build is another and in that case
instead of servicing web views we
actually have JavaScript running within
the VMS that are hosted on each platform
so in the case of iOS Android and
Windows Phone potentially you have each
of the the JavaScript VMs that are
processing your code and in that case
there's no webview so the idea here is
we want to invoke native api's directly
through a bridge and that way we get
native performance you get less janky
apps and it turns out to be really nice
in the case of progressive web this is
highly very slanted towards Google and
Android the idea here is that you'll
have still running within the browser
your application but there's these
concepts like push notifications and
service workers that that go along for
the ride but you can get almost to a
near native experience with that as well
in the case of this scenario on on the
right with with yellow you have probably
the most reach progressive web is a
little bit debatable but this is where
you have not as much sort of proprietary
things going on the case of blue this is
where things get more interesting so
there's a lot of things that are better
going on there so this is the lay the
fifty thousand foot view of the lay of
the land where things sit today
of building apps for mobile platforms
now if you want to read more about
progressive web and what Google is doing
there there's a website you can go check
out it's up on the developers website
for google they talk very extensively
about this there was a lot of news and
and interest about this at Google i/o
they recently have the summit for
progressive webs web apps as well so you
have a lot of choice there but if you're
kind of more interested of like finding
out what you can do and what frameworks
are available and what platforms you can
target there is this website as well
which is the mobile frameworks
comparison chart in fact let me just go
ahead and show you that now this one's
actually a quite a useful resource so
here you can go and answer a series of
questions that will allow you to
basically say well I want to target
various platforms and will filter down
the list of options you have available
to you now a large chunk of these
frameworks that are listed here are you
I frameworks so things like kendo UI
which we build others as well you can
also specify things like targets whether
or not you want to create a native app
for example and other things like that
so this will give you a breakdown of
what's available there so if I wanted to
I could take a look at say building a
hybrid app and I could take a look at my
options that are available to me there
so lots of options and if I wanted to I
could drill down into one of these like
xamarin and see what's available to me
there so this is a website you can go
check out if you want to do a cross
comparison of of things that are
available so let's address the first
topic which is hybrid so in this
instance we're basically trying to build
an application that utilizes a webview
so the nice thing about this scenario is
you can target both iOS and Android on a
PC or a Mac it really doesn't matter you
have developer environments that are
both supported and also in addition to
that you can target pretty much any ID
you you wish to do so whether it's
sublime text Adam visual studio visuals
for your code etc and the the idea here
and the nice the nice thing about this
is that because we're you're leveraging
a webview you can make updates and see
them in line within the app itself it's
a very seamless very productive
development environment and obviously
the canonical sort of target framework
for this is Cordova
so Apache Cordova otherwise known as
phonegap there was a name change for
various reasons this is basically the
framer can print which you can actually
create these applications so let's go
ahead and just create an application
that does just that so I'm going to jump
back over here and I'm going to jump
into some demos now so let's go ahead
and create an application so I've
downloaded the the Cordova CLI the way
that you can can you see this in the
back by the way do you want me to pump
it up okay good so there's you can
download the CL IBM p.m. and then from
there you just simply utilize the CLI to
create an application so this is the CLI
for Cordova this is basically how you
create apps so you can go ahead and say
Cordoba create and then you can give it
basically name and as well as a reverse
you RN for the domain space so I'll go
ahead and call this one hello NDC Sydney
2016 I'll give it a domain space here
because I'm going to be targeting a
device where I need to basically have a
signature a provisioning profile and
things like that for creating an IPA
which is the app package for iOS which I
have here I'm going to utilize my domain
here and I'll go ahead and call this NDC
and then I can give it a config options
here if I wanted to as well so let's go
ahead and say NBC 2016 so it's going to
go off and create this Cordova project
as you can see I've actually done this a
number of times we've got a lot of
projects in here this is the fun part of
being involved in some of these demos so
I'll go ahead and create that and jump
into this domain or this directory and
if we go ahead and take a look at the
directory structure for this in vs code
let's take a look at what's been created
so on the left-hand side here this is
our directory structure there's a bunch
of folders here some of which you don't
really need to worry about too much
right now the one that I want to all
your attention to is this one the dub
dub dub folder inside there you'll find
the assets that comprise your
application now when you create one
using the cordova CLI you'll create a
very bare-bones application so this will
have
have a sort of look and feel that
doesn't represent much right there's not
really that much to the application
itself but there are some inherent
things involved in Cordova development
that you need to be aware of so things
like there's an a different event model
that occurs there certain security
constraints are involved how you install
plugins etc these are all important
things to note where you install
plug-ins for example will reside in this
folder here the platforms folder for
example is where you'll see their builds
be executed and create things like Xcode
projects yes you do need Xcode if you're
going to build against iOS for example
it's just a sad reality of the story so
let's take a look at how this can
actually occur so I'm going to go ahead
and execute Cordoba and then for here I
can go ahead and say build iOS but
before I do that I go ahead and add the
platform iOS and what this will do is
basically provision for me the
environment it will stub out the project
template for iOS development and once
that's done I can go ahead and target
iOS this will utilize the command-line
tooling available for xcode so here you
can see it's gone ahead and established
a bunch of config settings it's created
for me a path under platform / iOS and
low now we can go ahead and build this
so go ahead and say build iOS and
provide the verbose flag the reason
while doodads just so you can see
basically all the work that's being done
targeting are the underlying command
line tools for generating essentially an
IPA so the IPA or the the app package if
you will for iOS is generated in this
location if we go ahead back to our
platforms directory and expand iOS there
you can see all the assets that have
been generated you'll notice that things
like the dub dub dub folder still reside
in that location I can also go ahead and
then execute this against a variety of
targets so the way i can go again a list
of these targets is by saying cordova
run Wak Wak list and you'll see i see
not only my iphone which is here i have
tethered by a USB i also have a number
of iOS virtual devices as well that i
can target as well so if i want to run
this on a virtual device through the
Xcode simulator i could go ahead and do
that if i wanted
I can go now and say Cordova emulate iOS
and this is going to go ahead and launch
the the iOS simulator which is here in
the background and then deploy my IPA to
that environment um so essentially
basically showing you how that comes
about and there we go now here I
mentioned earlier there's a different
set of characteristics like it's like
web development you have angle brackets
you have JavaScript it's very similar
but there's different events that occur
so rather than on document ready you
have on device ready you also have the
notion of plugins as well which comes
into play those plugins are available up
on two websites actually there's a
number of websites there that you can
check out one of which is up on Cordova
site itself this is a site that they
have where they provide a whole bunch of
plugins that have been written so
plugins are things like you know being
able to access the camera the
accelerometer these are ones that
actually come free for the ride but
other plugins might might include things
like firebase integration or integrating
with sequel light these and other types
of plugins are available there until
recently the plugins story wasn't great
in fact if you were doing Cordova
development back in the day the Cordova
plugins story was go to this github repo
and hopefully there's a readme file for
the plugin that's been written and we
don't know the developer but it's fine
just go ahead and use it the reality is
is that a lot of those plugins would be
broken they would be old or deprecated
and so one of the things that we've done
a teller because we have this sort of
verified marketplace of Cordova plugins
which you can go check out at plugins
that telecom will show you this quickly
so if you go here you'll see we have
this marketplace of plugins for both
Cordova and native script the reason why
I mention this is because one of the
challenges of using a plug-in is not
just getting it integrated but also
finding samples right finding code
snippets and things like that so for
example the action sheet is pretty
common sort of pop up that you'll see in
native apps and so what we do here is
not only do we provide sort of
documentation for it which could be
missing we also provide code snippets
and even down here at the bottom will
provide
in shots of how to use that now to
utilize a plug-in you simply load these
in via the CLI so let's see where i am
here so i'll go ahead and add a plug-in
so the way you can do this is through
the CL is a plug-in add and then it will
add it will basically asked you for what
kind of plug-in do you wish to add so i
can say let's add the camera plugin and
when I do that it will go ahead and
download that via mpm and install it and
make it available to me and once it's
available to me I can then leverage that
through a series of API calls now to
show you this how this operates we take
a look at where is it here not you this
is when you got lots of windows open so
I'm going to do here is just navigate to
another location that I have I think
this is it yeah so this is another
project is like the Julia Child's here's
one I created earlier type scenario here
I've gone ahead and integrated the
camera plugin and if we take a look at
an example here you can see that the way
that plugins typically work is they'll
annotate the navigator object so the
navigator objects a very sort of common
object found in JavaScript development
in the traditional sense and what they
do is they supplement that object by
annotating it with additional classes so
in the case of the camera plugin there's
an object there called the camera object
that you can go ahead and interface with
and when you call an object method like
get picture it will prompt the the UI
itself to spawn the native picture
integration API on the platform you're
targeting so if we go ahead and deploy
this to my phone here let me go ahead
and bring up my phone through the magic
of QuickTime and if we go ahead and
launch this app now what we have here is
just a very simple set of inputs at the
bottom those are represented by those
those buttons that you see at the bottom
and so what I can do here is I can say
capture photo with image data and what
this will do is allow me it will
automatically integrate with sorry if no
one wants to be seen I apologize i'll
just do this sort of really cool retro
thing but it will allow me to to
basically take a photo take a photo of
my screen here
and then i can utilize that photo and
display it if I wish to a variety of
locations so I can put it on back on the
screen here I can put it I can utilize
that data as the image URL really
doesn't matter i can also select images
from a photo library for example there's
a whole bunch of things that i can do so
these are things that you can interface
with now the calls for these api's are
pretty simple via JavaScript it's not
terribly difficult to actually interface
this with the native API this is the get
picture APL you just saw when I took the
photo if I wanted to get a photo from
say a location on disk so we have these
these sort of well defined types for
things like a safe photo album or photo
library I can get those locations by
simply calling get photo which is sorry
here and so we have on this camera
object do you get picture API that
allows me to target a URI location which
is that override there so that's
basically interacting with that native
API and that's basically how Cordova
does its heavy lifting now there's a
bunch of API so you can target for this
but essentially that's been the story
for targeting hybrid development for a
very long time and in fact that's really
like the essence of targeting Cordoba
and there's a whole series of framework
so you can use as well for targeting the
front end of this which I'll talk about
a little bit later but one of them's you
can use is like one that week right
which is called kendo UI there's a whole
series of widgets that you can use for
this as well and these are natives sort
of controls that you can embed on your
on your pages that will allow you to
integrate front-end controls that look
and feel like the native components
themselves but the reality is is that
these are themed according as CSS
they're really there's nothing magical
going on here these aren't native
controls they're just made to look that
way so these are a bunch of ones that we
ship as part of Ken DUI and I'll have to
write on my you can go ahead and check
it out it's not worth kind of
through that but that's essentially how
you can go ahead and create these these
applications really simply now there's a
whole series of other tooling there's
that you can use as well so in the case
of my previous example so if I go back
to the previous example I showed you
earlier there's a tool that you can gooz
called a CD be live which gives you this
sort of sort of ability to trigger live
updates as you're interacting with the
environment itself and it will set up
this endpoint that you can go ahead and
interact with these endpoints and get
live updates occurring as you're
changing code so it'll set up a system
watcher for you to track changes and
basically utilize those changes directly
with the emulator itself so that's
something else you can use as well so in
terms of hybrid native are sorry in
terms of hybrid itself Cordova is one
example that's something that you can
target as well a very popular framework
that you may have heard of is ionic
ionic actually is a wonderful framework
if you're leveraging strictly hybrid it
with angular that's its claim to fame
which is basically we you know we we
leverage angular very well and we have a
whole series of controls you can use so
let's take a look at a demo of that as
well so I'll jump back here and let's go
ahead and create a new application so
the way that this is done is there's a
there's a CLI that you can install as
well so if you say NPM install oh I'm
sorry sorry i was in presenter mode and
doesn't always switch over thank you so
you can NP an install ionic and this
will give you the command line tools for
ionic itself so ionic has a similar sort
of development model where you can go
ahead and say ionic create etc and it
will go ahead and create for you stub
out these projects for you to use so a
quick example is I can go ahead and say
ionic start and then I can create an
application like NBC ionic is all rocks
and then it takes basically as another
parameter here which will say
kind of project do I want to create so i
can say tabs for example and this will
basically create an application that has
a series of tabs located at the bottom
of my my interface and we'll see in a
second how this operates but effectively
ionic has a series of directives that
it's off that is created that emit HTML
for basically creating these sort of
native ish looking interfaces but as you
see underneath the covers it's just HTML
running within a full screen webview so
it does use Cordova as part is so it's
initializing that as part of that
process there's a whole series of other
operations you can conduct as well
there's things like being able to do
live updates there's a whole bunch of
things as well so once that's
initialized and again we're at the whim
of the the internet here so I do
apologize but once that's all done we
can go ahead and build and then emulate
this through the the emulator so it's
gone ahead and added iOS you can go
ahead and add other projects as well if
you wish so I'll go ahead and say no and
then here I can go ahead and say build
iOS and what this will do oops I need to
navigate into and you see rocks and
they'll say build iOS and this will go
ahead and generate the IPA via Cordova
itself so build succeeded and then i can
say ionic emulate iOS so this is a
leveraging ionic for the framework
itself it's going to go ahead and
integrate with the simulator itself if
you ever get something like this command
for kind of shrinks it down so that
hopes so here's ionic and this is the
tabs template so down here at the bottom
we have the series of tabs and you have
these transitions and you notice that
these actually look and feel native like
there's subtle transitions that occur
with buttons and things like that but
this is don't fool yourself this is
actually utilizing markup CSS and
JavaScript so it's meant to look native
but in reality it's actually just a web
app so that's how it's actually designed
that way and can you I follows that same
paradigm as well so the mobile control
is we have in candy you I as well as
many other frameworks that target hybrid
do the exact same thing they theme their
UI to look and feel that way now if you
wanted to take a look you could take a
look at the code itself
not you you so ionic creates a similar
directory structure in the case of the
tabs application you saw there you can
see we have our directives here so we
have this this directive for our eye on
nav bar which is that navigation bar you
saw at the bottom and these will allow
you to basically create that look and
feel that that simulates that live of
that that native effect in iOS and
there's a whole series of controls that
you can target as well you can see that
we're targeting angular sorry about that
you can see that we're targeting angular
and we have a whole series of services
and controllers as well as that we can
leverage so that's essentially ionic and
you can go check out that on ionic as
well I am leveraging Visual Studio code
here and there are a series of tools
that you can use as part of this one
series of tools that Microsoft's working
on right now is called taco these are
tools for Apache Cordova and these will
basically be a series of tools that
integrate with tools like Visual Studio
code they provide a runtime environment
a whole bunch of things like
intellisense for AP is like the camera
plug-in as well you can find this at
tacos tools sorry taco tools so tools is
the best high level UNC that's out there
right now so if you go to taco tools
you'll see a page that looks like this
and these are the tools that integrate
with patchy Cordova you can download so
it's providing things like intellisense
and debugging support continuous
integration develop and set up things
like that these are better now than they
used to be this used to be a nightmare
getting your environment setup as as I
alluded to earlier but basically if you
go into your debug setting you can get a
whole series of configuration options so
these are setting your environments one
of which you can set here which is
Cordova this is provided by taco and
allows you to debug set trace points
breakpoints get variable values and
things like that you've used vs code you
may have seen this earlier but there's a
whole bunch of different environments
you can use for this so I won't worry
about covering that too much cool so
that's essentially hybrid that's a very
bastardized explanation of hybrid
I do apologize for kind of skimming over
it but I think everyone's heard that
story before in the remaining time that
have left I do want to target something
that is really interesting and near and
dear to my heart which is what we're
calling native hybrid and if you've
looked at things like native script or
react native that's where we're going to
be basically talking about here and this
is talking about basically utilizing the
native API system for addressing the
sort of problem spaces that we're trying
to target for mobile so to kind of
understand where we were and why we got
here you have to understand what hybrid
pretty much promised and how does that
compare to what was available on the
other side which is native so hybrid the
hybrid promise here was basically you
know it looked at the space back in the
day and they said you know it would be
nice if we could bridge the gap between
web and native and in fact if you talked
to the original maintainer of Cordova
formerly known as phonegap the the guys
who at nitobe built it they basically
their design goal was to build phonegap
so it didn't have to exist like the
design goal of that project was to force
browser vendors to get their act
together on mobile platforms so they
didn't have to exist the reality is is
that that never really came to fruition
and so they can't continue to build on
and hybrid was really this sort of dream
of bridging beth's the best of both
worlds now the reality is today is that
there's been a bit of a not a backlash
but there's been sort of like this
experience that developers have had with
hybrid which is it's not as Optimas that
would like Mark Zuckerberg famously
stated some things about hybrid you know
the worst thing you can do is a poor
developer always blames their tools
right so that's not to say that mark was
at fault of that but basically like
people are having so people were having
some issues with hybrid people today
still can you have issues with hybrid
and so one of the things that we're
trying to address in others is you know
can we still have that reality of
targeting javascript but getting the
high performance set is seen with native
there's a whole bunch of other stats
here I won't bother getting into but the
problem is is that with hybrid the
problem is the webview the webview is
really where a lot of the performance
issues are encountered that's where you
see a lot of janky pneus occur
and it's just the web views themselves
have really sucked does this mean that
went around for a while that Mobile
Safari was the new ie6 you may have read
about this online to a certain extent it
was somewhat true in some ways in other
respects it wasn't but really the mobile
web views themselves are really held us
back in terms of what we could do up
until recently Android was a complete
nightmare like the default native mobile
view outside of chrome on Android was
just terrible it was slow it didn't work
well and then the api's were there
thankfully after 23 that's got to be a
much better story but it still remains
that there's some problems with mobile
web views so now we're moving towards
this world of you know rather than going
from hybrid being a series of
compromises with plugins and things like
that in trying to bridge that gap why
don't we try and take a look at a new
approach and so what we're trying to
address is this this sort of let's get a
fast time-to-market development
experience with this awesome user
experience and bridge them together so
ultimately the design goal for doing
this is to have them share those two
qualifications so in the case of web
hybrid you have the ability of sharing
code you have massive skill reuse you
can use existing libraries on the case
of native you know with native UI
there's no web view so you don't have
that jank enos you have full 60 frames
per second you have full access the
device AP is a new platform comes out
new version of iOS or Android comes out
you don't have to wait for a plug-in to
be written you can target it immediately
those are true advantages of each
platform now one you made up heard of
which is out there called react native
and so this is basically one approach
that you can take where you're utilizing
react as the underlying framework for
this at the initial onset they had
support for iOS they've recently added
support for Android it is a little bit
clunky but it does work and it allows
you to target this so if you're if
you're a react developer and you like
that style of targeting frameworks etc
this is an approach you can definitely
take this will allow you to develop what
we call hybrid native applications the
one that we're working on of course is
native script of course I'm somewhat
biased towards our so take that take
that assertion
with a grain of salt but I want to talk
about how these two frameworks
fundamentally operate at a low level so
the way this sort of operates is at the
top level layer you have your
application code which is represented on
the bottom it really should be flipped
but basically you have your application
code and when we invoke api's we do so
via a bridge so what we're trying to
ultimately target is an idiot native API
so in the case of a UI on iOS that's
targeting UI kit right which is the UI
framework for iOS on Android Java star
name whatever framework II wish to
target on Android that's essentially
what we're trying to target and when we
do so we'll do so via JavaScript and
it's because of the evolution of
JavaScript run times on each of these
platforms that enables us to do so this
was done not available until relatively
recently that we were able to invoke
these native API s so there's things
that we need to do along the way so for
example conversing metadata across the
wire converting types from their
JavaScript to Native cousins dispatching
calls directly to the underlying system
and then getting result sets back is
really what these frameworks will do
like native script and so what we do is
we generate things like metadata for you
so you can you can basically interact
with these native api's but that nothing
nothing stops you from writing your set
your own if you wish so let me show you
an example what this looks like in code
so here's an example that's targeting
native script that leverages as some
Android SDK api's so at the top we have
this is all running in the vm itself so
we basically invoke the Android object
there on there is a text format time
method and then we can go ahead and
sterilize out a time object to the
console window itself the output for
this is is pretty easy but what we're
doing here is we're leveraging that that
time object directly in JavaScript
that's a native object to Android itself
and in fact leveraging via Genie on on
Android conversely on iOS we have a
similar type of API call that's surfaced
out through these classes so in the case
of UI kit there's a structure called
uialertview
you can set some parameters and call a
method on it for the show method and all
this is done via JavaScript
fundamentally each one of these map to
what you would normally see in the SDK
doc so if you've ever been to the SDK
docs for iOS these are automatically map
to the same sort of properties that you
would be used to so what this means is
if you're a JavaScript developer and
well actually if you're a native
developer targeting iOS you want to
utilize something like native script you
can go ahead and do so simply by
utilizing your existing skills around
this so that turns out to be really nice
because the SDK Doc's map directly to
the the methods that we provide so in
both instances both of these are running
against the bm's that are present on
each of these platforms so in the case
of Android that's b8 in the case of iOS
that's javascriptcore so allows you to
basically invoke those in addition to
that once you start targeting native you
start to understand that really there's
no compromise that needs to be made in
terms of the UI itself and in addition
that you get the added win a not only
leveraging JavaScript but having shared
code across platforms so that turns out
to be really really nice and we've done
a bunch of measurement measurements
against this we're seeing high
throughput in terms of frames per second
you can see frame rates here at that 60
frame per second sweet spot that
compared that to things other frameworks
that we've done testing with like
xamarin for example sometimes those
things can actually be not as performing
as you might like in those cases because
we're targeting naww i it really helps
but the third and probably the most
tangible benefit of this is you get huge
code reuse and skill reuse and in this
instance here this is a person in the
community his name's Nathan Walker what
he's done is he's actually utilizing
native script and angular angular 2 to
actually have the same code work not
only across iOS and Android but also for
web so he can create a web page and
because of the way that the renderer has
been drawn out by angular 2 he can
actually emit not only HTML but a
dialect that we support which is an XML
dialect in native script we'll see in a
second to output these native API s so
this is a native interface so you seeing
on the right for both Android
iOS and that is an HTML interface you
see on the Left they're targeting within
Chrome so let's take a look at what this
looks like in code I'll jump over to
demo now so if you want to install this
you can do so by NPM so let me just show
you how this works so you say npm
install and then you'll say native
script we alias this to something called
TNS or telerik native script so TNS this
gives you the usage for this and it's
similar to all the CLI tooling that
you've seen so far we do have tooling as
well that integrates with visual studio
as well as sublime text and visual
studio code and a whole bunch of other
environments there are there toolings
that that available that are also
available for other platforms as well so
i'll go ahead and say teenis create and
then this gives you another description
for how to create projects so we have a
bunch of parameters here that you can
specify so here I can I can say you know
give me one that utilized this type
script so just as a side note nav script
was implemented using typescript we're
huge fans of typescript so you can omit
a project using typescript if you wish
you can use one that utilizes an angular
template so that's using this dash
template option here if you wish so
there's a lot of options available to
you to keep this simple I'm just going
to go ahead and say TNS create and I'll
say and see say teenis and you see 2016
and then from here once I specify that
by default we we assume just JavaScript
we'll go ahead and emit a project struck
and laid down on disk and then from
there you can go ahead and start working
against this and I'll show you what this
looks like in a sec in some cases we
have to dynamically download resources
from the internet and so because we're
on a slow connection here in some cases
it can be a little bit slow so let me
jump over to a project I created earlier
so let's see what we got here CDT NS you
see 2016
are so Sid being rather so let's take a
look at what this looks like so it's a
project I created earlier it's just
targeting a NATO script so what's been
laid down on disk looks somewhat similar
to Cordova but one thing you'll one big
difference you'll notice here is that
instead of having a file here in HTML
we're utilizing an xml dialect why are
we using this well if you've done any
work with react this is very similar to
jsx the only difference here is this
lives as a standalone file we can
certainly do this with angular 2 if we
wanted to we can actually have the xml
dialect itself appear within our
component if we want to do so but in
this instance what we've done is we've
defined an xml dialect and each one of
these items that you see are like page
stack layout label button etc they all
map to their native counterparts on iOS
and Android and so in a second you'll
see how we can how we do that but in
inside of this description you'll notice
things that that make it quite nice so
we have things like event binding we
leverage the nude event binding and
property binding syntax in angular 2 if
you're utilizing angular 2 by the way
but in this instance we're just doing a
bent binding property binding to an
underlying class called an observable
which is defined in native script which
is more information that you really need
to know but it's there if you wish in
addition to that we have our JavaScript
files associated with this so in this
case we have an event model we're
leveraging the ability to access these
properties as well this is our view
model that that we're utilizing for this
and all this is just basically compacted
together to basically output a native
app so how do we do this well go ahead
and say TNS build iOS and this will
generate for us an IPA and rather than
writing running this off the command
line I'm going to show you how this
actually looks in Xcode so to show you
kind of like this how the sausage is
made once we do this you'll notice that
there's a platforms directory here and
inside here I've already created one for
Android but down here you'll notice
there's our Xcode project now one thing
that differs from react native is that
we don't we don't basically need to
utilize the Xcode environment the ID
itself to run projects but I'll go ahead
and do so anyway
so I'm going to go ahead and open
platforms and then i'll go ahead and
open TNS sydney that project there so
i'm going to fire up Xcode apologies if
you don't like Xcode I think it's okay I
like storyboards but whatever so we take
a look at the project itself here here's
our file structure you haven't seen this
before don't worry it's not too scary
but here we have our assets for our
applications so the jas file the xml
file etc we can go actually in ahead and
launch this to target the simulator that
we have a bill on our machine this is
one of the outputs that we generate but
you can certainly do this directly
through the CLI as well so what we're
going to do here in the second is we're
going to go ahead and deploy this
application via Xcode two are in our
simulator here but one of the things i
want to show you is that this is a truly
native application I'll see why in a
second so I'm going to let this launch
and you'll see the sort of default
project that we create it's nothing
special it's a very simple application
that we create sorry the scaling on this
is a little mist so very simple you know
nothing magical but the thing I wanted
to show you is if we jump over to Xcode
and we say debug and say capture the
view hierarchy this is where we take a
snapshot of what's in memory and you can
see here that actually these are native
controls this is actually a uibutton
label which is from UI kit so these are
native controls that have been omitted
to UI kit and you can see that these are
these aren't this is not a web view
these are native controls that are being
emitted now to understand how this
operates you need to understand a little
bit about how NATO script op works
itself underneath the covers but what we
effectively do is we did a jit
compilation and we convert the xml into
the native types that they represent at
runtime we do that hit once and then we
simply run at basically full speed ahead
at the native level when we run our
application in this way so this is
showing you how that operates and I can
do the same thing for Android as well so
if I wanted to run this off the CLI now
I can say TNS emulate Android and
using that same code it's going to go
ahead and generate a APK file which is
the app package for Android and go ahead
and deploy it to the Android emulator i
have installed in this machine as well
we also support genymotion if you're
into that as well but essentially what
we're doing here is we're kicking off a
great old based build and we can
integrate with things like cocoa pods on
iOS we can integrate with jar files we
can integrate with all kinds of plug-in
libraries as well if we wish but
essentially that's really what the
tooling provides the android emulator
itself is pretty slow so you have to be
kind of patient with it but the idea
here is that i can go ahead and and
leverage the same native features that
are available to me now while this is
firing up one quick thing i want well
actually that went faster than I thought
maybe this will fire up so two emulators
this is like dogs and cats living
together mass hysteria Ghostbusters type
thing right I've never had these to talk
to each other but yeah the other thing
you can do is you can deploy to a device
so you can actually you know it'll show
you a list of devices you can deploy to
if you wish and that includes end I OS
and Android and we have Y technology
called live sync which allows you to
basically do live updates to the UI as
well so I can make a change and then
through a file system washer will
trigger that change and then immediately
deploy to the device or emulator that is
connected to through live sync should
really turn off notifications there you
go so this is a native application this
is an APK file deploy to android so
great trace statements sorry Trey
statements gonna kick and can we kick
through phone trace Mason will be
admitted to the console as well and
there's a whole bunch of plugins that
you can use but one thing i want to show
you here is we take a look at our
project here you may wonder like where
where did some of those types come from
well we actually have inside of our
nodes modules pants great inside our
nodes module here we have this this
project or sorry subdirectory called
tienes core modules and this is what we
ship so similar to how cordoba ships
things like the camera the accelerometer
cat
tax plugins we have similar core modules
available in native script that you can
use as well so for things like
connectivity for things like integrating
with the debugger it should be fetch
file systematic access down here at the
bottom if you if you notice we have a
section here for you I these are all the
UI constructs that wrap our native
cousins if you will for things like HTML
view list view placeholder progress bars
etc and those will map 1212 those
entities on the native side how do you
turn off the notifications this is not
good so this is like total demo fail I
apologize do not show notifications this
is like a chrome thing I never turned
this off I apologize I'm sorry all right
if it pops up again great all right what
do I do this is great it's going to show
up this is going to show up stop all
right what do I do someone tell me I
don't know halfway down K pop ups okay
it says do not allow any site to show in
there why is it showing me notifications
stop okay just ignore what's happening
on the right okay apologist ignored I
know it's hard but so we have all these
modules here that you can use for this
I'm just gonna keep the cursor there and
I'll just click it so we have all these
things including a web view so you can
embed a web view if you wish into your
native app and will utilize uiwebview on
iOS will you there's a webview component
you can utilize on Android these are the
native constructs that are available
there that you can use for that and so
it turns out to be really nice in terms
of that and what what you can do now a
lot of these things a lot of these
things map almost one-to-one tour in
terms of what you can do on react native
it is a little bit different though so
just be aware of that there there are
some things that differ in terms of
their but the developments parents for
this is quite nice so there's lots of
things there in terms of plugins if you
go to mpm we have over 308 plugins I've
written a couple myself there's one
called native script sound that allows
you to play sounds in your app these are
this is how you utilize it so we have
TNS plugin add data script sound and
then the way that you you integrate with
this is you just say require and then
you simply call the api's that are
exposed through that so it turns out to
be pretty easy I'll show you an example
of an app that does that let me just
jump over to my phone and I'll fire up
for example something like this guy yeah
come on guys just shut up alright so
this one you may not be able to hear let
me make sure my volumes up I'm plugged
in that's why it's going to be
problematic do you guys please mute
thank you so what you're not hearing
there is these are wind chimes and
there's actually a bunch of sounds that
are being played I don't know if these
will actually broadcast through my
laptop yeah the problem is I'm plugged
in here to display it through quicktime
here so it's kind of a weird setup but
these are there's a wind chime app that
utilizes a sound player these are
playing mp3 s as part of that there's a
whole bunch of other examples you can
take a look at i'll show you another
example here this is our sort of kitchen
sink app for native script these are all
native controls here that you can use
let me go ahead and center this guy so
we have things like layouts that you can
use so we have various layouts so you
can leverage as part of this these are
all native controls but they're all
represented as XML leveraging underneath
the covers JavaScript for this you can
create some really nice designs no janky
pneus with this as well because it's
coming through a quick time it might
look a little bit janky but it's buttery
smooth on on my phone here so we have
things like charts you can use as well
with full animation 60 frames per second
for this item layouts as well
you get the idea and you can take a look
at you know the code for this as well if
you want so this is the xml file that
maps that if you've done any work with
zamel you'll feel very comfortable in
this environment that's what that was
intentional by the way and so some of
these things might be difficult to do in
a hybrid sense but in a native sense
you're still leveraging JavaScript
you're still leveraging XML it's
actually quite nice for this environment
so I have six minutes left so I will
jump back to the slides and quickly go
over a few last things and then we'll
wrap up for any questions if you guys
have so there's a whole bunch of
framework so you can use for targeting
you I there's this framework called ace
there's a whole bunch of other ones
you'll also get sucked into this debate
of you know react versus angular I
wouldn't worry too much about that just
go with what makes you happy you know if
you're leveraging existing skills I
think that's the most important part
that's the first step of course me
working for telerik in progress i would
encourage you to take a look at native
script everything is open sourced you
can go check it out up on github in
terms of UI frameworks there's just a
ton of them that you can use including
jquery dead extreme has there's there's
unsend UI framework seven a whole bunch
of them out there we have our own called
Kenny you I so just take a look at those
and consider what's available if you
want to find out more information about
these and other sorts of things you can
go check out them up on github a lot of
these things reside there so for example
if you take a look at github / native
script you'll see all the repositories
for our modules you'll see all kinds of
examples we also have some examples
there that leverage native angular as
well so if you want to go ahead and
leverage that as well you can do so we
have quick start guides we have a whole
bunch of things you can find everything
up on native script org this is the home
page it should this would hopefully be
your home page and up there we have a
resources list we have videos we have
tutorials we have quick starts all kinds
of stuff there there's even some guides
up on pluralsight so great stuff
definitely worth checking out
cool so I have five minutes left I did
want to hold some little time for
questions so are there any questions
it's a question here at the front okay I
can repeat it's fine go ahead yes yeah
so the question is in the sample I
showed there was XML that converts the
native controls what about the code
itself like the onclick and all that
sort stuff that does not get converted
it does get jit compiled but if you are
actually crack open the IPA those assets
still live within that that app package
or the apk and they're still run against
the BM that is hosted within your app so
there's the native container that's
hosting the vm the javascript p.m.
that's still running itself it's jit
compiled and once it should compile its
resident in memory and will run at the
native level for that I talked a little
bit about the bridge that we provide for
interfacing with native that's really
where a lot of that heavy lifting is
done this thing so this is running with
inside the the process space if you will
of your app on the device itself but
none of those assets change we don't
cross compile we don't transfer we don't
you know do any translation anything
like that it's those assets live just
like they reside on disk they are
resident within your app package so the
question is if I for example have an
event handler that would modify a UI
aspect like a hide operation for example
how does that work that will modify the
visual tree represent on the device
you're going on so in the case of
Android or iOS it will interface with a
native by AP is so we'll call hide via
UI kit online on iOS and then remove
that from the visual tree that's why I
showed you that that capture
hierarchy and Xcode to show you that
though that's what actually is resident
in memory when it's running and those
calls will simply interface with the
native API so if I call hide on my
JavaScript application code that will
invoke the native API to call hide on UI
kit on iOS for example and then remove
that element from the visual tree on iOS
for example there's a two questions here
it's the question is do you need to be a
member of the developer program to test
against iOS on the device if you're
going to the answer is not necessarily
it depends the reason why I say that is
because if you're going to create ipas
for cordova you need to have a
provisioning profile if you're going to
create an IPA in the case of native
scripts you can you can sign after the
fact if you will but will create one for
you and deploy it depends on how you
have your device configured as well
there's a whole bunch of different
things that get involved there so truth
be told I if I get a provisioning
profile and a certificate to work
against that's about that's the extent
of my knowledge in terms of all that
mess like it's a total mess like I've
I've spent days trying to get the right
provisioning profile down oh I forgot I
wasn't targeting the right you know
domain space for this it doesn't match
and you know if you've ever done any
that work it's just a nightmare and also
that's just on the iOS side if you want
to sign you know for for other stores
for example like Google Play it's it's a
different story altogether so that part
still exists that part is still
problematic but the CLI will help you in
every regard so most see lies for most
tooling the stuff that i show you
cordova ionic react native there's a
react native CLI native script there's
all stuff for doing signing generating
builds deploying etc so yeah
the question is have we done any
performance benchmarking against true
native ap is the answer is yes the the
team has published some some metrics
around that we have some internal
testing that we do constantly we've seen
really good performance for the basic
sort of operations you'd see like
sorting you know type operations running
the JavaScript vm themselves have gotten
so fast that you really it's really hard
to tell whether or not you've got any
performance degradation at all I mean
like they're just there optimizing so
well and they are operating when this
jit optimized I mean it's like running
native at that point so yeah I mean it's
really hard to do comparisons now
because of jit kidding but the the
benchmarks we've seen so far are
fantastic I mean in 60 frames per second
we're seeing operations like in the tens
of thousands for very simple operations
but there's there's no problem for
writings apps now that being said if
you're there are certain classes of
applications you probably should should
concern yourself with like if you're
targeting like if you're targeting
gaming unity is probably going to be a
better choice for certain classes of
applications if your time for your C
sharp developers amarin is clearly a
good choice for targeting that i'm not
i'm not advocating that you change you
switch gears entirely and stop doing
c-sharp development do what makes you
happy but if you're going to target
JavaScript and you want leverage like
node modules that are available as well
as you know JavaScript itself or type
script or angular etc and you want to
have that code be portable to the web
potentially which we have examples that
show just that then that's a good that's
a good choice for that gaming is that in
and of itself its own class of has its
own problems there's a whole bunch of
other problems that get involved with
that like audio playback for example the
audio plug in I road is very basic like
it just does a simple playback when you
you start interacting with it in a very
high performance it struggles I'll be
completely honest I didn't write the
thing very well so but yeah I mean if
you're writing line of business are you
writing sort of like vanity apps or
reasonably complex apps it's it's super
productive it's really good for that
sort of class yep so the observation is
by this gentleman said like I'm thinking
of writing applications that you lie
sensors real-time information that's
coming back from the device yeah i mean
like that's that's totally fine the
latency on this is a not not like it's
not bad like I'm not I became that's bad
but it's going to be it's not as it's
not one to one with native but it's
pretty damn close like it's really much
closer than with hybrid for example and
you have the added benefit if you want
to write a module you can do so via
JavaScript you don't have to that's a
big difference between plugins on
Cordova and modules that you write in
native script for example you write your
native scripts sorry you write your name
script modules that interface with
native API is through JavaScript or type
script you don't have to resolve you
don't have to write objective-c or Swift
or.net or java for plugins you write in
javascript the whole time and so if
there's a native API you wish to target
you can go ahead and do so and so there
might be like high resolution timers you
wish to interface with we have one
that's integrated with that through our
trace module and they're they're super
fast I mean they trace down right to the
nanosecond almost you know so really
really good and so the accelerometer
works really well the they get 60 frames
per second on the interface I'm over
time thanks a lot guys if you have any
other questions stick around thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
