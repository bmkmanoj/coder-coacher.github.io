honored that you guys came in because I
thought it's nobody comes in either to
go and see 300 reservation myself but
thank you very much for coming so my
name is galia warrior and today we're
going to talk a little bit about
chatbots and we're going to discuss what
is this whole hype about it what is the
challenges and opportunities right now
in this space so among what's at eight
of you how many of you actually did talk
to a but talked about yeah ok kool did
you develop anything for the boat Aaron
I know you mentioned you did you tried
okay right okay that's good so hopefully
I'll show you what you can do and how
you can go about that so first of all so
what our chat BOTS it's something which
is a user's conversation as an interface
and they usually function on the top of
messaging platforms the lots of name
they were known for a while under lots
of names so at the moment chatbots is
the sort of standard in the industry but
again with my change in five years time
who knows we used to be chatterbox talk
about artificial conversational Intel
entities even which is impossible to
pronounce but main thing about the chat
BOTS they are perceived to be
intelligent whether it's based on some
rules us developers provide and you know
rube as agents or it might be some
artificial intelligence back and then
ivan as you can see Dilbert already
nailed it on that that if I look at the
history very briefly for 1950s this is
why it's all starts with Alan Turing's
papers you know Computing Machinery and
intelligence so the Turing test there
the whole question of can machine think
and actually this is very soul started
so chat BOTS is nothing new really it's
all back then in 50s the first major
rise of chat BOTS was in 60s and 70s
with the maybe so-called classic boats
now and it was obviously done mostly in
research institute MIT stanford etc so
the two main examples you may have heard
of
it's eliza doctor which was a scripted
conversation from the point of view of a
psychotherapist so you can actually have
a conversation as if you're talking to a
psychotherapist and he would actually
reply to you with using those early
language natural language processing
tools back then and it was at that point
it was really really exciting and very
cool the way it was replying it always
almost like a human on supply and then
in 72 Stanford University so they did
they were joking a little bit but they
created another person Harry it was a
simulation of a person with the paranoid
schizophrenia and again you could talk
to this person so he would emulate the
behavior of you know of person with his
mental illness and you might want to ask
you they actually meet and they met
quite a few times some conferences back
then and i think it was 1972 one of the
best ones when they actually talked over
there upper net and the you know they
had a proper conversation between
themselves so this was back in 60 70 s
then fast forward 15 years 20 years so
1990s we got the general boss which we
you know we all knew those sort of
mainstream boards the customer services
you know that IKEA bought you know that
anna service was very very simple and
reply but it was still you know useful
then there'd be you know call centers
romance ups interesting enough dating
apps application at that point whatever
they were conversational toys which i
was surprised but again there was a some
early natural language processing
backends there and also that the Turing
test which was based on that Turing's
paper so it was a actually lovely price
has been established to give money to to
an application to chat bots which could
actually trick the human into you know
believing it's human so till now it
still hasn't been reached out so you
know that that master on hasn't been
reached but it's been held every year so
far and then another type of votes which
became popular that point
some of the malicious boats on the
instant messaging the fun fact I found
out I didn't know that what Wikipedia
penta runs about two thousand volts to
actually maintain the state of the you
know the Wikipedia which is having
pretty cool and it's been again didn't
been there for a while it's nothing new
and then you know last year 2016 still
very fresh we came to the point where
you know there was an explosion so such
an Adela you know says what are the new
apps mar 2016 facebook religious a boat
frame worker at the same time or setting
it was in march you know they have a
boat engine hosted by the artificial
intelligence company called wit da TI
microsoft releases their now famous
stabled and takes it back very quickly
takes it off and then launches of the
cognitive services i don't know some of
you have been today Jennifer stock so
she was talking about community services
then oracle was there in September
google was there in may you know
everybody pretty much was suddenly
emerging in that space and you know you
know I Riley is one of them you know
famous conference providers conference
organizers so they actually held the
birthday in October last year on the
topic of votes which I guess again gives
that validation is actually very
important in business to right now the
reason why it is important then why it
became so important now is that there's
some research has been done recently
apparently eighty-five percent of
customers time on smart phone is
actually spent within the five apps and
those file that might be different
between you and me but essentially they
would be within the category of
messaging social networking games so
that's that's why we spend most our time
apparently on the smartphone so these
days and people like to chat you know we
all use our devices for that again some
certificates for your you know for your
knowledge thirty two percent of global
population is now social media the
growth of the number of mobile messages
sent between 2012 and in 2012 it was
around 15 trillion messages in next I
mean this year John 17 it's about 30
trillion messages so it's exploding
again
and most of those messages done through
the you know messaging platform or
applications and so all other factors in
which I important is that users you know
we all tired of the searching of this
new yet new application on the app store
or you know any other store and its
rebound to our 10 top 10 10 20 top 20
probably and that's it so we don't
really use anymore and this is from the
opposite side when your mobile
application developer how do you
actually make your application visible
it's really hard these days out and the
last and i think is also very very
important point why boats are so
prominent now is those advanced natural
language processing tools as well as
other capabilities on the AI space but
the NLP is one of the most important for
boats so they are now available in a
very easy way to develop for developers
to use in their applications and again
if you seen jens talk on cognitive so so
you're going to watch it later online
take a look because she actually shows
the the microsoft toolkit on that and
how easy you could actually bring it
together with your applications and
they're important bit why is it you know
what are the opportunities for the
companies now for the businesses first
of all we are messaging apps so you know
brands want to be there they want to be
where we are so you know that's made my
main point for them then some of the
ideas around customer service has been
already bubbling out and can you make a
customer service simpler in a way that
if i come to a boat and if i come to the
service and actually a very simple
question coming from my faq they are
really need a human to respond to that
or can it be automated however if there
is some requests which might be much
more complicated in to be dealt by human
then you might want to reroute to you
know to human and to make things even
better if that question is angry or you
know somebody is not very happy about
the service maybe we need to top it up
in the queue you know so that person to
get attention much quicker so now
opportunities in that space we all know
companies have a lot of internal data
source internal data systems and
internal systems and quite often they
are not the best
to use some like white clunky you know a
lots of steps to do something you're
booking your vacations might be taking
five ten steps and if there's something
quicker can be done and make you know
employees productive in the workspace
that is another opportunity and all
sorts of innovations coming out now you
know what I'm maybe there are some
examples you think of a possible in that
space around text and voice interaction
around you know using dossier it builds
how you build them up together making
better use of what you have right now
the data you have and how do you expose
it to the internally or external world
and one of the just recent reports
literally like last week it was released
so eighty percent of marketing leaders
actually want to have chat BOTS or some
way capability by 2020 which is very
soon actually so we better to look at
the space and see what we can do but
this is for the more for the businesses
and if you think from developers point
of view so what are the opportunities
for developers first of all their chat
bot application itself it's a service
you create once and you maintain that
you deploy it but it's it's a one piece
it's not a you know challenge of having
iOS device you know iOS called Android
code etc etc so it's all in one place
and then you can actually expose it to
those different channels where customers
are whether it's a facebook Messenger
whether it's flag whether it's skype and
whatever else might be so this is that
opportunity for developers also because
you just use those chat platforms
already so you don't really need to
introduce a new sort of way of dealing
with that with your application so it's
slack interfaces familiar to them skype
they know how to use this and so on and
again AP is using the NLP using search
using I don't know vision API etc so all
of those opportunities are there for
developers question is would both be
used for everything and you know such an
Adele abouts are new apps is it really
true probably not we need to be very
conscious of that because both are not
bots are good at something but they are
not particularly grated
so and we when we develop that we
develop those applications we need to we
need to keep this in mind so they are
good at something which is very
sequential for instance the number of
options and one of the examples is
there's a parking as a lawyer bot which
allows you to appeal for your parking
it's actually was quite popular in the
UK I think last year too so you can
actually got a parking ticket you can go
to that website and it will ask you a
few questions and then it will just send
an appeal to the council and you
actually might get you know the parking
ticket completely taken off you also
they are good for their sort of
simulating conversation which we already
know as a conversation you know ordering
your pizza booking an appointment you
know these sort of things again they
have very predefined we know exactly
what's the outcome it's very you know
there's a goal I need to achieve in
their steps which are known there may be
some of the long time critical queries
also could be done through boats I don't
know booking restaurant booking a movie
you know movie ticket for instance it
could be done as well that's not I want
to do it now but something like I wanted
it you know maybe on sunday i want to go
to a movie so what are the options and
you can go through those options iterate
etc to the boat however there's some
scenarios where boats will not be good
an application will probably be still a
good choice you know boogie a taxi for
four o'clock today or like in 15 minutes
it's probably better to do it right on
the you know goober or any other device
or any other application because it just
right there in knows your location set
you really don't want to have that long
conversation with each other but how you
order your taxi and maybe some of the
scenarios when the tasks are could be
complex i mean they might be singular
like gets the fastest route from A to B
but what is it fastest for you what is
it fastest for the algorithm and so on
there's so many options and scenarios
there so it might not be the best way of
you know exposing that sort of behavior
and using boats for that and in
generally you don't want to have both so
you do everything you want to have what
switch to something specific you know
which are they good at so this is just
to give you idea if you were looking at
you know it has
ideas for building your boats just focus
on one thing which it will do very well
so there are some real life example now
which are largely on productivity but
it's personal activity with its
workplace productivity traveling you
know personal systems for hotels flights
and so on personal finance actually oops
sorry beautiful I quite like this one
and I think it's available in us right
not trim but it's it's a really
interesting i did actually can you can
upload your bank statement and actually
can go to that find the recurring
payments you do and i should tell you i
think you paying netflix you know every
month and then you might think okay
maybe I'm not actually using that
service should i cancel it and it can
cancel it for you to the text so again
some something interesting to to help
you to save you some money and then
retail space is a very big player for
both because there are lots and lots of
scenarios where both could be and people
in people you know they're trying to do
some things there for instance in the UK
and all the dominoes they release they
they bought on the facebook i think and
you can order your pizza to that again
it's not nothing new i mean it's they
just doing exactly the same as they do
everywhere else you can go on the
website do the same thing but you know
this is just a bit of fun for them and a
bit of publicity but i think we will get
further maybe this year next year will
go further in what those words could do
in for the retail so how do you start
and you know what is there the easy way
maybe because like I spoke to the guys
earlier so you know if you tried
microsoft bought framework you know six
months ago it was really clunky it was
really hard to use because of bits and
pieces when admitting you know fit
together very well so you might have
tried and I was like okay this just
doesn't make sense to me so how do you
start so the first damn i want to show
you is is actually something very very
simple and the premises you can build
your bot in five minutes
also without writing any code and but
it's actually going to be useful but not
just hi hello and you know you send me
this long message so let me just get my
so the but i'm going to use i'm going to
build sorry is called well it will be
doing something around faq you know lots
of website a lot of companies have big
you know I think he was exposed and when
you search for it sometimes you can find
a quick quote you need sometimes it
takes a bit of time to actually find it
so what you're going to do is you can
create your own but it's a cold Q&amp;amp;A
maker and it's bother actually it's a
part of cognitive services provided by
Microsoft and you will expose your fa
cues literally in you know in that
service so what how you do it so you
need to go to this website called Q&amp;amp;A
maker dot AI and I need to create new
service you you put the name snappy
thank you right and then all you need to
do is you provide your faq page or you
can also you know upload a question
answer file or you can actually build it
manually essentially a knowledge base
can be both manually but let's make it
simple for now so let's go literally on
the bot frameworks faq page and let's
just say okay this is where i'm wearing
my where my faq pages and then we do
create so what it does now so it
basically goes through that content of
the page it creates those pairs and
creates that knowledge base line in so
written there so what it has if you look
at this um you've got got some bit of
crazy resolution i think okay sizable so
if you look here so they
pretty much you know these are questions
and answers they are all down there so
this is what we have exposed ever
questioned answer might be a bit too
long for you know both conversation but
again something you can edit if needed
you know trim and train and what you
could do you can go here and test your
bot now and that testing will allow
users to sort of express different
express what they are searching for in a
different way so you can train that
model and then say for instance I'm not
just let me just damage instead of
explaining it so basically what is what
framework you might have a user coming
and checking what is right both
framework right and given our knowledge
base we've just loaded so there are
actually a few options around what the
what the broad framework is and you can
choose and say okay I think this
particular piece of text is actually
would be the best answer to it right and
then also you can add alternative
questions so instead of what is broad
framework explain more question coming
but you know you can imagine different
scenarios wave like you know people put
the different different variation of the
same question really and then for
instance we can also put in sport frame
work almost envy what framework
dreamwork top spare today public clinch
available
and then again the one of their answers
from the knowledge base come directly
and actually I think it's a valid on
first so we can just say okay that's
perfect for us so when we did a bit of a
testing like that you know maybe you
just go into all the different questions
in our knowledge base you can just say
save and train right and then what we do
we do publish and that creates an end
point for your boat essentially what is
what is happening let me just click
actually publishing and then you will
see
right so we have created an endpoint
which can be used now by your
application don't have to be bored by to
be used by application and you know
that's all that's all used to be done
and then the question has to be provided
as part of the career right and then you
can edit it how you could now actually
expose it as a bot say on your website
even so you would need to go into one of
the ways to do it you can just go to
them as your I'll you know the results
look where you want to publish it so
let's just do that and then you just
create a new so you can create a new
service so what service it's a kind of
game preview but hopefully will be
released soon enough and so so how you
create it is literally you provide your
application name because this would be
your web application on a zero really
what how how do you sign so let's say
what framework right okay nobody's named
so let's put it in the north Europe and
create so they'll take few seconds to
create hopefully
so while it's creating it and then i'll
show you how you actually connect to
that end point let me just show you how
you can talk to it i did is previously
you can expose it through your you know
this is skype so we can do the usual hi
hello see this time it'll pick up right
and then we can ask the same question
you know what is both framework and then
you know it will bring you know that the
Deaf AQ so this is how can be exposed
into your skype or in your internal
communication tools whatever they are
and so let me just double check shirt
it's yeah so it succeeded so let's go
now into that taco bell see she slow
this one so when you create and as you
but you know using their past solution
platform in service you you have a
choice of different boat option so you
can create a new boat completely blank
and you know do whatever you want to do
that or you can actually create a boat
and point it to the Q&amp;amp;A service so let
me just quickly register our new boat
okay let me just copy that very
important it shown once you can't
actually get it back again so and then
fine and go back to Boyd framework okay
and then you select the language using C
sharp on OGS and then there are few
templates available to you so at the
moment what we have is questioning
ourselves and then we create what and
with this case we can just say okay I
have in my prescription I have this one
knowledgebase and I'd like to get that
up and running
and so what will happen now so it will
provision that bot and you will have now
the choices of you know communicating
through the web chat or actually expose
it through the different channels so
we'll come back to that because it takes
few minutes as i showed you that that
the Q&amp;amp;A but essentially is done in five
minutes and actually if you come back
you know next week and your boss asks
you what much have you learned you can
say okay i've learned how to make boats
and it might take me a few days to do it
but i can do one feel for the company
and you know you just use this ten
minutes but creator and use the rest of
the time to watch the rest of the
sessions so on the box the stateless
body is the one we just shown the faq
which is you know it's very simple it's
very static it's useful in its own way
but it it's not capable of learning it
doesn't really remember anything you
know you come back once again just the
same question or similar question it
just it treats you like you know you
completely independent entity the more
interesting ones are those semi stateful
both where you can actually track some
of the basic user details you might have
an option of signing into the boat and
then do something about you know then
use that information about the user you
might have an 03 eruption how which
goals they want to achieve and you can
guide those users through that
conversations you might have some
limited capability to remember just use
a session or if user speaks in a
different channels and actually you can
pick it up as well so this is where I
think a lot of useful bots will come out
you know or coming out right now and the
next one which is something where the
hype is i think is stateful but it's
those which can recall previous
conversation those which can remember
your preferences and actually you know
give you some recommendation based on
that you know have some AI capabilities
machine learning capabilities models
around there so they are really human
like you know just personal assistance
which everybody is saying that they will
replace humans
so I think we are not there yet Smosh
not working so we are not really there
yet I think or there's a very few good
examples of how it's done so we I think
went somewhere in the middle right now
and read people start is those staplers
just bought for fun the some design
patterns around what's I think I have
sort of already alluded to that so the
boats are really good at transactions
you know look up references and so on
some of the social conversations
conversations and being able to sense of
the same sentiment within that
conversation is very important there
might be example some of advisory role
for the boss if for instance you are you
know reach an expert system are you
trying to understand I don't know what
is my i'm currently on this particular
plan would say with an energy company
what would be the best options for me
given that you know how much he pay was
my expense of the you know what my usage
of the existence or and they might guide
you through the different options or you
know finance car finance loans etc so
that might be an option as well and then
information retrieval is some of the
lookups baked back backed by the data
source such as well faq board is one of
the examples I guess so building a good
chat bot actually involves a lot of
things quite often we have developer
start from that whole development bit
you know I have these bits and pieces
these are my channels where I want to
expose it to design api's I want to use
whether it's my internal systems or is
it some of the NLT Kate wills and so on
but there are lots of other things which
needs to be considered and those are you
know how do you actually design that
conversation and that it's useful to the
user that these are not getting annoyed
by that if it's repeated you know
there's a lot of things going on behind
the scenes how what makes a good bot and
I think we're still trying to figure out
especially you could see that there are
some books being released around you
know that the design of this it's like
you know UX design but it's for both now
this conversation design also how can
you apply your customers in learning
models you're very domain-specific
machine learning models deep learning
and so on where do you host your boats
and
what actually do you want to do to
disrupt the industry because you know
this is what a lot of people are you
know now spending time and money on how
do I disrupt this interest is using this
new technology and the landscape is very
wide actually right now and there are no
particular industry standards either and
you might have tried those of you who
looked at the development to you might
have tried with Microsoft services you
might have seen some of them you know
Facebook development options there are
some lots of odd lots of other platforms
which create you know allow you to
create boats like some of them at the
bottom like group group shop I thing is
called and then few others so they are
might be popular though because some of
them do not require coding so you can
actually do a bit of a drag and drop and
build your bot interface there so this
bitch is already update outdated
anything because it's September's on 16
this field moves way too fast to
actually you know to be able to track
everything manager gives you an idea of
what what are the options and messaging
platforms again quite sir I'd and the
options are lots of them so what I want
to show you a second demo is is an
example of oh let me just bring that
wait a bit so the second demo it just an
example of say you are a property you
know real estate property company in
London and you know you want to expose
your properties people want to go in
search for it in to search for rental
properties which is if you live in the
city you know it's a nightmare and say
you want to do those oops sorry
resolution is crazy okay and I don't
have anything oh my god that one being
sure once I can give me
actually a while it's loading so our
boat service has been deployed so I'll
just got that quickly on the demo number
one and and here you have a web chat
where you can actually talk to your what
the one you've created so it's already
there okay so bottom you later it's just
fits all up and running okay I'm just
about to say with Microsoft as there is
a new amazing version of the emulated by
takes a while to load sorry it's way too
good come on
this is not quite working is it so if
you haven't used it before so this is
the way to you know debug your local
boat and you can select them the place
where it states in my localhost at the
moment and so so again so that this
scenario is your real estate agency in
London so people want to use boats to
actually talk to your you know to
understand what the properties you have
and how can they rent it so you know
that the good boat design actually when
person say so but the boss says hello it
actually explain a little bit what is
what's its purpose so and you know maybe
some of the options so let's say with
help so this bolt allows you to find
some of the rented accommodation in
London using zoopla API Sandra play data
and then there are a few options so I
just want to show you that you can do a
some guided search you can do you know
just natural language queries and also
the way I built it I actually combine it
with an FAQ but around that agency so
and it can actually ask for just for the
start we can ask you know some of the
questions which are related to their
fake you so if if you move to UK from a
different country like I did before you
have all this what is a DPF what is the
tenancy agreement and all of this sort
of you know intricacies around that so
you might actually ask so what is GPS
because you see this abbreviation and
you're not sure and then the bath-bot
faq my reply okay the dps knowledge
bases this is their government standard
you know definition of the dps so if we
look at the sort of examples of guided
conversation or guided search you might
you know you can for instance a ok let
me give you a couple of options ask you
a couple of options first before I
understand what you're looking for and
say what type of property then you can
say ok I'm looking for flat
