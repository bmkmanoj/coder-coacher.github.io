is John I work for
Congress some of you may know us as
telluric and hopefully you're using our
software development tools telluric is a
company that has been building UI
control sets for dotnet and dotnet
platforms for well over a decade we have
1.9 million developers using our tool
set if you need to reach me you can find
me on twitter so check it out there
incidentally earlier today we actually
had quite a nice announcement regarding
our tool set for uwp recently we were
accepted into the dotnet foundation and
to celebrate this we've got a little
contest going on here where you can have
a chance to win one of these
cool-looking t-shirts so telluric is in
the rich tradition of doing really cool
t-shirts so feel free to check that out
up on our blogs at telecom if you
haven't used these controls they're
great they're open-source they're
available up on github I'm just about 20
or so controls you can use for uwp
development but we are not here to talk
about that we are here to talk about
native script so to kind of help you
along I'm gonna spend a little bit of
time in slides but most of the time in
demos and code so first of all what is
native script so native script is
basically a cross-platform
native ios and android app platform it's
for building those types of apps you can
use a combination of JavaScript or
typescript and angular if you wish and
by utilizing those you can actually
build native UI with all the richness
and performance that comes along with it
so really for native script itself our
intent was to build this open-source
framework that would allow you to
leverage your existing skills around web
development so you can style native
elements using a subset of CSS you can
construct your UI using an XML dialect
that we have and so if you're any
proficient in the web space you can go
ahead and use native script quite quite
nicely it's a combination of tools it's
a combination of
components and includes a whole bunch of
things as you'll see in a sec you want
to find out more you can start by
visiting native script org and we walk
you through all the steps necessary to
get everything up and running on your
machine as well as a whole bunch of
Doc's about getting started with
building apps etc there's a very large
development or community surrounding
native script at the moment a lot of
them are building plugins etc and we'll
talk about that as we go through this to
get started you'll download a CLI
typically and plug away I'll show you
how that actually works so let's jump
over to our terminal window and get
started you'll just install the native
script CLI via NPM so opening up a new
loop browser or sorry terminal you'll
just say npm install and then native
script is the CLI that we have for
building out all this stuff the CLI
itself is alias to TNS which stands for
telluric native script and it has a
bunch of commands for creating projects
for deploying to devices including
emulators for publishing to app stores
and a whole bunch of other things as
well so lots of great stuff there let's
take a look at an example of what nia
script looks like on their device so
this is a native script app that I have
on my iPhone here and it's a little
janky because of the throughput to the
display but it's smooth 60 frames per
second scrolling on the device itself so
don't interpret that little janky nasai
kipper form this is actually quite nice
so inside of jet now native script we
have a whole bunch of characteristics
and aspects for creating rich UI and
also interacting with the underlying
subsystem so we have things for things
like layout for displaying content a
variety of ways we have integrated bars
and bar charts and graphs and things
like that
with animation support we have very
scrool scrolling through list views now
on my screen it looks good but up there
looks terrible so it's actually not
dropping any frames so rest
shirred it looks really good with
including layouts as well these layouts
can be adapted using CSS so you can
certainly style them and there's a whole
bunch of conventions as well that you
can incorporate force data script itself
to target specific platforms and I'll
talk about that as we look at the code
so things like this you know you may
wonder like what's the big deal and why
is this important the reality is is that
when you're building applications for
mobile today you have a lot of choice
and some of them come with some caveats
and in this example here what we're
targeting our native UI constructs so
these are elements from UI kit that are
being targeted if I was on Android or
was running through the simulator there
I have obviously the Java classes that
are available through the SDK that I
would be targeting on the native device
that's different than what you may be
used to with other platforms that target
PhoneGap or host containers that are
chromeless browsers and the idea there
is with a hybrid environment you're
running inside a browser and there are
some limitations to that this is running
right on the metal this is JIT compiler
on script running against native objects
on the platform so I'm just gonna jump
around here just for a second so just
coming back here we've had a bit of a
long timeline with the native script
itself so we've been developing native
script for quite a while now and we're
currently just passed the adoption
ramped up and we're into global
dominance now in 2017 so that's our
intent that's part of the actual project
guidelines for that is to have world
domination across the board on that note
that I spoke earlier about hybrid there
this was you know dating back a few
years but basically the idea was that I
want to leverage web and bridge that
that gap that exists between what's
available through the browser and what's
available on the device and so with
hybrid there was this sort of reality
that came about which is with the
browsers that were coupled for hosting
your apps on mobile platforms they were
somewhat limited into
performance and so there was a series of
compromises you would ultimately have to
go through when targeting hybrid so
moving forward what you ultimately want
is the best of being able to target
web-like technologies and coupling that
with the best experience or performance
and that's really where native script
trying to tries to come into play and so
with native script what we're trying to
do is we're trying to target that fast
market leverage existing skills
experience with super fast performance
on the device itself now the way that it
does that is through a number of
different means and just to clarify some
of the capabilities here of the platform
the way we do this is sort of
complicated but it's sort of
understandable if you have any
experience with other platforms on Java
or.net in terms of platform invocation
so the idea here is that we have on the
bottom which is where our application
code resides the JavaScript or assets
running within the app package itself
which will make calls into the native
api's the underlying subsystem the way
this is done is through native script
itself which is actually responsible for
marshaling and dispatching calls and
types across the wire to the native API
so we do all the heavy lifting of making
sure that types are converted correctly
or coerced correctly we do all the
necessary metadata exchange in terms of
the API spec and dispatching and call
both into and out of the native API
itself the way this ultimately looks to
you is it's somewhat transparent but
what it allows you to do is basically
make invocations such as this so this is
an example of an application running on
Android written in native script and
utilizing the time class so here I'll
instantiate a new instance of that and
then I'll set its values using the set
method and then output that to the
console ultimately it really doesn't
matter what sort of code example you
looking at here but this is ultimately
using that that time class underneath
the covers same can be said for
something like iOS so on iOS you can go
ahead and in see 8 UI kid elements or
any other elements for that matter and
it's not just UI it can be other
subsystems of iOS
or Android itself so what we do is we
expose these types available to you
either in JavaScript or through a a type
definition file if your type if you're
targeting typescript and you can simply
just invoke the calls directly so here
we're seeing a uialertview
setting some properties and calling the
show method to display it now you may
notice that these actually map almost
one-to-one to the existing properties
within the docs or exposed on the
metadata that's intentional so if you're
coming from a platform where you're
doing a lot of objective-c and you've
been targeting iOS for a long time
native script itself will feel very
natural the same thing goes if you're an
Android developer and you've been
targeting the SDKs there and getting
used to the api's at the other day these
two code examples ultimately run on the
JVM so that are exposed on both iOS and
Android so in the case of Android we're
running on v8 in the case of iOS we're
running on JavaScript core and by
exposing that we can go ahead and make
very you know very rich applications but
still leverage the the capabilities of
the language that we wish to target ie
JavaScript or typescript it also should
be noted that we can also target angular
which is another first-class citizen for
us as well so taking a look at this a
little bit more deeply this is on a very
simple API by API basis native script
itself comes with a series of modules so
native script itself there's the runtime
there's all the stuff that happens there
but to help the development platform
along there's a series of modules that
you can take advantage of and what these
modules are are a series of basically
like plugins that you can use and simply
require in to take advantage of so if
you want to take advantage of for
example the file system there's a file
system component you can take advantage
of and there's other ones as well the
reason why this is nice is because from
your perspective ie the developer you
don't have to worry about the individual
aspects both Android or iOS you simply
utilize the module plug away and then it
will do the necessary heavy lifting for
you so in this example here we're using
the file module which simply you just
require in and then instantiate a new
file object
with a path specified underneath the
covers on Android this will invoke Java
dot IO api's and on iOS this will use an
S file manager for doing the right
things so ultimately at the end of the
day these modules are there to abstract
away the differences between platforms
so from a simplistic perspective this is
how kind of hangs together you have on
the top your application code that in
either invokes modules or will just
simply go against the individual api's
via the runtime and then those will tar
the independent platforms directly as I
said before there are conventions we
have within the application logic itself
that allow you to specify things like
hey if I'm running on iOS call this if
I'm running on Android call that we also
have file based conventions as well so
in a second you'll see this where on an
individual file by file basis you can
specify whether or not you want to
include this file on an iOS build or
include that file on an Android based
build putting this all together so we're
fans of zamel at progress because of our
rich history with building UI for WPF
etc and so we've defined an XML dialect
that you can use for those of you who
are used to react natives as sort of
akin to JSX where you can actually
specify a UI and then those will map to
individual elements that are native
constructs on the the individual
platforms so in this example I have a
page here and as you look at native
script basically pages or how we hang
screens together and that it has an
event called loaded that I can go ahead
and specify an export for and then
inside here I have a label that I'm
binding to a property which I mix
porting as well I can then underpin that
with JavaScript so here I'm going to go
ahead and define an event handler for
the load event and then on there I can
go ahead and set properties against
what's called an observable which allows
you to do T wave data binding is a
construct through the observable module
that we provide in native script and
that could also apply to collections as
well and then you set what's called the
binding context if you have any use or
exposure to environments that expose
this sort of pattern binding conferences
this thing that that exists you can
reach up and reach up to and set
properties on and if I want to go ahead
and style using CSS as well so an
example of this might be something like
to do app where you're specifying
properties in the bottom here you can
see we have a segmented bar as an
example so I'll jump over here to a
different environment and show you all
the songs together so I'm gonna jump
into my command line and we're gonna go
ahead and create a new project so I'll
say teenis create and then I can call
this NDC Sydney one what this will do is
it will specify for be a default
template and output to the file system
the the project associated with that so
if I go to NDC Sydney now there are a
variety of templates I can also use but
we'll see those in a second I get a
structure that looks like this so open
this up in code so over here on the left
you can see I have my various folders
here for my node modules platforms are
the individual platforms I'm targeting
packages on Jason obviously allows me to
specify my package parameters if we take
a look at app you'll notice here we have
pretty simple structure we have a
JavaScript set of JavaScript files an
XML file and a CSS file from my overall
app so if I take a look at example at my
app itself this is basically how life
begins within native script itself so we
create an instance of the application
object called dot start pointing it to
the main page as our starting point for
the application this is the mark-up that
was generated by the no script CLI so
you can see here on their page here we
have an action bar and that action bar
has a title as well as a class which
maps to a CSS rule and then underneath
here I can see we have the various
layouts that I showed you earlier so
inside this stack layout we have three
elements a label a button and a label
and those are styled using the CSS file
that you have here so I can define all
kinds of various rules if I wanted to on
the native elements itself I could also
Alys in a variety of different ways as
well if I wanted to I get specify things
like view models and so underpinning
that main page digest I had this view
model page that allows me to specify the
number of times I've tapped on the
screen it's pretty simple stuff so if I
want to go ahead now use this and deploy
it to an environment so I have two
environments here I've Android and I
have iOS I also have a device that's
paired here I can choose any one of
these environments and target them
independently so if I want to go ahead
and issue a build and I'll build for iOS
this will leverage the Xcode CLI that is
installed on your machine one of the
things that I'd you know wish we could
do better but it's just the reality of
the situation is that if you're gonna
target iOS you have a variety of
dependencies that you need to target on
your machine itself if you are running
on Windows or a Linux distro you will
have to utilize a cloud-based build
system so we support that through
another tool which I'll show you but
ultimately if you're wanting to build
IPA files which are those executable
files that iOS uses you would have to
use a Mac or cloud-based build
fortunately with Android you can do it
on either system so it's gone ahead and
built now if we take a look at the
structure here you'll notice that inside
my platforms folder I now have an iOS
directory and inside there I have an
Xcode project I have also a variety of
assets as well including the individual
build itself so I can go ahead and grab
those if I wanted to and look at them in
Xcode but ultimately that's what we're
doing we're generating these builds
underneath the covers if I wanted to go
now run this on the emulator and go
ahead and say teenis run iOS - -
emulator and I can also get a device
listing as well so if I go ahead and say
like say if I have a bunch of different
environments I can say TNS device list
there's a variety commands you can go
ahead and check out but you can target
individual devices including emulators
connected devices etc ghibli via their
grid and so you'll get those listed here
so you can see I have two emitters and
one device connected let me back to here
you can see my application is now
running I'm getting console output to
the screen I jump over to my simulator
here there's my application these
our native elements so that is a native
action bar there's a native element for
the labels and also for the button so if
I inspect this within Xcode for example
they would actually show up as uikit
elements you can see it has
responsiveness here targeting the view
model nothing major major going on here
nothing magical the difference is is
that in terms of how this differs from
say like PhoneGap or other environments
there's no webview here this is all
native so it's writing native on the
device it's also JIT compiled so the
performance is gonna be really good now
that's all I'm good if I want to I could
also simply switch this up I can say now
run Android simply by saying TNS run
Android - emulator and what this will do
is obviously search my list and install
this on the simulator that's here we
integrate with a variety of build
environments as well if you're using for
example cocoa pods for targeting iOS we
integrate with that we can integrate
with shared frameworks and libraries
native frameworks and libraries both on
Android and iOS as well so you don't
have to port all your existing
investment you can take your existing
libraries that you've already built for
both iOS and Android and incorporate
them as part of your build we are using
Gradle based builds for Android and this
isn't evidently you know something that
we support here I was brave enough to do
this I downloaded the the image for
Android Oh
which is the latest version of Android
Android 8 and it seems to work just fine
so it's why the benefits of being able
to utilize systems like this that just
simply dispatch the fact that you could
actually just in call new api's as
they're available and utilize them
accordingly so there's my application
they're running on Android and again the
exact same experience so pretty simple
stuff along the way there's a whole
bunch of various UI aspects you can
incorporate so if I wanted to I could go
ahead and take a look at those but we
ship a whole bunch of modules as part of
native script here so this is our API
reference you can see we have a variety
of modules that are included here for
things like file system access data etc
where you're gonna see most of people
focus their time is on the UI side so
you can see we have UI element
for a whole variety of things including
the basics like you know buttons and
date pickers and things like that and
also things like labels and layout and
all sorts of stuff so these are exposed
to you via native script but that being
said there's always gonna be something
that people want to leverage in terms of
the platform's themselves so if there's
like say for example sequel light as a
backing database you want to leverage
that you can go ahead and do that
through a plug-in so there's a variety
of plugins that are published up on NPM
currently there's 631 packages available
there for native script and if you
scroll through here some of these we've
written others have written them so
here's a plug-in for example for
firebase so if you want to integrate
with firebase as a back-end you can go
ahead and do that simply pull down the
plug-in and utilize it accordingly the
way you do this is actually pretty
simple you can simply just go up to the
CLI itself so I'll go ahead and stop
this and you say TNS plug-in add and
then the name of the actual plug-in
itself and then our CLI will go about
and pull that down install it as part of
your node modules and they make it
available to you if you wanted to there
you go so I can go ahead now and look at
the docs and say okay how do I use this
sucker alright so I go on iOS for
example and set a property key and call
firebase taught in it etc etc and that's
how it works make sense so far okay
plugins are pretty simple there's just a
ton of them out there some are for
back-end underlying plumbing stuff some
are pretty front-end forward stuff like
UI specific so here's one that allows
you to specify a toast if you want for a
feed back if you will so I've written
one here for sound so you want to
integrate with the sound aspects of both
iOS and Android it's pretty simple here
this is one that I wrote called a script
sound and simply adding the plug-in is
easy and then you just simply require it
and then create sounds and then call
play and stop etc so pretty simple stuff
all right
there are other aspects to this as well
so we have a variety of rich
capabilities built in the CLI so I can
go ahead and say for example
TNS debug iOS if I wanted to what this
allows me to do is I can go ahead and
integrate with chrome dev tools if I
wanted to so this allows me to get live
debugging we have integration also with
vs code so you can do live debugging
with breakpoints and things like that in
vs code if you want it against emulators
or devices running on your platform and
you can do a number of interesting
things here so here it's going
downloading some pods and installing
them because I had this dependency for
the firebase plugin so we use cocoapods
as well Eddy who wrote this uses cocoa
pods as the underlying plumbing for this
and then it goes through its process and
then it allows you to target it
accordingly you'll notice here that it's
actually prompting you for a variety of
settings so I'm more than one I'm a
member of more than one development team
for my apple developer so you know you
have to specify things like that you
have to do all the normal things you
normally would if you're wanting a
target iOS like for example create a
developer profile download a certificate
a provision for your device as well so a
lot of those things you still have to do
unfortunately that's just the nature of
mobile development but that works out
pretty well I find and the fact that you
can target languages you already know
and love without angular and something
like like Swift or Objective C or even
Java
it's pretty nice now you may wonder
let's just taking a while to build do
you support things like incremental
builds and things like that yes the
answer is yes and we also support sort
of like a hot reload capability through
a feature we have called live sync
so with live sync you can touch files it
will propagate changes directly to
device in line without having to re
rebuild and reissue the actual
environment so I've got this on my phone
here so you can see it's on my phone
just got my phone here I'm just tapping
on it so what I can do now is I if I
wanted to I could go ahead and debug
this using Chrome and I can go ahead and
fire up a new tab of Chrome and connect
directly to the environment here and
inspect elements and do all that great
stuff if I wanted to the reason why we
do this obviously is because it turns
out to be a pretty nice capability for
folks being able to inspect values such
as element values CSS properties etc and
then modify them to tweak them to see
how they change accordingly by default
if you don't specify that - - Chrome we
target Safari at the moment though this
is only running on Android I should have
remembered that this is coming soon for
iOS this is currently support on Android
so let me just kill this one and I'll
say Android - - chrome so this uses
WebSockets through the chrome protocol
it allows you to debug this pretty
easily so this is gonna go ahead and
issue this against my emulator here I'll
just go ahead and put this one down
while this is building I'll just show
you some examples some other examples of
things that you can do in native scripts
through my phone there we go perfect
there's always fun when you're doing a
live demo on your phone your actual
phone because I'm sure my wife will text
me at some point so we'll see what
happens there's some apps here that I
have that that showcase what what's
what's on native scopes itself there's a
variety of different things you can do
with native script as part of the
experience I've got an example here SDK
build which is nope not you are you I
thought my phone I guess I don't
no that's what yeah it's professionals
brothers yeah I don't have it on my
phone my apologies I guess we got to
build failure so I've got this build
failure here I'm not sure why I'm doing
this I'll have to take a look at that
apologies for that that's just for the
development experience a tool we just
recently added to our arsenal so you've
got all the CLI stuff that you've seen
already if you're at all interested in
building this stuff that's one great way
to go we've had that out for a while
this is another tool that we've just
recently put out there called native
script sidekick
so sidekick is sort of like the visual
studio like experience for creating out
these templates this is another
experience that we built out this all
targets the CLI under the covers but
gives you some some rich capabilities as
part of this so for example if I go
ahead and create a new application here
you can see that this stuff is exposed
via the CLI we just put a pretty
interface on it so here I can go ahead
and create a new application name and
I'll go ahead and call this NDC Sydney
too for example I'll go ahead and
specify a different app ID because I
have a different certificate and
provisioning profile for my device and
then here I can specify the project type
so here I can say I want to create this
using just plain old JavaScript or I
want to use typescript or I want to use
a combination of angular and typescript
so we support all those these are just
templates that we have built to other
box so here I can create one that's just
a blank template I can use one that has
a integrated drawer if I wanted to that
users eyes utilize the component we have
tab navigation or even a master-detail
type application so I'll go ahead and
create this one and in a second we'll
just take a look at the code that's
actually generated for this this is a
pretty simple example where under the
covers were utilizing firebase and
angular for creating this sort of
environment so this is just a listing of
cars that you might see a rental
dealership and the way it's hung
together is actually makes pretty good
sense that's
the reason why I like this you don't
have to code bases you don't have to
worry about differences in those
different environments simply just
target one your way you go so once
that's built you have this display here
which allows you to tweak various
settings if I wanted to so I can change
this description its identifier etc I
can also specify specific aspects to
each platform so for iOS or for Android
as well as Asset Management's so this is
for things like Start screens logos etc
these are bundled in as part of the
package that we generate for you so
these are some of the splash screens
that are shown when it's launched and
then any plugins that you may want to
incorporate that plug-in integration
through the CLI I showed you earlier
this is exposed here so these are the
ones that come out of the box based off
the template there's a whole variety of
plugins that you can use as well if you
wanted to take a look this just simply
goes up to NPM to take a look so if I
want to tell you to say I want to
incorporate firebase as an example and
these are the ones that are up on NPM
that you can incorporate so I'm not
gonna go ahead and do that what I'll go
ahead and do is I can issue a new build
so I can choose the target platform I
wish to build for as well as their
configuration I can also down here if I
wanted to issue either a local build or
a cloud build so cloud bills we have a
bunch of Mac machines sitting up the
cloud we take your assets we build serve
you back down and an IPA additionally if
you're targeting Android for example
we'll send you down an APK just taking a
look at that example some people
sometimes wonder about this so here if I
go ahead and navigate to this location
inside the finder so I'll go into dev
Tina's projects Sydney one actually
Sydney two I'll go and just take a look
at this so here's my project that's been
generated by sidekick you can see
there's my app and I've got my various
files here if I go ahead and now build
this so I'll go ahead and do an issue a
local build using iOS this is the same
sort of process that we have underneath
the covers using the CLI so we're
utilizing the Xcode CLI we're targeting
iOS and this is in this instance and
this will generate for me and
code project underneath the covers so
here we'll take a look I'm gonna have a
platform's directory soon I'll have an
iOS directory there we go
and then it's generating an Xcode
product to build against now ultimately
at the end the day will end up with an
IPA file and that IPA file is simply an
app container for your assets so it's
gone ahead and issued that build and
take a look here where's our builds you
need to so you can see our assets are as
part of the project itself and then if
we take a look at the IPA itself it will
have this directory structure within it
some people don't like that people some
people get nervous and they're like well
I don't want my JavaScript saw file
sources present in the application
itself how do I get around that how do i
mitigate that we just wrote a blog post
earlier that allows you to sort of off
you skate a bit of that through a
partnership with J's scrambler so if you
take a look at our blog we just wrote
about this this week where J's
scramblers Ally allows you basically to
make it more difficult to reverse
engineer your JavaScript that's present
in your IPAs and apks so you can go
ahead and check that out if you're
interested at all because ultimately
this is what's generated as part of it
but what's spat out through J's
scrambler is something that's pretty
opaque so you can go ahead and take a
look at that as well so once that's
built we can then go ahead and utilize
it I'll just show you what this looks
like here I'll just go ahead and open up
the shell great so I'll go ahead and run
this against iOS and again this is gonna
find a list of devices it picks it a
fault one which is typically top of the
list and then it executes that that's
through the tool through the
command-line it obviously gives you
prompts
and again this is utilizing data coming
from firebase and built on angular
so the build succeeded it's got the IPA
in just a second here and we'll deploy
it to the target
it's always fun to watch this we do
support incremental bills as I said
earlier so it does get faster this is
just because the first time I've issued
this
yeah apologies for the res as well it's
just you know get these emulators and
simulators that are pretty small so
alright so we're targeted for the device
there we go so we can go ahead and
launch this now this is actually on my
device here and again this is pulling
data from a back-end so depending upon
your network obviously sometimes it's
gonna be a bit slow for that it's also
issued that build for obviously iOS on
the simulator as well not like that I
think my networks gone down for firebase
nevertheless I'll show you what the code
looks like for this it's actually
reasonably easy to understand not you so
we take a look at the code for this this
is again the one that's based off the
template for angular and typescript here
our application is here this dot app
stuff is where we basically that's where
life starts basically for our
application a lot of bootstrapping etc
and then our application itself is a
series of screens for things like cars
and things like that so we have a
listing of cars here it's described
within our XML here the reason why it's
given this extension dot HTML is because
it's actually a it's better for syntax
highlighting for angle brackets and such
in different IDs but it is an XML
dialect so you can say dot XML if you
wish you'll notice here we have not only
angular event binding but also property
binding as well so you're really
utilizing those characteristics for our
rad ListView which is a UI component
that we have available for displaying
elements in a very smooth scrolling UI
control we also have a template here to
find that allows us to specify the
individual layout for each individual
car so each individual car itself will
leverage a series of labels
and then we have a very serious serious
of stack layout elements on this page as
well you'll notice over here as I said
earlier there's a set of conventions we
can do so you'll notice here that I have
a variety of styles that I've specified
for not only the component itself but
also for individual platforms so if I
wanted to as part of my build process
specify individual platforms for various
styles I go ahead and do that so
anything that's prefixed with dot
Android will get picked up in the
Android build iOS iOS build and so I can
specify any rules I only want for
Android here and same thing goes for iOS
I can also do the same for individual
source files as well so if I had an
individual source file that I want to
use for iOS I go ahead and do that same
thing with Android so just saying dot
Android or iOS here's our underlying
list component for the cars themselves
you can see we're specifying our
component this is where our template
lives for that source file that I showed
you earlier and then any styles that I
wish to specify as a collection here I
can also do so as well
again this was built utilizing or
targeting the Android and template so
that's why that's there I think the
reason why this guy is not showing up is
because my network connection is not
working so well right now for firebase
which is the underpinning for that
yeah it's dropping out that's
unfortunate cool there's a variety of
other characteristics as well that I can
talk about but yeah if you if you're all
interested in this sort of stuff you can
certainly target it very easily either
through the CLI or through sidekick
itself so I kick itself is is pretty
nice just in terms of giving that sort
of visual display on top of this so
jumping back here
so we have a variety of applications
that have been built on top of this
we've got a some other things that you
can do with this which are kind of nice
just going over some of the individual
sort of things that you can do obviously
with all the dependencies that can be
tricky for making sure that your
environment is set up well you have to
have a certain version of Gradle a
certain version of cocoapods certain
version of the JDK s and SDKs for each
individual platform a lot of this stuff
can be problematic so we have this
doctor' command inside the CLI that will
simply inspect your environment and tell
you whether or not everything is good to
go as I said before everything is pretty
easy to drive through the CLI itself and
running these on individual emulators
and environments turns out to be a
pretty simple thing to do just to kind
of clarify some of the things that I
mentioned earlier I said loosely just
very quickly that all these things are
based on on pages that's really the
first-class citizen of native script
applications themselves but as you'll
see there's a variety of various UI
elements and layout things that you can
take advantage of so I mentioned briefly
the layouts but the the widgets
themselves are highly varied and there's
just a ton of them that you can target
that being said if you want to target
individual elements that are exposed
through native API you can use either a
module or target them directly so
nothing prevents you from invoking
direct api's against either platform and
utilizing them if you wish and we
support that through as part of the
environment looking in that example I
showed earlier the 2d example you can
see how these individually map to
various native elements and if you're
looking at how you space these out
through layouts these are done through
our layout mechanism that we have
available there's a whole variety of
things you can also do with native
script itself for things like event
handling and property binding and a
whole bunch of other characteristics but
I won't worry you don't have to worry
about that for for right now if you're
looking at doing anything around data
binding it turns out to be pretty simple
I showed you this example earlier where
you can set variety of things against
the binding context but we have a this
notion of what's called an observer
which you can take advantage of if you
wish so simply by targeting observable
itself and setting properties against it
you can get be notified of property
changes when they occur against that
object and you can go and do some some
really complex binding patterns here if
you wish so you can set to various
collections if you want and bind
accordingly and that allows your UI to
artists obviously updated as changes
occur there's a variety of expressions
we also support as part of the data
binding itself so for a variety of
operators that you wish to convert
against these elements itself and
styling turns out to be pretty easy as
well so through CSS you can certainly
style these these properties quite
easily as I mentioned earlier by
convention this is how we go ahead and
style them so your view name will
actually map up to the online view
itself and then you can say a platform
if you wish we do support a subset of
CSS so it's not the entire set
specification these are some of the
supported properties we've added some
recently that we've been working on like
flex box as well for laying out objects
but it turns out to be pretty nice in
terms of how you can style these things
accordingly nater script itself as I
said is pretty rich there's a very rich
plug-in ecosystem as I said and there's
a whole variety of plugins you can use
today and that also includes integration
with a variety of environments such as
Visual Studio code so there's a set of
plugins you can write for our utilize
inside of Visual Studio code for
integrating with native script apps
running in line as far as other things
are concerned our performance with
native script is pretty good we recently
wrote a blog post about performance for
native script itself for our 3-1 release
so we take a look at our blog here we do
try and publish all of our perspex or
perf announcements around this we wrote
about this recently in our 3-1 release
so you can go check out that blog post
if you wish the reason why part of this
isn't is don't sorry I'm still on the
slides I apologize
so recently we've been writing a little
bit about our performance in our latest
release of native script we've added
some capabilities to allow you to
capture traces so in your package.json
file you can specify that you want to
specify a new profiling property which
is set the timeline and when you do that
we will output not only to the console
but through tooling that is a plugin
timeline view that you can go ahead and
inspect and take a look at the startup
time for native script apps as they run
as part of the report so as an example
we talked a little bit here about an
application called practice putty and we
show you basically how long it takes to
load various aspects of the application
itself and why things take as long as
they might take in some cases so there's
lots of capabilities you're getting
right there so definitely worth checking
out as part of that environment so as I
said before native script is completely
open-source you go check out the source
up on github through our repo which is
slash native script currently we're just
shy of 11,000 stars and if you have any
issues with that we go ahead and accept
issues there as well as pull requests if
you have any that you want to submit we
have a variety of extensions and also
templates available through here and if
you're wanting to get writing your own
plugins we have a seed project here from
Nathan Walker where you can go ahead and
get these things written up pretty
quickly so lots of tooling lots of repos
available there that's part of that
environment if you're interested at all
about native script from an API or Doc's
perspective we're pretty full full
featured here on our our Doc's site and
if you're looking for showcases we have
a whole bunch of them up on our web site
here so we have a variety of apps that
have been built using native script that
you can also check out here that people
have been really successful for one
notable thing is recently si P chose
native script as their basis for
building out their you
your applications for their app modular
so that's definitely something worth
taking note of so s AP seems to think
it's pretty good so we're happy about
that
and yeah lots of stuff going on there
any questions at all about new scripts
you might want to ask in terms of
yeah so the question is for people who
are watching this on the video in the
psychic app when you generate the
template for the angular based project
how do you override the theme for the
project because we need to have to set
it from light dark it doesn't take
effect through sidekick psychic itself
is very early there's lots of properties
and knobs and switches that are missing
from it so at the moment that's not
supported through the psychic tool
itself but that's something that
certainly after the fact you can change
as part of the the project's source
files if you wish so any other questions
for you wrap things up no it's a bit
early but that's alright so anyways just
check it out it's at native script org
really appreciate your time thanks for
listening Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
