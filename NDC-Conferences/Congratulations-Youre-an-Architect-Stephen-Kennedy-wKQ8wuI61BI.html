principal consultant from ratify and
throughout my career
I've worked as an architect I've also
had a lot of experience working with
architects some good experiences some
not-so-good experiences and so what
inspire this talk to me is really just
recognizing the attributes of what I
feel it makes a good architect outside
of purely general domain I think the
first thing in terms of an architect is
not to get fixated on the actual job
title of an architect you might work for
an organization it doesn't recognize it
as an official role or you know just
within your team still as developer
there are some architectural
considerations you you can want to make
that's in the best interest of the
business in terms of drive good outcomes
also the other thing about architects is
a good architect isn't necessarily a
good developer there is there is an
element of different skill sets involved
and vice versa I'm not going to go into
every single suit area around here but
my feelings around an architect are they
kind of sit in the middle of the
business and the development teams in
terms of not so much paying umpire or
arbiter but more sort of guiding each
team in terms of other considerations
they're there to sort of flesh out ideas
make sure that business is getting the
outcome that they want and also making
sure that the development team is
properly aware of all the business in
other applications and terms of their
decisions that they're making to me the
biggest aspect of an architect in terms
of what makes a really successful
architect there's their attitudes and
behaviors versus say the skills or
knowledge that they have edges and
behaviors are far more difficult to to
grow and to adjust they require a lot
more investment and time and focus they
also require a lot more haunting melody
and self-awareness in terms of how
you're portrayed and how you're
perceived particularly trying to
influence others in terms of ideas and
things that you're trying to change
you're trying to bring about skills and
knowledge your much easier to learn you
know there's things like Perl site
that's great conferences like in DC we
can learn these things relatively
quickly we can read a book or a blog
post where as attitudes and behaviors
it's something that's far more like its
personal in terms of the way you operate
some of these edges and havens I'm going
to go through and one of the big ones is
obviously around communication as an
architect you need to be able to
communicate with the business and
stakeholders and clients and those sorts
of things not just the development teams
that you might
previously been communicating with um
one of the things I find really useful
particularly if I'm talking to a new
stakeholder or a new relationship or
someone that I don't in an area where I
don't quite have the subject-matter
expertise is paraphrasing even if I'm
like 95% sure I understand what the
other person is talking about
I often paraphrase because assumptions
are pretty usually pretty bad and now in
our business in our industry and it's
best to be concrete clear the other
thing is I almost named the slide action
negotiation rather than communication
because a lot of your communication
interaction is actually negotiation it
might not be something as formal as
negotiating a rate or a license or
something like that but often you're
trying to influence and change ideas and
there's an implicit or sub communicate
and negotiation that goes on there and
then then often when you're negotiating
the fact that you feel like you're being
heard and understood is almost as
important as the actual outcome and
talking about that you know it's really
important to tie back anything to
business outcomes when you are talking
to non-technical stakeholders often you
know if you communicate things around
you know I want to do see ICD DevOps
with docker and things like that they
got zero interests because they they see
no buyer they see no value for them it
just feels like technical masturbation
to them they want to know what they're
gonna get out of it
so some of the things I do for example
is I've got some buzzwords just like how
we've got industry buzzwords so I'll
talk around return on investment time to
market cost of ownership those sorts of
things with what they care about I mean
so you you essentially tie an initiative
that you're trying to bring across the
line or an approach you're trying to put
out and you tie that back to some sort
of business outcome and that really
leads into the last point around you
know you want to have mutually
beneficial outcomes in terms of what
you're after what the development teams
after and what the business and your
clients are after transparency is
something I think in terms of you if you
think about the edge all principles or
something that's really important to me
it's to me one of the most important
aspects the only problem of transparency
is is there's not a lot of value in
being transparent right at the end of a
relationship you know the value in
transparency is when it's throughout the
life of a relationship or a business
relationship or a client relationship or
a relationship with a peer what I found
we've got a good transparency with other
people is there are going to be issues
that come across the line there might be
because of you they might because of
that other person what could have been
an external factor and you've got
transparency throughout the lifetime
then what that mean what I've found
anecdotally is those issues and things
like that are much easier to resolve and
everyone feels like they're on the same
page they've got buy-in they may not
have been complete agreement with each
other but it just makes life so much
easier as an architect if you've got a
good transparent relationship creator
bully is obviously something really
important to an architect you are trying
to again promote ideas and will
influence and change things and often at
the start of a relationship it's very
difficult to establish a credibility
so a good thing to do is to start small
do little small things it might be after
the first year meetings taking notes
these are things I said I would do and
make sure you execute on them when you
said you're going to execute on them and
you sort of build momentum that way one
of the things I see in sort of good
architects is they're quite task
orientated so one of the things I'll do
is I use outlook a lot I think my role
so I will whenever I've got tasks and
things like I'll use the task pane with
reminders and I'll set reminders not
when the task is due but based on my
capacity when I think I should probably
think about starting that work you know
other people use other tool productivity
tools like Trello or teams or whatever
you want those are all sort of good
habits to get into in terms of building
that credibility in that trust with the
people that you're trying to influence
an architect is a leader like sort of
the scrum master they are a servant
leader they are there to lead and
influence sort of decisions but they
also should collaborate with the teams
that they're working with in terms of
both the business and the developers
I'm a very big fan of the idea of strong
opinions loosely held so what as an
Arctic what you want to do is you want
to have some idea in terms of a vision
in terms of what you're trying to
achieve that's going to give the
business the best outcome of what
they're after but you should also be
open to ideas from people particularly
if you want them to feel like they've
got a sense of what autonomy and by and
in terms of what they're producing what
they're doing I'm you're not the
exclusive owner of good ideas I am
really lucky to work for the
organization and work for where I work
with really smart people and often my
job is not to come up those good ideas
but to help the team sort of craft and
grow those ideas and nurture those ideas
and to something in terms of just by
asking questions have you thought of
that same you thought about you know
what's going to happen when you rolled
out a new version
you thought about what the licensing or
the costs implications are doing this is
gonna be and what that does is really
empowers others but there's still one
important aspect of even if you've got
loosely held opinions is you still need
a background you still need to have some
level accountability and some love
ownership and what you're asking people
to produce an act it can be a stressful
and these are not a whole bunch of
things that I do there's just a short
laundry list of things one of the things
I do quite often early in a in a
relationship or if I'm with a new client
is I'll record minutes and actions not
just to build credibility but to hold
both sides accountable in terms of and
also prevents the problem of he-said
she-said so there is an overhead in
doing that because after a meeting
anything better to do the write-up and
then over time is the relationship
improves then you may find yourself not
let me to do this so much but I find
that really useful because you know
particularly round requirement side of
things if there's any ambiguity what
often do at the start want to release
those minutes as I'll say at the
beginning of the email will say hey feel
free to sort of feedback if this is not
your understanding what happened in the
meeting um
whiteboard architects has got a really
bad reputation in this industry and I
think it's pretty well justified so as
an architect I think it's important you
eat your own dog food I think
particularly for rolling out a new sort
of set of patterns and practices sit
with the dev team and maybe for a day or
two actually just be part of the dev
team ink and code with them and take on
board their feedback around those things
have you over-engineered had you under
engineered it if you're not full of
things that they are aware of you know
it's work it's about working with the
people the the other one I constantly
struggle with and I think most people
struggle with is only worry about what
you can control you can't control
everything you can't control budgets you
can't control always control
requirements you actually not even
responsible for the real clients that's
the product owners job right yeah
so you it's what you need to be is you
need a very clear around what your what
the area is that you can move in in
terms of this is what this these are my
constraints this is what I'm going to
this is what I'm going to do it within
those constraints and finally you know
you can't take on too much so it's
around being able to allocate but when
you delegate
all people accountable as well if they
say they're going to do something make
sure they do it and if not if they don't
do it that's made me start with just a
quiet conversation and then the if it
gets worse in terms of them not
executing on things then you might need
to escalate or it sort of involved more
of a group conversation particularly if
it's the group as a whole or a
development team as a whole that's not
doing what they said they would do um
the last this is my last light and
really it's something where I feel quite
strongly about as well as don't be
afraid to look like an idiot you know
the two sort of I guess psychological
areas that we hear quite often our
industry is the dunning-kruger effect
and also imposter syndrome and I find a
good way of not being guilty of either
of those is just to ask dumb questions
all the time
again assumptions are something really
bad in our industry the other aspect is
it also humanizes to an extent and it
makes it it makes it easy you've got a
lot less pressure on you if you ask your
questions because it doesn't you don't
need to feel like you have to be the
expert or the gun you know and I'm sure
you know we've got some industry experts
around and in DC here obviously and
there are stupid questions all the time
you know there's no there's very little
damn danger now asking stupid questions
because the other aspect is well to
consider is that even if you ask one
stupid question on the conversation
you've probably add a little whole other
value throughout the entire conversation
in terms of your insights and the other
sort of smart questions you've asked so
never be afraid to ask a stupid question
oh it's me I don't know how I'm doing
for time but if anyone's got any
questions I can probably take a few nope
