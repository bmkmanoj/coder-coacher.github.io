you guys and I'm really grateful to be
here in Oslo this morning especially
given that this is the show that I know
the most about Oslo from so I'm very
happy to hear that you guys haven't been
invaded that's really comforting to know
I don't know if you guys know that this
is like pretty much worldwide at this
point that people really follow this
show so if you do know anybody because I
assume everybody in Oslo knows every
anybody you can tell them we're all
waiting eagerly for season two because
they just kind of hurry that along on
the screen I have an escalator and you
see four different paths of the
escalator which way would you anticipate
these to go do you think maybe if we're
looking at it you'd go down one whoops
down one and then down the other up one
up the other that's pretty common right
let's see what that really looks like
does anybody see a problem with what we
expect to happen what do you think would
happen when somebody is using this
escalator they're going to yeah they're
like having to cross over one in order
to be able to go to the other so there's
a huge collision in that this is really
what we're talking about today more than
anything else this is accessibility for
UX don't worry it's much worse than you
think
and my name is Elle waters I work for a
company called simply accessible we're a
globally distributed company so while it
was a bit of a trip to get here from
North America it's something that we
have lots of teammates in the UK and in
other parts of Europe so we're happy to
be a part of this conference a couple of
years ago we did a survey with UX
professionals and we asked them why
don't you integrate accessibility more
into the things that you do and we came
up with three top answers so survey says
the first answer accessibility is
intimidating yes I think we all can
agree to that when I got involved with
accessibility for the first time this is
kind of what my home library looked like
because the first thing that people do
when they try and get answers to their
questions about how to be able to make
something more accessible to people with
disabilities as they go and they
research right that would be the first
thing that you do and so I had piles of
books and websites and everything and I
was trying so hard to learn feeling like
I was on this really fast learning curve
and so I would go online and I'd find
these things where the w3c would have
all of these different techniques 203
general techniques 94 HTML even
Silverlight techniques don't use
Silverlight flash techniques don't use
flash server-side scripting techniques
all of these things so what do we call
this in the accessibility industry
good start it doesn't matter this is
like the most exhaustive obtuse kind of
documentation that you can find online
and it's not even getting you through
the door as far as what you need to know
about accessibility and then there's all
these devices that people use
there's devices that allow people to
speak into them devices that allow
things to speak for them things that
somebody can use a wand for something
someone could use a foot for there's all
different manner of keyboards it can be
very intimidating to know how do you
possibly design and develop something
and test to know that you've been
successful for something like this
this is a refreshable Braille device
when I first saw it I thought it was a
Casio keyboard it's the it's mysterious
looking it has mechanical keys that rise
and fall with different Braille imprints
on it electronically it's an amazing
device but it's as foreign to me as
anything I could imagine
and then the most popular screen reader
around has the most intimidating name of
all is called jaws I took one look at
this and I thought I'm out this is
incredibly intimidating
number two answer was accessibility is
hard yes
and I'm sorry and you're feel free to
leave if you're hoping that you're going
to get accessibility is easy today it is
hard but when you look at it everybody
has days when they try for 100%
excellence and they miss right that
makes me sad everybody has times when
features get released and you didn't
test them with real people so that the
yes button is right next to the red and
the no is next to the green and while
that may not make a lot of sense to us
at the same time in another country it
may make good sense to people and
sometimes we secretly hope that good
enough is too
good enough after all the work that we
put into something this is a picture of
the top of a ramp the top of a
wheelchair ramp at a building in Toronto
where I was visiting and the sign reads
no wheelchairs permitted on ramp for
wheelchair access please use west
entrance and the reason why even though
it has a button to push the door open
the reason why is because they didn't
actually measure the gradient
sufficiently enough and so after they
put all this time and effort in they
found out that it was a too steep of a
gradient to be able to pass the
regulations to allow somebody to easily
be able to use their wheelchair to be
able to get into the door of the
building so sometimes you know maybe
they just think well it would just be
much easier if maybe they just went
around to the back door because that way
we don't have to redo all of this work
and that's understandable this is a
picture of my niece he's named after me
her name is Elle and a good friend of
mine Dylan and a couple of years ago I
was in the car with her driving to
Austin Texas for South by Southwest and
her mother my sister and I was telling
my sister about how awesome Amazon Prime
is because yes I'm pretty addicted to it
because we live in the world UPS hub I
live in Louisville Kentucky and so I can
order something in two hours later it
magically magically appears on my
doorstep so I think I was probably
trying to evangelize her but I was
telling her hey I can add you to my
Prime membership and then you two can
you know order things you don't need
with just one click and so I went onto
my mobile device I went onto my at the
time I had a Samsung and Android device
and it went on there and I decided okay
I am a power user right not only do I
work on the web but I'm as I mentioned
an addict when it comes to Amazon Prime
I know the website really well so went
there and of course I got this mobile
view and I thought okay that's fine
I wanted to add my sister to my Amazon
Prime membership and I looked at those
links and I couldn't find an easy way to
get there but
it was so differently designed the
content looked really different than the
desktop site so I thought well you know
when a doubt you google it right so I
went there typed in how do I add a
family member to my Prime membership and
I see a link and these are Amazon links
I figure that's pretty trusted so I'm
going to click to that of course it goes
to a desk top viewport type site a
desktop version and that was difficult
but you know I'm looking and I see ah
go to point manage Prime membership that
must be it so I click on that link and
they get to hello listed the flutters
member since and it's the same page and
I think okay well there's surely some
paths that I'm missing here so I scroll
down and I look and I see down at the
bottom I see amazon.com full site and
I'm like I'm going in I know that it's a
complicated web site and if any of you
guys have been to the web site the
desktop version you know what I'm
talking about it is it is like a focus
management nightmare when you think
about how many different kinds of
interaction patterns as they expect to
kind of just assault people with and yet
you know I was a site I buy a lot of
stuff so it must in some way work so I
go there and I think it's okay even
though this is all my mobile device I
can manage this because I know the site
really well so I go and yes it's this
lots and lots and lots of content and
images and everything but I know where
that menu is so I click on that menu
I find that link manage my Prime
membership Prime membership got it I
know exactly what to do hello Elizabeth
waters member since November tooth and
all I wanted to do was be able to add my
sister to my Prime membership account
and this is not traditionally considered
an accessibility issue it took me five
minutes and a little bit of swearing in
the car to get through this before I
gave up but imagine what it would be
like if you had one or two other
challenges in trying to be able to
access this content how difficult it
would be and so it's something to
consider that disability is a usability
amplifier and so think about that for a
second if it takes me five minutes to be
able to get through a particular user
task flow
it may take somebody 20 minutes it may
take someone 30 minutes if they have a
disability that makes things go a little
slower if perhaps they're challenged in
in other ways where they have a
combination of things that are going on
so accessibility is hard because good
design is hard
that's why accessibility is hard
number three answer accessibility is not
my job really
so when putting together things for a
conference a couple of years ago I asked
it was a UX conference and I asked them
why they didn't want to hear more about
accessibility at conferences and the
answer was my work does not involve
people or work with people with
disabilities or I don't have a lot of
direct need to learn more about
accessibility basically it's not that
person's job okay one in seven people in
the world have a disability that's 15
percent of the world population that's
according to the World Health
Organization and you can go to
google.com slash accessibility and find
lots of great information basically a
billion people in the world have some
form of disability so that's 15 percent
of the world's population and for
developers versus 5.2 of desktop
Internet users that's the stat right now
that you guys are probably still
suffering through having to support just
put that in perspective there for a
second a trillion dollars of annual
global disposable income so there's your
marketing bit right there a trillion
dollars of annual global disposable
income it's different according to
different countries as far as how much
but it ends up basically working out to
being a pretty significant user segment
and then last bit as far as business
case when looking at whether or not
accessibility is worth taking on
everything you do to make something work
better for someone that's blind or deaf
helps with findability and search engine
optimization everything you do to make
things work for somebody who's low
vision or has mobility challenges
actually works and helps with your
mobile strategy and everything you do to
make better for someone with cognitive
difficulties helps everyone
Braintree just recently released this
stat that mobile transactions are
expected to increase by 74 percent over
the next three years so I think that
most organizations are really trying to
find out how to be able to grab hold of
that and how to be able to manage a
mobile strategy that will put them in
the forefront of their industry so
looking at this here's another
real-world example of how things
typically go within a web project
lifecycle the accessibility requirement
would be entrances accessible to
wheelchair users so you say check we
have a button so that somebody can push
the button the door opens and a person
can use their wheelchair to get through
unfortunately there's a missed
requirement because that same place is
actually that same door is on the top of
the stairway so we would say that's a
missed requirement right because they
didn't put that all in there so we're
going to log a defect that's what we'll
do and so the remediation the fix is
basically put a sign up that says access
from alley off Dundas Street right and
the sign is on the door all the way past
these stairs so the issues resolved
because it's not really somebody's job
to figure that out and I would ask you
guys if it's not your job whose job is
it if you work in any capacity to put
digital content out there then there is
a share of responsibility that you have
and an opportunity that you have this is
a building that I went to that was
specifically designed with inclusion in
mind and I thought it was really
interesting to see this in the built
environment
beyond just having the bare minimum and
having a wheelchair ramp and things like
that they did things like this so
instead of just a simple button you can
see they have this long panel because
sometimes people don't always have full
mobility of their hands even if they're
in a wheelchair they may have a
motorized scooter and this allows them
to be able to bump it with their wheel
and still be able to open the door just
a small change but actually really
thoughtful about different ways and
modes that people might use that
additionally all of their television
sets are tilted above tilted down
towards people but are above so that
nobody's like knocking their heads
because they'll have blind individuals
who may be using the wall to be able to
give them you know some bearings on
things and you don't want them to be uh
knocking their heads into the into the
television sets and then finally one of
my favorite things is there are people
who have low vision that may not want to
be using a lot of assistive devices in
order to be able to walk and yet they
have specifically they have these edges
that are just a different shade of tile
along the wall to show people where the
wall is so that they can find it because
it's really high contrast and then at
the very end of each hallway they have a
circle that's rubberized and it has a
cocktail feel so that somebody
understands you're at the end of the
hallway it's kind of a nice thing and it
didn't take a lot of effort for them to
be able to design things inclusively so
this accessibility or is this just good
design is this something that's consider
this is Terry Fox he was a marathon long
distance runner in Canada and you can
see he has a prosthetic leg and he
pretty much made history because of the
fact these tremendous athlete and yet at
the time people were not used to seeing
people with disabilities perform and
excel in these athletic environments so
the question is this is Aimee Mullins
she's an artist and actor and a model
she T has prosthetic devices she has
them made by Steve McQueen at times
where she will have these beautiful
works of art or she like Oscar Pistorius
will have these amazing prosthetic limbs
that actually when she runs she runs
faster than someone who was born with
femurs instead of someone who is born
and has these so is this accessibility
or is this just really good design this
is a picture an image still of her when
she was in an art film and she was one
of the only people who could be able to
do this without CGI because of the fact
that she can wear prosthetic limbs so
she can be she says she has the
advantage of being five foot five or six
foot two on any given day whatever she
wants to be and then finally this is
Gianna and she was a little girl who
lost her leg in an accident and started
basically becoming a recluse for years
because she was embarrassed about going
outside and she wasn't very comfortable
using her new leg and there was a
company that started to design an
interface where children could design
their own prosthetic limb and they could
pick the colors they wanted they could
make it look like a transformer they
could make it look like Ironman or they
could pick their favorite colors and
this is a picture of her after she's
gotten comfortable with the leg that she
designed for herself so the question
again is this accessibility we're is
this just really good design so today
I'm going to share with you a web
professionals inclusive design coloring
box I would have called it a tool kit
but if we're in a design class it should
be something more friendly and should be
more playful and more squishy you have
plenty of time this week to be able to
get all of the crunchy kind of dev stuff
so we're going to have a coloring box
and those of you guys who have these
we'll be using these in a little bit and
if you don't it's okay there's actually
an old-school way to do it beforehand so
starting with user research this is
something that those of you guys have
have done work with in UX and design
this is a way for you to feel comforted
to know that a lot of these things you
already have in your coloring box so
we're just going to point out the
benefits to people with disabilities
we create personas this is a good
example of a persona this is John we
create full personas of people who have
rich lives and we work with client teams
to make sure that it caters towards what
they themselves are looking at for their
primary user task clothes and then we
happen to include some disabilities with
those people we don't create
accessibility personas we create real
client personas so this is an example of
some personas we created for World
Vision Canada when we were working with
them this is John he's 27 years old he's
single he has no kids he's a gallery
artist and he works from home and he's a
human rights advocate he promotes rights
for underserved communities and uses his
artwork to be able to create that
awareness and he's thinking about
applying to become a child sponsor
ambassador John needs clear simple
instructions and he wants to get avoid
getting lost in details he makes tons of
to-do lists all the time and he
frequently feels overwhelmed when things
are too chaotic and too much is going on
he has autism spectrum disorder this is
rose she's 24 years old she's married
but she has no kids she's a graduate
student and a journalist and because
she's a journalist she works really
unusual hours mix of short and long
trips for her work she focuses mainly on
developing nations in her journalism and
what she reports on and she manages most
of her life while she's on the move and
so she usually uses a mobile device
because of that and she wants her life
to be effortless and forward-thinking
she wants to be ready for whatever's
next she's on the cusp and so she has
very little patience for things that
waste her time Andros has been almost
completely deaf since she was born this
is Mary she's 35 years old she's married
with two children she's an incredible
musician she plays 11 instruments she's
a professor of ethnomusicology and she
wants to inspire students with new ways
of creating music and has a grant for
teaching music as advocacy
and so she's developing the student
performance fundraiser for World Vision
and she's been blind since she was 13
she needs significant trust and others
and she has parent fatigue which is
really significant this is an example so
all of these personas are based as as an
amalgamation of real people that we do a
lot of usability testing with and we'll
see if we can get the audio to come
through this is a clip of when we're
setting up we do remote moderated
usability testing with people with
disabilities
and so this is to give you guys an
understanding of what it's like for
somebody who uses a screen reader just
if you've never heard when somebody uses
one if you try to use it yourself that's
great
but it is a different experience if you
use it on a daily basis so this is one
of our participants just setting up the
software to get ready for the study
significantly in value we've already
located what I believe I mentioned a
little bit really you know what
something before that's looking for
everything so I don't know about you
guys but that's a little fast for me
the average screen reader user listens
to stuff about 200 words a minute much
much faster than the untrained human ear
could listen and actually parse anything
but that's pretty common actually so
just as an example of how people consume
information when they're using a screen
reader they consume it via for those of
you guys who are thinking on the
technical side they basically go in a
linear format by consuming it via the
document object model so they're looking
at it from a Dom perspective and because
of the fact they're really comfortable
using a screen reader they start parsing
it very very quickly
this is Shawn he's 31 years old he's
engaged he doesn't have any kids yet
he's a UI engineer in Palo Alto and he
has a game-changing idea he's incredibly
competitive very very driven so he's a
member of the Young Entrepreneur Council
which is a made up organization but
probably something like that in Palo
Alto he's creating a micro donation
disaster relief mobile app to sponsor
at-risk people groups and he wants to be
update on all of the latest technology
and therefore he gets bored with
technology very quickly he's probably at
this conference actually he has low
vision and because of that he needs to
magnify his screen 400% in order to be
able to see the content that he's
interacting with this is Maxine she's 61
she's widowed she has two children and
five grandchildren and she owns her own
bakery but she's looking to retire and
spend more time with her grandchildren
and so she's looking to spoil every
grandchild this year and she's looking
at this World Vision gift catalog for
birthday and holiday gifts for her
family she's very much an extrovert
she's got great people skills she has
severe arthritis from years of computer
work okay so these are the personas that
we created and it's a pretty common
thing that we do with teams because we
want them to understand accessibility
from the perspective of how people might
be using their content buttons can
sometimes be too close together for me
and I can't click small targets which
one of these different personas who of
these people might have said something
like that you're going to have to yell
it out because Maxine you think yeah
Maxine that's a really good guess
because if vaccine is having difficulty
being able to to hold a mouse because
sometimes it just hurts and she might
have hand tremors it's going to be
difficult for her to click something
that's a small target good Maxine
next I bump up the font size in my
browser to make text easier to read I
here Shawn anyone else Shawn very good
because of the fact that he has to be
able to read sometimes he will bump up
just the font size it's very common
because he doesn't want to get that
horizontal scroll that you get when you
expand and magnify the entire screen you
see captions as an alternative but for
me there my primary format so I hear
some people think Mary this is captions
for video I hear rose so what is the
difference between captions and text
transcripts does anybody know captions
are actually for people who are hard of
hearing or deaf because it's the visual
subtitles that you'll see on a video but
if you're blind you won't have access to
be able to read those and so you're
either going to listen to the audio or
you'll read a text transcript so in this
case yet it would be rose I need to use
the keyboard but on certain web pages I
just can't
anyone who would be somebody who
absolutely needs to use a keyboard yep I
hear Mary that's good then finally I'm
worried that I won't be able to use the
internet to do my job
so you're John anyone else
actually everyone truly when we're doing
usability testing some of the things
that happen is we develop these kind of
very intimate scenarios when we're
working with people and trying to work
through a client's website with them and
we hear a lot of anxiety we hear a lot
of frustration but it comes out of a
fear more than anything else it's not
that people are angry they may be angry
but anger comes from somewhere and
they're really afraid because at any
moment that could stop working for them
and then that has really serious
ramifications for them especially if it
involves their job so here's just a
another I have a couple of slides that
show a list of common things that we
hear so it's hard for me to remember
things from one page to the next John
typically with a limited view of the
page it could be difficult for me to see
how one part of the page relates to
another who might that be so I think if
you zero in on limited view you can
think about Sean and he's got this very
small view of the whole page so it's
difficult for him to see how one thing
might relate to another English isn't my
first language ASL American Sign
Language is I need to translate
everything as I read that's actually
more common than you would think I feel
a lot of eye strain and my eyes get
tired after a few hours of work that's
very often something that we hear from
people who have low vision so again that
would be Sean
so by using these user personas it's
something that you can start to think
about the things that they encounter as
they're working with your content and
it's less about a technical standard and
much more about designing things to
where they are easy to use for everyone
but focusing if you design for the needs
of the few you meet the needs of the
many so if you incorporate this into
your design and you look at persona
mapping as a user experience champion
oftentimes you have different roles in
what you're doing there's people who do
interaction design there's people who
are information architects people who
are visual designers and what it's
really helpful to do is to look at who
is your primary user and who's your
secondary user in each of those roles
so if you're an eye information
architect or content strategist then we
would recommend that you focus first on
neroli diverse users people who may have
cognitive challenge challenges who may
be somewhere within the autism spectrum
and people who are non-native language
users that's always a really good way to
do it and to do this you can conduct
usability testing with paper prototypes
you can sketch a napkin and be able to
sit down with somebody and be able to
get their feedback it doesn't have to be
a working prototype for that persona
mapping for a visual designer focus
first on low vision users which also
Maps very well to people with mobile
devices and also color blind users and
you can conduct usability testing with
high fidelity mock-ups whether that be
an HTML prototype if you go straight
into that or if you're talking about a
Photoshop file you can do user testing
with them persona mapping for the
interaction designer this is very
important as a step so if you don't have
somebody who's working through a task
low and you're thinking only about
modules and components I would
definitely encourage you to think about
this and so as your first user mobility
challenged users second user is blind
users so be thinking about how somebody
gets through each of those different
kinds of interactions for the workflow
that you're presenting on your pages
and you want to conduct usability
testing with HTML prototypes but let me
strongly encourage you to make sure that
you have really looked at it with just
using a keyboard first you don't need to
use a screen reader because you'll never
end up listening to it as quickly as
fast or like Mary does right but what
you can do is you can test everything
with a keyboard so that you know that
there's not any stops and that workflow
so here's five things to remember and
this is the only five things that you
really need to do from a design
perspective in order to be successful
with accessibility the first one is
obvious winds call it what it is how
many of you guys are familiar with this
particular pattern this mobile pattern
that Facebook put out years ago without
really doing any user testing and
Confused the world on their mobile
website for a while there was like a
period of time where it was between
pancakes and hamburger and at some point
the favori fans once and now we call it
the hamburger menu and even today and
usability testing this baffles people
who are not like us who are web
professionals and we see it all the time
so we know what it's supposed to do this
confuses the hell out of them and yet in
usability testing they found that the
menu icon itself doesn't translate very
well to people who are not nor like
active users and the word menu it did
all right but the thing that did the
best was when you have the icon with the
word next to it it was so obvious so
clear what that pattern was that people
did really really well in usability
testing so obvious wins when you have a
choice between something kind of brand
new and slightly mysterious for an
interaction pattern and something that's
very clear obvious wins the second thing
make it simple and make it easy so we
have on our website and I encourage you
to go and use anything that you find
that's useful we have an examples areas
it's basically like our lab setting
and we have a form validation pattern
that we put through years of usability
testing you don't have to make all your
forms look like this and all your error
messaging look like this but with that
said one of the things that's a surefire
way to get brand loyalty and to get
people to really come back to your site
is how they recover from mistakes when
trying to complete a form how well you
help them recover from those errors
they've shown that that creates an
incredible amount of brand loyalty so a
few things about this for multiple
errors we typically put a summary bucket
of the errors at the top of the page
that makes it really simple and easy to
understand we put the number of errors
that somebody's encountered we make
clickable links for those particular
fields that are in errors so that
somebody can go directly there that
makes it much easier for people who have
limited mobility to be able to get
directly to fix the issue that they find
and then this next one is a little bit
on hyperspeed but we've had success with
elderly and people who have limited
mobility and that is the ability to
click a link and go to the next error so
they are able to skip through several
different form fields that are not in
error so they don't have to have 30
times just to be able to get to that
next error this is simple this is easy
there's no question what the error is
how that error can be fixed what they
need to do to be able to fix it the
third thing is make it consistent and
make it predictable I didn't say make it
ugly or make it dumb down or overly you
know simple make it consistent and make
it predictable how many of you guys have
a pattern library or design system that
you're thinking about or that you're in
the process of working through that's
good so you will succeed that's good for
those of you guys who have been a little
daunted a little overwhelmed by the idea
of creating a pattern library I
encourage you one of my favorite people
a shitty pattern library is better than
no pattern library at all especially
from an accessibility point of view
because if you create bad modal
dialogues but you create the same
pattern every time then we can work with
you to create a beautiful modal dialog
and though that beauty just cascades
throughout so pattern libraries are
great because it means that you're not
presenting your users with eight
different kinds of error messaging
you're not presenting them with five
different ways to be able to fill out a
form or anything like that they know
once they have gotten into your system
they understand what it means change
your perspective and assume nothing so
this is a photo how many of you guys
have your straws yeah great okay I'm
going to bring up another file and if
you don't have a straw you can pretend
to have a straw just by holding your
hand and you can do it as they are
holding a milkshake straw so what we're
trying to think about is how to be able
to understand what something called
proximity and hope so what I'm going to
do is I'm like everybody to hold up
their straw and look through it with one
eye and close the other eye and I'm
going to have a webform on the on the
screen and I want you to fill out the
web form I'm going to take a photo of
you
so when you're done you go to put your
hand down
so what was the pattern that the the
movement that you guys found yourselves
doing and trying to fill out this
webform right you're finding yourself
moving from left to right and left to
right and left to right and the biggest
problem with it is this is an example of
what it would be like if you were
somebody with low vision you'd sumed in
your screen or you're using a screen
magnifier do you see what the problem is
for people if they're looking at this
they're going to look at the question
and they have to go all the way over the
screen in order to be able to find those
answers and who knows what that yes or
no really is referring to when it's this
far away from the question and then so
we're creating this pattern where it's
left to right - left - right - left to
right and that's creating some muscle
memory for your users right there
they're used to being going left to
right - left - right so then the next
call-to-action quit no kidding right I'd
quit but then they're used to their
thinking okay well I went this far over
each time so I'm going to go this far
over the next time the next call to
action previous and when you look at
this this is not really in a design
context something that we would
recommend for a lot of reasons but the
one of the biggest problems that we see
is we're grouping the wrong chunks of
information so we're grouping questions
together and answers together and we're
not grouping related pieces of
information in proximity to each other
so this is a law of proximity and a
design perspective and while it would be
tedious for us or it might kind of
disturb us a little bit if we don't have
any visual disabilities this is not
exactly a perfect simulation of what
it's like to have a low vision kind of
experience but it gives you that for the
purposes of this conference and it
recognizes how difficult it is to be
able to associate these
as a pieces of content and then when you
look at these buttons they have
something what we call visual weight in
a design perspective they have equal
visible weight so the only way that you
know which button that you really want
to select is by actually reading the
content so it increases your cognitive
load to have to be able to do them so
here's the magic of what CSS can do for
us ah so the markups no different behind
the scenes and that markup could have
been perfectly coded for somebody who
uses a screen reader but it was totally
unusable for somebody who might have low
vision so let's try again with your
straw or your hand and try and fill out
the form now
a little bit easier huh you're not
you're not going to eliminate the
left-right movement entirely nor should
you necessarily do that it's not a
recommendation that all your forms need
to look like this but it's definitely a
recognition of the more streamlined the
experience the better it will be for
everyone as well as people with low
vision and you can imagine that this
probably works a lot better on a mobile
device and it groups the right chunks of
information together right the question
with the answer that's a much smarter
way to group these things and have them
in proximity and then if you see the way
that we treated the buttons next is the
very first button that they go to
because that's your primary call to
action it's what you want users to do
and then they have an immediate feedback
of how to get to the other ones that
they need that so use layouts to create
the right chunks of your information and
group them together and a pattern of use
to lead that eye to action if we look at
this we can see it's a pretty
straightforward experience after them we
have these UX cards that we're putting
out there kind of in beta and we have
this is one of them it's the straw test
which is this and we have a few others
which just allows you to get outside of
the way that you normally see your own
designs another one is to look at just
the headings on the page and can you
understand the context of the page just
by reading the headings another one is
imagining you can only move forward
using only a keyboard and you can't move
backwards can you do that and so there's
a lot of different ways to be able to
look at the content that you produce and
when you put these design constraints on
what you do it's something for you to
understand how to be able to make your
designs bulletproof
and last but not least go see so in
agile terms that's gimbal lean
methodology the idea is all of this is
great you should build these best
practices and everything that you do but
ultimately the true measure of whether
something is accessible is whether
people with disabilities can actually
use your product so if you're not
conducting usability testing don't feel
that you have to spend a lot of money
don't feel that you have to do heat
sinks and heat maps and things like that
and work through six weeks of user
research that no longer is valid because
you have this really rapid sprint cycle
instead think in terms of guerilla
marketing kind of usability testing and
look at your customers and find out if
you can get these kinds of needs from
that and if not there's lots of
disability advocacy groups that you can
work with to get immediate feedback on
your prototypes on your designs on your
mock-ups this is a confirmation about
why it's important to do user testing as
I mentioned before we do a lot of
usability testing at our organization
and this is blurred out because it's an
actual client website but what we found
that was really quite surprising is that
in this day and age of responsive with
different breakpoints we found that a
lot of users were viewing a different
breakpoint
than their clients there the client
really actually anticipated so people
who have liked this user Amy she has a
bookmark bar that she has up constantly
and that was throwing everything into
this portrait mode for her to be able to
view her site another user we found
actually three out of eight users that
use screen readers weren't even using a
monitor they don't need a monitor they
live at home they're blind users what do
they need a monitor for and so a window
system throws that into this 135 pixel
by 60 pixel viewport for the browser so
the browser still running but it's not
viewed at full screen and what that did
was the
that gave these users the mobile version
of the site but they were using desktop
screen readers to interact with the
mobile version and keyboards so it was a
different experience entirely blew our
minds changed how we did usability
testing how we did our own accessibility
testing for clients because we recognize
you can't make assumptions about what
people might be doing and what they
might be using
there's too many configurations and the
spectrum of human needs and
accommodations and what people prefer
are too vast to try and predict so the
only thing that you can do is use
wonderful best practices and then go see
and actually test with people and last
but not least I would just encourage you
guys to just dive in there is nothing no
need to have a fear of failure when it
comes to accessibility and inclusive
design make mistakes but earnestly try
and understand how to be able to build
more inclusive things and you already
have the tools much like Dorothy with
the shoes in The Wizard of Oz you have
had the power all along to do this
because you already know how to be able
to design or develop a web page or a
mobile app or digital interface you
already know that because that's what
you're in in this particular industry
and you have those skills and do your
best with that and follow those
standards and best practices and you'll
succeed we did a research project for a
client and we looked at four years of
data that we did accessibility
assessments for she wanted to know how
many of the issues that we find that
impact people with disabilities were
actually directly related to web
standards over 60% almost 70% of the
issues that we found that impacted
people with disabilities were direct
directly related to web standards that's
pretty stunning so if you think about it
if you have pristine semantic markup and
you design your webpages with proximity
and mind and color contrast in mind and
these kinds of things that you already
know
to do in your roles then you've actually
accomplished a great deal towards more
inclusive designs so it can be tough but
you guys are already equipped and you're
already superheroes in what you do so
design and code kindly thank you I think
we have a few minutes left yeah a few
minutes for questions if you guys have
any no questions about accessibility
really yes yes right sure sure so the
question is that number is huge right 15
percent of the world population having
disabilities and the question is how
many of those people where their
disability actually impacts their
ability to use the web and while there's
no easy way to be able to come to that
number I would say that the largest
group of people there's two large groups
of people who have disabilities in that
number and it's not blind users actually
most people when they think about web
accessibility to think of blind users
it's people who have mobility challenges
and people who have cognitive
difficulties those are the largest
groups of people with disabilities and
then visual impairment there's seven
times as many people with low vision as
there are people who are blind which is
why you see a preferencing low vision
and really kind of talking about that
because it isn't as well known so
there's not an easy way to come to that
that question but when people have
mobility challenges whether or not it's
arms and they're one-handed and they're
having to use the web with just one hand
or whether or not they have limbs that
it's just from the waist down I can you
know actually it's a great question
we'll see if we can get some
search on that but the truth is there's
enough people who it's not just their
legs because that's truthfully the only
place where you could probably have a
motor disability where it doesn't impact
the use of the web right would be if
it's your legs because just about
anywhere else and it's going to become
difficult for you so that's a partial
answer but well I'll try and get some
more on that but yeah it's mostly people
there's a lot of people were coming back
from armed conflicts and war that come
back and they have damage done from from
injuries and combat and that's something
that's actually been on the rise as well
any other questions yes so the question
is can sometimes designing for disabled
people impact normal users and that's a
great question I think that the real
question would be what are you designing
for normal users that the short answer
is no but when you design there's a
Susanna Gonzalez from Smashing Magazine
basically talks about how none of us are
really normal users because we're all on
this continuum whether it's a temporary
disability or something that somebody's
aging into those disabilities or if you
happen to be wearing glasses that's
something that is somewhat you know of
an impairment and we've seen time and
time again that things that are done to
improve accessibility actually increase
the usability for others so the short
answer is no there's there's really not
something that impacts negatively for
people who don't have disabilities if
you design correctly for people with
disabilities because the idea is you're
not really designing specifically for
disability what you're designing is a
universal design approach it's actually
one of the wonderful things about Norway
is that the legislation for
accessibility in Norway actually says
that
stead of designing more than one
experience for people and say
separate-but-equal the goal is to design
the same experience and have multiple
ways to be able to accomplish the same
task so there's nothing that we've seen
color contrast helps people you know it
helps everyone designing things with
proximity in mind helps everyone it
really increases conversion rate for for
things when they're more usable yes yeah
sure so the color contrast requirements
from a technical point of view from the
web content accessibility guidelines
states that normal text has to have a
contrast ratio of four point five to one
and larger text is three to one so we're
not talking about a high contrast we're
talking about a reasonable level of
contrast so people who need higher
contrast than that typically will enable
a theme or a custom style sheet so in
Windows or something called high
contrast themes and they'll use that if
they need significant contrast so as
long as you kind of get out of the
user's way and allow them to be able to
effectively use their own tools that's
really what we're talking about and so
regular contrast is not usually very
challenging for organizations orange and
green can be tricky at times to be able
to put text against but a lot of times
people will find that what we're talking
about is text against a background we're
not talking about all the colors of your
brand palette we're talking about what
you use to communicate text information
right so instead of using that really
thin tiny gray font to be able to make a
very artistic state
and you know use a little bit darker
gray like a dark gray works fine it
doesn't have to be a black and white
website in order for it to function well
any other questions
all right well thank you guys very much
and enjoy the conference I appreciate it
oh and there's a voting outside with
really cool post-its that unfortunately
do use color to convey meaning but we'll
give you guys a pass on that and so vote
if you enjoyed it
what's that mm-hmm
