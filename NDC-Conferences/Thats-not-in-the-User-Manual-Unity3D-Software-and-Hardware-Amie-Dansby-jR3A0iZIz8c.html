Dansby I'm from Dallas Texas
I work in games currently I work for a
robotic company I previously worked at
marble before uh Disney took over I
worked on Captain America x-men destiny
Super Hero Squad show and I have a
scholarship I started for the National
video game museum and it's for girls in
stem
so I'm active in that and I'm also
active of the makerspace area which i
think is kind of a not quite as a
familiar thing here which kind of
surprises me I have a few 3d printers
and lasers and all the fun stuff so this
talk is this is not in the user manual
kind of a quick show of hands how many
people use unity for like their jobs
okay so a few do you guys like people
just trying to do I'm just going to get
an idea of what you guys have done none
the forefront just for fun okay
so this is like just an overview of
unities for their demo of kind of some
of the stuff that they use they've
gotten the engine is extremely powerful
it's used for more than just games
NASA's JPL program used it for some of
their Mars rover landing as well as some
medical simulations so this is just a
quick
yeah okay so just a quick overview since
a lot of you actually don't use unity
unity is a physics engine and a game
engine it is known primarily for being a
video game engine if any of you have
ever had to do anything to calculate
physics even like a basic of what like
the human ways on earth that stuff is a
pain in the butt and unity has done that
all for you and they've implemented they
call it XR but it's a combination of VR
and AR as well as like level design
world building they've gotten into
cinematography as of lately has anyone
seen district 9 or chappie so that
director they had been going in and
doing real-time rendering using the
Unity engine for film and they've cut
down their like film time I believe to
six months which is insane to do this
real-time rendering I think they're
doing all their calculations as well as
their like facial capture so and this
was actually they went and filmed out in
California and they were able to do
I guess if you've seen district 9 it's
all digital so unity is pushing for you
can build once and you can deploy to
everything and I guess if you used unity
you kind of know that's true yeah so if
you have a Mac or an iOS device you
still have to have you do your build on
your Mac if you have an Xbox you still
have to have be part of their program to
publish to the Xbox so kind of gets into
what happens when what you're doing is
not listed up there so we're going to
still do it so I guess the biggest thing
is when you don't know what you're doing
you get into that point where you're
just afraid so I think everybody gets to
that point so you just can't be afraid
to be like I don't know what I'm doing
and there's no documentation to support
it
unity there's another engine is called
unreal those are that's actually what I
use when I went to university this is a
book that actually had when I went to
school and these are the game engines
that were listed and unity was not even
one of them so over the past 10 years
there they've pushed their their engine
is free to download unless you make more
than a hundred thousand dollars a year
on your game so they're asked they have
an asset store which if you're not an
artist is an amazing thing because you
can go and download you know animated
models and assets and get your game
running with a prototype before you
actually go in there and spend money on
an artist okay so where does unity fall
in this in the stack there you have your
graphics your sound your game specific
code for any type of script that you're
running on your player your character as
well as networking and then there is
unity uni follow follows like right and
below your operating system whether
you're you know window specific if your
console specific if your hardware
specific all of those have some type of
documentation or you know framework for
them except for the stuff we're going to
do today so this is the fun thing when I
get to introduce hardware to most
software developers these are usually
fun expressions that go through
everyone's mind
some people like hardware some people
hate hardware some people don't
understand some people don't have a
project to work on is anyone dabbled
with any type of hardware or hobby
electronics or anything yes yes what
have you used those refi okay I have see
this is what happens when you
participate I have fun things too so
this is a circuit playground it's a it's
a has LEDs built anything to do too much
coding so I have fun stuff this is a
Raspberry Pi I think it's got a job you
so it has built-in Wi-Fi okay
these are two instances I've
okay so unity has excellent
documentation when you are doing
something that they have that's existing
so what happens when I typed in Arduino
nothing comes up nothing
so where where do you start I have to
use my IT Crowd since I am here okay
these are kind of the Alpen all these
slides up on github later as well but
these are just some of the software and
the hardware I'm going to use unity
which is the engine and Arduino has
their own separate ID as well and you
know the proton particle which is a
little IOT board if anyone's familiar
with that some little LEDs and Lego
Mindstorms okay
anybody know what a microcontroller is
all right what is it
yeah it controls a inputs and outputs as
well yeah init sir all right come up
here you can have something fun or I can
give this you after workout class okay
that's a circuit player I can go over
some of the hardware with you laughter
so these were a few people that had
replies of what they thought
microcontroller was so from this person
thought it was a tiny planet some of
them are humorous but I I got into I was
doing like works and talks in I would
talk about microcontrollers and then I
realized people are like what's a
microcontroller so I mean some of our
funny and this one person says that it
can manage complex tax and
microcontrollers like Donald Trump and
it's simple and can manage basic tasks
with instruction somebody said it's
adorable little computer that can
interact at the real world this one is
pretty good
and a device that runs a single program
that cannot extend things like adding
memory but able to capture input and
control outputs with a physical world
which was pretty much exactly what he
said so and then this Chris said it's a
really annoying manager who's insecure
about his knowledge of your abilities so
the gist of it is you can buy really
cheap hardware I don't know if you guys
have something like dollar store you buy
a little like toy that maybe just lights
up that's all it does that's got a
separate little micro controller you
don't need a full computer for that and
all that's doing is maybe when you press
one button it's lighting up this toy
that's not like the simplest levels well
maybe maybe maybe it's okay you guys
here we go again all right so here's the
fun thing we'll go over this is a
Arduino this is similar to a Raspberry
Pi they're an open-source embedded
microcontroller computer so soldering
was involved in this so I figured this
was not going to be a soldering class so
I soldered all this stuff before before
I go deep into anything else I just want
to give you guys a basic overview this
is just a unity and I have it connected
to a pen pen 3 which I am triggering and
ground that is the only thing I'm doing
on this and I have it connected through
a script through Arduino so if it'll
play I figured I wasn't gonna bring a
bunch of LEDs up here because that's not
nearly as exciting but this is just the
basic to start so I'm just connecting my
script through unity and connecting it
through a comport which is just through
USB and it's saying hey computer I'm
telling you to do something and that
something is turn on the light and you
set your pin high and low simple what's
fun
that type of I know that turning on an
LED or a hello world is not like very
exciting but when there is no
documentation on what you're doing and
you figure out how to make it work
turning on like something a simple LED
is like it works I got it and then you
can move on to a task that's more
complicated another thing that I have
been using unity for is 3d printing I
have an obsession with 3d printing you
can take your model that you make in a
computer and you can physically create
that object and if you're not like a
very artistic person that's an amazing
thing because I can't draw a line
straight line without the use of
computer so a lot of games we all you we
have art and assets and all that fun
stuff this is um just a little game and
I just put this little Pacman guy in
here just so you could get an idea but
the same type of file and model that is
used in game is the same type of asset
that you can 3d print so I kind of went
and I was like if you can have some way
to connect between your your game your
model and your printer all you have to
do is just import your Autodesk files if
you're not an artist there are assets
already on the asset store and you can
3d print these same mall all it does is
it imports directly into your project as
you can see he's there
he has no texture but then you 3d print
it and here it is so if y'all want to
see but this is done on a resin on a
form 2 printer but you guys can pass it
around but it's a solid object is the
exact same model that is used in the
game and I was able just to download and
connect it and print off my model so
this is another one this is a Bluetooth
it is a Lego conductive bricks and it is
uh do you guys ever know the clap on
clap off like the sound sensor so that's
the same thing as you could hear it I
actually do have that with me so you
guys can play with
after actually we can see if it'll have
the brick okay
so clock really loud oh oh we forgot to
break hang on we forgot to break you
have to complete the circuit oh he has
the bricks over there good well no we
need another break because it so the
circuit is not complete so it won't but
will be I brought all this stuff you
guys can play with this one okay so
unity scrips unity uses mono which you
got opinions about mono I think everyone
does but there's still whenever it's
compiling and unity has its own
implementation then it's trying to
standardize that mono so that's why when
you build once your game can deploy to
multiple consoles or devices they have
been a little behind on their dotnet
they just updated I think in 2000 17.1 I
think they're up to you know four point
six for net so you can create your own
scripts and those will compile as well
they this is what I was talking about
they use the common the CIL so when you
run your unity game and your project
your code is being executed it's not
your c-sharp that's being executed it's
their own assembly bytecode there's
other things like the RFID and NFC so
Lego dimensions uses that if you guys
have kids or adults like me to play that
and they're just tiny little discs and
they actually interact with a just a
gamepad that's connected to you know
your Xbox or your console so that piece
of hardware is not one of their
deployment I know they are a specialty
program and device but the NFC and RFID
are extremely common
I was able to get some of the NFC this
is just an Arduino and a shield so if
you ever have a badge when you go into
your office or like a keycard or
anything or like me I have a NFC implant
in my hand so I was able to well the
first thing I tried to do is scan this
little guy and see if I could read the
tag data and write it to my hands so
whenever I would put it on the card it
would recognize and it would pull up and
then I could say I am Batman
but they have a little bit of security
so it's I mean just because I got an
implant in my hand and because you can
but so they do have a little bit of
security on this you know this game pad
that they have created where this stuff
is not quite as safe but still fun all
right um
since you mentioned Raspberry Pi and
Arduino they're both very similar
they're both open source projects I do
have a few other thing if you have other
ones to give you all and their IDE so um
since this is not one of the standard
platforms that unity actually supports
they don't include those libraries so we
can use a serial port though which is
through any like micro USB that's just
saying the computer saying hey I'm
telling you to do something and if you
see something called baud rate that's
just the speed of rate for transfer
these are all of my schematics and
there's PCB layouts so if you guys
wanted to print out your boards those
are all on the github link so this is a
wiring diagram I think this is probably
one of the most intimidating things to
people that our software it's like what
happens if you put you know five volt
and ground well find out but make sure
you're in somewhere that's fire safe
because that stuff does happen okay so I
don't know if anyone around recognizes
this this source code there is this guy
that goes around and find source code
from
and tries to figure out what the actual
code is from so this is from the very
first Iron Man movie when he's trapped
in the cave and he's trying to build the
suit of armor to get out this is the
suit he made and this was the source
creed that was showed this is actually
from a Lego Mindstorm brick so Lego that
means Iron Man is pretty much like
powered by Lego which makes that amazing
but Lego all of their code is open
source as well and it's just a kernel of
Linux so if you want anything to work
for between unity I've had some that
success and I'll show that demo at the
end but that's that's fun little fact
let's go see it again so that was the
Lego Mindstorm
so kind of going over some examples for
your serial communication I guess the
biggest thing in unity when you tell
something wake up and hi that's saying
should I always listen for this event
you're trying to compare to if it's how
you've done in games hey I'm always
listening for this device to press this
button so the problem though with some
of these little microcontrollers and
these boards is their memory so if
you're always pulling for some type of
device then something like this can
crash so you all you really want to do
is recognize hey when this is pressed
down I'm gonna do something so instead
and if you've done anything it's not
like you have a computer where it's you
know you have a ton of memory nope so
that's just a little example of what not
to do and this is just kind of my thing
whenever you do your button trigger
events your data press down I don't know
I usually just put it on new line
because we're not monsters but let's see
so for serial input these so unity has
their their scripts which is just your
c-sharp script all you do is you said
you use it in Visual Studio you don't
have to use mono you can import any of
those scripts into unity and you can
tell it what to do
so this is just telling us hey we need
to open a serial event to connect to our
device so these are some ideas kind of
that people have gone and done simple
lighting up LEDs which doesn't seem very
exciting in itself but they actually
make these Lego bricks that light up and
LEDs work the same so actually have
another one it's a 3d printed it still
has supports but if somebody wants this
yes yes three different it'd like I
think you got one measure temperature
photocell motors Bluetooth the es
esp8266 those are IOT boards
those are pretty standard so if you have
any projects that you want to work on
I'd be curious do you guys have anything
that you'd like to interface with with
unity I'm always curious kind of like
what people are doing ya know all right
so what would you do so the that little
proton the one that's like if they're
five dollars I think or maybe they're a
little bit more than that but you can
run I believe view for you on that which
is like an AR I have some strong
feelings about them though after their
free version I think they charge you
it's like a penny per database call and
it's yeah it's pretty pricey yeah so
okay so this is what I was talking about
for for what they're using for film and
this is really interesting to me because
I really like costumes and cosplay
projects and you spend so much time
making some of these costumes did you if
anyone's all the jungle book all of
those care like the
Tigers and everything all that was done
in unity as well and this is for oats to
do the same people I was talking about
that did district 9 in chappy so they're
going in there making their real
costumes and they're going in and
they're taking pictures and scanning
them and you know simulating this fabric
and then they're importing all of this
into unity and it's cutting down you
know their entire I guess I think he
said they're able to graphically like
compute all of those geometry and that's
that's what's makes that amazing this is
not something that unity had supported
and this is they were like alright the
you know we're spending this much time
on development for an artist to go in
there and create you know a texture or
do the physics for something like this
that's moving and they're like why can't
we just scan it out of a real costume
and be able to go in there so it's
pretty cool and they actually brought at
Unity unite they brought some of the
costumes up there so you could see so in
that detail is pretty sweet okay
so this is something kind of was a big
deal when we worked on the first Thor
game was the Cape
so in movies or animation you can
control whatever the the animation needs
to do but in a game when your character
is moving to the right or to the left
that's controlled by a player that is a
real-time so the amount of geometry and
having to cache all of that data for
Thor escape was a pretty intensive
process probably more so than we thought
it was gonna be and that's what makes
something like scanning those images of
those people and bringing in that
simulation is that's what makes that
beneficial there's another game that's
coming out it's called cyberpunk 2077 I
believe it's the same people that are
doing the witcher 3 and they're actually
going in and you know they're scanning
their model and they're doing all their
animation
and they're rigging post post-production
using I believe they have their own
engine but it's the same concept so you
can see here where they're going in and
doing that all right now the fun stuff
oh also I will be at PubCon trying to
make jokes
so that's on Friday I believe all right
so let's do the fun stuff so I don't
need the mic yeah can you hold the mic
you want to be my assistant okay hope I
don't break or you can talking tell
jokes okay so this is a little Lego
Mindstorm motor that I had I had
disconnect and I through unity so
whenever you trigger an event and unity
I'll try not to like actually so that to
me it was pretty fun so when you trigger
the event in the game it actually will
trigger the motor and it's just as
simple it's just you know turning the
rotation of a motor the motor it doesn't
have to be a Lego Mindstorm but I like
Lego stuff so and actually shoot it's
like pretty far maybe
oh no well if we never find the little
balls that's okay I lost them at the
hotel too I don't want to like bump
anyone
all right so if you want to play with
that you can I'm trying to think okay so
I'll put up all the slides and some of
the source code and the asset projects
um trying to think what else yeah feel
free to bother me on on Twitter and the
Internet's yeah but if it wants to come
play with this you're more than welcome
to if you can find all that there's one
it'll be like golf you have to go find
the ball though I have a little I have a
few little Pakman too if you guys want
them that I 3d print it alright any
questions I know it's like a wide range
of things all right
as far as like Arduino and like that
kind of stuff mm-hmm
yeah so that's kind of like the thing
there's a few I've seen one guy on
YouTube that has a few tutorials for
Arduino so I think the biggest thing is
you probably should understand like how
serial communication works there's also
things like like I Square C do you know
anything about any of that kind of stuff
so I think if you understand that and
you have a firm grasp of that all you're
doing for your Arduino code like the one
for the led you're just saying hey Syd
set this pin high and unity is saying
hey I see a vent event was triggered
don't overwhelm yourself because I think
if you're going in and you try to like
do everything at once and then nothing
works especially with hardware you know
software developers I think we think
like we can solve everything with
software and then you realize oh if it
doesn't have power I can't even turn it
on look at our dwee nose webpage they
have like basic tutorials the one that
I've had the most success with for unity
is the uno so there's a few other
versions and I'm not exactly sure what
the difference were or why people had
problems but I would start with the uno
yes there there is one others one guy he
doesn't actively support it and I did
download it it's free it is called it's
called Rd Rd unity or Arduino or
something and it's free but when you
start to go look at the Arduino script
and if you understand what it's doing
you can you can do that on your own
because all the stuff he has is very
very simple at least as far as I mean
you're not going and making like Lego
dimensions with that well be my kind of
thing there is there is a guy who has
open-source hardware for the ev3 like R
that's supposedly supposed to work with
unity
I couldn't get it to work they have you
have to install like their actual
software and not Lego software as well
as the I think you need some a SIM card
on it yeah look at our do we know and
look yeah look you can look on the unity
asset store there is the one it's free
like I said that guy does not support it
though what else is there there's not
much and that kind of like makes it
difficult it's like where do you post
like where do you post the stuff that
you've found so like all these little
projects I like played around with it's
like you just hope that someone is
googling and comes up and it's trying to
do the same thing that you do we had an
issue when at our work we were trying to
find something and we went to Google and
we couldn't we there's one per tand that
had the same question and we're like
this is amazing and there's actually an
answer look in the forum it was somebody
else on our team that had answered it so
it's things like that I think the
biggest thing thank you I think the
biggest thing games aren't really
open-source and we don't share because
it's you make money so like when I
worked at Marvel the biggest the biggest
thing there was brandishing it's like
the Hulk wears purple pants the Hulk
always wears purple pants so when the
game was ready the trailer was ready for
III but the game the movie trailer was
not ready and the movie has first rights
to show new costumes to show new you
know shields hammers whatever and that I
mean they're worried about brandish
surance that's that's their biggest
thing I think maybe there's still some
interesting I put this until Disney
bought them making games so if you're
going to share any of your coat and
you're gonna put your code on github
like you've an open-source project
there's things you got to think about if
you have art assets that you may be paid
for in the unity asset store you got to
be
careful you gotta make sure that other
person is able to download those assets
you have to make sure they're able to
access everything on your project that's
what makes that kind of hard I don't
have anyone ever played Zork it was like
an old text adventure game from like 88
and they actually released the source
code for that you know 30-something
years later and that's kind of neat but
no one's actively keeping up with that
game anymore so they're not making money
on that and that's something that you
know I feel like I don't quite have the
answer for as far as like open source
open source games like how and where do
you support that so any other internship
yes
so he asked he said they have a CGI
assets that they use a company and he
was asking if they can be imported into
unity so do you do you know what program
they use so there is so the a lot of the
CGA like programs that they use you can
import into unity it just depends on the
file the unity has something called
unity connect where you can find an
artist that knows how to use unity so we
if we are going to outsource like an
artist or something it's like hey we
needed this to work with unity we don't
want to spend 10 hours of our day trying
to figure out how to import this model
in here and get the animation there they
give you a package you import that
package and it works so that's the thing
an artist or an animator or somebody
that does shaders that's specifically
for unity but unity supports like all
the Autodesk so that's the little Pacman
that i 3d printed that's an Autodesk
product so you can export that file as
an STL and that STL is what a 3d printer
understands that translates to g-code or
something like that
yeah but depending on a program yeah you
can alright next questions anything goes
Yes No maybe so I have more things to
give away
yes so he asked how to use like the the
physics in unity to communicate like to
communicate with something that's like
in the real world so the little launcher
guy so this motor only has a rotation of
360 degrees so if you're having say you
have something that has a camera on it
and you want your camera to look up and
down well if you don't have a servo on
that little camera you can't look up and
down you're only limited to what your
what your hardware can do
yeah I'm trying to think if you do any
type of like launcher so you're trying
to recognize if it hits the target you
could always use they have sensors that
measure your depth or how close you are
to objects as well
you should look Arduino has one and it
supports the their a distance sensor yes
yes yes you could use it they're pretty
accurate too and if you use them with
Arduino they're I mean they work really
well I mean for a cheap little like what
else are you trying to do so you want to
recognize the distance in between so we
kind we kind of ran into that too and
it's like do you calculate that are you
reading the data from the hardware to
unity or do you read the you know you
send the data to the device from unity
because you have to worry about two
things like latency with that so are you
gonna be doing like wireless or
bluetooth
yeah so there's some fun things with
that I've also seen some people try to
take and build a unity like an apk which
is like for Android and run like a
flavor and run that on a Raspberry Pi I
don't know like the success for that we
had prototype stuff and we used like
onboard Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi and we had
issues with like doesn't like frequency
of devices in a room so not so much like
just band it's like you know all these
devices in the same little area you're
on the same Channel and you can't even
