all right let's let's kick it off
Windows 10 IOT core or corny so when I
send in his abstract I wrote corneille
so I was like me I wonder if that word
has a meaning so I looked it up and it
actually mean in the urban dictionary
actually defined it it's the wrong
spelling of the word corny but the NDC
was nice enough to actually correct my
spelling so thank you for that now a
good man once told me that when you're
giving a talk you don't really get no
big moment you don't get plot twists you
are not Steven Spielberg you don't get
to have your big surprise moment stuff
like that so if you have something to
say say it up front and then prove it so
Windows 10 IOT core or corny and I would
like to say that Windows 10 IOT core is
the corneas product that I have come
apart from Microsoft for a while and I'd
like to prove it but I also like to
prove that we are to blame the
developers we've created something for
it that has made it a corny product and
we the awesome developers can remove a
lot of these problems we can make it a
better product we can stop it from being
a problem and actually have some some
benefits from it but I'd like to start
to do is a little bit demonstration what
we can do with the platform so we all
know what we're talking about since
normally people don't have that much
experience with Windows 10 IOT core so
when you've installed your witness
tonight ecori the first thing you are
going to see is a you're going to log
into port 8080 of the IP address of your
Raspberry Pi or whatever platform that
you choose to run Windows 10 IOT core on
and you can see this menu this is
actually quite extensive you can do a
lot of stuff with this you can see what
apps you have installed here you so you
can have a lot of demos that i could
start i can run them and do all startups
so it's actually quite easy to
manipulate the Raspberry Pi and winners
tonight of course stuff from the menu in
the menu system you also have a crude
file explorer you
going you can navigate through the
documents and stuff like that you can
hit up the look at the processes that
carrying kill processes run processes do
all that sort of stuff see what's taking
the most cpu power and all that you can
actually do some performance testing you
can do see how much CPU do we have like
we're not using almost anything we can
so we can watch a lot of that stuff but
what we also can do here is activate and
you're going to want to do this so this
is probably the first thing you're going
to want to do when you write out the Box
installs your raspberry PI's go in and
start the visual studio remote debugger
because if you're going to write code
using visual studio you want to be able
to step through the code like we always
do and write C sharp apps and if we go
in and activate this as soon as we
deploy we deploy to device we're going
to demonstrate we can just deploy there
and it will will take care of it for us
we can step the code see how it's
executing through the microprocessor
through the Raspberry Pi and also
Microsoft has a lot of stuff around this
like the e TV is the event tracking and
all that stuff but I'm not going to go
into that it's a sport of an advanced
thing what I'm going to talk to you
about is this this is the devices so
under the device tab we have the default
controller driver and the default
control the driver is is kind of strange
because initially you will have the
inbox driver and so if you go into this
tab and actually change to the direct
memory mapped driver you will enable
something called the Lightning drivers
and the big difference here is speed
lightning drivers are much faster than
the original drivers the original
drivers can come up to something like 5
kilohertz if you if you simply switch
them on and off and the lightning
drivers can speak in actual megahertz
which is really useful i'm going to
demonstrate why in a little while so
that's something you going to want to do
you're going to go in and ingest oops
and activate the direct memory map
drivers under the device tab then you
just have the regular device think even
adjust audio volume you can see
bluetooth versions and all sorts of
stuff like that
the growing is update yay and something
that you also might want to have check
out is the remote so let's say that you
have a big screen somewhere connect that
your Windows 10 device or perhaps you
have a raspberry pi that is far away
from you so Microsoft wrote an app you
can enable this and you will be able to
get the Raspberry Pi screen into this
app so it will stream the screen into
your apps you can have a headless
display you can put a Raspberry Pi
somewhere and you can actually see the
screen and see how the app works on the
Raspberry Pi so that's also kind of nice
now one of the things with web
frameworks like this like if we don't
want to administrate 100 raspberry PI's
or hundred systems on the web we don't
want to do that we want to use something
a little bit better we want to use SSH
so we can actually well I want
demonstrates ah alright let's do this
instead done by
there we go okay so we can actually ssh
into so it's a Raspberry Pi with Windows
10 9 at the core supports ssh so we can
use secure shell to access our Raspberry
Pi this supports a number of commands
like you can do you can you ping can do
this is basically a all the regular
commands that you remember that you can
do you can add you can use net user
maybe we count maybe we don't have
internet here now you don't have
internet okay so beginning is paying you
can all those sort of things you can try
your connections and you can run scripts
so you can run scripts and all that so
you can do a lot of configuration very
quickly like you can set you can set
default names and all that stuff so I
think you can do that the problem with
this facility though is that it doesn't
actually have some of the commands are
with exe some are not it doesn't feel
like it's actually quite prepared like
for example I would just assume that i
could type ping and i can but i cannot
type i think it was like that stance
wasn't no i could type in that stance
trace or something but some of the
commands are not available to you
without the dot exe extension which kind
of gets annoying in time if you know
what I'm saying but one of the strong
parts one of the really really strong
parts for windows tonight of course
visual studio so I am demonstrating
Windows 10 IOT core I'm running visual
studio and I'm doing it on a mac you
know is X get a lot of the new microsoft
right so the standard solution here if
you want to add something new let's do
that let's add a new app and get zooming
in a little while don't worry so we add
a new project and right out of the box
you don't actually have that much
regarding let's get rid of you and let's
do like
let's zoom in so we don't actually have
that much so normally you will not have
this tab the Windows 10 IOT core tab
this will not be visible to you you will
not have the ability to build more than
the regular universal app but Windows 10
IOT core runs Windows universal app so
we can deploy a Windows universal app to
the Raspberry Pi so let's do that let's
start there demo for awesome people so
this is still a regular Windows 10 IOT
core app we could run it on Windows 10
we could deploy to the App Store and
have it run all that sort of stuff but
we can also give it okay so here we have
it we can also give it the possibilities
to interact with ion gpio devices so
there are these Windows IOT extensions
for universal Windows platform and the
Raspberry Pi support this and you just
like when you're writing mobile apps in
the Windows Phone developers here all
right so when you're trying to check
dust my phone have a camera you can do
the same thing with a UV p app you can
check do I have a GPIO output and it
will give you true or false and then you
can kind of build your code in that I'm
going to show that a little minute but
so we simply add that to the system and
we're good to go so this this can now be
deployed by going to here and doing ok
and go into device okay let's see what
that won't
go into device then you need to also
configure your device you can do that
properties debug then you need platform
time or a RM so you can have to build it
for a RM and you get to do it too all
right there we go demo for awesome
people device and that's about it then
you can actually deploy it to your
Raspberry Pi IOT core hopefully so does
this is actually a very powerful thing
would be in a static or that we can do
this stuff but oops you cannot do that
why can we not do that
alright let's look at that later it's
not important right now what we can do
with this all we need is an IP address
so we can put it anywhere in the network
we can deploy to it directly the thing
is though that let's say that we want to
do something really really simple like
manipulate the the GPIO port so what
we'll do for this is the first of all we
need to initiate the GPIO and the GPIO
is the pins on the Raspberry Pi that we
want to talk to we want to actually have
TTL levels plus 4 plus 3.3 volts to
control stuff and the GPIO controller
when we do get default of sync would be
no if we do not actually have a GPIO
controller so that's very very simple to
do tests or do I have the possibility to
do this and stuff like that now a lot of
people do this like their first app and
they remember from when they would talk
microprocessor programming in school so
they do while true and then do is do
some work to do something for because
that's how they learn microprocessor
program is like we're not working with a
microprocessor anymore working with
highly advanced computer so there are
better ways to do this nowadays you can
go in and actually do this would a timer
that's one way to do it so timer here we
just regular thread pool timer will give
us a tick where we can actually do work
with the Raspberry Pi and actually
putting up these levels it's just a pin
right compared to to a read and doing
the reeds it's also just a
straightforward let me show you yeah
like this but you do not use while loops
anymore because in the modern world we
don't have to do reads anymore because
we can hook up event handlers two
buttons so previously when we were doing
while through read from button X okay if
it gives us a value do this but now we
can put
eventhandler it's connected to your
buttons so our physical buttons is no
different than our actual would be in a
web forms applications back in God knows
when with me so Microsoft have built
quite a powerful thing now like I told
you you don't actually have that much to
build you only have regular windows
universal apps to build for this but I
don't know why but you have to actually
go through extensions and updates and
install a package called Windows 10 IOT
core tooling so here we go windows are
at the core product templates now if you
install this you will get a whole
barrage of new tools let me show you
so when you install that the first thing
you get is this menu option called
Windows 10 IOT core which contains the
c-sharp background application for IOT
now this is called a headless app so
this means it hasn't doesn't have a
display it's just a background task
doing work you're probably going to be
using these if you can start developing
using the Windows 10 IOT core because
several background tasks will be doing
jobs for you while you have a UI that
performs the the interaction with the
user but what you're also going to get
and this is what I like the most about
this new system that they built if
you're going to get some C++ stuff
you're going to get where it stands all
right
alright with those so going to get this
Windows 10 IOT core option here for c++
where you also have the background
application you have the regular uvp
application if you want to write in C++
but you also have this so how many hair
have used Arduino how about fifty
percent so this allows us to take our
Dean of code and run it directly as a
background tasks in the Raspberry Pi on
Windows 10 IOT core and there is no
difference is fully compatible with the
RG know right wiring language so you can
take Arduino code and put it directly on
the net yes I'm sorry one more time okay
so the question is if this includes like
the time and sensitivity and if you can
get the same kind of timing on the
Raspberry Pi to get on our you know and
the answer is actually yes if you enable
the Lightning drivers without the
Lightning drivers you will not have the
speed you can get an Arduino but if you
enable the lighting drivers you actually
have more speed and better speed you can
get up to like five megahertz or
something like that so so that's pretty
good so this is like the rough things
you can do we know that the court you
can run one googly app at the time you
can install apps and run apps and you
can run a lot of background taxes many
background task you want until this
machine start going slowly so let's go
back and start talking about why is
Windows 10 IOT core actually corny
a couple years ago I got a really
strange job and it's called by company
that works by they actually make all
their money by changing toilet paper and
soap in public bathrooms they make
millions doing this so they have a
service is your company pays the money
and they make sure that you always have
a fresh bathroom that's their core
business that's what they do and they
had decided to build an IOT device they
decided to build an IOT device that
would tell them how much toilet paper
they were consumed in any given bathroom
anywhere in the world that they had
customers they would do this because
they had statistics they had statistics
that could show them that okay they're
using this much toilet paper that means
that we need to replace that and we need
to place soap and we need to do this
many hours of cleaning and they could do
very much of that automatically or so
they thought now I was calling to
consult because one of my old friends
works at this company and he said well
the developers just came back with a
solution it looks nice works well but
when we're going to install it they say
it's going to cost $1,500 a device and
he was shocked the original toilet paper
dispensers that they put up costs five
dollars there's a 1495 dollar difference
and he didn't like that he liked it also
he called me up and said could you come
over I'll pay your regular fees and you
can look at it and just tell me if they
did something wrong okay okay sir so I
cited this conference room with this
nice developers have built this and they
demonstrated the product and it worked
nicely and everything in and that's
about it so they left me to it and
what's going to look at it and look nice
and but you know you're my Harbor guys I
started taking apart who what is this I
wonder how that work oh that's really
nice mechanics to actually calculate how
much the toilet paper is going out and
then is this a raspberry pi
they put a Raspberry Pi in a device that
were meant to be put in thousands of
places I mean that's a five that's a
fifty dollar investment but the problem
also was that you couldn't run this on
battery even if people came here every
other day you cannot run a Raspberry Pi
on battery power that long it's
impossible oh well we could but they
would have that a car battery to it it
just defeats the purpose of having our
units which meant that for every
installation they had to call an
electrician to join them come up give
them a power socket in a bathroom by the
way to connect the Raspberry Pi to which
of course was very very expensive and
not very useful all right so now are you
thinking they're idiots right you're
thinking it to see it new now the
raspberry pi is a very rapid prototyping
tool you can do things that you cannot
do in C in C or C++ really really
rapidly using the built-in like the wire
ring building system is really really
great because you can take examples from
the internet it's pasted in and get it
to run and refactor it later because you
know that if soon as you can get
something out your marketing so they can
look at it you can get feedback over in
business we're doing agile stuff we're
doing things we're getting feedback word
prototyping we're building a product and
the witness the 90 core for me that is
where I want it to be I want it to be
this awesome rapid prototyping tool and
that's also kind of the coin in part
because not being marketed as a rapid
prototype which was being marketed as
they catch all super device and we have
accepted it like that so basically it's
our fault so I don't think they were
dumb I don't think they were dumb at all
because I remember I remember my one of
my first Jobs had his developer it was
called Dan
man was super smart he was at all the
hackathons he won all the hackathons he
was at all the user groups he ruled all
the user groups he was the king of C++
development he could write drivers do
everything and I was so impressed by
this guy I was like 18 years old I was
really impressed with him I mean one day
his company the manager his company cost
me up on the phones hi hi yeah you know
Dan tells me that you're a really good
programmer you know you you know when
you're your childhood Idols of what yeah
yeah it said it said that wow that's
amazing thank you thank you very much
and but you've got to come and work for
us yeah yeah I'd love to come work for
you because I was so I was so happy then
sir yeah yeah yeah sure absolutely we
were going to build a switchboard
actually dad has a build a switchboard
but they want to help taking care of it
taking care of that software so I draw
up that his office until was a beautiful
summer day I was 18 I had a job I had a
job making a lot of money i was going to
program with some of the best people i
came up to this this big building would
have had all the developers and all the
technology and all the hardware and all
the cool stuff and i met dan in a
conference room and said yes really
happy you want to come and work with us
in this project and he showed me all the
hard would have rolled in C++ and C and
and then he came and yeah and here's our
pbx system they were wrote in visual
basic 6 point what this was I'm not that
old this was in the year 2000 a visual
basic 6.0 what Fred pbx are you insane
but I we started talking they told me
not our today's project as a consultant
I wasn't hired here when I started here
and the manager new series with visual
basic 6.0 so he asked me to write the
software in visual basic so he could see
how it worked and perhaps take care of
it himself now over time the project
grew and became actually very very big
having millions of customers or
thousands of customers having millions
of money a lot of money coming in
and Dan got hired and wanted to rewrite
the software do you think he got to do
that it worked Kenna and I remember this
story when I talked to the developers
because I realized how would happen so I
went back to the board of directors and
said all right guys we need to replace
this raspberry pi that runs Windows 10
IOT core and they told me why would we
do that when the product we use even got
IOT in the name people are mistaken they
think that the internet of things are
hardware devices they don't think of
this huge global network of connected
devices to communicate in many different
types of fashions and we the developers
if you want to build this great cool
thing called in their thing so we want
to match to build stuff like this using
raspberry PI's for whatever we need to
make sure that people understand that
proof of concept it's just that it's
nothing more nothing less I mean
Microsoft isn't even pushing Windows 10
IOT core in a Raspberry Pi that much
they are doing it but not that much as a
hardware platform for building regular
hardware stuff this is the pitch the
first time I heard it for window found
out of the core I'm going to read it for
in case you can't read the Windows 10
IOT core is a version of Windows 10 that
is optimized for smaller devices with or
without of this play the runs on
Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 aero dragon board
for 20 °c and manova board max Windows
10 IOT core utilizes the rich extensible
universal Windows platform uvp API for
building great solutions that sounds
like a marketing pitch for MVC right not
a hardware device Microsoft gets that
but we don't so mean so many people
they're smart hardware people yeah we
built in a raspberry pi why because we
built the prototype there and it's a
prototype was all we had
for me the windows tonight decor is
superb at exactly one thing more than
being a rapid prototyping tool and i use
it for this all the time i used to feel
gateways didn't anyone know what I feel
gateways so when you talk about IOT you
talk about gateways talk about field
gateways and talk about devices so
devices and hook it up to feel gateways
and the field gateways are basically the
internals of your network the the
external port to the cloud services
because you you want to have the ability
to control your devices even if the
Internet's down you want to have
something in the way but you also and I
think in the future are going to want to
control what information is available in
your location and what leaves it let's
let's give our an example of this so
we're building an IOT device you know
four billion ft device and we have a
house and in this house we know if the
doors are locked or not would you like
to tell us somebody if the doors were
locked or not would we like to tell our
neighbors if the doors are locked we
wouldn't there's circular information as
information we want to keep inside our
systems and I preferred if they didn't
even ever go in now would prefer if it
couldn't go on the internet like it to
be separated from the internet and I'd
like however to know if somebody goes
and checks my door handle they are in
the doors locked I'd like to tell my
neighbors but like my neighbor's house
and my house to be able to communicate
and say hey somebody else pulled my
handle hey somebody please pull my
handle two and then three holes go yeah
somebody pulled my handle really hard
and it's inside my house and kind of
figured out that a maybe we should alarm
somebody but maybe the rest of the world
doesn't need to know that maybe we don't
want to tell that to cloud service or
maybe we don't want to share with with
all of our slow that somebody was
pulling at our doors because our
neighborhood drunk again and couldn't
find the right house
but we need to think about this stuff
because this is where the winners
tonight the core is really really good
because that's built in MQTT is that
stuff it can take an entire array of
MQTT devices in a location take all that
data aggregate it put the good stuff to
a cloud service like IOT hub or abs or
stuff like that and then keep the other
parts you can communicate with perhaps
open hub or something like that inside
your house and control the things three
important to you make sense but I mean
windows tonight the core isn't the only
platform for this I mean Windows 10 IOT
core is is one of two major platforms
for raspberry pi and for most of the
field Yates was tough the other one is
lynyrd so let's talk a little bit about
linux versus Windows 10 IOT core and
Linux is an almost every platform you
cannot find device almost today that is
a computer in some way they can't run
linux and i think windows is trying to
catch up that's that's the whole idea
what Windows 10 like they're trying to
be on so many devices and many people
think that you can't run Windows 10 IOT
core and anything else the Raspberry Pi
me know vinyl and drag on board and
stuff like that but that's actually not
true you can run the Windows 10 IOT core
on anything that has a 400 megahertz cpu
2 gigabytes of storage and to analyse
the Sikhs megabytes Aram but you're
going to have to work to get it there
because it doesn't have all the drivers
doesn't have all that stuff we can make
it run linux on the other hand if you
look at for example debian oh yeah but
i'm sorry forgot about that it does need
to have some of the modern pentium
supports like you need to have a
physical addicts extensions no it's no
execute and streaming seeing the
extensions you need to have all this
stuff and no execute that's the process
if you feature for marketing like
non-executable stuff so you can have
some security things and that's just the
requirement from Microsoft since windows
8 and it helps us not to get buyers as
not to get get attacked
computers now linux on the other hand a
if you look at Debian it says it needs a
1 gigahertz processor says it needs one
gigabyte of storage and it says it needs
128 megabytes ROM so that's why I put it
here I don't believe them I brand linux
on 386 machines around lenox don't run
debian and 386 machines but we're
talking about the latest versions so
fine and that may may require this but I
mean Linux is a very versatile software
compared to windows tonight the core and
I think if you would compare what they
need to run linux would win every day of
the week over Windows 10 IOT core
horribly bad slide alright so Windows 10
IOT core wash a very very slow system
especially for a GPIO stuff I like bit
banging I like reverse engineering
things I like taking protocols and
making them do things they were not
designed to do and that usually calls
for a lot of bit banging and trying to
actually do stuff with communication
devices and micro processors and four
and thirty three main transmitters we
couldn't do that with Windows 10 IOT
core now when they released the arginine
wiring protocol stuff and the Lightning
drivers we can actually get up to six
megahertz with that which is plenty so
now we can suddenly do all that stuff
but it's still very very very much
slowly so it's only one-fourth of how
fast you can make linux run with Debian
on see on the raspberry pi guess
raspberry pie with debian can get 22
megahertz I don't know why you need that
but it still faster on the other hand
six megahertz is enough so maybe it's
okay maybe it's good enough for maybe
we'll get even faster drivers in the
future but at the moment Linux is the
fastest one when it comes to gpio
handling and of course if we're looking
at device drivers I mean I was trying to
count how many network cards that Linux
support it
just get tired there's there's lists
upon lists upon lists upon lists and
this basically if you can buy it in a
store it will work with linux today
Windows 10 IOT core supports 7 which is
a nuisance because you actually have to
check thus this support my platform is
this okay for my platform and you're
doing prototyping which I think the
windows 10 I the core is that's a
hindrance I do not wish to have a
problem with Hardware I just want to
work with us is such a big company that
this should not have been a problem to
tell some intern right a hundred device
drivers it's good do it I mean this
shouldn't be a problem it should not be
a problem and even Bluetooth devices I
mean bluetooth is a big part of an IOT
system it's getting even bigger and
Windows 10 IOT core supports three
Bluetooth devices Linux has 25
officially supported bluetooth bluetooth
objects and over 50 that is supported as
they say not one hundred percent but
supported mostly and it's growing all
the time this is just for Debian this is
probably the thing that has annoyed me
the most working with Winston at the
core is the fact that a lot of the stuff
just doesn't work even the bill I mean
Windows 10 IOT core is advocating that
we work on Raspberry Pi three but by the
way the Bluetooth don't it's just that's
something that I would have expected to
work on the system now there are no
silver bullets I know that I prefer
linux / windows when our building
professional hardware stuff i'm going to
give you that if I have to choose today
there's still too much kind of jobs
there's it's too much hassle to navigate
around some of the problems some of the
shortcomings of the platform so i use it
for field gateways because rocks at that
it's quick to deploy these bug has a
built-in MQTT support so it's just
awesome at that and I use a sure for my
RT hub so of course C sharp and I at the
hub and that's the case like married to
each other's they work perfectly but
apart from that I tend to use linux and
if you know a little bit of Linux I
would probably go with that for now and
I hope that Microsoft will make this
platform a little bit more mature and I
mean they are going for it there are
really really flirting with us they're
flirting with the makers the flirting
with the makers did want us to build
stuff with this they they're giving out
examples if you go to dev that microsoft
/ IOT there's so many examples of what
you can do with this platform you can
build robots you can bill example you
can build them length detectives you can
build magic mirrors and do all sorts of
cool stuff so somebody was asking me
yesterday my white ass we just want to
do with this and I think it's just
flirting with the makers they want to
have a make or platform and i'd like i'd
like to address that but there's a lot
of people was not no no no no there
there evil is microsoft they're doing
something bad to us there this must be
wouldn't it's a free product it works
reasonably well why should I have to do
something bad well there is no they're
not and then I actually stumble upon a
blog post that is the originator of why
is IOT core evil and and a lot of people
actually believe that windows tonight
decor is not released to be a make or
platform it is really you probably heard
this it is released to keep the windows
grip on all the ATMs around the world
have you heard that so there's a kind of
like a like an idea that Microsoft only
built the windows tonight at the core to
keep their 10 million ATMs running
windows not linux and and that's a very
interesting thing it also requires you
to not know that there is something
called Windows Embedded which is a
platform for atms mostly and it's quite
interesting that people miss that when
they're starting to you know
build conspiracy theories so that's
actually Windows 10 IOT core I wouldn't
recommend using it for anything
professional feel free to play with it
the Raspberry Pi in itself has a few
shortcomings that I think it's important
to mention one of them is actually power
handling so let's say that we're done
with everything we want to shut this
down and this is a new remote location
how do we start it again so this is a
premium platform for Microsoft and if I
shut this down now I have no way of
starting again I will have to physically
unplug the power and replug it this is a
premium platform this is the platform
that they are demonstrating the new core
cool operating system there is one way
which is sold during a reset button did
these two pins that you can see on
screen and if you short them out it will
actually boot up again so if you take it
down power mode you can actually boot it
up using those that's the only way that
I've found to actually do this without
having to do and which is just annoying
the Raspberry Pi in itself is otherwise
I think an ideal product for Microsoft
to do this stuff and I'm really happy
for to do it so science relating guys if
you have any questions feel free I have
about nine minutes left so we have a lot
of time for questions you want that if
you don't have any questions but like
beer you should attend pub conf which is
tomorrow and no saturday sorry so check
that out they wanted me to mention that
so thanks for listening guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
