site reliability 101 lightning talk mine
jejunum balda and i'm a site reliability
engineer for the property website domain
so stive right into it there's this one
thing about site reliability I'd like
for you to take away from this talk it's
that by using the idea of redundancy
you'll be able to build applications
that are more reliable and more
resilient to going wrong in
production but what do I mean exactly by
redundancy well take these presentation
slides as an example let's say as I was
setting them up before the talk
well the slides us I used an online
service called Prezi let's say that
website went down right before the talk
so most people would freak out how am I
meant to give the presentation if I
don't have any slides to show well just
in case that happened I prepared a
redundant copy of these slides one that
I could open up using the desktop app on
the slides so now all I have to do is
open up that offline copy and off I go
so taking that idea step further let's
say I go to open up that offline copy
and I get an error message saying sorry
couldn't open up your presentation well
now I'm really screwed right not only
can I not get to my slides I'm the
present on the Prezi website but the
offline copy I'd prepared just in case
weren't even open well just in case both
those things happened I prepared yet
another redundant copy of it
in PDF format so now all I have to do is
they're open up a PDF file why not have
all the same animations and look as nice
as their original versions but hey I've
got some slides to use so you might be
wondering how this applies to a real
website so let's take the domain home
page as an example
so we cache the domain homepage using
our CDN so that in the event our
back-end application goes down or we or
the yeah let's stick with that back-end
application goes down our end user could
still at least see a cache copy of that
home page and as another layer of
redundancy we also cache the home page
in the end-users web browser so that in
the event we say miss we miss configure
our CDN or their users having Internet
connectivity issues as long as they
visited the home page before they should
still be able to load it up so going
back to my original point there's just
one thing about site reliability I'd
like for you to take away from this talk
except by using redundancy you'll be
able to build applications that are more
reliable more resilient to things going
wrong in production and then in the
interest of keeping this a lightning
talk I'm gonna wrap it up here but if
you'd like to hear more I'll be giving a
more in-depth talk about how we do it in
domain right after this in room 4 so
hope to see you there thanks for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
