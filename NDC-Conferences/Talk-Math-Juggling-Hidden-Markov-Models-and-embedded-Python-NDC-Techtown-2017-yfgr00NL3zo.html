apologize
fine I even made the slides in English
so sorry that was nothing about habit
I'm not gonna start all over though
except that saying welcome okay good
very good
so what we're gonna do in this talk you
will see that there's a little deviation
from the program it's said that this
should be about math juggling and
fighting I think even something about
hidden Markov models and the reason that
I changed talk a little bit is that the
project I'm going to present has changed
a little bit over the half year since I
started so that's why these are going to
be the topics for today so why what is a
smart juggling ball why do we need a
smart juggling ball I like to juggle I
think it's great fun and I would like to
have a juggling ball that first of all
knows when it's being juggled and how
it's being juggled I would like to use
some kind of embedded electronics maybe
some software to kind of tell me when I
start juggling and what kind of juggling
I'm doing so this is definitely
something we are going to look into I
don't know why that won't switches off
so that's what we're going to talk about
what are we going to need to make a
smart juggling ball definitely gonna
need some math I'm gonna spend quite
some time today talking about math and
why do we mean need math well let's look
at a few juggling patterns together just
to kind of get us all going yeah
alexei legally okay okay oh okay
stop making is that better if I talk
like this okay cool I will take off this
thing it and get rid of the wires and
there we are okay thanks for letting me
know so I hope that you can still hear
me on the back row let's look into a few
juggling patterns and I think that if
some of you have tried to juggle two
juggling balls you have probably done
something like this or if you are
left-handed
maybe you juggle all the way but still
you juggle with two balls something like
this or if you're really courageous you
change the direction as your journaling
so one ball goes high and the other one
goes low and already we are starting to
talk about juggling and patterns and
throwing with a natural kind of language
so I say that you know there's a high
ball and there's a low ball which is
called much much faster so we can see
the nice throw a high ball
lowball goes really really fast to the
other hand and it has much more time
because one goes high takes time the low
ball goes really really fast so I have
time to do things with the low ball and
then I can start to do things like this
I can add the little throwback to the
same hand to make this go continuously
and a small throwback to the same hand
and throw to the other hand a high pole
this is a way for me to talk to you guys
because you understand English and you
understand this but you make computers
understand this we need to do something
a little bit more precise we need to
describe juggling in a different way
than using things like low to the same
hand or to the other hand and so on so
we need to kind of put juggling on a
solid mathematical fundament for to make
it able so that computers can start to
calculate things on this for us because
that's how you want to do in the long
run and I'm starting to get warm so I
can get rid of my beautiful scarf that's
good exactly so when we start to make
mathematics you're gonna need some kind
of starting point some kind of
assumptions about juggling and I'm gonna
do this now I'm gonna make my assumption
completely explicit and then we're gonna
apply some logic and out of this
assumption and the logic we're gonna
develop a complete entire mathematical
system of juggling is everybody familiar
with the term logic you know what logic
is I know I'm a guy a little bit
courageous in the Correa's he knows what
logic is so let's test him here I have a
little little candy it's a black and I
put it into one of my hands and I'm
gonna make two statements and your job
is to tell me where the candies
so first the candy is in one of my hands
it's in either of these hands there is a
candy and then the second statement the
candy is not in this hand you can know
somebody please apply some logic and
tell me where these candies and one
volunteers and then well no no I'm not
lying the statement are true so
definitely they are true so obviously
it's going to be in my right hand right
so you can take this one and eat it but
that was very easy can we try to do one
more a little bit more complicated
I have a black candy and a white candy
and a black candy I'm gonna need a
volunteer look and you just come up
start with me for a second and if you
just come here I'm gonna hide them and
nobody must see where they are okay okay
close your eye guys okay come here
closer huh oh okay that's fine that's
fine that's fine that's fine okay okay
close good then you come next to me
that's right
and now I'm gonna make a few more
statements there's a white candy and
there's a black candy and the white
candy is never next to an empty hand I
with made the white candy is never next
to a white hand and the two candies are
always in adjacent hand so there is no
empty hand in between them and then the
third statement is that this hand is
empty can no somebody please tell me
where is the black candy oh there's a
first guy on the left side on her right
hand her left okay so can you can you
can you come up any common point oh you
want me to repeat that's all they say or
can you please repeat the question
always always safe but okay so this hand
is empty the two candies are always in
adjacent hands hands that are next to
each other and the white candy is never
next to an empty hand no kin no please
tell me where the black one is in her
right hand yeah can you open a look oh
god you got it right perfect so then you
can give him the black candy and you
will have the white candy for coming up
thank you great so this is logic and
this is logic now we know that okay so
you're gonna start do have some
statements about juggling and then you
can apply logic and make a mathematical
system that's good let's do this
so these statements are sometimes in
mathematics referred to as axioms and
axiom is a statement about the world
which is always true can never be false
so that's why it's a good starting point
for using logic so or first kind of
thing that you're going to decide about
you're going is that we're going to
throw with alternating sounds left hand
right hand left hand right hand now we
could imagine that I would juggle in a
way in which I throw with both hands at
the same time but today we're only going
to talk about juggling which is
alternating left and right so this is
our first true statement about juggling
and the next one we only throw one ball
at a time in some times of juggling you
can do things like this you have two
balls in one hand and if you're good you
can throw them up with different height
this is called multiplexing today
normally duplexing only is throwing one
ball at the hand from one hand and one
ball at a time that is the second kind
of starting point or a kind of
guaranteed truth about juggling and the
third statement is an even rhythm when I
haven't even rhythm so I'm gonna try to
keep minam juggling try to have an even
beat as possible so it's a kind of
rhythm in everything I'm doing and
they're gonna be equally spaced in time
and if we have these three statements
all together we can start to apply over
logic and create what I think is a
really really beautiful model of
juggling any questions so far
everyone is happy okay that's good
everyone is happy awesome great so when
you have this kind of statement
alternating hands that even rhythm it
can lay out our hands in time so I will
say imaginative unit is the right hand
left hand right hand left hand and time
is going from this side towards the
right side and then we have our beat
kind of established in this little
drawing and then you can start to look
at different ways of throwing so here is
one way of juggling and one ball pattern
and it basically goes from my right hand
to my left and back then even rhythm and
what I'm doing here now is the same
thing you see drawn in the symbols on
the on the screen so this row is being
strong and then on the first subsequent
beat is being strong again so it has 1 1
1 are you guys with me so far yeah
that's good obviously we can start to
throw a ball in such a way that is being
thrown on the second subsequent beat so
I throw something from my right hand and
then I stroll something from my left
hand and then I throw the same ball
again from the right hand so this is
what you are seeing on the screen behind
me right now same rhythm same speed same
time between my throws as when I was
operating only with one ball except that
now I have two and of course so we can
go on and go on you know it
I throw a ball like this I need three
balls and each balls are going to be
thrown on each third subsequent stroke
and then it starts to look something
like this and then you are maybe curious
is it really true that the balls are
being thrown on each third throw so I
can replace these guys with some balls
in other colors and I think I have an
orange one and I have an orange one and
I have a yellow one and I can start to
do this like this and if you know start
to count you can count on the yellow so
because that 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
so they're being thrown each third beat
and of course they can do the same thing
with four balls and 5 volts and six
volts and so on I'm gonna do some for
maybe some five throws later but I'm
going to stop with three balls at the
same time and you can start to make some
observations already and that is that
when I stroke a ball that is going to be
thrown again after one or three or five
beats it is crossing hands it goes from
left to right or from right to left and
that makes sense because there are two
hands so if it can't be thrown on
everything every single throw it needs
to change hands for this to add up and
similar if it's a to throw or a for
throw it is a bit higher it has to go
back to the same hand for this to add up
we had three axioms and all of the
things they said that it should never be
more than one ball in a hand at the same
time and therefore some combination of
throws becomes illegal it is not legal
to throw juggling balls in numbers with
with falling falling numbers because if
I throw a to throw from my right hand
which comes back to the same right hand
where it comes from and then viola is in
air I try to throw a one throw which
also goes to the right hand and I'll do
this at the same time these balls try to
land in the same hand at the same time
and I really struggle to catch them so I
can't do that well of course the same
thing is true for throwing a three and a
two or a five and a four for instance
they will end up in the same hand at the
same time can't do it it's illegal it
kind of follows logically from our
axioms what I think is really
fascinating than that we can now start
to combine throws
different height and I've shown you this
one already here we have throws
different height and we start off
throwing a two followed by a three
followed by a one and then you can
repeat this all the time and it looks
like okay so it should be a two to use
three and a ones let's see that's two
that's a three aiyah here we are this is
the pattern that I showed you initially
and this is the pattern that you see
drawn on the screen behind me and of
course these juggling patterns they get
names from the numbers of throw that we
do or this or the sequence in which we
throw the balls so what I just showed
you is a juggling pattern which we call
two three one that is the name of that
pattern yeah so far so good I don't know
why this thing is switching off very no
one then I don't hope it's my computer
which is failing yeah okay and so far I
think you are doing what is quite easy
no I'm gonna come to probably the most
difficult part of the lecture so try to
stay as much weight as possible and I
will try to be as slow as possible and
see if you can understand this because
what I want to do now is to try to take
these kind of things that's all and
generalize them into a much more general
pattern about juggling
so imagine still that you have over time
right now in this very moment this is
this line right here so I have been
throwing some balls in the past with
three so they are being thrown against
three three bits later and because this
is right now and we know how they are
thrown in the past it can say that on
the first subsequent bit there's a ball
ready to be thrown again on the second
bit it's a ball ready to be strong again
and a on the third bit
there's a ball ready to be strong again
so this is just a same thing that you
have seen when I stroll in juggle three
balls and no imagine that I start we
move time forward and I throw this ball
so this body then be in the past and
then you throw this one so it lands here
so that's also another three and that's
gonna look like look like this so this
one was
in the future no it's in the past it I'm
in throne and we are once again ended up
in one one one standing and in East is
timeline so because of this we can draw
this in a different manner we can draw
this like this just one one one inside a
little circle and Arobin the number
three pointing back to the same circle
so what I'm trying to do here is to
build a kind of state diagram of all
possible juggling patterns that they can
do with three balls are you guys with me
so far let's do a few more examples just
to make sure
so imagine though that I decide to throw
this ball here because this one is the
next beat in our timeline which goes
like this and if you throw this one into
a three we will get back to this point
if it once again have one one one and
you will have the same pattern so let us
instead Ashe assume that we don't throw
the ball as a three bit throw but as a
four bits roll like this because I throw
it a bit higher up in the air there's at
the moment not scheduled and a ball to
land on the third subsequent bit but on
the fourth subsequent bit so obviously I
have to add a new state into my state
diagram and can I know you guys try to
imagine what that state is going to look
like and I want you want to try to
commit a suggestion so there's going to
be an arrow out of this one that says
four and it's going to come on you state
and what's going to be inside that state
one one zero one that's absolutely
perfect perfect after the correct time
in to say that's right
exactly and imagine though that this one
is the next to be strong because still
or time is moving in this direction I
know I want to throw this one in such a
way that I get back to this state right
here
anyone want to try to make a guess at
what kind of throw that needs to be
that's way too fast because nobody else
can sink but it's correct so it's gonna
be able to and yeah yes you can see the
two it goes in and fills the gap and
that's going to bring us an arrow back
to the state that we were previously in
so now we have two states all kind of
understanding how this pattern is being
built up let's try to do one more just
to make sure
so imagine though that I decided to
throw a 5 and obviously we are in this
state at the moment because it's true
from here 1 1 1 so we are in this state
there's going to be an arrow to the 5
and this time you guys can't reply
because I know that you know it so
anyone else you want to tell me what's
gonna be inside that next state 1 1 0 0
1 ok very very good
so you'll got this sort of it's kind of
easy to understand and then you don't
have to do all the mechanical work of
filling out these states so I can just
show you the complete state diagram it
looks like this it's beautiful isn't it
this is a complete abstract modeling of
three bits three ball juggling I think
it's beautiful and you can also see that
there's a few things in here which you
haven't talked about for instance we are
able to get into this state and then
it's a zero and you can get back to
having a serious row and what that
really means it's an empty hand a hand
where there is nothing going on and I'm
going to show you a few examples in a
second I just want to summarize a little
bit because I think we did something
really important here so we started off
by identifying or axioms or three kind
of content fundamental statements about
juggling and they are here and they are
really explicit because they are about
hands you say you know alternating hands
they are about balls and there are about
time about the rhythm so here everything
is very very explicit but as we kind of
progress we went over to this kind of
analytical little to little drawing that
helps us and still we have time along
the timeline and you have something
about left and right hands a little vent
strip those of you who don't read these
characters and then number three and
then when we start to generalize this
into a more general pattern suddenly
hands disappear there's no more
reference to an enhancer there's no left
there's no right there's nothing and
eventually when they get over to this
point there is no reference to hands
anymore
there's no reference to time anymore
it's just a kind of static diagrams that
holds a lot of state kind of devoid of
all the reference to what's actually
going on and this is the concept of
mathematical abstraction so we start off
with something extremely specific and
concrete in the real world and the end
up in a very specific very very general
model
which is abstract about juggling and of
course once we have this model we can
start to do really really cool things
for instance we can start to go on a
little financial journey because you
have seen the juggling pattern 3 already
I've done that a few times for you guys
it looks like this and if you start to
look carefully into that diagram we see
that it's possible to do a 4 that brings
us up to this state and then we can do
another 4 which brings us down to this
state and then we can do one and you can
return back to the original state so
it's possible to juggle the pattern for
for one that is a continuous juggling
pattern and I'm gonna show it to you in
a second but 441 is a kind of important
pattern because when people started to
analyze juggling back the first person
to do this was a guy called clothes
shaman I maybe some of you have heard of
that guy the father of modern
information theory was the first person
to have a real go at making a
mathematics of juggling and then
throughout the 80s in America and in
England groups independently developed
this kind of system which is called
siteswap and what's interesting is that
you know the pattern for for one is not
normal to have been juggled until it was
proven mathematically that it was
possible to juggle it and I think that's
really really true that you know we
start off with some assumptions and then
you can prove that certain juggling
patterns are possible to juggle and then
of course somebody starts to practice
and actually learn to juggle it for the
first time in history made possible by
analysis so we remember that the whole
avium we had three throw which is like
this and a fourth wrong is a straw which
takes four beats before it's thrown
again so it's quite high back to the
same man and then it says that it should
be possible to throw a 4 a 4 and a 1 and
it looks something like this
this really deserves applause people and
of course there's a myriad of beautiful
patterns inside here that you could
discover but there are some challenges
because initially we started talking
about that you want to make smart
juggling balls because we want to kind
of visualize what's going on so why do
we need to be slice so let's take a
gentle look at a few different three
ball patterns so if you already seen the
three which is this one and then there's
a pattern which consists of a 3 a 3 a 4
and a 2 and then repeats and three three
four to looks like something like this
so here is 3 3 3 and here is 3 3 4 2 and
unless you are an experienced juggler
it's not very difficult very easy to
tell this juggling patterns apart they
kind of look a little bit like the same
so once again what we can do to make
these patterns more clear Matsu kind of
more visually strong what's going on I
can exchange the ball with one of the
balls in another color
so I have two orange and one yellow and
then I can do like this no I think it
becomes quite clear that the yellow
balls stays in my right hand all the
time where the two orange balls crosses
between my hands can you see it yeah
that's nice now I can use a bowl a
different color to kind of make it more
visible what's going on make it a bit
more clear but the problem is of course
that in the moment I add another three
in here it doesn't add up any longer
because it will look like this so here
comes to four and there's a four and
here's a four and this one this ball I
really would like this one to be yellow
so that I would like to have a smart set
of juggling balls that can change colors
accordingly by themself so that I can
see what's going on that is kind of the
whole idea the whole motivation for
trying to build a small juggling ball
wow you guys are laughing but just wait
give me ten minutes I'm gonna put this
into a larger historical concept and
you'll see that wow it's super useful
even though right now it seems more like
a toy project so a smart juggling ball
he needs
some kind of electronics and some kind
of stuff and here comes the embarrassing
part I've been working on this project
on and off for the last eight years and
I still haven't succeeded in making a
smarter window so you know maybe I
should find myself a completely
different job but anyway I started doing
this project together with Drogo
Tomlinson from University of Oslo he's a
mathematician and a juggler and even got
a little grant from the Norwegian
Research Council to try to make this
smart juggling ball and they worked
really hard on it for a while and then
you know time takes over other things
and they kind of got halfway there but
he never managed to drive it all the way
home but I give talks like this quite
often and a couple of years ago I gave a
talk at the Oslo University College and
I met these four guys and they were in
their first year of their bachelor
thesis and they were so fascinating
about his whole math and juggling thing
so when they were in the surgery I'm
ready to do their bachelor thesis as
engineers they came to me and I said hey
can we try to build smarter green balls
and said great I will take you on and
I'll be your supervisor that's awesome
so this is Johanna harmless jakob hokum
some did this project so then we started
to kind of look into into this so what
do we need to make a smart juggling ball
well we're obviously gonna need some
kind of electronics and this is the
circuit board that is students designed
for this project and it has all the
things that you would expect to find in
a kind of abandoned system it has a
microcontroller tiny little device that
can do computations and talk to
different sensors and so on this is an
ST STM processor 96 megahertz
lots of RAM and all the things you need
in addition these poles may have to
exchange some kind of information about
when they are being thrown and when they
are being caught and so on so you have a
radio in there which is great you also
need a sensor which is the little tiny
device here with an accelerometer that
measures acceleration and it's also a
gyro that message rotation and the gyro
is very useful because we want to do
free fall detection we want to know when
the ball is in the air versus resting in
your hand and to fit in the battery we
made a big
hole in the middle which means that
accelerate accelerometer is no longer in
the center of gravity of the ball so
when the ball is rotating if you throw
it a bit awkward it won't be able to
calculate that it's free-falling so we
needed a kind of dryer to compensate for
that and then finally they want to see
colors in or light in different colors
so we have 8 3 colored LEDs on the
circuit board four on this side and then
four on the back side so that the ball
can has a kind of beautiful light we're
definitely going to need a battery to
power the whole thing so there's a
rechargeable solution for this
lithium-ion battery with a little bit of
energy sufficient to power the ball for
an hour or maybe two hours and then the
most difficult thing of all is this and
this is much more important than you can
possibly imagine this is the shell which
which will kind of encapsulate all the
electronics and make it into an actual
ball and to make a good shell turns out
to be much much more difficult and you
guys can possibly imagine because I am a
juggler and when I have a juggling ball
which is kind of soft and so on I'm
quite relaxed when I'm juggling I feel
that I can stand here I can juggle three
balls I can talk to you guys and if two
of these guys kind of trash in the air I
don't care so much because they just
fall to the ground and I can pick them
up again and continue in the moment you
take a juggling ball like this and it
has some kind of really hard 3d printed
horrible plastic
I am so terrified and I'm journaling
still these balls that I'm happy there's
a carpet here because it's a wooden
floor I would be so stiff and kind of
and relaxed and I'll juggle them because
when two of these guys hit each other
midair because I don't do my juggling
properly it's like my heart stops
because oh my god thousand hours of work
he's gonna crash into the floor in a
second you know it's horrible so I think
you know as kind of engineer it's so
important to think about the human
aspect of the products that we make
because this is actually a complete
useless juggling ball because of the
material from a tree is made so that's
an important lesson to take with us what
is the last thing we need in order green
balls any ideas
software yes you're gonna need some
software that's exactly right very good
and in this project you were kind of
standing in the choice between these two
guys
shall we use some kind of see Arduino
based singie and I have made quite a lot
of few prediction or do we know I like
Arduino and I feel kind of familiar with
it and then the question is micro peyten
when we had this discussion with the
students maybe you know February this
year I said Oh Titans will be so
exciting I would like to learn more
Python and so on so after a bit of
thinking about it we landed on Titan I'm
going to spend a few minutes not talking
about why that was a bad idea
yeah I really regret it actually so the
good thing about Arduino is that you
compile about before upload then you
kind of do your stuff and you're happy
my core peyten
these little chips that you can have
inside of microcontrollers when you
connect this with USB to the computer it
pops up as a device as a kind of hard
drive or USB stick in your computer and
you can edit the Python straight on to
the device which you think is a very
good idea but if you guys are going to
try to do something like this you have
to get yourself an editor with really
really good syntax checking because if
you don't do this and you upload a code
it doesn't work perfectly because
there's a wrong indentation or you have
a runtime error you get no feedback the
program just stops working on this
little embedded device there's no big
dump of error message onto your screen
saying you in which line is the error
and so on so I think that you know this
argument that you can edit on device
it's not really a good argument it's
actually just a hassle because I end up
making just a slightest programming
error and the whole thing crashes of
course it's possible to do some kind of
compilation of peyten
onto this micro peyten bytecode which
executes a little bit faster and you
also get a little test of your syntax
and so on before you deploy which is
good but then of course you lose this
ability to edit on device but you don't
want that anyway so that's fine at least
that's my opinion maybe some of you guys
disagree faster to execute see
absolutely true much much faster to
execute even on a much simpler and
cheaper device the C code executed much
faster faster to prototype is an
argument that you have heard several
times today on some of the Python talks
that oh you can just open it and you can
do all this magic stuff I think that
this may be true when you write
algorithms but in an embedded system
where you have microcontrollers and you
have devices that you want your
microcontroller to communicate with this
is not really true because I mentioned
to you that one of the most important
sensors that we have inside our juggling
ball is the accelerometer and
accelerometer and the SlashGear oh and
also a three degree compass magnetometer
there are complex devices and they have
lots of registers and a lot of settings
about sample frequency and filtering and
interpolation and what God knows and to
set up this device you really need to
know your device well to write the
registers and so on and is that code
gonna be faster to prototype in Python I
don't think so I think the time
consuming part here is really to know
your devices and to interface them more
than actually writing the code and I
know it's late on a in the evening or
not noon but this is the some of the
Python code that you need to set up this
accelerometer inside the juggling ball
and it's a lot of stuff that you need to
know about addresses and how the device
is kind of constructed to be able to
configure it the corresponding code for
Arduino looks like something like this
of course we don't have to understand
all this code but I don't think that
this is any more complex or harder to
write than the Python code so I don't
personally think that the argument that
it's faster to prototype on on Titan
is true for these kind of embedded
devices so maybe some of you agree with
me disagree with me please come out have
a discussion afterwards I would love to
hear some arguments why this is
eventually wrong okay but once we got
this device going we can connect to it
and we can get data out from the
accelerometer and that is the sensor
that measures the movement of the
journaling bowl and typically it looks
like this is being juggled so there is
resting and then eventually we throw it
and then we straw it they apply a force
to the accelerometer that we can see
here and in the second we dropped the
ball because it leaves our hand on the
way off instantly the acceleration drops
to zero and it's actually zero-g because
the ball is accelerating downwards as
gravity is also pulling it downwards
that comes across as zero-g and not 1g
that some of you might expect and then
it's gonna be airborne for a little
while and ends gonna land in your hand
and dependent on how soft you are able
to catch like this you won't get these
hard spikes that's because at least I'm
in our jungle I tend to almost sometimes
meet the ball a little bit and I kind of
catch it like this and that's why we get
this one sample of a really really high
force acting on the ball 15 g in the
moment it lands into the hole and of
course the challenge for us is that we
want to have juggling balls that are
smart so we want to convert this data
into a siteswap number is it a stirry
straw is it a fourth row is the five
throw and so on and the students in this
project went on to this in a very very
kind of mathematical approach so they
took the equations the juggling question
that I mentioned you initially by a
Claude Shannon and they try to make a
little equation that expresses which
siteswap number do we get from do we get
from throw so here there's a lot of
stuff and especially it's this line here
in the middle that says that this row
and rounded is twice the velocity
there's a gravity and there's some
constants and said 12:00 time and the
beat time the dwell time is how long you
hold the juggling ball in your hand
between before you throw it again it
lands you hold it a little bit and
destroy it that's in well time and the
beat time is the entire time before ball
is being strong again the frequency of
the whole pattern the problem with this
approach this kind of in one way I think
this is noble work done by the students
eyes who provides they have really done
a good job of combining side slope and
available physics and so on but
eventually this fails and the reason it
fails is that if I juggle three balls
and you see that there's an estimate of
the velocity based on accelerometer how
fast the ball is leading my hand but the
juggling pattern can look quite
different because I can juggle very very
narrow and then the ball goes straight
up against gravity and as I extend my
hands faster and faster the the tempo
actually increases and I can't talk
anymore
and I straw really really hard
acceleration of the ball becomes higher
so the exit velocity is higher but it's
still I sides up number three so when we
try to do this and apply it into
coloring of these different straws in
different colors based on the juggling
it actually fails doesn't work that well
so we need to build to hard-code an
equation like this into the code in the
moment it involves humans and so on it's
actually not a good idea you even need
something which is much more flexible
and kind of adapting to the behavior of
the human I think that's one important
lessons from this project
yes it can be compiled for faster
execution but still in this juggling
balls that are running on 96 megahertz
we are still able to get only about 60
or 70 Hertz sample frequency on the
accelerometer of how to measure whereas
an Arduino version that I've worked with
many years ago which had a much cheaper
and much slower microcontroller but the
program written in C then I could easily
achieve 200 250 300 Hertz sample rate so
that's also partly why this project
isn't workout and it's also particularly
due to the one throw which is like this
right how long is the ball airborne
especially from a little bit narrow you
won't actually be able to detect the
freefall because the sample frequency is
too low so therefore we have a little
bit of further work we could imagine
that we do a little bit of increasing
the sample rate do some kind of code
optimization to see if we could make it
go fast enough to increase our sample
rate and I think it would be very
interesting to have some kind of
adaptive algorithm for throw indication
so that when we are throwing something
out and we get a velocity when this ball
eventually lands if they have radio
communication and they talk about when
they are being thrown and when they are
being land landed and the ball will
based on this radio communication know
whether it was a 3 or a 4 or a 5 with
absolute certainty when the other balls
are being strong and therefore we could
use some kind of machine learning or
some kind of adaptive algorithm that
converts acceleration or velocity into a
throw based on this so that would
definitely be a further work which I
would love to do if I can find the time
for it
okay I see that there's a few minutes
left and unless you guys are completely
full I think I will spend a few minutes
just trying to put this into a kind of
historical context here is just when we
had the first test of the juggling ball
so these are two of the students who
program everything and they are looking
I think this kind of fear oh my god is
it going to work we had a very good time
at high school not to have this testing
and it works you're all a little bit
more relaxed so let me start by asking
you guys a question initially I set up a
few axioms this kind of absolutely
certain truths and then we used logic to
deduce two logical consequences of these
axiomatic statements how old do you
think this way of reasoning is who was
the first one to reason in this way and
write it down into a book any others I
know not to try probably the Greeks
that's a very good you have any
particular Greek in mind or just the
Greeks in general plot oh and good try
huh Pythagoras yes maybe I don't know if
he wrote it down though the first guy to
do this very very systematically was
Oakley and Oakley wrote a book called
mathematical elements in which he make
ten or fifteen axioms and assumptions
and then he did use everything in
two-dimensional geometry that we know
today squares and triangles and all
these kind of things and here is a copy
of one of these documents this is an old
copy from here approximately 300 and
this is in the possession of the Vatican
and it's referred to as codex but the
countess is one of the oldest copies of
athletes elements and here you can see
the famous a squared equals B squared
plus C squared derivation in this book
another community which has spent a lot
of time to try to make axioms and then
deduce the logical consequence or the
people who deal with origami so origami
of course being the art of folding paper
in certain patterns and this is one of
the traditional Japanese patterns the
crane
and of course people start after a while
when they discover that this could be
math amazed and formalized to fold much
much more complex shapes and here is a
horse and if you don't think this is
sufficiently complicated people do
things like this and I remember and
remember that they do this from one
single sheet of paper with no cuts so
it's only folding to get into these kind
of patterns and it's a really beautiful
which is this little friend
mantis a praying mantis I think you are
called and here we have some kind of
insect and this by the way is the crease
pattern which tells you which way to
fold the paper
so the redlines folds one way the black
lines four fold another way and the
circles becomes these different things
that prolongs protons out from the body
of these things and the reason that this
was possible is somebody managed to
activate and formalize the entire field
of paper folding and origami and now I
can go back to the stuff that someone
was laughing a little bit and I said you
know I want to make a smart juggling
ball and understand how it's being
juggled because on the face of it it
seems like a completely useless thing to
do why would you do that what's the
point but I think the lesson learned
especially from origami is that when you
really really know how to fold things
based on mathematics then certainly you
can apply this to new things because at
some point in history we decided that it
was convenient to have satellite TV or
we want to have satellite communication
so we need to send these satellites into
space and they need power somehow so
they have solar panels and the thing is
that the solar panels are super big
surfaces but you want to put them into a
square box so hold you fold that solar
panel to make it into something that you
can put into a box well of course the
NASA started doing this at some point
they met some of the origami kind of
paper folder people and the paper folder
people said hey this is easily done this
for in a long time problem solved just
come to us pay us you know and we're
gonna do this for you so there are these
really really beautiful shapes that
people make so here is just one such
example so when it's unfolded or in it's
a packet state it looks like this and
then you can pull in these kind of
things then eventually it falls flat and
once you have proven it on ground then
you can build a solar panel for real
and you can send a panel into deep space
and you know exactly how to fold it out
to get the energy that's all I had thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
