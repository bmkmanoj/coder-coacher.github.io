of look ma no service how servers
architectures are going to change the
world of at least software development
let's just start small all right start
small um a couple years ago I was
speaking at a conference be au or they
said other major conference here in
Australia and in that talk I'm sort of
positive this right the talk was about
docker and my point was soon deploying
applications is going to be as outdated
as many all men memory management for
exactly the same reason because we can't
be bothered with that I've got I've
got more important things to do and I'm
sure someone form a double yes was in
the audience because it wasn't six
months later when they released lambda
yep of course these things are causally
related and lambda was a massive massive
change in the way that we sort of use
and build software it's a tremendously
powerful thing and basically what
lenders are and now as you're as
functions and Google I think they're
called google functions and IBM has
something which shows you how powerful
this is right if we're talking so then a
year year and a half all of the major
cloud providers is supporting this now
but what a lambda is is is relinking
thing is I upload a piece of code to AWS
and then say to 80 yes please run this
piece of code if this particular event
happens it's that simple and that's sort
of where most of its peril I so I want
you to sort of run through an example of
what's now possible
with these tickets sort of this type of
technology and we're going to do this
I'm going to go and try and so to show
you how easy it is to live code an
application now the only thing I could
find to sacrifice to the sort of demo
gods was a limb that Windows laptop
animal mouse so please bear with me but
we're going to see how far we get but
let's just give you an introduction of
the application that we're going to be
building together and it's a good
old-fashioned sort of like forum yeah
then was anyone alive in the 90s so that
we did for and smack them so it forms
common it's a pretty pretty basic thing
but this is how we're going to start out
right eyes created to DynamoDB tables
and DynamoDB tables is sort of the no
SQL single table store that awsm through
me powerful so we have two dynamodb
tables and what we're going to be
building is three sort of lambda that
are in front of those DynamoDB tables
going to read and write to them and in
front of that over here is sort of an
API gateway yep so let's see what that
sort of looks like
that's not what I was hoping for like a
mirror this was all right yep so we're
down dynamodb of course you into West is
working fine in the break it must be
some boring talks on right now there we
go all right like I said to DynamoDB
tables right nothing fancy going on and
what we have configured is something
called gate API gateway now API gateway
is the gateway for api's believe it or
not you guys are a tough crowd is it
like six already so yeah its API gateway
and basically what we're doing is we're
defining sort of rest rest ish api's and
so what we've been doing is we've
defined that a resource called threads
and then we can sort of define our
methods on there so this is our threads
with the get and in here we sort of
specify that we could call a lenda
function and I oh I don't have any led
the function that's unfortunate let's go
let's go create one
so we got Linda get start it go away
escape this next this is great smaller
screens your entire things different so
get threads let's just call it get
threads we're doing the node here we are
now remember when I said that Linda is
this you see less on that screen than I
see on this string this is fun so as I
said Landa's is this piece of code that
you upload and then you tell AWS sort of
run this piece of code when this event
happens and this is sort of that event
that we see over here context has some
context and the callback is when we're
done that's sort of how this works so
let's go to figure this out right so so
what we're going to do is we're going to
do two two two two things here right if
we've specified a thread ID we're just
going to go and do a query on the dynamo
DB table so if we have a threat idea i'm
just going to do table name is demo
friends i'm pretty certain and the key
is the red ID you can't rely d
braces now we go they do require AWS and
a dynamo DB table DB so now we've sort
of created a dynamo DB connection and
now we can go get and then if we have
data coming back we'll just do call back
error data item and if else just call
back the error
you'll see that all right so then what
we'll do is we'll tell them sort of what
function to call in there we're going to
choose an existing role we're going to
do this here we can say how much memory
it needs instead of timeouts and this is
everything we need congratulations your
lambda functions is now sort of create
it and here's the interesting configure
testament to read I date is when I
should go look this up
what I put another DynamoDB tables no
don't want to be
Suraj items the right idea
almost right so
criminals don't there you go Thanks
there we go yep so this yup would right
so this is everything we need to do and
if we now sort of to create this lambda
that does a request to our dynamodb
title and returns that results mmm that
was what a couple minutes and if we now
hook it up to this one sort of this one
get threads
we can now test this here
for conduct of course okay demo bells
don't like Windows laptops apparently
yes badoo badoo badoo permissions are
always good fun I want to do that do
that get rid of that one don't get rid
of it
see something doesn't work either reboot
or deleted do it again we've now created
a micro service in 10 minutes that
wasn't spectacular I know damn you're
tough so here's the thing deaths it gets
fun right this is not just created the
micro servers because creating
microservices in 10 minutes is easy
alright everyone can do that but this is
a production-ready micro servers running
in production without me configuring
servers runtimes platforms see I CD
pipelines none of that stuff right now
this particular micro servers will do
one request per second it's just pretty
good all right one request per second
okay but the interesting the problem you
have when you're scaling applications is
doing that order of magnitude scaling so
what you see if you sort of go up an
order of magnitude from one request per
second to 10 requests per second all
right this is what makes it hard on your
infrastructure and on your code and
often requires to change the way we
think about infrastructure in the way we
think about code right so let's see what
we need to do to get this particular
micro servers to do 10 requests per
second see
go threads overview I can't keep
everything in here capacity there you 10
requests second yep with bursts up to
three thousand requests per five minutes
still not impressed yeah all right
however hundred let's go oh the person
capacity is updating so yes like we're
now doing 10 requests a second you want
to do 100 requests a second what do we
need to do to do 100 requests a second
update up to 100 ONN pay the two-dollar
32 a month all right it's not important
it's pretty important if we want to go
for the beyond 100 to 200 we have to
email amazon to please ask us to run
more than 100 lambdas at the same time
because that's what that's what Amazon's
doing they are they're sort of spawning
and they're falling up the plans it's
all over the place where I don't know
where that is let's homer and sydney
somewhere around here I don't know I
don't know what I saleability sudden
there is an evil server they're running
amazon take care takes care of all of
that if we want to run a thousand of
requests a second thousand requests a
second you should have have to go in
here and go
if you want to move beyond a thousand
requests a second you sort of have to up
this number and that's what makes it
insanely powerful where's my
stop my ring these things yep that's
what makes lend this a powerful so will
happen two more right we're having two
more we're do one waited for the get
threads and one for the get posts and
sort of 1 lambda for new posts that are
coming in right we're doing up a post
from from api gateway to here and we'll
just store that in the post database all
lambdas are looking very very similar to
the one up just for you trivial but
here's gets interesting right what api
gateway can do is it can sort of have
custom authorizers so I can protect
these resources that I have and every
time a request comes in amazon is going
to run my little lambda again to check
whether I FX's to that takes care of all
the caching takes care of all of the
provisioning and again we don't know we
don't care where these things run what
they do how it's going now this is
powerful this is extremely powerful but
here is where its get even better
because they're not just the events
aren't just sort of API gateway related
ones every infrastructure component in
AWS is able to generate events when
things happen so we can write a lender
that gets cold every time something
changes in this dynamo DB table so when
the post is edit we write to this table
and we can now run a function that
update the last posts in a thread over
here
and we can chain all of these events
together so an event happen on API
gateway this one is devolved this goes
to dynamo DB table this one's cold that
goes here to other stuff happens
extremely powerful extremely small
pieces of code and then we can have our
set of little single page JavaScript app
and we can host that on s3 in cloud
front we now have a fully CD nth front
end application connecting to a sort of
web server ctype back end without
provisioning any servers without having
to spin up ec2 instances or even
Beanstalk there's no scaling groups
there's no nothing like all of your
logging is sort of put into cloud watch
for you to to look at yeah massively
powerful so what are some of the
consequences of these things but so if
we start using this to the sort of the
full advantage what's sort of happening
right and the one thing is that we get
to the point where it's micra surfaces
all the way down not that many terry
pratchett friends in the audience no go
retail Richard maybe is more important
than the rest are going to say so what
we see is we break down those sort of
micro services and we break them down to
smaller ones if you looked at that new
post the new post microservers was
divided into two pieces of code right
the one that except the new post and the
one that also updated the threads so you
now sort of get these Microsoft into
even smaller components and smaller
functions the stuff you see very very
quickly sort of that seek urs or an
event sourcing makes it very very easy
to do you almost get them for free but
most importantly
reaching everything in your application
is going to be even driven which is
extremely powerful as well sort of go
along but before we go go on I want you
to sort of point out some of the Dragons
like the here be dragons because
distributed computing is hard
distributed computing is very very hard
and that's for two reasons the most
important one is that you will never
ever have a guarantee of something
happening once the only guarantees you
have that something happens at most once
or at least once and that's that's sort
of one of the major problems is doing
sort of these massively distributed
systems you always have to think about
what happens if this doesn't happen so
you can either pick I want this to
happen at most once and if something
goes wrong then that's it it's over or I
need to be able to deal with it's all
happening multiple times so you have to
think really hard about your failure
modes what happens if things go wrong
right networks are unreliable that's
just the way it is and the other thing
is sort of eventual consistency if we do
this event-driven thing a lot of this is
going to be eventually consistent there
might be milliseconds tens of
milliseconds minutes or even hours
before something actually happens you
have to be able to deal with that if
you're doing this style of programming
and if you thought the shepherd
computing was hard distributed debugging
is even harder basically every debugging
session turns us to a murder mystery
we're sort of update last post did it
with a time out in the query because
we're building these chains if something
along this chain something goes wrong
that's really really hard to sort of get
that debugging going certainly if you're
having these individual functions their
individual login correlating sort of
what happens certainly in a just in a
production system is going to be tough I
love this decline there's no cloud it's
just somewhere else's computer so we're
talking about serverless but it turns
out you still need to know quite a bit
on how these lambdas work in practice to
sort of get the most out of them and
this is one of my favorite quotes on
certain that computing thing I can
distribute distributed system is one in
which the failure of a computer you
didn't even know existed can render your
own computer unusable you start using
all of these services if one of them
breaks you have to figure out what to do
more importantly tools do not support
scaling there are some tools up there
that help you sort of deploy a few of
these lambdas and a few of these other
resources there's nothing out there that
Wilson skilled this up to 10th level one
hundreds of these functions yes actually
quit my job last week to go start to
start up in this sort of space tooling
on how do we sort of scale tooling to
attend to the hundreds of these
components that we're building but more
importantly there is an insane amount of
treasure to be had in this style of
architecture really cool quote our
architecture does not include servers
for the same reason it doesn't include
electricity
it's not my problem anymore not my
problem and if you compare costs like to
sort of n three large instances with a
load balancer in front of it set you
back around instead of almost seventeen
hundred dollars a million typical API
gateway and laminar requests about seven
bucks which is insane you can do tens of
hundreds of millions of requests the
most important thing not worrying about
servers priceless and that's sort of
what the so it's powerful it's useful
it's cheap right you're here something
and very very powerful the coat fits in
your head like it fits in my head
sideways that's how small your typical
code is yours interesting question do
you which your writing unit tests for
this yes the reason you're longing yes
is because you've been indoctrinated by
TDD for the past 10 or 20 years there's
no point to running any tests there's
one if statement and there's one remote
call that can go wrong there's four pass
through this code I can see them I can
reason about them I want to test it and
i'll test it manually other in the
console or on the comment line really
quick i'll test it but if i get the
results I want that's it why would I go
to the trouble of writing unit tests for
it doesn't make any sense not anymore
and that's sort of where a lot of those
changes are going to come from right now
our unit tests one of those are amazing
principles right don't repeat yourself
dry very important not anymore just go
and copy all of the stuff it's
self-contained and here's why one of the
most important things to come out of
this is a lot of sort of call immutable
services immutable services or done
services this this code that you're
seeing here is done it is never going to
change because that's why would you vote
unit tests so you can change your code
later I'll never want to change this
code I have my inputs I have one input I
go to the database and I return whatever
is in the database I will never want to
change this either i need the entire
thing in which case i have everything or
I don't need the entire thing and I'll
chuck it away massively massively
different way of thinking about writing
software in these sort of circumstances
so a lot of those sort of quality
principles that we've been sort of
reviewing for the past 20 years are sort
of changing
and for the record I was a massive TD
bem boy not like I've never never liked
this thing I'm not an excuse massive
TTFN boy except I haven't written a unit
test years so immutable services dumb
services the functions that we write
will never ever change hardly ever
change I'll get back to them afterwards
I'm sure there's some good discussion
going on efforts and and this is
absolute magic right this is my little
pony magic so let's go talk and sort of
go through some of the features because
what happens if we sort of add that
little applications of ours what so
remember this is the quick and dirty
application that we wrote if we want to
sort of email all of the people that are
watching a thread it's got no clue why
you would do that but every forum has
this sort of check box at the bottom
email me when someone posted posts in
this trip yeah so if we want to built
this how about on this update we push
that post to an SNS topic we push that
post ness ness topic and then we have an
auto am they'll listen to that SMS topic
it reached from this database of idiots
that want to be emailed when someone
posts something and so when they find
something they going to talk to SES to
send that email what we're doing is we
are adding code when we're adding
features see how we haven't changed any
of this stuff over here like the new
post is still the same posts
so what happens if we want to do
moderation because there's all these
people at spam on the interwebs and we
want to add some moderation to our sure
thing so what we're going to be doing is
we're adding a moderation table I think
we're all where we put all of our code
all of our posts that need to moderate
it and we're going to add alem know
where the moderators can sort of come in
and approve things and if we do we're
going to add them to the post table and
here's the magic everything else still
works there's no change than any of the
other stuff because they only get called
when we add a post that something else
is now adding that post doesn't matter
so this entire flow hasn't changed we're
still emailing these people that want to
be emailed we're still adding and
updating our threads how about if we
want to search posts now a search host
so how do we do that well we just create
a new blender that listens to that same
as a nest topics when a new posterized
and we'll just chuck it into cloud
search let's type in the flats fridge
and we'll just add another service over
here just talks about search the only
time you're adding when you're adding
feature the only thing you do is add
code like you hardly ever ever change
code and that's so extremely powerful
and why I'm so extremely excited about
side of this whole way of event-driven
function based architecture that service
architectures certainly this is a
terrible name by the way
I think because we're we're defining
something by what it's not right let's
work really well for no SQL its work
really well for no estimates and I'm
sure it's going to work really well for
servants but yet so the sort of knaves
terrible but this pile of architecture
is is a is an entire new way of thinking
about and finally doing those things
properly that we were talking about I
was having a chat with with Goku earlier
today and and he make this interesting
remark in that the financial incentives
are now in place to do the right thing
what we mean by that is that we now want
to separate out our different functions
because we build things separately in
different modules and a different
subsystems then we packets up the entire
thing and put them on one big vm because
that was cheaper for the first time in
history we now have the financial
incentives to split things up further
and further because this lemma might
need a lot of memory but this one
doesn't so we want them to be in
separate ones so the first time history
the incentives to do the right thing are
in place and that's not not just my
little pony magic we are talking sort of
my little pony and rainbow magic thank
you very much
any questions people that violently
disagree yep you yep nope I have other
question was if I have any insurance
what is your ID yeah I'm like I said I
know nothing about diving looked at
issue yet here functions yet what sure
oh that is they've got platforms and s3
where you can host your websites but to
build entire web application to the back
ends that's the work that's that that's
that and that's where it's powerful now
you can do your library you can I've
just shown you the easy one you can put
that in the library and include that
involve your land us that you want to
use it yep yep if you can do that in a
lot so it's I just saw show you the easy
way out you can upload a zip file are
there you can upload a zip file with all
of their all the stuff in there so you
can build your if your Java you can use
your jars in no tree s you can use your
NPM packages and you can even upload
binaries it's just a little bit it's
running in a Linux container
so you can upload your binaries in there
and sort of coal them from like a node
for example so yeah you can you can use
whatever whatever you want to run
something that is you your friend answer
question yes so yes and yes and no again
the tooling around this is very very
basic still you can have different
version of your lambdas and you can have
them running at the same time so you can
have different different versions
running at the same time subscribe to
the same or different events so you can
have multiple versions what I find is
that that isn't so it doesn't happen
very often that you have different
versions of the same code a lot of the
time is because if you make a change its
most it's most often because your
contract changes and if you're if you're
outside contract changes you basically
have a new service now now right now
like I said tooling the tooling right
now there's very little tooling that
sort of to help you sort of manage
different versions instead of running at
the same time it's a deal VF supports it
absolutely problem you can have
different versions of the same lambda in
production running at the same time and
you can sort of point to different
versions specific versions of your
landers but there's very little tooling
to sort of help you manage that just yet
like ask me again in three or four
months
most of most of the examples that we see
sort of right now are sort of relatively
small one company so talking to they use
it for their day big data ingress right
so they chuck big things on an s3 bucket
and then they use lenders and the
process that and sort of make sure it
gets into their Hadoop cluster if you
talk to Sam Crone and Peter camera
murmurs last name something with an S
they're running a cloud guru they
basically have their entire application
instead of running in this type of
environments car sales downstairs
upstairs in the pavilion of doing the
same thing right there they're using it
instead of their analytics platform so
they're not building entire applications
just yet but people are starting to use
it for sort of parts of their parts of
their stacks so it's there's no massive
adoption yet but you were definitely
seen the trance to build bigger and
bigger things out of it but yeah it's
definitely used in for the massive
production loads with the thousands or
millions and tens of millions of
requests a second requests per month
Williams a second that'd be cool ah yes
that depends so how do you holla the
question was how do you handle failure
right so this theoretically you could
there started to things you can sort of
fall back either on other regions or you
could fall back to sort of ec2 instance
if you really wanted to but yeah it
would only be a problem instead of land
that goes down on like an entire region
because they take care the provisioning
like saleability song like that happened
a couple months ago in Sydney you should
know any of that again that sort of goes
back to your monitoring right it since
the for example this one right if this
breaks if we should get from that if
this post season put them as an SQ none
of these other stuff happens and that's
why it's so sorry how important start
monitoring these these things important
sort of monitoring monitoring do we get
the expected amount of business
notifications is is our if the lambda
still intact it's someone sort of break
this particular link here there's
there's no tooling out of the box that
does that you can all of this stuff goes
into quite wash so you can sort of do a
lot of that metrics based said alarms in
cloud watch as she would do with any
normal component so you can do some of
it but again the tooling around this to
sort of do that supporting and scaling
are are in their infancy right now
good question so the first one talks
about to latency and how that works so
there's a couple of civ interesting
things that happening the hundred 30
milliseconds was on our on our cheapest
versions of lambda right so your CPU in
your memory are linked I put it on the
lowest memory settings if you put it on
the higher memory setting you get more
CPU in your throughput twill decreased
dramatically so you can go to sort of
have that quite easily you can probably
go to a quarter if you if you really
want to so so that a lot of that is to
do with satisfying your sessions the
other sort of thing we have is what we
call cold starts if you're a a new land
that is started you you have sort of the
hundreds of milliseconds often so
sometimes even sort of second delay
instead of that starting that up but the
most important thing to realize is that
we're talking about this point over here
right everything after this is
asynchronous but so it's the front one
yeah so this this will be you can get
there down to tens of milliseconds quite
easily by just playing with the memory
settings on this one
without everything to do with the
settings of the lambda it was the
cheapest version one week lemme let me
see what we can get it up to here of
course so let's do a mirror here again
Linda configuration where's my memory
section so that's something is the
reason we're specifying memory is
because memory and CPU are linked 101 so
the more memory you give it the more CPU
gets at the same time so if we where's
my so save under the test we sort of run
another test here we're talking about 33
milliseconds and then from api gateway
to do this on there
and this is sort of where we get that so
it varies quite a bit and it it also
happens sort of on it's like so you get
the height ends it's your is your
latency sure it's probably good enough
consider all the other things you can be
doing so that's sort of what is going on
since yeah like tens of milliseconds
probably good enough for most of the use
cases that we're working on there what's
coming out yep
gee that sounds like a great idea for
someone to build a tool around no I
guess I tooling around it absolute sucks
you have this you have for now you have
this interface and this gets larger and
larger and it's sorted alphabetically
nope nope there's nothing that gives you
the this types of because this is what
you want right you want to sort of
collapse pace and sort of open that up
and yep tooling around it it's still
very very much intimacy right last one
are we going to go and grab a drink I
think it depends a bit in the situation
that were in that sort of that the
change that you're making but things
like integration tests on that much
larger scale start making a lot more
sense right so that's the you don't
testing units anymore how do we how do
we test a bigger and bigger components
that we're building out up from these
smaller components so you would a lot of
it would be testing from that like the
UI for example just go through but a lot
of the stuff I do is mrs. Emmanuel just
go do a Cu RL on that HTTP do i do I get
back the results that I expect sort of
go go going to DUI does does does it
still sort of work and because we make
such localize changes it's actually very
easy to see sort of what the
consequences are you so it's easy to see
what you would expect to happen and so
verify that it did indeed happen and the
chances i'll be breaking something
somewhere else is is relatively slim so
all of the testing I would do are sort
of on that much much bigger bigger level
um no I think this is starting to sort
of the the sort of the ultimate sort of
DevOps right where there is no what's
ops and what's dead all right it's the
same thing we're doing the same thing
instead of managing and monitoring all
this stuff is going to be like we're
stocking with and that's why I sort of
service is such a terrible name because
it doesn't imply that we're not doing
ops anymore right there are still tons
and tons of ops I can't remember who it
said but one of the amazing quotes is
you can outsource your as much of your
operations who can the one thing you
can't outsource is caring right amazon
doesn't care about your application you
have to care about your application can
outsource that to anyone else and that's
ops amazon can give you the amount of
messages that's going through that SNF
topic but what's good and what's bad
we're talking ops right we're talking
monitoring but no I think this is sort
of the holy grail for DevOps where that
line is getting blurry and warrier
little what is def what's up it's it's
all the same thing yeah all right thank
you very much appreciate it and see you
