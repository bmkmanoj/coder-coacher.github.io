beautiful thing today how many of you've
heard of the hololens all right cool
good stuff good stuff
how many have tried it Oh even better
how when you have developed for it yes
if you've done any kind of develop for
it it might have been a bit boring and I
would recommend and going to my second
talk which is immediately after this but
yes yes I did mean to say bedroom people
go did you mean broker Nick Nick it
right no yeah there was a bit of a play
on words so I live here in Australia and
and I came just for you guys I am
actually dansk out but I live in
Australia so this is my backyard kinda
and but it's not like we don't want
people to come to Australia right
we have warning signs too
have you ever seen a drop in you have
like cuz you would be dead yeah drop
bears they'd look like koalas but you
don't really know until they attack you
right so our government made this nice
warning sign it's kinda like the secret
packages right um sir and right now in
Australia we going into summer so it's
starting to heat up a little bit we I
was doing yesterday and he was - to here
I think and he was 27 at home so yeah
I've sacrificed a lot so this is pretty
much what it feels like in summer
because you still dress the same when
you go to work right yeah it's crazy
um please don't be these guys or I could
say as I know me doing other countries
please don't be so Norwegian right
please ask questions just jump up just
raise your hand I'm okay with questions
if you run out of time or if you're
running you know a bit late I'll let you
know okay but we will get there so what
are we what are we actually looking at
it's a bit of the where we are at now
which is what I'm so how many people
here write code like day to day almost
everybody okay that's cool because no
matter how you look at it all of that
code kind of comes in the same way right
you might be writing apps for a mobile
device on a screen alright it's still on
a screen you might be writing for
Desktop which is could be web or it
could be your WPF app or it could be
your whatever Linux app anything Mac OS
it all comes out on a 2d screen right
it's a flat screen I can't see where I'm
going with this right you might be is
anyone do gaming as in write games yeah
excellent so do not write games but you
play games okay no that's fine I didn't
ask that question very well but if you
write games it's still for a 2d sit down
you know at a screen type thing unless
you you still use the Wii or the Xbox
Kinect which I don't think anyone does
is house today - like it's the Kinect is
brilliant it's actually kind of almost
what's in here but it's just not
something that's used a lot and then of
course collaboration and finding
pictures of collaboration is really
interesting because people always sit
around a screen and pointing I don't
know is that how you collaborate but the
same idea persist you have flat screens
right and to be honest it's kind of its
bit predictable it's a bit boring like
you can't go on autopilot yeah it goes
out you know it's gonna be flat we can
have a thing up there and a finger here
and we're gonna you know it's just it
just becomes the same over and over and
over again it's a great gift isn't it
he's done that before um and then
because it's like this which we tend to
go completely the opposite direction
right and we take this VR thing and it
doesn't work because it's not there we
go and we take this virtual reality and
we just scared the bejesus out of people
all right I don't want that I don't
want that in my VI headset has anyone
ever played doom on like the oculus or
the vibe or something like the original
doom game you'll get good don't hi it's
freaking scary like you need brown
underwear for that so this is kind of
what we went from the 2d to the right
everything in your face and yeah there's
good examples of where we can extend on
you know existing kind of experiences
and that makes a lot of sense to me it's
taking something we already know and
extending it into virtuality that makes
a lot of sense to me now talking about
this thing
I think someone's played Sonic yeah I
can tell dear do you know what is
actually powering this anyone know I
found out it's magic
it feels like magic if you try it and
I'm happy to give people a go if this
time like in between talks or after the
next tour or something like happy to
share if you break it you buy it safe
but it is it feels like magic it really
really does so let's talk about the
different kinds of virtual reality or
augmented or mixed or digital realities
I don't like to call them
augmented reality we kind of know you
whether we think we've tried or not we
probably have tried it and it's an idea
of having the real world and you overlay
some data on it it's kind of like a
heads-up display right I put an iPhone 8
on there at the bottom because the new
AR kit augmented reality kit for for iOS
is coming out and it's going to work on
iOS 11 which is with the new iOS iPhone
8 which is very exciting because they do
some really cool stuff with just the
camera on the phone we won't talk about
AR kit today but just so you know it's
coming no it's here but it's coming in
production in more and more things it's
very simple very lightweight often it's
a very basic experience people always
say Oh be right I know what that is it's
Pokemon go and then I use this throw
them out
you know Pokemon go is not really
augmented reality it's kind of a
real-world camera with a thing on it and
you just do it's it's getting there
people know now what Pokemon go is but
it to me it's not the real use of
augmented reality it does often off
involve a mobile device because it's you
know the real world you move around we
are well so you have you whatever device
with you which is often a mobile and
there's no obstruction reality you can
see all of the reality and you overlay
data on right so you're not it's not VR
because we are in comparison you obscure
everything right there's nothing left of
the real world hence the term virtual so
you're in control of what the user sees
of the full experience as a developer or
designer it does come with very limited
physical movement because you can't see
where you're going right there's there's
some assistance now with the HTC vive
and the oculus
some you know monitor or cameras that
you set up in your space and it'll tell
you where they are so you kind of can
see a little bit about where you are but
you don't know if someone is gonna step
in front of you or like there's no you
can't see the real world it means it's
quite isolated there is some effort
around collaboration and online gaming
and those sort of things but most of the
virtual reality experience is very
single-use I think you saw um it's
tethered means there's always a cable
coming out of your head okay I brought
this which we'll talk about a little bit
later which also has a cable but it's
not via so everything is changing right
it's a little bit different but
essentially you have a long long cable
that comes out of your head and you're
restricted by that and that goes into a
computer that's really really powerful
and I've ridden no tracker movement
which used to be true but there are now
examples of tracking the movement or the
hand gestures at least of whatever it is
you're doing in this virtuality so
that's kind of the two sides and then in
the middle is what's now termed mixed
reality and that's marvelous way of
saying no it's not augmented reality we
want to call it something different
which is confused everybody I'm okay
with you calling it augmented reality
what you what works on on hololens but
it is officially called mixed reality
right the whole idea with this device is
that it scans the room you're in and
I'll show you this in a little bit later
so you know what the device knows the
entire 3d model of the room you're in
whether that has tables or chairs or
people or whatever it scans it
continuously which means that you have
this natural interaction between the
digital stuff that you put on the
experience which might be a person that
comes in and sits on the chair
the real chair and and the physical
world that you're in so you can use any
room any surface this is key you have to
be able to use any room or any any place
any location that you can think of right
that is the key for mixed reality
because sometimes you're wrong I've had
questions like but there's four chairs
there how does the next person know in
the other room there has to be four
chairs there and I know that missing the
point whatever it is you're developing
has to work with whatever is there
whatever surfaces you identify you have
to use so that's the key
there is no tethering right this is a
complete fully self-contained device it
has a computer and everything so we'll
go through that in a minute now this is
a really important question that if I
talked to anyone clients customers
students who ever work before you start
developing whatever your great idea is
you have to ask yourself whether it is
for hololens or it is VR AR because
there's you can absolutely build a VR
experience on the hololens
yeah there's our Walking with Dinosaurs
app that gives you this nice beautiful
world of palm trees and dinosaurs and
everything but it's not mixed reality
right it doesn't take into account
anything that's in the room so don't do
that make sure that if you build for
hololens and you make people pay $3,000
u.s. for one that you also take
advantage of what it can do because that
often gets neglected you just go oh
that's cool but that any off you go this
is kind of the first prototype photo
that I can find I cannot verify that
that is the hololens on the left but i
think it is also because it's the same
dude that's the kinect from an xbox 360
on his head and these it's kind of bit
hard to see with this but they have red
green and blue lenses here that can kind
of go over each other which this also
has now a much more complete package and
it's just interesting seeing I'm
guessing there's probably four years
between the two photos something like
that
it's a fair amount of effort so just
before we look at coding and stuff the
specs on this so it's it's kind of
Awesome and kind of standard it's an odd
mix so what makes it possible to scan
the room that you're in and these for
environmental cameras on the front
there's two on either side they use
infrared and UV light to to map the room
and build a 3d model a polygon model
which also means it doesn't work very
well in the sunlight because of the UV
it's not really an outdoor device it has
a dip depth camera that can measure you
know distance and depth of course and
the UV is about four meters
distance that are the range so you have
to walk around a room to kind of map the
whole thing has a video camera because
you can record whatever you see which I
also used to show you what I see through
it and it has voice recognition through
these microphones it has incredibly good
voice recognition it's really really
really accurate I did a workshop the
last two days on developing for it and
we had lots of fun with the voice
recognition because it just works right
it's so easy to use then we have the
wave guides and the what you see is not
projected onto your eyes or anything you
don't have lasers going through your
skull it's just light kind of immediate
from this angle down onto these wave
guides red green and blue and that's how
it builds up how the Holograms that you
see very very smooth very very fast
limited field of view we'll get back to
that
that's usually what people got on earth
and of course it has some guts it has a
brain right I'm not a hardware guy I'm
not sure what an Intel cherry trail
system on chip is but apparently it's
quite ordinary there's nothing special
it's a 32-bit architecture it does have
a HP u which is a holographic processing
unit and they've got that directly from
Star Trek no not really but that is what
does all the Holograms and is it's a
bespoke piece of silicon that has built
I think it until it's built it and it
does something like a trillion
calculations a second about the same as
a really really powerful graphics card
two gigs of RAM which is kind of me 64
gigs of storage and runs Windows 10
because there's a Microsoft device right
I know I have not had a blue screen yet
but it runs Windows 10 which means it
gets the same updates as your Windows 10
laptop but of course is a different
version of Windows 10 okay the last
thing which is a very very big part of
this is the audio it's got two speakers
on either side those red red bits the
sits right over your ears and we'll get
to what HR TF is head related transfer
function but that's means that you can
hear 3d audio with these speakers it's
very very accurate alright and I would
like to hammer this home it's untethered
right there is nothing else this is it
often you'll see stuff like this this is
Microsoft marketing going yeah well
obviously it's Australia cuz she's being
eaten by a shark right but you see stuff
on the ground there's stuff on the wall
and things floating in the end
everything and you kind of think that is
the experience you're gonna get and it's
not right it's more like this okay
that's the feel of you that's where you
see through it and this is very
disappointing if you expect the other
picture that you see everywhere you get
used to this real quick 15 30 minutes
it's kind of but it means you do move
your head a lot that's why people always
do this right when they look at it
because you can't see very much the
Holograms are only rendered in this
little space so that's the caveat there
is all right I just want to show an
example of something that's really cool
and it's a if I can start it it's just
gonna stand there one of the cool things
about hololens is that it lets you
display mine from anywhere you can get
different perspectives on their
Minecraft world
it's awesome to play with the controller
but we show something create world
run around in sacks and easily navigate
and manipulate the world using his voice
and his hands you can walk around the
halls wrap can around four different
viewpoints and you can look inside
that's pretty freakin awesome isn't it
like dad's holy crap like you'd look at
this you go okay that's pretty cool
now that was in 2015 and minecraft is
still not out for it but anyway you get
the idea there's this really really
immersive you know even collaboration
between the two and he used yeah it
probably was a table had to be exactly
that size but the ideas you can use any
table to do the same thing right so
pretty amazing what you can achieve with
it kind of have the vision of it and
then again this is an existing idea
that's been promoted and extended to
work on the whole lens okay let's talk
about code so there's five building
blocks or five pillars of mixed reality
development there you need to be aware
of I need to get right for your
experience to be kind of convincing I
guess the first thing is what's called
gaze and gaze is essentially your mouse
cursor but gaze is where you're looking
well it's not so much where you're
looking is where your head is pointing
so it doesn't track I've movement but
your gaze is what comes out exactly from
the center of the holland's right so I'm
choosing things maybe oh here we go
as with my mouse cursor but I'm using my
head as the mouse okay that's a little
bit weird when you first do it but
that's how that works you have a
construct at the very core of it Cole
raycast which is one that little bits is
down there recast and it's a unity so
unity 3d is the 3d modeling tools anyone
used unity 3d and all a couple of people
okay it's quite daunting using it the
first time but my approach have been
just ignore everything you don't know
what does and if something breaks you
figure out what that thing was that you
need to know about but raycast is a
construct unity that allows you to kind
of shoot a ray out from an object or a
thing this
as your head because you got where
you're wearing it and you can you can
detect if you're interacting or if
you're hitting anything you know you're
hitting another object are you hitting
another you know part of the spatial
mapping or whatever it might be
so that's the that's the key to it I'll
see if I can show you a bit of it so we
have a Marshall example which I tend to
use let me just start up the emulator
here before we do anything okay
so unity looks like this whoops yeah
like that and there's a ton of stuff
going on right but this is what you need
to kind of get used to this is where you
live a lot of the time more so than
Visual Studio so you have various
section you have you know what the scene
looks like what you see out of the
actual Holland's Wallace obviously the
black part of this will be the
transparent part so that's where you'll
see the real world you'll have some you
know hierarchy and some assets in this
case there's my origami so I can click
on the stage and you can see that's the
stage there's some spheres I can double
click on those and zoom in and see him
and stuff like that it's quite it's
quite good UNC is a good tool it just
takes a little while to get used to it
as anything this thing is what really
really frustrates everybody because
everything you click on that changes so
you have this then the changes and the
camera then it changed something else
and you got to cursor and just keeps
going right this is properties
properties properties properties I've
gotten used to just ignoring it and
knowing I need to fix fix this one thing
so let's go back and see what okay what
is that doing so I'm just wanting to
start out the emulator here which didn't
work well because I used the wrong one
so this is really another part of it
here so there we go the way it works is
that you build everything in unity and
you then write your C subscripts so
people here familiar with c-sharp yeah a
little bit because I got that this was
more of a C++ kind of crowd is that
right Python maybe but embedded at least
C C++ that sort of this is a Microsoft
it used a c-sharp that's just how it is
runs I'm done it but you build
everything in unity about unity here and
you didn't export this as a project or
solution into Visual Studio and then you
didn't take it that and build it in
Visual Studio and then either you know
launch on the emulator or push it onto a
real device or publish it whatever it's
pretty freakin awful if you ask me they
have done some improvements on it like
this you can now run what's called a
simulation in unity for hololens so that
you can just press the play button and
it gives you most of what the immuno
does which is improvement but the
development cycle is really long and you
just gonna have to get used to it if you
want to try it out you'd learn to do
other stuff while you export and
importing and publishing and pushing and
everything okay so here's the emulator
we've got sound as well I might just
turn the sound off for a minute
mmm be up come o beers why so that's
essentially that's what you see through
the hololens right this is as close as
you get without having a real device so
there's the spatial mapping you saw the
room behind there's an actual virtual
room that it uses and we'll just see if
that ran got deployed ah so then you get
this you get into whole gamut now no duh
you get an error because it took too
long so then we go back in again and
then deploy it so I'm I'm not gonna
sugarcoat here this and say oh it's
awesome we all know as developers that
some of this is just crap right but the
end result is so amazing that you just
keep pushing through right it's so
convincing what you actually get to
build so while this is doing its ting
let us look at the code so we're talking
about gaze and in this case we have a
cursor which is this okay well cursor
there's a script to be attached to the
physical of the physical the digital
object the 3d cursor that we have which
I can just show you is well it's a
little bit odd because I have two
computer over here so you know bear with
me in here I have the cursor I can just
double click it looks like that alright
so that's this thing I want to point
with when I point with my head
and I want to attach a script to it
called Wilkerson and in this script I'll
just go through the main component here
there are there's a start this is
important there's a start function and
there's an update function the start is
what initializes everything when you
start up the experience when the
hologram of the 3d object is initialized
it runs on start just once update runs
every single frame whenever there's a
you know sixty times a second sixty
Hertz device it'll run through this code
so in here we have the raycast that we
were talking about before right
that's where it happens so we get the
head position in the gaze direction
because we're the head is what we're
looking with right that's where we
casting the ray from I'll be looking at
something and then we do a ray cast with
those with that information if we hit
anything that returns a boolean and we
get this hit info object and we can use
that to know what we hit we can interact
with the thing that we hit and in this
case we enable the mesh render that
means we we have rendering with drawing
the thing the cursor then we set the
cursors position to wherever we got the
hit the point of the head and then this
is magic thing down here where we rotate
it because we want the person to house
whatever it is on and that's the
quaternion function that allows you to
do that and if you don't hit anything we
just disable the the cursor that's all
does right let's see if we got this
running hopefully so here's origami and
it's a Windows 10 Start menu as well so
then that stands up and hopefully there
we go maybe you're in T and here's a
little origami so I'm controlling this
with the arrow keys and WASD for a 3d
experience right now we were talking
about the cursor so that's the center of
my vision not that little cursor there
cuz that's just my mouse cursor but if I
turn over to that ball oh there's a
cursor right you see how it hugs the
surface
of the thing of the of the bowl so
that's what we just did that's all the
code we needed pretty straightforward
so that's gauge we look at something and
we can then interact we can interact
with it we can identify it we can do
whatever we need to okay the next part
of this to do is any questions like you
really can ask questions I wasn't
kidding or you can just be Norwegian so
gestures is the next thing so we had
gays the second of the five pillars is
gestures and it's kind of like this
almost we have a gesture frame so in
front of this when you've where there's
gesture frame where it captures the
gestures and is meant for you to just
hold your arm relaxed at the side and do
this the tap and it takes a little while
to get used to because you see something
and you want to tap it or you want to
tap it or yeah there's many many
versions of it but the idea is that it's
relaxed you just do this and that's
what's meant to be an intern a chiral
interaction which it just isn't like no
one does this in real life but you get
the idea right we got this the tap which
in my second session today will expand
on a bit there's a few other ways you
can use it and then you have bloom which
is like that like a flower the blooms
and that's how to exit an app or bring
up the Start menu those are the only two
you need to know there's only two right
so what's the natural question that
everybody no one asks exactly can you
build your own right can you make your
own gesture yes you can
would you do it no never um it's really
difficult because you have to manage all
of the raw data that comes in from
whatever the hands are doing and then
you have to accurately manage that into
a gesture there might be a swipe or
whatever it is you want to do and then
you get into the position of well how
the hell does you user know that there
is an extra gesture because everybody's
used to this right so I would never ever
recommend doing your own gestures yes
you can but you need a really good
reason to do it
that's the gestures the code for this is
almost almost as rudimentary Oh
to get to that in a second
so we have what's called a gesture
manager up here mm-hmm gaze gesture
manager which is a framework construct
can you see this code is that all right
I can make it bigger but the rooms not
that big it's okay
yeah all right and we use this gaze
gesture manager to attach events to
essentially that does all the hard
lifting for you it recognizes all the
different gestures and throws events
when something happens right so you
don't worry about actually recognizing
any gestures you just need that manager
what we're doing here is we want to know
if we're looking at something so we have
a focused object which is just a game
object which is the the lowest form of a
unity object is called game object it's
kind of like object in net and in the
start we set up this tabbed event right
so here's the recognizer dot tabbed
event that's it now you're listening for
a tap right that's all you need to do is
really is that basic and we have an
anonymous function here that we say if
we have a focused object then we send it
a message call on select and we're
sending an event to whatever it is we're
tapping on and then of course you get a
start capturing gestures this is the the
most common thing that people forget to
to burnt to coal and then do not know
what's not working then every single
frame we obviously want to know when we
tapped on something if we're hitting it
I mean this should look pretty familiar
by now
it's a ray cast all right so we're just
doing a ray cast again and then if we
hit something well we set the focused
object to whatever it is we collided
with that's the beauty of unity although
everything is scripts and nothing really
know about each other you can get a
reference to everything within your
scene within the experience quite easily
and if you're not hitting anything well
which set the focus option off we don't
want to tap anything obviously and then
there's some plumbing down there right
and this means to be now in here so the
tap on my email is just enter okay so
I'm just gonna press enter so when I'm
oh sorry I forgot one more thing
obviously want to look at what the event
is the on
select so each of the spheres has this
fear command script attached to them and
the unselect here is what happens
there's a thing called rigidbody which
as you can see right now they're
floating they're not actually doing
anything they're just kind of sit in
their rigidbody means at apply physics
or give it mass and weight and all that
so we add that component and then we
have a collision
detective mode motors you know how do we
actually detect whether there's a
collision with other objects which is
not too relevant in this case and then
they will get to this that's another
part that's for the voice in a minute
but what we then have is that what
happens when you tap on it physics apply
and then what happens
it drops exactly so I'll just move out a
little bit so we can actually see what
happens g-g-gee so now I tap on it and
falls down alright I didn't do any of
the physics I didn't code any of the
rolling of it I didn't code any of that
all of they both say I want to tap event
and when I tap on the thing I give it a
rigidbody that's pretty much all I did
and you get this very natural very kind
of smooth and nice experience just
tapping the other one just for good
measure right bang that force down as
well and it falls into the abyss because
I'm not adhering to spatial mapping
right now so that's that's gestures
there's others that I'll go through in
the other session but that's it but you
know something I don't
there's a new one I know I know he is
saying I don't know what Marcus was
planning to be honest I would imagine
that there would be other gestures like
the swipe I can see that's handy like
get rid of something you know sort of
thing but I don't know I don't know I
think it's pretty difficult to do it
consistently and I don't know when
there's a version two of this either or
three whatever they call it
that's not very helpful was it voice is
the third of the input methods that you
can use so there's gaze gesture voice
right and there's something you get for
free you can say select on anything
which is the same as tapping if there's
a word at a button like this if it says
zoom there you just say zoom when you
look at when you gaze at the application
and it'll just trigger it there's a few
shortcuts like that you can use Cortana
which I know is really popular in Norway
no one here uses a guitar now exactly
but it does work really well there isn't
it a whole API for katana that's
magnificent very easy to use voice
recognition of course you can use custom
commands you can do your own liking role
your own commands which is what we'll do
so back to our script so we have a
speech manager and I said you can use
any voice command you want right and you
can and again in the second session I'll
tell you why you shouldn't use any you
can think of so again in the start we
set up a speech manager oops sorry
key word recognize are in the speech
manager and that just has a dictionary
of key words and values the values are
actions so we're gonna set up one here
called reset world and that will
broadcast a message called on reset so
we need to handle that and then we have
a drop sphere which will send an on drop
to whatever we're looking at and then we
give those key words to the keyword
recognizer and then we start it what you
can't see down there and then we have a
phrase that's recognized then we invoke
that keyword at that action you know the
value of the dictionary so there's key
yeah just invoke function and I'd this
might be a little bit quick but we don't
have that much time and if you've done
any sort of c-sharp this should be
pretty straightforward so back to our
sphere commands here cuz that's what's
gonna you know collected on reset when
we get that we destroy the rigidbody so
I'll be destroy the object right and
then we put it back to its original
position which we record him and we
initialize it
so we can put them back up and when we
call on drop we're just called unselect
which was the same as when we tapped all
right so we just reused that function
and then we'll see if this works
reset world a and they came back right
to this voice command again I'm using
the emulator so it's my laptop
microphone but it still it works so then
if I look at something like this one
here I can say drops fear it falls down
that's it that's all you have to do
voice commands like it's really is that
easy um this is kind of if you've never
done development for it and you start
looking and you go is that it it's kind
of almost you know it's what been kept
was saying this morning it's too simple
you don't feel like you achieved enough
right but it really is that simple and
then look at the fourth part of this so
that's J gaze gesture and voice ggv for
short weirdos are the input methods then
you have sound right and sound is often
something we just kind of we don't
really understand how to do it unless be
an audio engineer which most of us
aren't so we kind of just put it in
there and that's a pity because it is
using what's called head related
transfer function and I won't go into
detail exactly what it is you can
Wikipedia which is what I did but it's a
way of calculating how a sound reaches
your two ears and this is what they use
for these little speakers and it's
really convincing it's very very good
but you don't have to do any of the
mathematics it's all done for you all
you do is you're attached sound to a
thing and I'll go back to the code now I
want to go just to unity first here I'm
on so in unity on our origami collection
unfortunately I can't zoom in more than
this this is just how it is we have this
audio source which comes from an asset
here and you just assume you just drag
and drop this is the beauty of
programming and unity you take this and
you drag it and you drop it on there
right that's it or you can drag it over
here you can drag it over here but
essentially that's how you attach things
to each other and we have this audio
source and the reason I put my computer
on mute before you realize in a minute
was because this is freaking annoying
but this is
the demo that it is um and we have this
audio source which is the ambient noise
and I will now are you ready I know I
know
reset world still works and now if I've
done this correct there it is lovely
that's the sound script that's attached
to the spheres no I'm sorry it's just
it's another one my little pet peeves
don't ever have background music right
it drives people mad remember they have
this on their head they cannot escape
right there is no background so the the
code for this again it's almost not
worth looking at to be honest because
the sphere sounds here is just setting
up an audio source and a clip you have
some of these values that if you
understand what they do you can set them
or not you load an impact on a rolling
clip and then you have some collisions
and you just you trigger the sound right
and these on collision enter and exit
are building in the Unity framework you
get those for free they'll be triggered
every time there's a collision and you
can handle it or not but you can
probably come up with better sounds than
that okay alright in my workshop I have
we shoot down some cardboard boxes with
bold you know as you tap your shooter
ball and I found a sound bite of someone
cutting up a cardboard box and I've cut
that into four pieces and it sounds
infinitely better than that
and that was my 10 minutes so you can
definitely come up with better sounds in
there but sound is hard a bunch of code
on when do you roll it you know how much
magnitude velocity stuff do you need for
it to play the rolling sound all that
stuff but that's you can go into any
kind of detail on your sound design okay
cuz I still want to show you how this
works right so let's just do a demo of
this and I just need to make sure that I
am so now I'm going to connect both of
them to my own hotspot because you need
the smallest possible network in order
for this to not have a million seconds
of lag
let me just do that chief today it's me
yeah okay so yeah my I'll make sure it's
connected to my phone yep
very good okay so here's a little
developer to it we'll look at that more
in the second part as well nope decided
to log out just go back in okay so now
now now hmm
talking about yourselves come on
so I have a floating Start menu in front
of me now which you can't see but it's a
bit weird I can actually remove it get
rid of it there we go now this is not
kind of do won't do anything come on yes
I might just try again Wow crash darling
no Chrome doesn't work what a surprise
okay I'm on there we go
Grimes is not secure
it's interesting talking with his aunt
because you can't there you go do you
okay now we can do it so I can do a live
preview which means you can see what I
see
have ya it is a little bit flaky because
it depends on network and how much
interference isn't so now you can see
what I see kinda all right it's a little
bit of lag a couple of seconds so this
is a game called rubber raid and I kind
of treat it cheated and them start it a
little bit before so he's that whole
wrong you can see inside the wall and
it's like it's there right so now I got
Oh whiteboards getting oh there's a
robot coming out the whiteboard so you
shoot the little robots that come out
sure
and then depending on how good or bad
your mapping is which this is terrible
obviously because I haven't mapped the
whole room but the cool thing is you can
shoot everything right you can shoot
walls and it's just like you're shooting
it real and I can go and look at the
wall look inside of it and it's a lot
more stable in the glut in the goggles
than it is for you guys on the screen
just because I move my head a lot more
so we exit that gives you an idea right
now
everybody likes unicorns right yes okay
who wants a unicorn geez Wow you get a
cat as well or maybe a space there you
go nice there you go you got a helmet
and this is just a bit of fun right now
do you notice the thing was as fun as
this is yeah it'd be guys is this mixed
reality not really is it I'm just
placing things around the room
we can get a put a monkey on the floor
here but they've all floating they're
not actually adhering to anything I can
place them where I want they don't fall
down anything actually I think this guy
needs to be huge
there we go monkeys a lot bigger Hey
look at that
and the cool thing is I can move around
everything right and I can see it from
every angle or one behind the thing yeah
there's the thing there's the monkey
over there and it's it's super super
stable like it's unbelievably stable
actually hmm yeah cool so that is all we
have time for but as I said you're more
than welcome to try it if you want I
just got a couple little slides here any
questions on that does that feel
convincing yeah how complex can see
being before you're on all the devices
overwhelm the device I have enriched the
limit yet having said that in the
workshop yesterday the guys did
something where they built this well
essentially the built the shooting range
I don't know what they did but they
managed to make the frame rate really
crap so there was some performance issue
there but not sure but in general if you
do it correctly there's not a limit like
these Holograms you can put hundreds of
them like you just know where they're
and they stay there like if I turn it
off now and I go back to stray I come
back next week they'll still be here all
right so you gotta clean up your
okay
so what's next there's some social
issues around it I hope we don't get to
this part anytime soon because that
would be a bit scary awkward I guess as
you may have noticed you do look like
bit of an idiot with it on it's not a
great look to do that and often you see
these elements you see these kind of
huge endeavors of this is all of the
data of mass they can go and look at
right we don't have this as hobbyist or
you know little companies or big
companies we don't have this enormous
amount of data so I think there's a much
bigger chance that this involvement is
going to come through ten
people are gonna sit here and they're
gonna build little things they're gonna
try and you know evolve some little idea
they have whatever might be the tinkerer
I think is much more important for the
success of the device not the
necessarily the marketing of it um you
can absolutely just go and do it now the
origami tutorial it's on the Microsoft
web site on the developer portal try and
find a 3d model if you serious about it
there's an asset store unity that you
can use um yes it's expensive it's crazy
money three thousand dollars US which is
that in pounds now I just want to show
you a little bit of an example of this
tinkering I never run a little bit over
time but I hope you can bear with me oh
honey it sound oh hang on that has got
to go is so annoying okay let's just try
it again
yeah so this guy here and then just go
around and see what areas outside the
sphere and just trim them and I don't
know let's see what happens I'm gonna
try it out and show you guys whenever I
get it done so this is what it looks
like after Timmy I think I did a pretty
decent job let me show you without this
fear which by their ways no polygon so
it's not quite spiracle sorry it's not
that great and I could you know keep
going if I wanted to but that's true
enough this is what it looks like
I think it's pretty good I can trim it a
little better but I'm pretty happy with
it
that's how hololens can help you do
gardening who would have known really
simple idea right he just takes this is
a building tool it takes place as a
sphere and that's it he just has an idea
of hey this can help me do something
cool and I think that's much more ballot
for us as you know developers and
tinkerers and everything
more so than this huge NASA experience
or Mars experience or fragments which is
a game on here that's hugely impressive
but we probably wouldn't build a game
like that depending on whether you want
to quit or not I've got one more demo of
what is the future of this device so I
think this is worth 3 mins over time but
this is very very cool from one space to
another in real time hey feel like to be
Hollow ported so so cheers to where his
hole ends device and I'm gonna wear mine
we can see each other in full 3d in real
time we can interact and communicate as
if we'd co-present so Jay can you walk
around my space so we're doing
everything to get the impression that
Sergio and I are present in the same
space we call this technology holla
portation
and that's cool that's useful right now
I'm pretty sure the other guys in the
next room I don't think it's across the
country and look at the amount of
cameras they have but they're doing it
and they're now actually done this in a
moving car so the guy being Hollow
ported is in a moving car now he's not
driving in he's in the back but he's
being you know it's very very impressive
um that's me I'm Remy people Microsoft
they give me stickers I have a blog if
you want to read more about some of this
stuff
I do a bunch of Pluralsight courses
which are these I have one Hollis
development as well it's a mixed reality
and tooling and everything else of a
podcast if you want to hear more of my
ramblings with a guy I've never met in
Alaska which is kind of interesting and
please come tonight for the party right
there's this dude
Tom hasslein he's apparently really good
I don't know who it is but he's a jazz
musician so and if you want to stay on
I'm doing your next session in this room
in about 10 minutes on a bit more in
depth than all the stuff of this this
won't really be quick thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
