about the archive net I'm going to
way back in the beginning all the way
through to now what you need to do right
now to get ready to go through to the
next phase of net what that means and
why we're going there so that's the talk
today and they're making a couple of
claims here first of all by saying I'm
going to do this
so I'm implying that I think I had
something to say and I know something
here and second of all I'm claiming to
be independent and so I rarely show a
lot biocide but I think in this one it's
a fair thing to do to give you guys
that's not what you want to see that's
what you wanna see to give you a little
bit of background on me
habitat Microsoft space for a really
long time I did spend six months out of
it when my boss decided I spent too long
in it and he said I just went to work
for the company just went to work for me
said yeah I'm not going to do anything
for dotnet for a while cause I did fight
on and on a Mac and in AWS and all that
so I've been around a tiny bit but
mostly in Microsoft space I've been in
MVP since ninety 1998 and in my opinion
what that means is I've been a thorn in
Microsoft site for a long long long time
and happily they've mostly forgiven me
for it but I think that my job and your
job is to help Microsoft understand what
we need as real developers in the real
world because they do kind of live in an
ivory tower even though they do try to
get out and makes is there any Microsoft
people here nobody that I see good then
I can say anything I want great yeah I
didn't know whether somebody from the
team was going to show up which would be
great to answer questions and I really
don't care that much if i annoy them
they can they've pretty much forgiven me
but I have been contributing to the
languages and there's features in there
that I've helped to to get in and things
I've helped to fix and we're proud of
that's one things I'm proudest of in my
career and but they've done all the work
it's been great I'm just saying the
associate property for the null
reference operator is wrong and make a
big fuss about it
and yell a lot and then they fix it they
have to do all the real work so that's
me and let's look back it's beginning of
dotnet so let's kind of jump back in
around 2000 give or take a couple of
years around 2000 what did the world
look like because some of you weren't -
they're actually just so odd to think
about
some of you weren't there and some of
you that were there have really tried to
forget so I'm going to take you back and
let you remember first of all we had C++
and this is about what C++ look like it
was incredibly powerful and it could do
absolutely anything but just sort of
needed a team and you better know how to
drive it because you could get into a
lot of trouble that's sort of where C++
was around 2000 but there was another
player in the Microsoft space and that
was Visual Basic and what did Visual
Basic look like about like that it got
there it was the tortoise and the
tortoise and the hare race it always got
there in fact development went pretty
fast but it was kind of like movement so
it was a little old-fashioned a little
slow get to the finish line but you know
and I was a visual basic person I loved
it or basically I was C++ before
Microsoft so I do know C++ as well and
then there was the rest of the world
what did the rest of the world look like
from a Microsoft perspective if you
looked at across the landscape from
sitting from as a Microsoft developer
what did it look like the road ahead
didn't look so good
neither C++ nor Visual Basic could go
forward at that time they were too many
pressures on it Visual Basic had too
many shortcoming C++ was too hard to use
blah blah and starting in around 1995
that was this competitor out there it
was named after coffee for of all things
so Java was released in 1995 and by 2000
Java was getting increasing market share
and was really really the the
up-and-coming thing and as a Microsoft
person you're like yeah I know that JVM
runs everywhere but you know I know I
said we had still had a Microsoft tool
the politics are different we can only
be good with that so so we have Java and
Java was there and when you're sitting
on you have a summer ass ahead of you
and what do you do I mean how this is my
house what do you do you need you need a
mild mannered person who can come
jumping out of a phone booth right you
need Superman now you need to find Clark
Kent because you can't get Superman to
you have court kid to put in phone
booths till we get in the phones we
can't come out of the phone booth right
so you need a mild-mannered person who
can come jumping out of a phone booth
and save the day and where do you look
for a mild-mannered person who can save
the day in Denmark of course Joe and
ourselves were joined Microsoft in about
1996 and by 1998 the project cool was
named had a name cool
that stands for C++ C++ like see like
see like all of that is one c and c has
a soft C but hard seeing now because
it's a C but anyway so C that's the
first object-oriented see like
object-oriented language okay that's
what cool was unfortunately Microsoft
one of many times this has happened
Microsoft failed to check the trademark
before they named their tool and
therefore they had to change the name
and nobody had a good trademark on
c-sharp except for some musicians and
that was already like public domain and
so the musicians couldn't really claim
c-sharp and so we got c-sharp and that
was a great name and we've lived happily
ever after
so here comes along dotnet and dotnet M
C sharp so these two vehicles look a lot
the same and I'm going to do it have a
little bit of license here and someone
who really knows cars can later tell me
how long I am but for right now go with
me okay so the one on the left but they
look like they look about the same the
one of the left is actually souped up
Dodge Dart you don't know what a Dodge
Dart is I'm sorry I don't know the best
European analogy for a Dodge Dart but
it's an older vehicle fairly small
engine a smaller wheelbase and so it's a
it's kind of older at this point because
it 2007 five years old okay I'll be
honest I carry a swoop back cool-looking
Camaro maker in John ready to go okay so
these two cars are different but they
look the same things look the same
because they are designed to do
precisely the same thing car go straight
line fast short distance okay dotnet and
Java save your universe give you a
future forward in development that you
will be happy with we've been through
several like we're happy for a while now
we're not happy we're happy
for a while no we're not happy we needed
to be happy again and that was the
purpose of c-sharp in Java so let's take
a look at them together so Java was with
a strongly a statically typed language
with a manifest that means when you
picked up a dll you could look inside of
it and you could say hey this is what's
here then we had it was also
object-oriented class-based that's
pretty cool and it was semi interpreted
had something called a BM a JVM that
could run anywhere I was pretty cool
stuff in 1995
let's garbage collected English trace
garbage collection we pretty much have
three worlds of garbage collection no
garbage collection C++ good luck don't
make any mistakes now we had reference
counted garbage collection which was in
many tools including Visual Basic which
says when you create things that will be
expensive when you create things we will
set up to destroy them that's the short
story and there is by the way this one
really big catch which is if you do the
wrong thing
we will keep it forever and then we have
the third thing which is traced garbage
collections just a little newer at that
point a trace garbage collection says it
is fast as the Dickens to create
something but you know once in a while
you know how to give me a little time
because somebody's got to take stress
out it's going to take a little bit of
time so trace garbage collection pushes
that time always expensive to either
create a destroy it pushes that time to
send it in definite point in the future
when a lot of garbage will be collected
together and so I could explain all the
technical things behind it none of which
is interesting that's the only part that
matters and it had curly braces why do
curly braces matter because we think
we're still driving Humvee we think
we're still cool we think we're out
there right okay we love curly braces
and there was reflection which means
that code could look at itself and look
at other code and so these are pieces of
Java in 1995 2000 the same networks you
can look at net well statically and
strongly talk to his manifest we already
talked about what that meant hmm
object-oriented yeah we know what that
is okay
Oh different
it has a mesial instead the JVM and I
sound a little bit like a small thing is
you know three letters and four it
doesn't seem like it's a big deal
actually is because MSI l running on the
runtime the.net runtime he's far more
tied in it's more of a thin wrapper own
across the operating system and because
it was more difficult to ever have
dotnet get traction off of Windows
platforms with the Hobby was a little
bit of a hard sell politically okay no
it was a really hard sell politically
and because people that weren't on the
Windows platforms they didn't want have
anything to do with Microsoft that's why
they worked on Windows and so they
didn't absorb mono and he didn't absorb
the alternatives very well that was a
little bit different garbage collection
trace garbage collection dotnet did not
have trace garbage collection because
they were copying Java it had trace
garbage collection because it was the
best idea of the day
proved that by history because almost
every language that has done anything
since then uses trace garbage collection
okay so that was like the right way to
do that and we had curly braces in
c-sharp and we had reflection hmm okay
they look about the same but they
weren't the same there were also some
differences so let's take a quick look
at those and it's a very high level of
this so you could go a lot deeper into
this conversation first of all they have
some different types Java has attracted
an arbitrary position type which also
sequel house which is where if you only
do not Matt that's where you would have
seen this so like 8 characters to the to
one side of the decimal point five
characters to the other side of the
decimal point
that's what arbitrary position means
dotnet came along and he didn't have
that but it did have a full decimal type
so when most important types internet I
will keep saying this I my goal is this
year I'm sick every time I get on stage
you should use a decimal unless you know
for a fact you need the performance of a
double change all your doubles to
decimal but actually be careful because
it's a breaking change so be careful in
your codes that but you should use
decimal in all locations we do not you
do not have proof that you need a double
because you won't you won't find it
pretty much it means three people here
and the entire conference are actually
doing financial modeling and they
actually do need the double but nobody
else really needs it's very very rare
they're primitive types in Java this
biggest
okay so Java has a primitive typing in
the language it's baked in it's truly
part it's real it's special and then
they also have classes primitive types
do not come from a common root while
dotnet does not have that separateness
they have what's called a value type and
an integer is a value type a date/time
is a value type of gooood is a value
type all of things are a they're a spec
a specialization of a root type called
object so everything about that comes
from object this actually is a
difference primitive types have to be
wrapped they have no methods on their
own in net everything including an
integer can have a we can methods can
have properties it can even support
interfaces an integer sports and I
comparable interface and therefore has a
compare to method
cool okay different primitive and
reference types value in reference types
that we have defined new operators which
means if you create a point class or an
imaginary number class before dotnet had
it then you could add operators to that
enumerations of classes I'm not going to
go into this but what you call them in
them is fundamentally different in Java
and.net so there are differences there's
some pretty delegates well that's
another big one you know how we use
delegates because I function you know
say pointer to a function and all the
stuff we've been using it since 2000 so
it's a very very beginning we've got
that yeah not so much a job and because
of that Java has to use a series of
patterns to do exactly the same thing so
if you're a Java programmer you live in
breeze patterns deeper than that
programmers do is just because not
enough user for this particular set of
things done it's just easier okay so
there are different they are the same
that was the world and why do I go here
first is because there's some
fundamental things are the races on you
okay so there is some fundamental
differences in things that dotnet did
because of this history and they're
still with us and one of them I want you
to go back and change your code about so
there's two different languages C sharp
and B being fundamentally different
audiences c-sharp is designed to convert
Java programmers and VB was designed to
save Visual Basic programs and I would
argue that they both failed miserably at
what they set out to do so Visual Basic
programmers
I had a difficult time many of them that
did say I went to see sharp and even
early on I waited for a long time but I
did eventually drink the kool-aid and go
to C sharp and C sharp actually did
convert some Java programmers some super
spies I was going to me some C++
programmers but largely it also brought
new people into the industry they both
did and these were just really exciting
wonderful languages the day C sharp is
bitten by far at larger used today can
also six possible decisions in Java I
think I've touched on these before but
Donna had the opportunity to do things
differently so I could do things like
the common base types that were arguably
a improvement on Java and then here's
the big one is performance it was
believed that that dotnet would be dead
out of the gate if it wasn't as fast as
Java whether that's true and I see
irrelevant it was absolutely believed
and because of that there's one thing I
want you to go change in your code that
exists because of the performance race
in 2000 this is a long time ago can we
please get over this and that is a
failure to do integer checks and c-sharp
it is a very small performance hit today
very very very small it does mean that
every single time you do addition and
subtraction with an integer it's checked
to see if it's overflowed but every
single other mathematic thing you do
that overflows or does something else
from wrong throws an exception in your
face and you fix it
nope yeah no not so much an integer and
net you go to maximum value and add one
what you've got not an error you hit the
men value I think although I'm thinking
about that and we're thinking about the
bits and I was all of a sudden not sure
but I do think it is men value okay I
was just about sign dead since uh blah
blah but yes so maximum value goes to
minimum value minimum value minus one
goes to maximum value not what you meant
to do so check that particularly
particularly check that if there's any
place in your code that you are using
anything other than a long you're much
more likely to get bigger than the
maximum value if you're using a short or
a byte a couple of other things the same
thing there would like to see you change
that one okay so let's look at the time
because
to tell you guys I've done this talk
before and therefore I and I don't have
the time iPod I'm gonna grab my phone
I've noticed talk before and so there's
a possibility that I'm going to either
be short or long in which case we'll
have a chat or I will cut into John's
time which I'll try not to do we're fine
so far okay
okay so dotnet I've been saying mm but
that's because in 2000 we had a
beginning of a beta that was fairly
public and many people were actually
even going to production by 2001 late
2001 2018 February early February 2002
something like February with wind net
was actually fully released now the four
Yaiba we redid that so it was object or
transcribe which collection all the
things we said very painful for VB
programmers there's a whole separate
talk I could do on the arc of VB but it
would be like a tragedy instead of like
a a nice this is where we're going talk
so 2003 we had a release that nobody
remembers that net 1.1 and then we had
2005 for all practical purposes 2005 is
the beginning of time for dotnet that's
when things started being real we got
generic we got generics we got anonymous
methods iterators no levels a lot of
things that you can hardly think of the
language without we're not there prior
to 2005 and also by this point C sharp
did not suck as badly as it did when it
started and there is no question why
anybody went to c-sharp is beyond my
comprehension because one of the
differences between c-sharp and VB is
that VB was an incremental compiler from
day one vb.net has never been anything
else than an incremental compiler which
meant that intelligence actually worked
in visual basic.net first and guess what
c-sharp folks if you were there it
didn't you barely had syntax checking
and then by 2005 the parallel
interpreter that I mean was peril thing
that looked at the code and figured it
out in order to give you intelligence in
c-sharp
was starting to not suck too badly and
so by then c-sharp was usable
I coming from VB it was just like not
usable without intelligence but the VB
programmers would never have come so you
haven't tells us because if you be I
mean you would have eventually gotten it
I think but VB habit so it came into to
Visual Studio and the C sharp cutter
scope why don't we had that and they
said yeah because we have this really
fast compiler it's really cool it's a
great compiler it's a really really good
compiler but because it's a compiler
that doesn't run until you tell it to
run we got no idea about your code and
let me said yeah we don't care get over
it give us intellisense mi did which was
great so let's look at 2005 and what the
road ahead looked then and it was
actually kind of beautiful I did follow
just because it was pretty but I don't
mean to say it's like there was doom in
the air because we did not feel that at
least I didn't I don't think very many
people 2005 dotnet could or spell to
anything other then here's a great
future out there and we're ready to go
that's what 2005 felt like it was a good
time so let's go back and look it's a
couple changes they weren't much changes
in 2006 okay so they may remember what
happened in 2006 we got four things came
Betty named what they were know John is
never wrong I'm so happy now okay nobody
okay I'll give you three of them
okay Matt the fourth anybody I love this
any all of you here not one of you can
tell me the name of the fourth thing
some of you could tell me what it had
something to do with what link not like
no Lincoln comes out later no card space
the most forgotten major technology of
our time okay
2008 we got links so you were right but
you were off by a couple years okay
lambdas we got attention methods bunch
of fun stuff in 2008 you remember that
release right that was a fun release it
was just a lot fun great release 2010
was actually a big release for Visual
Studio so this is when Visual Studio got
rewritten that oh my gosh that was a
scary release I don't know if anybody
here was on the public beta but the last
public beta before release was unusable
slow you could not use it for real
development
flow that was the last public release
three months before release time guys
she's not going to go well and one of
the reasons was is that there was an
entirely new technology that Microsoft
decided to invent on its own because
well well
because and that was mess okay you may
remember the managed extensibility
framework or know what it is you know
what it is
was it better to do nobody knows
yes good you guys raise your hand and
wait for me to call you I'm not used to
it gosh I garden yes
I'm just going to call it dependency
injection if that's okay it's a bit like
a dependency injection but yeah there's
some differences and yes we could have a
conversation about that further I'm just
going to say dependency injection and go
with that okay so if you disagree with
me just deal with it okay it's close I
mean it really is close enough for offer
everything we care about but that's what
Visual Studio 2010 is entirely based on
it and map is not note with sufficient
performance and therefore shortly
during too late in 2010 lighten that
release and going forward mess split for
the first time and split twice in the
future is still unclear and I actually
had a business card as you say I assume
with the URL for a crystal meth labs so
what I used is my business for a name
for a while and so I was very
heartbroken that math is going nowhere
but now I think I'll give up the domain
if anyone wanted we also got PC Ellis
big thing I'm not going to talk as much
as you think I'm going to talk about PCL
today but that was how we could target
multiple things by saying I want to
target all these things please tell me
what I can still do as I target all of
this range of things and it tells you
the three or four things that you can
still do at that point that will work
across all of those features so yeah
okay what did it look like ahead in 2010
okay so this is a really interesting
time because the future started looking
vague and it started looking vague in a
way that Microsoft really never talked
about it like this and I've no idea what
other companies were thinking at that
point but Azure is launched at this
point
and Blanco sauce has begun to believe
that what it wants for the futures is
your CPU cycles okay that's the future
as they see it is own is having your
data and your CPU on their boxes so they
can charge you for compute than for
storage that this would be that is what
Asher is okay so their seizure is the
future they are starting to look to as
you're they're starting to pile up
reasons you want to go to as your by
giving you toys and tools and things to
make your life easier and thats their
job is to make it worth your time to go
to Azure but in 2010 has yours launched
and they start looking at a couple
things that are happening I forgot to
mention way back in 2003 on that slide I
did talk about the compact framework
that's Microsoft's first mobile attempt
this would be Microsoft ready to do
their third fourth fifth six or
something like that I used to think that
when Steve Ballmer said developers
developers developers under his breath
he was going developers it kept those no
mobile developers developers except
those mobile developers because
Microsoft managed to shut them so many
times I could not believe that anyone
was still developing for them and I'm
quite sure I know why because those
groups this is by top secret NDA don't
tell anybody they got some devices from
Microsoft sometime I think they were
strictly bribed because why would you
steal a do we still be an MVP when
you're standing up in front of people
going hey you should go to compact
framework oh gosh it doesn't support it
anymore
oh gosh you should do this oh gosh that
doesn't oh gosh it changed again so that
was the world as we had phones coming
onto the scene big way we measure and it
turns out they need the same thing that
was not actually obvious in 2009 it
became obvious fairly quickly afterwards
the biggest is a big and the small stir
small need exactly the same thing which
by the way is not this huge monolithic
dotnet giant thing removal that walks
into the room
that's know what anything is just a tiny
thing this is all I need okay here's the
box that's all I need to sit in the box
is a small box small box so we needed to
make this big shift okay and Microsoft
started thinking about this but they
were in serwe they were not ready for
this at all
they're going how're we going to do this
Tania was created starting in 1998 can
you even imagine the code that's in
there and at the same time that
compilers are a dozen times worse have
you ever even thought about what was
inside the compilers at this point you
would have just never slept at night
okay so the couple projects started
including Rosslyn project moving forward
to having a new compiler around 2010 so
2012 came along and we got a sink in a
wait one of the other things needed for
the small platform had to have a good II
think in a way story and I get slightly
annoyed at a sink in a way when I talk
to people because the complaint I hear
is if I use I think in a wait it's
everywhere I have to put it everywhere
and I know some of you are thinking yeah
it's really annoying you have to put it
everywhere okay and I think about this
analogy okay do you guys know what a
solar tube is it's a it's a round pipe
and it's very reflective and you put it
on your roof and it has a special
collector and then the light just
bounces down and you can get light into
a dark part of your house and so let's
say I have a laundry room in my basement
it's quite dark and I want to give it
some natural light such as Haley closet
about that I will just take the solar
tube and I'll put it on my roof and I'll
put that pipe down and it will come out
of my basement and won't that be nice
okay that's a sink and a weight over
here you've got something you can
actually wait for okay and you have to
pipe it back okay all the way back to
the thing that could actually possibly
weight in the windows world this is easy
you've got a unit you know that you're
waiting for people click buttons and
stuff like that that's the message the
message queues it sitting there okay you
know you're waiting okay you have to go
from the thing you are glad to a
different server to go get some data you
have to go all the way from that point
back to your to your place you could
actually wait asp.net you got this thing
over here that's going off to another
server might be slow you have to go all
the way back to iis and asp.net and your
infrastructure because that's what can
actually wait
okay that's why you have to go top to
bottom that's the short version my a
sink a weight talk but I thought I'd
share it while this came up on the slide
I'm kind of drifting a few directions
from what I said I'd talk about but
we'll get through it all so this is also
going to store ton of 4.5 introduced
support for something called etw and
this is another thing I went into I've
done like three or four things are like
I big-time I'm teaching this I'm going
into this and nobody ever cared suicide
workflow mess and atw and I'm so sad
that you guys are not you guys are go
anyway w does everybody here it's
anybody here other than maybe John and
it's only because he has struggles
trying to support it does anybody here
know what ECW is other than John what is
it thank you ha thank you if you're new
logging it can law get this 10,000
events per second and you won't be able
to find it in your profiling isn't that
interesting
okay look into event source in ECW we
got it a long time ago and it is helping
you even though you don't see it because
all of that new cool stuff that you get
in terms of profiling and all those new
features that little annoying graph that
you watch your own wonder what that's
doing all that stuff comes from etw okay
so that's 2012 okay
you also first-time Visual Studio has
backwards compatibility and you've got
the all-caps menu yay team yeah
okay so we got that and then she doesn't
213 comes along and we got that it's
just kind of small release in a lot of
ways we did get some stuff on wind farms
it was really important there and you
began embracing regular updates which
means we had a p1 up to queue up to
three up day four and what's big about
uptake for a Visual Studio 2013 is
immuno oh I don't know look at it here
you could check a box instead of going
to the registry to get rid of the
all-caps menu you guys do that do you
know that it's still really annoying
right
okay so 2014 2015 what did the road
ahead look like right now as you're at
this point is pretty darn good
AWS is pretty darn good Google
cloud is pretty darn good we got we got
cool stuff it's out there and we're
sitting on a rock not quite sure how
we're going to get there that's kind of
where we're at in 2014 2015 and this is
the point at which Microsoft sort of
gets out the cat out of the bag that is
going to redo everything everything now
at this point the Rockland projects
pretty much finished but they're going
to redo they're going to go to open
source they're going to get your head
around this they're going to redo the
dotnet framework now they didn't
actually say out loud big flashing
billboards we're going to rewrite the
dotnet framework because everybody
including the stockholders should have
freaked out if they did that but they're
going to look at every line of code
because that's the only way you can get
on to other platforms you have to find
every line of code that could hurt you
going to another platform and at the
same time you have to reorganize because
you can no longer be this big monolith
and this process has been in the darknet
team had been working on this in bits
and pieces and fits and spurts for quite
a while but at this point they fully
commit to the fact that they will create
a small componentized modulized net in
open source cool right and from that
point forward they have created full
confusion and that's really the rest of
this talk is trying to unwind the
confusion that came from that because oh
my gosh there's a lot of things to
decide now oh my gosh every time they
come up with - they came up with a new
word again oh my gosh where did I speed
our net 5 go well it's done it's a speed
on Bitcoin how how is that hard but it
is easier the thing is we got net 5 nbc6
and in the framework 7 so it is an
improvement but now oh my gosh they
rename things that was a year and a
month ago ok it's been chaos it's been
chaos and we're going to unwind that for
the rest of the talk ok 2015 rousing
revilers visual studio actually does
light up I know this is a terrible awful
like you know one of those weird little
advertising kind of things but this is
where we got perf tips you know how long
anything took when you're running in the
debugger if you haven't noticed those
little numbers so
important we got the debug peek which
allows you to use conditional
conditional breakpoints with some degree
of grace for the first time conditional
breakpoints have been there since 2000
there's nothing new about this but now
it's graceful you can get in there and
do it okay
and also the big news of 2015 it's the
default male no more all caps menus for
the default how many of you want to go
back to all caps menus as well tell you
how to do it
the check box is still there you go
check it if you want to okay they didn't
change that they just made unchecked by
default which was a really good decision
okay any questions so far so I'm going
to switch gears let's check my time too
and I hope I go till 11:20 because
that's how I'm going to talk to so
hopefully that's actually correct I
think it is okay so st dotnet i was
going to go through recipe dotnet and
then when i went through this in my you
know when i was planning and doing this
i get this one you guys are done with
history so i'm just going to put that up
there like take a quick look at it and
i'm not going to go through them
actually not it's familiar with asp.net
because I didn't think the internet was
going to go anywhere so I should invest
a lot in learning ASP I never did ASP
programming I did a lot of early espy
dinette programming and web forms right
side it really sucked and then I stopped
doing that and dismay MVC
early NEC stuff and that was great
except that MVC 4 came along and broke
everything I did not piss me off so it's
just been a rough ride for me so I'm not
going to go through that history in
detail okay so this is 2014 she's a
reminder of where we were and where
we're going to go because 2017 looks
about like this okay
we're building a bridge to the future I
mean that asking we really loosely
because I actually believe for a very
long time the community is an integral
part a non-removable part of the
Microsoft ecosystem and if I say like
that you go let's turn obvious you
remove us there is no ecosystem but
always Microsoft has had some ear to the
community I've been giving the feedback
for over 20 years now and that's a long
time they have been out there at times
try not to listen
and at times listening really well right
now they're really trying to listen so
when I say the word we it's not because
I work for Microsoft I know that's a
little bit confusing but we're building
a bridge always a kind of better looking
bridge than this well this kind of looks
like a you know under repair bridge but
we are looking at a bridge going forward
and that's why things are confusing so
the way I'm going to explain this is a
little different it will be a
sufficiently complicated slide by the
end that you will so that you're in the
right room
but but I'm going to do this a little
differently than you've seen it and I
really would like feedback at the end
about whether this adds any clarity to
what you've seen and you have seen lots
of boxes and I'll show you boxes because
well it's a dotnet course talk so how
could you not have boxes okay so what is
done in dotnet is a runtime remember
back at the very beginning we talked
about the JVM and MSI oh it is still a
runtime yes there is a native
opportunity we will have going forward
for the runtime will basically be baked
into the native and go out that already
happens on phones
it happens which it doesn't make sense
once you push out but we have a runtime
even if it's native it's just put in
earlier if we do that with some
libraries how many libraries we need
array and that kind of thing and now we
need an editor yeah we got a right stuff
we need that and probably need a
compiler okay that's kind of not net and
from Microsoft's perspectives they could
tell you all the distinctions between
those four things which have generally
been in four distinct very different
teams okay but for us in general it's
been yeah that's what I do for a living
it's been one big blob and I want to get
a little closer to one big blob than
what we've been able to hear from
discussions of this so what it'll take
to develop and how do we make this make
sense in terms of our process so one of
those organize it let's just lay it out
so you have an editor and then that is
sometime within the compiler involved
and we have some libraries but the
libraries actually there's several
important library categories so for one
we have a set of things I am going to
call basic libraries I struggle this
with this word because
once upon a time the word you would have
put here within the word core that words
been used associated with bcl in the
past but I can't do that anymore because
it would be exceedingly confusing and I
struggled with the word and I came up
with the word basics nothing to do with
visual basic this is just the old bcl
stuff this is a ray and a sign numerable
and it's linked and it's all the stuff
that comes along and it's an inherent
part of what you do is dotnet then we
need some UI libraries okay so we need
something along the way to communicate
and we need some data libraries so the
very concept of UI libraries in our
world is pretty vague so that could be
complete rid of that we only got purple
box anymore
I'm going to call this delivery delivery
libraries or delivery framework because
this includes asp.net it includes uwp
includes WinForms I actually think
winform still has a future does anybody
agree with me nobody really okay you
come back here in two years and tell me
if there's a takling WinForms in two
years because I might be giving it oh
but no I think that WinForms actually
because its simplicity actually still
hasn't has a future
it just is going to require that we get
off of this complete we're going to do
everything on the web crap that we've
been doing and get back to the fact that
something so belong on the web and once
we get back to that I think WinForms
will have a future again but we don't
have to argue that that's a different
conversation but we do have asp.net
fundamentally in that box right there
now this is wrong because well that's
not what the compiler goes really the
compilers job is just to pull all that
stuff together and there's one thing
that's still missing from this slide and
that's your code okay so now can you
guys just give me a little bit of
feedback here can you relate to this as
a way you do your job does this make
some sense out there
nods heads no nods heads what do you
think is this is this make some sense
because I want you to understand what's
coming in relation to what you actually
do times you have a comment yeah let's
do that let's say tool change you're
right there's other things in the tool
chain other than just compilers and I'm
just saying compilers so let's clear
for that okay so this is the way I'm
going to talk about your job I'm going
to talk about from that perspective
rather than Microsoft what group who
reports to who and all that crap okay so
the first thing I want to do is kind of
get it out of the way a little bit so I
have some more room and then I
accidentally went back to libraries I
apologize that the editor what do we
have so just I'm going to stick with the
stuff that I know I'm afraid I did not
put writer on here a price should be
Visual Studio Visual Studio code and
probably project writers should be there
as well
then we have your code it's your code I
don't have much to say about it you have
a lot to say about it
delivery libraries what do we have we
have UWP WPS we have wing forms I didn't
click on the slide we have asp.net 4x
and we've a speed on a car and we have
xamarin forms and it's more of them in
the December and forms I just decided to
clarify by self saying to examine forms
so far everybody's so good right nothing
hard yet data libraries no that's I'm
going to put any framework 6 any of core
we not put a deonette on here because
there's really not changes but to let
you know if you haven't already heard a
vo net does go to core so it is in the
dotnet core framework but there's
complexities and where I put it
how many of you use a do net instead of
entity framework not very many okay good
good for me no no we're going to be the
basic libraries and here we have the
dotnet framework and I'm kind of lunging
some things a little bit together but
everything other than the runtime we
have core effects which is one of the
names given to dotnet core pieces that
are living outside of the runtime and we
have xamarin which is sort of a big blob
that I stuck in there to represent the
pieces of mono that exists outside of
the runtime okay so with me then we have
the run time the run time we have CLR we
have core CLR and mia mano okay
now you look at this and you say well
all those things in all in the middle
they say core they must be part of done
and Corinne you're absolutely right and
the things along the bottom well that
looks like Dameron so it's mono for
zamarons one of the ways that whole
group has been described
you think this once across the top would
be simple too but we couldn't have that
we're building a one of these little
graphic things and we need to make it
nice and complicated and so we need to
do something hard here so there's the
hard thing and I can't make that with
like rounded corners so what we're
saying here is that a speed on that core
and in the framework core will run both
on core and on the old framework okay
there are many good reasons for this I
won't go into them but one of the things
you can do is if you really want to
asp.net core you can do that without
committing to dotnet core okay
so there's various versions of this
slide and at this point you I should be
cross and going I just want to develop
code that's a reasonable thing to say
when faced with variations of this slide
okay so actually surprisingly for
perhaps Microsoft actually understands
that it actually surprised me because a
year ago six months ago I was having
conversations like oh my gosh you had no
idea how badly people's eyes glaze over
six months before that I was going to
have any idea what it's like to stand up
on stage that keeps us straight if it
undefined nbc6
in the framework seven and at least we
got past that garbage so at least we did
that okay but still it's still pretty
messy okay so can you explain that to
your boss do you want to explain that to
your boss that gives me a headache to
think about so no I don't want to
explain that to anybody it's a mess so
let's take a timeout and Microsoft
actually did this as well as is me
screaming Microsoft actually also said
ya know this is a lot so let's see what
we can do to make this better now just
I'm saying that and so Microsoft did
this only for you but what I'm going to
explain also made Microsoft's life in
the order of magnitude easier and before
I go there I want to just briefly talk
about open source so open source is
great I'm not sending open source as bad
open source gives us a lot of really
cool things you pick your favorite up
here maybe you can add a couple more
things open source brings us really cool
things this is the right track to be
but it's not without its challenges and
challenges one of the things is some big
quality metrics and I mean two things by
this one of which is a general role on
the internet the general world I guess
was a general rule wherever you're going
through your open source stuff
what beta means is pretty vague there's
things have been out there with
everybody using them quite happily cold
betas like still okay and there's other
things that are out there with betas
that oh my gosh please don't touch that
okay so it's a little vague and from
Microsoft's perspectives the big thing
to understand here is that Microsoft's
idea of completion has changed entirely
once upon a time before 2017 if
Microsoft gives you visual studio 2015
with.net four point five point two four
point five point one and c-sharp six and
you could say great and a new version
any framework all bundled together great
happily I'm very happy I just bundled it
comes together and is quite nice
Microsoft last spring released as
connect core and dotnet core in release
and they said oh yeah the tooling is a
little weak like Oh weather isn't any
and gosh on the other hand at the build
system we have in there for SPI net core
yeah that's going away okay this is what
I mean by quality metrics this has
changed and it will not go back at least
not for a very long time and so this
makes the world you look at look
different and if you don't understand
that you're going to stub you toes so
you're going to have to listen to people
you have to find people I fully believe
that they will become voices in the
community that a group of you decided to
trust this person and group if you
decide to persist person maybe it'll be
me maybe be John maybe will be you but
there's going to be people that say this
is what I think right now about going
forward and as part of that I will tell
you what I think
but please I want to do the best I can
and ask me questions if I'm not clear on
this as to where it's my opinion about
where you should go
versus what's actually real and
everything I've said right now I think
is real ok I bet a little bit I'm going
to tell you some things that are real
like this is what I think
should do and that's opinion so I said
various meaning of what beta means
changes during data things will change a
little bit more the whole bill system
changes oh they'll be able to upgrade it
oh that means everybody my team has to
upgrade on the same day thank you that's
not easy managing granularity so I
worked on a order if I saw a node
project I swear this is true the sad
thing is I counted it had in its
packages file nine hundred entries nine
hundred your brain exploded someplace
around one hundred okay so it's just
crazy without their terms granularity
hopefully dotnet will have some sense
about this and we will not go that far
because really should never ever ever
have more items in your packages files
thank you can evaluate the current
status of if you can't figure it out
don't put it in there okay yeah there's
this little pad less problem that
happened why did it happen because
people in camp they weren't following
they couldn't keep up with the current
status of the things that they were
using and the synchronization of
releases will be different okay so I
will tell you right now that there has
been an announcement the Visual Studio
2017 will be a lot and that would be
there's an announcement that Visual
Studio 2017 will be released in spring
of 2017 okay nice there has also been an
announcement that dotnet standard I'll
tell you in a minute what dotnet
standard is 2.0 will be released in
approximately spring 2017 those two
releases will probably not be
simultaneous I'm sure everybody would
love it if they were we would love it
they would love it everybody would love
it they are not going to fight very hard
for it
so if one's ready it'll go the others
really it'll go they're not trying to
coordinate that that's a different world
we just need to know we're in a
different world and then we can be happy
we can learn the new patterns we can
figure it out okay and then the road
maps will be crap okay I'm not going to
say that any lighter than that you
should not a somebody's doing a road map
right now three years out open source
stuff things will change it will change
be a little bit patient with that don't
bet a lot on road maps anymore you go
back two years what's the red maps and
tell me if you agree okay so yeah they
will be
not very
aníbal that's an opinion I'll say that
okay and the thing is that this is where
you were in Microsoft if you're in the
Microsoft world if you wanted to have
nine hundred packages and your
dependency file you already left okay
you're not there anymore so Microsoft
needs to address these things and they
actually have and so how do we go back
to this okay and say clap what how do I
even make sense of this okay so first of
all I'm going to argue you can do this
you can do this no problem you can
handle your code no problem I'm going to
argue you know what delivery platform
you want no problem okay I'm going to
argue this fart you were totally good
I'm also going to say that you guys as a
general group except for like three of
you already made a decision on your data
platform you've got this this part
you're good this far you're good
the problem is that the rest of this you
never had to think of at all zero not a
bit now oops oops what's going on over
there that's all the stuff I never
thought about what's going on there now
so Microsoft did a great and wonderful
thing which they did an appalling job of
explaining and that was all of that is
now can be now considered under an
umbrella called called dotnet standard
okay all of that all of that can now be
considered dotnet standard now that's
not entirely true because NuGet packages
that you need a lots going to come out
on nougat not all that will be indented
standard but there is a big part of that
like everything you think of is dotnet
that's that's part of that standard so
you're going great what's done is
standard and you go yeah okay so I'll
tell you this and then I'll tell you in
English okay so the diamond standard I
just got it here okay it contains all
these things okay there it is that's the
definition of it and so it's Madonna
standard is an API it's rules
it's a documentation it's kind of like a
standard except it doesn't follow
standard format because Wow let's see
how we're going to do we're going to
actually give you this how can you
actually get a hold of it and look at it
okay yeah we're going to do that in code
we're going to give you a bunch of
libraries you're supposed to match those
libraries and that's what we're going to
do and there's some Ridge
reasons behind this but if people start
talking about what dotnet standard is
they often then also fall over into how
it might be implemented and they start
talking about redirects and blah blah
blah but none of that you care about you
don't care whether a particular piece is
taken and written for hole on the
platform you're interested in completely
just rewritten or whether it's a
redirect from a piece of standard code
all you care is that it works so diamond
Center is a whole bunch of rules that if
everybody follows what you can do is
write your kid once well gosh that's
where you want in the first place let me
just write to one thing don't make me
write this to dotnet corn mister dotnet
framework and I've got to make this
decision I've got to do that you don't
have to do that that's the whole point
of dotnet standards so and does anybody
I mean this is something some of you
guys do know about sirs anybody want to
say that I'm wrong about that it's a
pretty good explanation ok so all the
stuff you heard about down is standard
and you'll feel a lot of it is terribly
confusing and oh my gosh now you got to
keep done at corn dotnet standards right
dinah core core everything's core core
is a new stuff dyno standard is this
overarching umbrella so overarching
umbrella so why do we need this really
complicated chart okay wow what the heck
so what this says is a dotnet standard
2.0 I'll start on the side so you can
easily look over there done if standard
2.0 will be supported by the next
version of.net core I can't promise I
have a name for that I can say but you
could probably guess it and you wouldn't
be far off
the next version net core the next
version of mono for xamarin platforms
and the next version of UWP it will be
supported by 4.6.1 because it is largely
defining what what dotnet standard is
this solves a problem you may have heard
about where dotnet core just doesn't
have enough api's you just can't do
enough in it ok it solves this problem
by saying that dotnet core to me dotnet
standards must promise to do all these
things that you by the way think you
need for your development so it matters
to you whether
things are available so for these things
will support 2.0 now how confused are
you right now on a scale from one to ten
he wants to tell me that they're
confused above an it you're totally
confused you're totally freaking at noia
I'm talking about okay how many of you
totally have it you're below a three
you've got this you understand I've
explained it you totally have it good
there's some good that's more okay
unless other people were just hold their
hands down who are consuming all okay
the most you're in the middle okay
the idea is over you really need to get
this so take take my approach to it
listen to other people's approaches to
it and get what you understand on a
standard you write your code saying it
will your code will write to.net
standard which means you will only use
pieces that are in.net standard you are
not going to use an out-of-date obsolete
version of XPath it's not there you're
not there's certain things that aren't
there the vast majority of them are
things you will never know are not there
there are some things you might have to
do a little bit differently and the core
for this the thing is they worked off of
with largely dotnet 4.6.1
which allows you to mostly do the things
that you're doing that not everything
and dotnet 4.6.1
is in.net standard everything in dotnet
standard 4.6.1
will do that make sense you write
tinnitus Anna is somewhat limited not
massively limited but somewhat limited
and then your code should be able to run
anywhere do you believe me you should
not believe me okay let me just say that
John is going to say something if he's
not going to say you should not believe
this then I'll listen gets questioned a
minute but you should not believe that
why should you not believe that oh let's
just pick one the registry what's the
registry on Linux anybody no it doesn't
exist okay but does that mean that we
should not allow you to put information
in the registry but wait
the major reason you're putting
information in the registry because on a
Windows platform that is how you tell
something something permanent about a
setting in your application well Linux
it's called a knife I'll show what's
going to go to a registry in Windows
should go in most cases to an ini file
is it the same no if you're putting
something in the registry for some other
program to look at your host kit do it
you have to do it some other way you use
those some before or something okay you
with me on all of this okay so yes it's
going to be there but there will be some
things maybe 20 think 20 something like
that that are going to either work
fundamentally differently or if you get
on our own platform it's just going to
throw a runtime exception which sucks
and I am they have said very publicly
they will be able to write analyzers
they have not yet said publicly they
will write analyzers and I recommend we
hold our feet to the fire on that one
because we need those analyzers John did
you have a different question okay yes
and I almost didn't show that part of
the slide because it's actually quite
simple remember for the the dotnet
framework can hold things that these
dotnet standard does not have four point
six point to introduce a couple of new
ap is a small handful of API at one
point they believe that those api's were
going to be in dotnet standard they then
decided that the that they weren't worth
it and that there was very very few
people had used them and dotnet standard
1.5 so there is a breaking change is the
long story there is a Brecon change
between 1.45 and 2.0 and it's believed
to be extremely small effect almost
nobody but there are few API is that
when 462 that were expected being
standard that will not be there yes if
you have anything that works on one side
that did not work on 1/4 then you could
have from that is a great way to check
it and if you actually fund have a
problem with that you know contact the
team just because it might not be you if
you have trouble contacting the team and
you don't want to click the little
button up in the upper right of Visual
Studio
you can also contact me okay I will get
that message to the team okay
hey about five minutes left so are we on
track scary isn't it that's a big ugly
saying my suggestion this is my
suggestion my opinion now is that you
shouldn't touch that standard until 2.0
and then as soon as 2.0 seems to be
stable in terms of what you're hearing
in the community you should in fact
begin writing your applications your new
applications and convert your old at
least to know where problems are to
dotnet standard because dotnet standard
gives you that flexibility going forward
and I am right now talking about a
dotnet 4.6 app and normal old dotnet
framework up what almost all of you have
almost all of you do not have production
core apps right now that's your normal
app look at moving on to standards
that's its role is to take you forward
in the future with this little pain as
possible and before this I thought this
was going to be just only slightly
better than what happened to Visual
Basic programmers in 2000 and now I
believe that it is probable high
probability that we're going to make
this change with relatively little blood
and tears that is going to not be
completely pain-free but that frame that
pain is not going to require very much
morphine which keeps going to be okay
okay so don't expect to be free but also
recognize that this change because of
this snow dance standard should be
relatively good they are desperately
trying to make it all work right now
because it does require rewriting almost
all the dotnet framework I'm going to
skip over this it goes back to that this
is a repeat of that slide and now I'm
going to talk about another topic
quickly which is a support tracks I
never thought I would have to stand up
on stage and explain support tracks and
I'm so sorry but there are two trains
you have to pick which train you're on
well there's three trains how many of
you want to be on the nightly build okay
forget that
okay so you read on the long-term
support or fast track support and here's
the difference let's just kind of look
at that quickly this is the difference
and I could not make PowerPoint work
correctly the dots not lining up on the
top and the bottom when there's that
little I can switch
tracting like you have in the subway
okay they're supposed to be exactly in
London I just can make PowerPoint do it
so you can easily switch at those spots
but if you jump onto the fast-track
train at two point two okay jumping back
on to the other train is likely to be
difficult okay so so the problem with
this is my guess it is a guest not even
really an opinion yet is that for two
the two series you will want to be on
fast track okay
and the reason is I don't think they're
going to get it right I think there's
gonna be lots of tweaks I think two one
two three I think these are all going to
be relatively yeah you kind of got to
get there okay so that's my guess but
then after that you probably won't want
to be on the long term support track
because mostly that's what you're used
to
they gave us a version of Visual Studio
and 18 months later they gave us another
one well let me change that and three
months later they gave us an update but
those updates were really they were
really pulled together and now you're
not so much these are bits and pieces
around the edges and it's going to take
effort on your part to figure out when
to go so the difference between these is
the three months is that you three
months after they release the next one
the old one is no longer supported on
the fast track
okay I hope that makes a little bit of
sense I'm going to go on just because
I'm just about out of time and I do want
to get to this so the takeaways of
Leslie pointer ok the takeaways from
this are first of all I didn't go into
this deeply but in the history I hope
you kind of got someplace there's that
we really cast to change we were on a
rock the future was beautiful and we
couldn't get there okay dotnet was 15
years old it could not go forward
without massive change we had to do this
this is not Microsoft trying to make
your life difficult so the second thing
is that it looks really painful before
dotnet standard I was quite concerned as
how we were going to teach it it's been
a very painful year and you should
appreciate all the people not me because
I didn't do much of it that really took
a big bet on net core and as part of
that helps make it better and understand
that we needed that standard
you need to pick the right support track
for you I do think it's going to be
difficult at first and then this is
going to be a great strategy after that
one of the things I think is going to
happen is that it will be difficult for
them to not want people to all go to
something like a 2.2 and I don't know
how they're going to handle that so
again you are going to have to be more
plugged in than you're used to being you
guys are all of this conference you're
used to being plugged in at some level
you'll want to stay plugged in this year
go to 4.6.1 if you possibly can if
you're on an earlier version upgrade to
that is a first step no reason to go to
462 right now unless there's something
in that update otherwise that you want
but the actual API surface area does not
matter
watch for standard 2.0 and it comes out
use if you can I mean give it a few
weeks don't like they dumped in is
something that you're not ready for but
I think you want to move forward onto
that and switch to ESPN or net core
whenever you want to I think they're
going to get not pretty good you can
find out more about that several talks
here and watch for a new framework I
think it's behind any framework so
struggling they have an amazingly
aggressive set of goals and that is made
it difficult for them to dot the i's and
cross the t's on the normal everyday
stuff that you want so keep an eye on
any frameworks that might keep you from
going to dotnet core on the you may not
want to go to any framework core so that
may delay when you go to dotnet core and
then I do think core is a brilliant set
of principles it's great it's modern
principles it's going to take us into
the future and I am very excited about
it I just don't want you to go into it
thinking yeah I'm just going to whatever
Microsoft says because if you do that
you will go insane and the reason you
will go insane is you will listen to
three different people at Microsoft and
you will hear three different things you
will listen to 20 different people at
Microsoft and you will hear 20 different
things so you're going to hear insanity
out there I do suggest that we as a
community we try to coalesce around a
couple of idea sets however we do that
whether it's curated or whether it's
individuals so that you can say you know
what I'm just going to listen to X and
it's probably not going to be Scott
Hanselman anymore because Scott is one
of the people that's out there pushing
new stuff for different reasons is I
think it's going to be people in the
community and we need to find out the
right way to do that whether
it's organizations whether it's
individuals however do that but that is
my story on the archive net and I'm very
excited about the future very excited
about the next 10 years very excited we
have a tool of it can takes into it and
I want to thank you so much for sharing
this ride with me and I'm going to thank
you and let you go on with your day so I
hope you have a great day and thanks
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
