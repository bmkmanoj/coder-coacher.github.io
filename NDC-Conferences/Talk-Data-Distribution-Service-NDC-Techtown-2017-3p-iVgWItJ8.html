presentation my name is Lars I'm
currently working for a dot response and
I'm going to present my experience with
the DDS protocol I'm gonna show um there
was a customer Alstyne wanted to use DDS
wanted to try this and thought responds
got involved so I'm gonna talk a little
bit about that project then I'm gonna go
through some protocols like we call them
competitors try to place DDS on the huge
tree of different protocols and go
deeper into DDS and then at the end I'm
going to try run my very ambitious demo
project here if everything goes
according to plan I don't know the
hardware worked myself and I'm a
software guy so this is gonna be
interesting
it's usually what fails first is the
soldering just goes up and I've also
transported this on the train and so
yeah let's just try okay so Alstyne
which you might know makes ships and
they build the ships and I also make the
control system for the ship what we have
a picture of hair is a very nice boat
and here it's the an example of the
control system in the bridge and what
all stents set out to do was to create a
new control system for about on to make
such a control system you need to get a
grip on all the analog digital input
outputs that is existing on the boat and
they are all gathered in IO cabinets for
instance the propulsion system has one
or two or maybe three cabinets full of
i/o controllers and these our controls
are usually PLC's
so they handle the low-level Modbus
rs-485 canvas all that stuff happens in
those cabinets and old dos later become
digital analog signals or not analog
signals David Deji to talk but you know
like numbers and bits then they need to
be presented around the boat and on
operator system on operator stations and
on panels and they need to be logged and
as an example we have a view of a gas
tank cargo here this is from the final
product but it's just to show the
complexity of the task let's say the
boat has several tanks filled with gas
you want to keep track of how much is in
each tank you want to be able to open a
closed valves to control this and maybe
you want to pump like here pump here
wolves everywhere and thanks with the
percentage of usage and the signals that
are important here our tank levels
alarms valves pumps etc like for
instance the yellow p2 there means it's
an alarm because it's a low level and
then you have p1 which is too high level
on the tank
so usually when you build such a system
you expect to do a lot of manual labor
like a lot of engineering work to get
all the signals to the right places you
have to sit down and configure every PLC
and set up everything which takes a lot
of hours to design a new ship so
understand had previously attempted to
make a message based middleware to to
control the ship they tried to make a
control system by themselves from
scratch
based on Modbus TCP and they tried to
make their quality of service themselves
but it didn't scale very well there was
just latency it was very hard to control
because all the data was going
everywhere and everyone was processing
everything so that was tricky and also
since they used middleware that was
based from the vendors the bonds getting
tight to the hardware vendors so you're
stuck with one type of bio controller
all around your ship and that's not a
very flexible solution you can't
customize the cost of the ship that way
if you only use one provider like if you
can choose between three or four
different providers you can put them up
against each other and you can make
things cheaper so that was a kind of a
big motivation for them so what I set
out to do was to make a scalable
distributed control system that used
rugged and standardized components and
communication with the layered and
testable software design which was
Hardware independent so I was kind of
ambitious they also wanted to do it in a
very short amount of time and I don't
have that big developer
Bates themselves so and what response as
well but you also have to start thinking
what can we buy that is already working
so they chose to use DDS for the
mid-lower its scalable distributed and I
wanted to make a system where you can
plug and play everything you you can
take this computer with Linux on it and
an application just plug it to the ring
of the network here and then it's just
supposed to work so imagine this is a
panel that is supposed to show the
valleys and the tanks we were looking at
earlier then this will be configured in
a configuration program to show all the
tank signals all the signals that has to
do with them then you would just plug it
in and assume it's working and sometimes
it does
so the software to be rugged and
standard they based it on Linux and
shows a lot of open standardized
software libraries like Boost C++
standard library stuff like that and
then the DDS and they try to make it
layered so that you only focus on your
business logic and your functionality
then you let TDS do all the middleware
stuff and then you can also make test
functionality and just plug it right
into the denier and DDS Network and also
to make it hardware vendor independent
they had to build a layer of TDs on top
of all the PLC's so they were basically
telling the vendors that we want an API
to your i/o controllers and then we want
to mix that with DDS and make all the
data available directly on the DDS
network so that was the task at hand and
here is an example of the result you
have this is an alarm view of about that
it's of course a simulator because they
have 956 alerts so you wouldn't want to
be on this ship and as you can see there
are p1 alerts which means high priority
and then you have yellow alerts which
are not that hard high priority and what
I'm hoping to illustrate with this this
is a snapshot of their graphical user
interface and what I'm hoping to
illustrate is that they have set up a
filter on this and said we want all
alarms then you have the different
sections of the ship in the circle here
it's impossible to read but it's like
engines power management propulsion
pollution cooling and then you take this
graphical user interface you plug it in
to the network ring and everything just
appears magically and I'm gonna tell you
how and how that works but in in summary
the the outline project ended up being a
flexible control system where the DDS
greatly reduced the development time and
we came up with the term during the
development that this was like a happy
magic cloud because because you have a
discovery protocols so when you plug
things into the network DDS
automatically reads the data and you're
set up which data you want so we have
the feeling that there's some kind of
magic going on data just goes wherever
you want it to go which was nice I'm not
gonna go very much into detail about the
earth Stan it's more like just a show
off of a happy project using DDS but
maybe there are questions about the
old-time stuff before I head on to the
technical protocols
yeah
see
I guess
Oh
yes I feel like you want the alarms to
show up and
hmm
any considerations
yeah briefly with the the alarms
you have characterization in the
graphical but you also have you can also
setup that the type of data that you
have will have priority over the order
data so I guess if you have an alarm you
would set it to prioritize over
everything else
so if your system is very loaded then
the alarm would be get true and all the
data might get delayed and so that can
be handled as for security and hacking
and stuff that wasn't considered like
someone could probably connect to the
system and start sniffing the DDS data
but that's quite common in such chip
networks yeah DDS has started making a
DDS secure which will meet this
requirement but we didn't experiment
with that during this project and the
others
okay
so when working with the DDS it's nice
to know where the DDS places itself in
relation to other big standards like why
do you need DDS you have other internet
server cloud standards to choose from
and especially when it comes to an
Internet of Things which is a buzzword
so I have to have it there you want to
know like which protocols exists and why
do you want to choose DDS for your task
and then you need to consider where your
software is placed if it's fast you want
to stay in the device-to-device domain
where devices communicate little pieces
of data all the time then you have the
device server which is more like you can
say device to cloud or data pushing up
to the internets and then you have a
server to server which is other
protocols and you have for example XMPP
which is extendable messaging presence
protocol which was made for instant
messaging and works best device - server
and server to server it's a nice
standard but it has an encryption no it
has a dressing squirt well it's scales
quite well but there is no quality of
service in it so say in the example of
Alstyne if you were to use this then you
wouldn't really have the time in
requirement you wouldn't meet their
timing requirement for say send an alarm
if the ship is going really badly so you
can't use this and for Internet of
Things it's it's nice for server to
server and device - server
you have AMQP which is very secure it's
made for banking transactions and they
can give you a reliable message delivery
at most one at least one exactly one and
encryption
it is message oriented so it doesn't
give you the data centric approach of
TDS but it's it's very secure mqtt
device the service service server this
is a lightweight protocol where you send
data from little devices and into the
cloud that's the kind of traditional way
of doing it sending things to the server
but there's also a single point of
failure if the server goes down so they
are not very intelligent devices this
way because it's a centralized approach
a co-op is small lightweight for
point-to-point communications
so I guess what I'm trying to say is
that DDS is cover both device to device
device - server and server to server and
it's scales and has Kuo's which makes it
huge so you can see DDS covers
everything which is also why the
protocol can be a little bit large to
start grasping and look at all the
possibilities of it so when should you
use DDS you typically use it for large
systems that will take a long time to
develop and will grow to multiple
versions and lasts for a long time
complex systems and you use it when you
need really fast no latency just lots of
lots of data sending between different
applications and you don't have a single
point of failure it's very easy to set
up redundancy because everyone is
talking to everyone so the data stays in
the network so when do we not choose DDS
if you don't need it if it's something
simple point-to-point or or if you have
very tiny microcontrollers you just want
to send a little bit of data then you
don't take the bother of learning the
entire DDS and buying an implementation
and using it it's it's kind of it's a
broad standard so it does a lot of stuff
which you won't need if you could just
send UDP packets or Google protocol
buffers or whatever if that's all you
need
DDS is probably not for you this is an
example of that it's huge it covers both
clouds the fog and the edge
which means you can set up a system with
a lot of small devices which lives in
the edge communicates to each other
directly and this is the ring from all
time where you just connect the network
right in and all the data just goes
magically between all the devices then
you can start setting up domains and
central domains and supervisors and all
that stuff and start using heavy tools
and and you know there was a requirement
in all stand to do logging of all the
data so typically you take a server and
you set it up to just log everything
that comes in that means it subscribes
to all the data that is in the loop and
all the data will also be sent to that
server in addition to all the devices
then you have a logging system
yeah
so the goal is to have a middleware that
hides your platform from you so we don't
have to know the operating system you
don't have to know IP addresses of what
you connect and there's a lot of stuff
you don't have to set up once the DES is
running because they it's basically it
sends a lot of multicast packages
everywhere to discover each other and
then builds its own network topology
discovers who listens to who and then
you don't have to do that yourself there
are a lot of implementations and also
Kongsberg has one I have no experience
with it don't know anyone does anyone of
you have used this yeah yeah did you
create it or just okay when I was making
this presentation I I learned that well
after I said yes to doing this
presentation someone told me oh did you
know that the people have comes Berg
have their own implementation and that's
like okay so I'm coming here like a
total noob and telling you guys and you
already know everything but so we
discussed and we said like it's like
being a hyena talking to the Lions about
in their lion cave so good and I didn't
try the Kongsberg one yeah
they bought one yeah that's kind of why
it was fast I think if we were to
implement our own DDS we would still be
sitting here doing this
so they're basically they're both the
RTI one they're both licenses for that
and they're quite to establish they have
XML configuration of everything in I
don't know how Kongsberg is it's all
secret I guess
it's
huh
and you know if they can talk together
they're okay
okay cool good
so yeah so the goal of the DDS is that
the right data to right place at the
right time right data is done by
filtering you can set up content
filtering edge filtering life cycle data
rates the right place
that's the discovery stuff I was talking
about where everyone discovers each
other it's also set up so that the
subscriber knows if a publisher is down
which is kind of useful for for instance
safety the month and the right time
that's handled with quality of service
policies where you can set up a lot of
stuff you can set up for instance if if
there has been so on so much time since
the last package was sent you can say
that this device is probably dead you
can have deadlines reliability
importance you can prioritize all the
packages so that the important stuff
gets sent first and the network from
software point of view looks like this
you set up as a publisher you set up
data writers which sends topics and then
as a subscriber you set up a data reader
who writes the topic who reads the
topics like topic be sent by data writer
and then there are three data readers
listening to this topic and DDS
middleware knows these connections like
they have they know about these lines
here so if these three are not there the
data never goes anywhere basically so
well communicated so I tried to make
example case which builds up to my demo
to explain these data variety of data
reader concepts and the case here is
that my computer which looks like that
will send color to a Raspberry Pi with
LED LED which can send which can be red
green blue yellow so that's the color
data looks like this and this is an
ideal file does a standard as well from
oMG I guess you use IDL as well and then
RT gives you the possibility to just
generate the code you input IDL file and
you just press run and it generates a
lot of codes everywhere
looks like this so the interesting files
here are the lead publisher lead
subscriber then you have all these data
files which just handle how the data
looks like in the relations to the data
then you have the heroes here in an XML
file so you can specify what you want
your cues to look like okay
so in our case you first have to specify
the domain you will be working because
there might be several domains and they
don't know about each other
that
then you have to set up participants to
tell software that you are participating
on the main one then you have to specify
if you're a subscriber or publisher like
so and then you have to set up data
writers and data readers for the color
the color is a topic plus the data we
will be sending and receiving and the
cues yes I don't know how to explain do
you do XML as well or if you have your
own format food hmm
okay you can choose
RDI chose to use XML for that but I
think I think you can do it in the
application as well without touching XML
and typically it's stuff like you set up
to raya reliability and the interesting
thing here is the history tag at the
bottom where you tell your data writer
to keep all the sample it has been
sending so it just every time it sends
the sample it stores it in a big
database for later use and the same is
true for the data reader here it's set
up to keep the 10 last samples that
you've been sent that's useful for late
joiners when you plug in a device that
wants this data later on then these data
readers and writers will cooperate and
send the data where they are supposed to
be then you can have ownership of data
which prevents everyone else from
sending the data except you if you have
the highest on the ship string and you
can have redundancy where the ownership
someone owns the data but if they don't
send anything for if they are out for
five seconds everyone else can send the
data so yeah
I'm gonna try to demonstrate this with
my little raspberry pi project
so what I'm showing here is a publisher
on the right subscriber on the left and
I've set it up so that the publisher can
send red green red green at the push of
a button and then it's sent to the
subscriber
oh and then I told in the wrong device
we're doing right we're in
this is slow because it's a Raspberry Pi
booting time and that the start of the
Raspberry Pi run
subscriber which will light these little
balls
can you all see these little balls no I
should probably
find a way
yeah
like this so again this is my homemade
hardware from tonight so fingers crossed
so this one is subscribed to the data I
can blink
and if I unplug this one change the
color to red
I'll get back fingers Croft
it's right so that's a light jointer now
I had this one which I accidentally
plugged earlier and it's configured
differently so let's just see what
happens when it boots this one failed to
boot entirely
oh this one turned blue this is a
publisher so this published blue and
this one received blue I found out with
this one
keep publishing red and green nothing
happens because I've set up this one to
have a higher ownership value so this is
prioritized so you can see on the
display next here got color blue nothing
happens i certain deny send when i send
but who cares i'm not the priority I'm
not the owner of this data but let's try
to unplug this one and keep sending
there we go there's the five second
timeout it's not lighting oh and this
one is back up as well like it blinking
together yay so this is many hours to
make glorified Christmas lights yay
yeah I think that's all
I have no idea and I'm happy I don't I
don't have to know
it's no it's completely distributed so
all I do is to include this middleware
DDS stuff and then okay you answer that
yeah
that's configured by the
yeah
impressive
all the questions
have to be synchronized
you can are different you can set up
profiles mmm that's also how I made this
one have a stronger ownership because
it's as a data writer profile that is
different from these months or from yeah
this one
yeah
you can set up a relay between the minds
I don't remember what they're called do
you remember
any application
a number of publishers to join that a
number of the mass and so if you want to
we do providers
hmm
I think also rgi has some kind of
finished build thingy yeah but it's
quite it's not very hard to set up
because you choose the domain just to do
myself mmm other questions
hmm that's my quality of service
configuration so it's only cents like
once when it boots so if I am to reboot
then the data is considered fresh again
so it kind of sees the data as old that
stuff oh yeah I know that I know an
answer for this that's the liveness
duration had passed so then the data is
not the best data anymore and then
somehow doesn't pick them up I was
actually expecting that to happen the
first time I tried this so I'm not that
into the these details yeah
if you have various implementations
are you guaranteed
well there are some that you have this
minimum power everybody supports I mean
it's basically point-to-point but then
you have more resistance
publishes data on big time and that's
and then you have additional add-ons
dollars like security
implementing up
is the stander explicit in opportunity
people like you have
is it possible to combine
yes
it was a in my ambitious planning period
that I was planning to have different on
each of the raspberry PI's but yeah
I guess
no absolutely not I think our TIR is
among the most established ones and
that's probably why they chose it but I
also think they're quite expensive I
believe yeah
you can play without the only devices
to do the same by the definition or if
it's not the same exchange what happens
detective
hmm I know that if you have different
quality of service completely like
there's something wrong then they stop
talking but what happens if you have
so it's like my
okay cool
no more questions
experiences with the decide
some over
if
two pieces apart
experience
if you have a large system and you have
to do some of this on you
or domains I like the design process you
mean
mmm it's a hard question
okay
Thanks that's all I have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
