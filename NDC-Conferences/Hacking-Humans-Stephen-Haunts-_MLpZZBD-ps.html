hacking humans social engineering
techniques and how to protect
against them so the agenda for this
afternoon is to first look at what
social engineering is then we're going
to go through and I've got some famous
social engineering cases that you may or
may not have heard of in the past then
we're going to get to the interesting
stuff and look as much from social
engineering techniques then we can look
at how to protect against them both from
a personal standpoint and from your
company's standpoint and then I wanna
give you some resources for further
research because it is an interesting
subject and we can't possibly cover all
of it in one hour so I want to give you
some interesting resources to look at so
generally social engineering leads to
illegal activity so a little disclaimer
at the beginning so I'm not condoning
that and this talk is about mitigation
and prevention
I know people don't generally do social
engineering I'll doing it for illegal
activities and they normally end up here
so that's my little disclaimer out of
the way in case any of you try and blame
me if you're him
so this is a huge subject you know we
have an hour so we've got a lot to get
through but I mean you could literally
spend your entire lifetime studying this
stuff so I was going to give you a bit
of a framework that we're gonna look at
and then you can take it further to
study if you want to but first let's
start with a little story so it was a
wet and blustery night and Keefe was
sitting in tech support in his company
during the graveyard shift he's sitting
there very bored waiting for his lunch
break where he dreams of playing his
game of pool and suddenly the telephone
rings he picks up the phone and it's Tim
from accounts he's the vice president of
investment funds and investments I think
very important in the company so he
keeps like a ton of his case from tech
support how can I help you
and Tim goes Keith I really need your
help I'm locked out of my system I
cannot access my files we have investors
coming in tomorrow for a series B
investment this is worth 150 million
pounds if you don't close this deal the
company's gone and I can't get my files
I can't prepare for it
can you help I've tried doing a password
reset via the website and it keeps
crashing so Keith sits there and
Ponder's what to do you know standard
processes you are supposed to go through
an online portal to change your password
but this guy is really high up he's
heard the name he's heard the guy's name
before so he
believes he's real he goes okay sure
I can help you out I can do a force
password reset on my end and then you
can go and change it on your range when
you first log in so he does and Tim
tries to log in and then he changes his
password and it works so Tim is
incredibly grateful Keith you've just
saved this company we can have the
investors come in we're gonna get this
investment and it's all down to you
helping me out thank you very much and
he hangs up so for the rest of Keith
shift he's walking on air he's just
helped a large executive in the company
solve the problem you know he's having
visions of himself running down the
hallway high-fiving everyone to the
rocky Fame chain that's how much of a
good day is meanwhile Tim or Dave the
hacker is currently logging onto the
system using an account that he's taken
over and changed a password
he's currently copying off hundreds of
documents which is going to sell to
someone who's paid him to steal those
documents that's our little story just a
bit of context so what is social
engineering a classic definition of
social engineering is about influencing
someone to take an action may not be in
their best interest so I'm going to try
and get someone in here to do something
against your best interest so there's
three kind of typical broad areas of
social engineering attacks that you'll
be familiar with so the first one is
phishing you know that's where you get
an email that's pretending to be saying
that West Bank you click on a link
trying onto your details but really
someone's just recording your password
or your typical Nigerian prince scam is
I mean there will similar sorts of
things another one need to call phishing
so phishing is similar to phishing based
on over the telephone so there's only
one received those phone calls from the
Indian call center claiming to be
Microsoft yeah so I've received quite a
few times as much as my parents start
fishing so they're trying to get you to
either give up credentials or pay for a
service which you don't actually need
and never classic one is impersonation
so this one doesn't really involve any
computers as such it's about someone
impersonating someone else to try and
get to do something against your own
will
so let's look at some statistics I'm
guessing most of us are developers in
this room so we like stats and numbers
so these stats was taken from a website
called social engineering dot org it's a
fantastic resource URLs down there if
you can read that
I'll make the slides available
affricates on my blog so for phishing
90% of all email is spam and phishing
represents about 77% of all social based
attacks so that's a huge proportion of
the email and the types of attacks that
you know a basically social attacks free
fishing and these generally involve you
trying to click on a link to do
something like you know taking over your
bank account details so be fishing so
scams over the telephone so in 2012 and
these are fairly old stats but they kind
of illustrate a point so 2.4 million
customers were targeted for phone fraud
in 2012 I mean but just in the first
half of 2013 2.3 million customers were
targeted for phone fraud so you can see
that the the curve in which the the
problem is arising is getting a lot
bigger and so on very clever somewhere
has calculated that the average loss for
a targeted business is around forty two
and a half thousand dollars per
compromised personal account sorry for
impersonation so few details here so
medical ID theft is on the rise due to
websites impersonating medical providers
which are 1.8 million victims in 2013
and the top place for ID fat is actually
the workplace so if you imagine your
desk at work and the amount of
information you probably have lying
around which may seem completely
innocent innocuous is actually very
valuable to someone and 80 percent of
F's involve disabling or by pricing
bypassing controls an 88 percent of
reported stolen assets were personal
data so details about people names
addresses phone numbers dates of birth
anything about a person is very valuable
on the black market especially if that
data comes with medical information I
think you can sell those details for
about four hundred four five hundred
pounds per person
I don't these ones are probably US base
it's a us-based site so types of social
engineers I mean they come in all sorts
of shapes and forms though probably none
of these are gonna be a surprise to you
so your typical hackers penetration
testers they're probably only ones on
here actually sort of genuinely gonna
try and do some of these techniques so
pen testers are there to try and where
they're paid to break into your systems
legitimately to try and stress test them
spies you know your typical James Bond
star one spire novel type stuff you know
probably not as glamorous as that bit of
stuff does happen identity thieves
disgruntled employees that's quite a big
one so someone who's actively
disenchanted with their workplace is
likely to be someone who'll steal
information from the workplace
recruiters a classic one they're always
trying to get you to do things against
you will so we need critters in the room
good
governments and salespeople so classic
sales techniques they're trying to get
you to buy something even if it's saying
you don't really want or need look
anyone guess who one of the best types
of social engineers are there's one I've
left off children saying any parents in
the room whose kids can wrap you around
their little finger one do it every day
and they're very good at manipulating
you so why do people do social
engineering well it consistently works
people are very fallible and we'll look
at some of the reasons why so later on
in the talk but it consistently works so
if it didn't work and they wouldn't do
it it does work but for any network the
people in the organization like computer
network the people are the biggest
vulnerability so you can spend hundreds
of thousands or millions of pounds on
infrastructure intrusion detection
devices firewalls all that good stuff
but if you have some people that aren't
following basic rules in your
organization and give out credentials or
you know leave passwords lying around
and all that money spend it's for
nothing and generally social engineering
is a path of least resistance so if you
imagine someone's got a password file
and they want to try and brief force
crack that password file that's quite a
lot of effort that has to go for you to
do that and it could be quicker it could
take a long time or with a little bit of
manipulation and social engineering
they can get someone to reveal their
password so typical common types of
attacks miss isn't an exhaustive list
but it's just to give you a flavor so
customer service lines where attackers
get the numbers or email addresses from
websites they'll phone up the companies
and they'll try and do random password
resets just by giving out surnames
there's a rather large well-known
bookstore online which is that this
happens to them before I won't say the
names because we're filming it but you
can use your imagination and generally
when people try and do an attack via
customer service phone line the people
on the other end of the phone who work
for the organization if they've got a
lack of training generally they have a
desire to please they want to try and
help the person on the other end of the
line so they're more likely to be
susceptible to someone trying to get
information out of them so delivery
staff this is another big one so your
people turning up at your organization
pretending to be a delivery man you know
they don't even ask to be very
convincing you just need a you know
brown boiler suit type uniform and a
revolver raphe fake-looking badge an ID
and you can quite easily get access into
a building just with a big parcel under
your arm so another common attack he's
just but general phone calls so this
could be either to a company or just to
an individual person at home if you've
got someone over the phone it can be
very easy to manipulate them and tech
support is another one as we saw in the
example in the story at the beginning
and generally when you phone technical
support is Norma strike access into a
system
so before we look at some techniques
around social engineering let's just
look at a few sort of classic cases
associated area so the first one is a
guy called kevin Mitnick says anyone
heard of him before he's quite a famous
one especially of IT people so he had
quite a high profile arrest in 1995
where he spent five years in prison so
he's he's paid his dues back to society
but he first started off when he as a
kid by stealing records out of bins for
the LA bus service and he used that to
try and form a scam which helped him
ride the buses for free and his first
computer hack was when he was age 16 in
1979 he was against the deck computer
company and he basically formulated a
scam which enabled him to get copies of
software for free so while she is a
fugitive so you know on the run from the
FBI he just consistently kept on trying
to break into computer systems as if it
was a game so in the end he was charged
with 14 counts of fraud and 8 cases are
unauthorized access
but today though he's a reformed
character so he's written several books
these books are excellent if you've not
read them the one on the right they're
ghost in the wires he's more for
biography it's a great read but he also
runs a very successful security
consulting company where he now actually
teaches governments and large
organizations how to protect themselves
from people like him he's made quite a
good career out of it but he has paid
the price optimally by going to prison
for a long time so this is another guy
called Frank havoc gnarly as anyone
heard of him before so he was born in
1948 and he's what is referred to as a
confidence trickster but he also did a
lot of check forgery and he was a very
good imposter and over his career as a
criminal he took on 88 different
identities including an airline pilot a
doctor and a lawyer and he's very
convincing in doing this and even when
they did catch him he managed to escape
custody twice there's quite slippery
character so most of you probably heard
of him from this film here catch me if
you can you've Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom
Hanks so it's a very good film and he
kind of Hollywood defies his his
experiences there's a little bit more
glamorous and probly what it actually
was but it's a very good film
and there's another shot from the film
so it's when he was pretending to be an
airline pilot so the final one I want to
quickly look at is a guy called Charles
Ponzi so he's very famous probably heard
of the Ponzi scheme or the pyramid
scheme and what it's involved is it was
mail fraud using international reply
coupons so the way it would work is you
would send money to agents in another
country who by international reply
coupons send them back to the US and he
had then exchange them for stamps but he
could then go and sell the stamps for
higher than what the reply coupons were
paid for so he makes a profit so you
made quite a lot money out of doing this
but you know being a criminal and being
quite greedy he wanted to make more so
he started recruiting people where he
would use them as investors to invest
money into this scheme and then he would
pay them back with the profits and the
office he that keeps on going down in a
big pyramid this is all working quite
well until a newspaper at the Boston
Post started getting suspicious when
they looked at his tax returns and soon
as his investors got wind of this they
all started withdrawing their money out
of the scheme the entire thing collapsed
it was that at that point he was
arrested so he was charged with 86
counts of wire fraud and owed an
estimated 7 million at the time so quite
a lot was a lot of money now but it's a
real odd huge amount of money about them
so he pleaded guilty and he spent 14
years in prison and why clickers stopped
working there we go
so we've looked at what social
engineering is at a very high level it's
the art of getting someone to do
something that's not that's not in their
best interests and we're taking a look
at some sort classic examples as well
free classic examples that have been in
the press so what I want to do now is
just to cover some very basic techniques
so what we're going to look at is
information gathering pretexting
elicitation and manipulation so they're
coming up the four pillars of social
engineering or the four pillars I can
fit into an hour anyway
so the arrow is kind of going aligned
these kind of things happen in an order
so the first one is information
gathering so to do an effective social
engineering attack against your victim
you need to put in a lot of preparation
you can't just walk up to someone and
start pretending to be someone else and
hope for it to succeed because it most
likely won't so what you need to do is
you need to do research on your target
whether that's a person or a company or
a set of people because a successful
attack or a successful end goal might
actually require you to con more than
one person to get to where you want to
go it's not necessary is gonna be you
con one person then you get to your goal
so one very popular way of doing
information gathering you see what's
called dumpster diving very american
term basically means going free people's
rubbish and it's a mucky job but you'd
be surprised what what you can find when
you do that so quick show of hands who
shreds all their paperwork and documents
before they throw them in the bin at
home cool that's good and that's very
important because a lot of people don't
I mean everyone in this room I guess is
quite sort of tech savvy but people who
aren't in our line of work or industry
probably aren't as astute as you guys so
you need be surprising people far away
so bank statements credit card
statements old prescriptions maybe
medicine bottles so if you want to set
the type of medication when you finished
with it you just throw the packaging
away
well that's very useful information
because people know what drugs you're
being prescribed if you're being is full
of wine bottles and beer bottles someone
can actually tell you actually quite
like a drink and then they can use that
information later because you know
probably a good place to try and con you
is by talking to you in the pub but even
food packets you know just very simple
things like you know what you eat what
you drink the sort of information you
throw away you can actually build up a
massive picture and all that senior
rubbish bins in your back garden so the
other area is called open source
intelligence or OSINT as it's called and
basically she's a posh word for saying
looking at what's available online and
gathering information about that person
so Facebook if you haven't got your
profile lock down properly which a lot
of people don't can reveal quite a lot
of information photos things you've been
up to films that you've seen you'll be
surprised how much personal information
people
in trust into these social networks
again Twitter lots of information posted
by people can give you quite a good
background as to what that person is
about hobbies interests what football
teams they like what music they like the
sort of people they hang around with no
sexual persuasions it can tell you all
that sort of stuff another one which is
probably most serious one in my mind is
LinkedIn as you think about the amount
of information you've put on LinkedIn so
it's all your past employment history
probably lots of information about
projects that you've worked on probably
information about projects you're
working on now qualifications all that
sort of stuff and then the other ones
are basic search engines so I'll put
Google on there but then I thought I'm
going to put being on there as well in
case there's any staunch Microsoft
people in the room but Google being all
those sorts of search engines you could
just google for people and find
information on them so another form of
information gathering gathering is by
malware or getting malware installed on
your machine so this can come from
various sources so we talked about
phishing where you're clicking on links
in very convincing looking emails well
one thing they could be doing is they
could be installing key loggers onto
your system or another form that's
becoming quite popular with
screenshotting tools which frequently
takes screenshots of stuff on your
screen zip them up or compress them then
sort of send them back via a VPN tunnels
somewhere I could drop server somewhere
another very common way of getting
malware onto people's machine is by
having a delivery man have you talked
about before walking into a building and
you just shakily drops rather appealing
looking USB thumb drives on the floor so
if you pick up a 256 gig thumb drive on
the floor you're poking to be quite
impressed
well 256 gig they're quite expensive go
put it into your machine and it can also
execute code and install malware onto
your machine so never plug in thumb
drives that you pick up off the floor
another very easy way of gathering
intelligence on people's shoulder
surfing actually just looking over
someone's shoulder so last week when I
was commuting home so I work in
Nottingham I live out in the countryside
in Derbyshire I was commuting home on
the train I sitting next to a lady who
had a laptop open and I could quite
clearly look over her shoulder and see
she was writing up a disciplinary
warning for a member of her staff I
didn't even have to glance at her screen
for that long to find out what her email
was about so that's how easy is you
always need to be aware what it is
you're typing on your machine at any one
point so if I'm doing I'm a manager in
the company I work out if I'm writing
personal notes on people I generally try
and do it away from the team so people
can't look over my shoulder and see what
I'm writing because it's private
information there are some good
medications for shoulder surfing
apparently it's a real product it's
called the privacy scarf and I really
want one okay so he looked
information-gathering so we've you know
we you need to build up a lot of
information about the person you're
going to mount an attack on that's
probably one of the most important areas
of social engineering you need to go in
prepared knowing who it is you're
targeting what company is your targets
in who they are what they're like and
then with all that information in hand
you go into the next stage which is
called pre texting and this is the
practice of presenting oneself as
someone else in order to obtain privacy
information otherwise known as acting or
taking on a persona
so some classic for some principals that
are using pretext in so planning and
research leads to more success you know
so we've set the point quite a few times
you need to put your effort into doing
research up from shared interests make
success more likely so if the person
you're trying to attack is a Derby
County fan and you're a Derby County
fans and you've got some shared
information which you can talk
confidently about if you know someone's
into a particular band whether they've
Nine Inch Nails for example but I quite
like them if you like the same sort of
bands as then you're gonna be able to
talk more confidently about them because
when you go and do a pretexting attack
or you know take on a persona and talk
to someone you're not going to go
straight in and try and get information
from them you're gonna try and build up
a rapport with them and that might take
you know weeks months years even depends
on what it is you're trying to do so
good acting definitely helps I'll
probably be rubbish at it I was useless
at drama at school but yeah good acting
definitely helps you've got to be
convincing to the person you're talking
to and keep it simple
don't try and over complicate the
pretext that you're doing so you know
try and keep elaborate backstories to a
minimum yeah and just be more aware of
what it is you're trying to get out of
the person also try and use information
and these no verifications the last
thing you want to do is the person is
trying question what it is you're saying
to them when you're talking to them so
if you talk about so they you give our
particular football statistic or talk
about a particular game and you've got
the information wrong and then they then
come back and try and verify that
information or question that information
that can help or not help but you can
actually you make it difficult to build
up trust with someone so planning your
pretext so you need to define what your
aim is what what is it you're trying to
achieve ultimately from this person as I
say so change me attack may not just be
centered against one person you might
have to do pretexting or take on
multiple personas with different people
to get what you want so you need to plan
for different reactions or stray from
the happy path so if all goes well
you've got a list of questions you've
got
how you're gonna talk to this person
over a matter of weeks and if all goes
well you get the information that you
want that's great chances are probably
not going to happen the things are going
to stray off your plan so how are you
going to deal with that you need to have
a plan in advance how you can attack off
a different line of questioning if you
actually don't you say something that
offends that person and how are you
going to backtrack from that and you
know talking about keeping it simple
will just being friendly be sufficient
if you're meeting someone deliberately
in a bar to try and get information out
of them you don't necessarily need to
put too much effort in that front you
can just go in and be friendly with them
so there's another definition of social
engineering here which I quite like
so the clever manipulation of the
natural human tendency to trust and the
key word there is trust so building up
trust someone takes time so if you meet
new people like at a conference for
example you probably meet lots of new
people are you necessarily gonna have
that element of trust of them
straightaway
you'll probably respect them you'll
probably like them but trust you saying
that takes time to build it's definitely
not instant okay so the next technique
is called Alyssa tation and this is the
act of getting information without
directly asking for it
so generally when we're talking to
people most people want to be polite
it's a general human tendency we want to
be nice to each other and people also
want to appear well-informed so you can
use that to your advantage so nobody
wants to be that person where they're
asked a question like on stage at a
conference and you can't answer the
questions you don't know the information
nobody really likes being in that
situation people want to appear well
informed so if you're questioning
someone and talking to them it might
actually be quite easy to get some
information out of them because I don't
want to look stupid so they'll be
willing to give you information up and
people are people also want to be
appreciated so who likes it when you
know you do a good bit of work in your
job and then your boss actually turns
around quietly to you and says you know
thanks that was a good piece of work
has anyone ever have that happen to them
the rest of you need to try harder but
it's a general human tendency we want to
feel appreciate if we want people to
think or know that we've done a good job
most people don't like to withhold
information or lie people that you said
people want to be honest
so doing effective elicitation requires
you understand how to communicate with
people now that's a very easy thing to
write on a slide on a presentation but
actually in practice it's saying that
you need that's probably studied over a
long time it's all you know human
psychology which is why saying this is a
huge subject which you could literally
spend your entire life studying and
practicing but having a good
understanding of how people communicate
you know how to build up trust of people
how to make people feel appreciate it is
actually very important to do in
elicitation because if you go back to
the definition of elicitation you want
people to give you information without
you directly asking for it so you don't
go to someone and say I want your
password because they're not gonna give
it to you you want them to reveal
information voluntarily so you have to
adapt your communication styles to fit
that particular situation so not every
situation not every person is the same
some people are more naturally guarded
so if you're trying to get information
out of a software developer the chances
are we're going all the time they're
going to be more introverted and say
someone who works in a course and so for
example so you need to adapt your
communication style you also want to
build up a bond review target so as I
said before you don't just want to go
straight in for the kill is it well what
I'm not the kill that's a bit harsh but
but you want to build up a bond you want
to build up trust and that takes time so
you know a lot of the time this is done
down the pub you get people drunk buying
drinks then people start loosening it up
and then you build up that bond rhythm a
thing that's very important is staying
within the character of your pretext so
a very good example of this I haven't
done this by the way but a very good
example yeah
a husband who's cheating on his wife you
know he might go and meet he's a lady
friend Germany he takes his wedding ring
off you know that's all part of his
pretext he's trying to come across to
someone who's single and then there's at
one time where he accidentally turns up
and he forgotten to take his ring off as
well as being incredibly awkward for him
he's breaking his pretax because that's
not the persona that he was trying to
portray
and when you're doing a dissertation you
want to use effective questioning
techniques so we'll spend a bit of time
to get some questioning techniques now
so there's four main techniques that
will look out so this neutral question
in open closed unli d'ang how many
people heard of these before when you do
those sort of icky courses that you have
to do with you your employers yeah
communication skills and I sort of stuff
yeah we're gonna go through that so a
neutral question does not directly
target and they're not direct the target
on how to answer so you're not trying to
lead them in any particular way it's a
very passive style of questioning so if
example how do you like the weather
today it's not directing them in any way
it's very neutral how do I know whether
it's stayed one person might say I think
it's quite both yes they for example I
think it's quite a sunny
whereas Troy hunt was going blood he had
his cold I want to go back to Australia
so very different types of answers
because you're not being directed then
we have open-ended questions which
encourages for meaningful answers about
the subjects own knowledge and feelings
so for example tell me about the
relationship we've a father is a race of
open question or how do you feel about
the election candidates probably have
got some quite colorful responses last
November on the flipside to open
questions we have close questions and
close questions give us control of a
conversation and allowed us to lead it
wherever we want it to go so for example
building on the questions we said
previously so do you get on with your
father well that's a very binary answer
it's coming yes all the night who are
you going to vote for you know Trump or
Clinton so those those are very good
well they can be good if you're trying
to narrow someone down but if you're
trying to get someone to be very open
and express with you then close
questions are quite bad to use then the
final one is a leading question so this
way you're softly prompting someone to
respond in a way that you want them to
in a direction you want them to it's
very useful as a manipulation technique
so generally leading questions aren't
that good
if you're trying to manipulate someone
this is kind of your bread and butter so
we look at the example here so do you
have any problems with your boss
so you're directing that person there
with the word problems and boss is kind
of implanting in someone's mind that
they may have a problem with their boss
they may not do but then they might
start talking about issues that you have
with their boss or how fast was the red
car game and it's mashing to the blue
car so that question is it's planting
into your minds that the red car was
going very fast and it's smashing to the
blue cast it must be the red cars fault
not necessarily the red car could have
been going very fast and the blue car
swerved across a lane and smash into the
car but it kind of leads you down a
particular way of thinking so when
you're using these techniques you want
to use them as a kind of a funnel so you
start off with very neutral questions
which you can then start narrowing down
with open and then close questions and
then when you're trying to get to
getting a final answer out of someone
you can use a directed question which
generally is use as a last resort you'd
hopefully got the information you need
by that point
so just to recap then so we talked about
pre taxing and elicitation and so the
differences between the two is
pretexting is taking on a persona and
elicitation is using that persona to
extract information so the two go
hand-in-hand okay so the next part we
want to look at then is manipulation and
there's a key difference between
manipulation and influencing someone so
influencing is a way of getting someone
to change their mind in a way that is
good for them whereas manipulation
you're trying to change someone's mind
in a way that is not good for them so
ultimately influencing is a win-win
situation it's a win for you and a win
for them and when you're manipulating
someone it's a win for you and a lose
for them so manipulation generally is
bad you don't want to manipulate people
it's quite horrible but for a social
engineer she's absolutely what you want
to do so this is the definition of
social engineering we looked at at the
beginning of the talk so the act of
inferring someone to take an action that
may not be in their best interest so
really what we're saying is is the act
of manipulation because it may not be in
their best interest so it's a win-lose
situation so we look at some classic
manipulation techniques so one is called
the fear then relief technique think
back to the example in the story at the
beginning where the guy on the phone was
using fear as a tactic so you know I'm
an executive VP in the company if you
don't help me we're not going to get
this investment and then you'll have no
job so he was using fear to try and
shock someone into being same for him so
here's another example so hi this is
tech support we detected a virus on your
machine and it could lock all your files
so that that's the fear parts all of
them all of the files on your machine
could be damaged we need to install the
virus killer so we can help you out so
that's the relief
so by that point the person's just like
I want to get the virus killer on my
machine all my files rescued because
I'll probably not back them up so at
that point I said well can you please
tell me your password
I'll log on to the system install the
virus killer and then your system would
be fine I miss a very simple trivialized
example base an example of using the
fear relief technique to then get
someone to give up their password so
another technique is using guilt and
using guilt as a way of getting someone
to comply so this might be where you do
someone a favor as part of your pretext
over a man at a time you do lots of
favors for people you try and help them
out but you then try and use that as a
way or you try and use it against them
later so if the person you're pretexting
against you find out that they're having
an affair that's valuable you can use
that against them if you if they you
know if they're an alcoholic for example
when their family don't know but you
you've managed to find out that
information you can use that against
them so it's effective it's using a
secret is blackmail now an example what
I need is copy these file for me you
know you owe me a favor I get X as a
secret for you so I've done something
for you please do this thing for me now
the technique is called the foot in the
door technique classic technique used by
salesmen as well so ask him a victim to
do a very small request first and once
they comply follow-on with a real larger
request so a typical example as well
could be you know we see beggars in the
streets or panhandlers I think the
column in America where they stop you
and ask you the time you tell them the
time then they ask you for change that's
a classic example of the foot in the
door technique salesmen use it as well
so door-to-door salesmen they will try
and strike up a conversation with you
first I'll ask you you know what do you
think of the weather today or they'll
ask you a series of questions and I
think common for the name of the study
there's same way they said if they can
get you to say yes twice to something
then you're more likely to stand there
and talk to them and follow through with
the transaction or at least listen to
them
okay so we've looked at some high-level
techniques on social engineering so it's
information gathering
you need to plan what your attack is who
you're coordinating the attack against
gathering information we've looked at
pretext in which is taking on a persona
using that information you've gathered
to try and build up trust with someone
and then we looked at elicitation which
is the act of using that pretext to get
information out of someone without
directly asking for that information and
then we've looked at some of the
techniques manipulation techniques that
are commonly used so what can you do
what can you do to protect yourself and
your companies against this sort of
thing luckily it's actually quite simple
a lot of the things you can do sobre
split into two areas so we've got
personal mitigation and we've got
corporate mitigation so common targets
in a organization tend to be people like
junior staff some people that have not
been with the company very long now
they're there they're very eager to
please they want to climb up the
corporate ladder so they will do
whatever they can to try and please
people and to succeed there's nothing
wrong with that having ambition and
wanting to help people and succeed is a
good thing but manipulators we use that
to their advantage contractors have role
in an organization aren't necessarily as
heavily invested in that organization
might be more willing to give up details
about stuff I've worked with various
different contracting organizations from
around the world who have all been very
willing to please and have given me lots
of information when I've asked for it
especially in the last company I worked
out when they probably shouldn't have
admin staff as well you know
non-technical people would be a
receptionists people to do the photocopy
and so general admin staff in a business
they're not gonna happy is sort of savvy
to these sorts of things will be very
willing to help out and give up
information and support staff where
we've looked at people calling in to
call centres to get information
so if you ever have someone phoning you
up in a business trying to ask you a
question which you might be a bit
suspect about then always ask for
identification so back in the story at
the beginning Keith the technical
support guy should have really tried to
verify who was on the phone with him a
bit better yeah the guy just phoned up
said his name he'd never had never met
him in person but he recognized the name
but he didn't do anything to try and
verify who he was watching for out of
character questions so for example with
a delivery man is there delivering
parcels to your organization and then he
wants to get access to different parts
of the building he asked if he can drop
something off in the server room for
example that's kind of out of character
you wouldn't expect that and also if
someone is trying to deliver something
or they phone you up and they start
giving a very elaborate backstory as
well which is out of character if you
wouldn't expect them to give so much of
a backstory can be seen as a trigger
so another very simple thing that you
can do is not let guests roam around in
a building by themselves so if you have
visitors come to the company
you know escort them to a reception area
getting to sit down make sure someone
keeps an eye on them if they do need to
go somewhere in the building to meet
someone take them there just to score
them and we discuss this one already but
you know if you find a USB device on the
floor don't plug it in you know take you
to your IT support get it destroyed for
it in the bin
even if it's tempting to plug it in
because it's a you know quarter of a
terabyte drive or whatnot just don't
plug them in and this one is always bit
just being aware of what it is you're
saying so if you're talking to people in
an organization so on a different
products or you're talking someone down
the table in a social context whenever
you're talking about work just always be
aware should I be saying this is it
relevant for me to give up this
information if you start talking about
you know you get the project you're
working on work you know is it saying
that's supposed to be quite secret is it
saying that gives you capacity of
advantage should I really be discussing
this again the very simple simple things
to mitigate it but they're things that
actually have a big impact so it's on as
well shred documents by for home and in
the office so the company I work for we
have serious series of shredders around
the office you have one by the printer
by the main bin and one in two of the
two of the offices and you know it's our
policy at work that anything that goes
in the bin we shred it
go back two USB drives you don't go
storing confidential details on the
drive for him to stick it in your pocket
especially it's not encrypted because
USB drives are very easy to lose I lose
several of them each year due to being
clumsy and having kids that like
stealing stuff off my key rings so
anything can't do store in USB drives
I'll make sure they're encrypted so
things like the sam disk drives which
have aes encryption on them
good things to use also if you're in a
laptop computer laptop make sure you
install driving friction on there so I'm
using a Mac one of the first questions
it asks you when you set it up is do you
want to enable encryption always make
sure you hit yes so if your laptop gets
stolen or you lose it somewhere then
people can't access information off of
your laptop
you'd be surprised you know how much of
a treasure trove your work laptop is
you've got source code on there you've
got documents on there it's very
valuable therefore people might try and
steal it so being aware of who's looking
over your shoulder so I said before I
gave the example I was commuting home
just last week and just glancing over
the woman sitting next to me on a laptop
not deliberately trying to read what was
on a screen but you can't help it
because you naturally nosy I could read
what she was writing in an email so
always be aware of the foods around you
so if you are working on the train are
you working on something that's really
appropriate you know are you displaying
confidential information which someone
could just look over the seats and see
what they're see what you're typing sort
of a thing is educating yourself so you
know come into talks like this of course
is on plural of site books it's good to
make sure you get educated and this goes
for companies as well they should be
educating their staff from what to look
out for so give information that we've
discussed today
so next one is sort of more corporate
mitigation techniques there's anyone in
the room in a position where they can
sort of define policies in the workplace
one person okay this is kind of aimed at
you but for everyone else if your
company doesn't do these things and it's
kind of good to mention them and try and
get them to adopt them so one thing
that's very important is identifying
what information assets are most
valuable most valuable this is like
documents you might have stored in
SharePoint or whatever document
repository that you have and use simple
information coding so that it's very
apparent to anyone who works in the
organization what that document is so
you can mark it as green okay for
release so I could be sales information
brochure where documents stuff it's okay
to go outside the company then the next
one is amber read-only with
authorization up side release only with
authorization so it's documents that
might get sent out to other people or
other companies but you need an
authorization of someone higher up in
the company it could be multiple people
especially if it's a large company of a
complicated structure but these
documents require someone to sign off
the ascending amount then the next one
is confidential do not release these
documents they should never go outside
the company but if they're clearly
marked on the document then it makes it
easy for you to know whether it should
be sent out on us it's just a very
simple information coding exercise so
another one is having the corporate
security policy documents who's had one
of these frost at them and told to read
it hands up you read it well okay cool
so these documents can typically be very
big so but they are important and that
covers things like encryption policies
for your you know your source code AV
and antivirus policies what should be
installed on a machine and if a company
lets you do bring your own device and
what the what the company expects for
you from being your own device what they
can install on your machine to monitor
it they quite dry boring documents but
they are needed and legally they're very
good to have but as a company just
giving them out to people and saying
read it and then putting a big tick in a
box it generally doesn't work
quite a lot of you are quite good at
reading them so that's good but what you
should really do what the company should
do is actually put some training in
place so if you've got you know 100 page
or F of policy documents then put in
small training courses together on
what's in those documents is generally
the best way to try and do it so
computer-based training if you are
looking to put any of these policies in
place there's a good website here as
sans dot org that actually has a series
of templates which you can use which
means you know 90% of what's there in
those templates is you can just use and
then you just tailor it so what you want
for your organization so the company I
work a very small start-up in Nottingham
we're actually using this and we're
using this to build our own security
policies this one as well more for your
IT guys is make sure you keep software
updated and patched religiously so
there's lots of different exploits that
are detected even in things that seem
very innocent like Microsoft Word these
exploits give career criminals and
professional hackers a way of getting
into systems and people like Microsoft
you know they they know this and they
patch their software frequently so
always keep your software and your
operating systems updated be be
surprised how many companies domme going
back to the idea of shredding documents
are games very simple but if you're in a
very large company then it's quite
common to have a professional document
destruction service in place so these
are companies that put the big security
bins everywhere you put the documents in
then they'll come on-site with a big van
and shred everything in the back of the
van so I've worked for several companies
that have those they're not that
expensive and they're a good way of
making sure confidential information
doesn't get out of the organization
so you should never assume your company
is too small to be a target so if if
there's something of value with inside
your company without commercial value
commercial secrets or a way of getting
into datastore data breach to steal
personal information if they're selling
the value there then people will try and
find a way to exploit it and as we've
seen the way they do it fridge
protection elicitation you might not
even know that someone's doing it you
might have befriended someone and
befriend be friends with them for six
months before you even realize that
there's something wrong
so in quick summary then what we've
discussed her over time cool
so social engineering is yet to
influencing someone's do saying that may
not be in their best interest so it's a
win lose situation we've covered
different types of social engineers and
they're come in all sorts of shapes and
sizes including children we were very
good at meeting parents and people do
social engineering because it
consistently works it's very easy to do
for people that have been practicing it
and that's because people are the
biggest vulnerability in any network and
it's a path of least resistance so
trying to get information out of someone
is a lot easier than trying to hack a
computer system so four main pillars
that we looked at information gathering
pretexting elicitation and manipulation
there are lots of other areas in there
and I'll point it's some good resources
in a moment if you want to research this
any further but the four main pillars of
those areas and then we looked at some
mitigation techniques for yourself as
individuals and for companies okay so
some cool resources which I think you
should look at so the free books I
mentioned earlier by kevin Mitnick are
fascinating
they're quite easy reads as well they
will each films about the size of a
novel so I read them all on holiday once
watch my wife's dismay while she was in
there reading her Dan Brown novel butt
ghost in the wires he's particularly
interesting it's more of a biography so
it's about how Kevin
got into doing what he was doing and
some of the techniques he used it's
really interesting this book here is
kind of the Bible of social engineering
and the website which I took those stats
from earlier is the sister website for
this book it is a big book it's about
that Vic it's not an easy read but it is
really informative and there's lots of
examples and going it's a lot of
different nuances a psychology as well
this book is well I recommend so because
of the amount of time we've got we
didn't really have time to talk about
body language because you could probably
spend an entire hour just on that
subject alone but this book's really
good so this guy Joe Navarro is an
ex-fbi interrogator and he talks about
lots of different techniques that the
FBI uses to tell if you're lying so some
examples if you're questioning someone
in a work capacity you know Disciplinary
for example if they start moving their
feet or legs towards the door points
them that way it means I'm uncomfortable
and probably lying see that some of the
techniques he talks about people overly
rubbing their hands on their legs is a
sign of nervousness but if someone's
sitting there with their hands like that
and that's called stapling which is a
sign of confidence
Sager talks about lots of these
different techniques it's quite
fascinating he talks about one case
where there's a guy being convicted
where they're trying to convict a guy
for murder and but they were having
trouble pinning it on him and in the end
they've got this guy in he's a bit of an
expert at reading people and from
watching back hours of videos and
looking at the little micro expressions
in this guy's eyes they managed to work
out that he was guilty and eventually
convicted him that's one of the stories
it's in that book so that's largely I
want to talk about today and information
about me so I work for a company called
buying butler and writing down this kind
of two companies in one it's on the head
of development there and part of my role
is actually defining the information
security policy and making sure that our
developers and staff I'm gonna fall prey
to social engineering attacks because we
hold quite a lot of insurance data so
I'll see we don't want people to
accidentally give any of that
information up I'm also an offer for
Pluralsight I've done about eight
courses now we recorded a new one
yesterday in the hololens room which is
quite cool
so I've got lots of courses on there I
will be doing a social engineering
course over the next couple of months
and lots of spent quite a lot of time
going to conferences because my company
that I work for was great and they just
let me go but just brilliant so I can be
seen talking around the world NEC Oslo
hopefully can do Sydney this year and
tech Arama an STD in London in May and
also run a user group in Darby called
Amish a.net so if anyone's ever in Darby
on the last Thursday of the month you
have more than welcome to come along to
I use a group it's free and we have been
free beer it's great so I hope this talk
has been interesting I hope it hasn't
left you all paranoid that the next
person you talk to in the in the lunch
queue is going to try and manipulate you
and get information out of you people
generally are nice especially at
conferences like this so but you know
you might want to wear your tinfoil hats
thank you
so is there any questions from anyone
yeah they would need to you need to give
them an extra bit of ID how would you
implement a safer way to do it without
causing problems to the user because if
it was a genuine case they go I'm not to
have my computer I don't know any
information you're really not helping me
how does you implement a good security
policy in that way to prevent socially
engineering but I'll still allows your
staff to do the tricky one because in
that situation because ultimately the
tech support guys reset the guy's
password so he was having a really good
day that day so at some point in the
week someone's gonna start pointing
fingers at him because he unlocked the
account which was used to steal those
documents which doesn't really answer
your question I know but I mean it
finding back yeah that's a good one
phoning them back
we had a recruiter that threatened to go
to the police if we didn't give a name
of one of our very good I see people of
course we just asked to be she could
give her the phone number and thrown
aback okay that's a bit dodgy we're not
actually but I just work for and I
remember the internet Bank egg a lot of
you're probably doing PPI claims of him
right now but back then we actually had
someone who routinely kept on calling up
and asking technical information about
surfers that we had on our states and
that's kind of how I first got
introduced this idea because we've got
warns because egg was quite good at
protecting against this sort of stuff
and we got warned that someone was
phoning around asking different
questions about different parts of the
estate and we worked out all the
different questions I asked you actually
if everyone gave those bits of
information I actually gave them quite a
good outline of our IT infrastructure
but never did find out who it was but
you're saying that was warned against at
the time I work for online games company
and our players love to scam each other
out of their stuff so rather than as
well as this education I'm saying for
goodness sake don't topical password in
the chat box what how how could we in
build systems that make it harder for
people to scam people out of their you
know amazing magical sword whatever
question I don't mean that that's a
massive thing it all depends on what it
is you're building and designing I guess
so the things that they're trying to
scam out of in the game today how much
do you have financial value at all is it
where people have paid for coins or them
right so if you're trading cash for
assets in the game it's comfy imagine
there's some kind of financial
compliance you have to deal with as well
okay
 the comments you're trading yeah
okay that's a without knowing more about
your entire company but maybe we should
meet in the barn you can tell me all
about it
cool well thank you I'll be I'll be
hanging around the conference for the
rest of the fitness a week so if you
just grab us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
