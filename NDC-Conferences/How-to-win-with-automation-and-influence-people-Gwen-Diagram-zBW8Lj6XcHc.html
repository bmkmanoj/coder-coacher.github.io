about how to win with all innovation and
influence people it's amazing to be here
this is my first Devcon furan s--
i'm a tester and discover master in an
automation kit
so a little bit about me i currently
work at sky i accidentally became the
test manager i'm an automation tester I
don't give a about test management
but that happens to all of us we end up
becoming managers so I'm really into
dinosaurs whether they're living or dead
that includes pigeons because they're
living dinosaurs and I organize a
conference up in Leeds called the Leeds
testing italia which is a one day free
punk-rock testing conference so we have
like people speaking from all different
disciplines so DBA is talking about unit
testing don't care as long as it's
testing testing related so it's kind of
although we have a lot of testers coming
we get developers coming in stuff like
that as well so currently I'm working in
a Java space but I my first love was
c-sharp I still really miss c-sharp but
what you end up working in Java so this
is a journey about implementing a test
framework at my current place of work
which is Skye in Leeds I work in a huge
team so there's about 60 people in my
team in sky itself is 30
thousand people or something it's huge
so I'm not used to working in a really
big company like this I've worked in
startups previously and generally
smaller companies so companies that
totally won't mammoth so here's my story
of learning how to work in a really
massive company so as it usually starts
it started off with an interview so at
the time there was another senior tester
so I interviewed with him and the
principal engineer so in the interview I
asked what automation frameworks you
were being used because you know I'm
gonna have to actually work on these so
frameworks included Spock Scala test
facilities it's taken me so long to
learn how to say that when you name a
framework name it's something that
people can say
J behave j-unit maka karma and cucumber
so languages that were used groovy
they wrote api's in groovy Java and
Scala so I also asked about environments
which were a massive in massive issue so
I asked why they had so many
environments when they were telling me
about this and they couldn't actually
answer why there were so many
environments it was pretty big mess so
we were transitioning the application
from London to Leeds so they were in a
period of transition which meant we'd be
working with the London developers as
well who'd actually built the whole
solution until the transition had
completed so it completed last December
but they'd been working on it for six
months at this time so basically it
sounded like a pretty big mess but as
you guys probably are you're kind of
into that a mess means that there's
something interesting going on in serve
just like yeah I can actually deploy my
software which is what you want but it's
not as exciting so I get in there and it
was actually worse than it sounded so
here's the general architecture of the
system each color is a section of the
architecture that's looked after by a
component team and we've got two stacks
that aren't quite duplicates of each
other but they're pretty close
and the second stacks only missing like
this kind of front-end proxy it was kind
of difficult trying to figure out what
to call these things because they're
really kind of convoluted systems but
yeah so I was in the pink team which
wasn't called the pink team at all it's
called something completely different
but I need to call it something so I was
in the team that dealt with the front
end of the system so these dudes the
kind of Helios API proxy and the
front-end and Jeff so both of these were
written in groovy and we'd somehow
managed to find groovy developers which
is pretty rare
so these groovy developers loved
groovy and
when he suggested that maybe there was
another option they were really really
sad they loved it so what we had to deal
with was a really clunky old front end
we're in gravy with Grails and stuff
like that and a world of siren Jason so
this was too long to actually put
vertical but this is a taste of siren
Jason this is directly off the
documentation so it's Haley us and so
it's directing the user where to go
after into each interaction it's really
really difficult to navigate and try and
write tests in so when we looked into
just the tests we discovered that the
front-end application there were no
acceptance tests running is part of the
build instead they had functional tests
so this covered a lot of different
layers so when people say functional
tests you've got to encounter some
issues because functional tests people
use as a catch-all for everything
basically everything that's not unit
testing on there like our you know we'll
cover that in functional tests no you
won't so they also had integration tests
as well which strangely were basically
the functional tests with instead of
using a mock they were actually testing
against the real system it was the same
tests so they were both written by the
developers and so they were just the
same tests duplicated so no one could
actually agree what functional tests are
so which caused loads of arguments so
I'd recommend getting the naming of
tesla's sorted as quickly as possible if
you're in a situation like this so the
same was happening for the API proxy
layer loads and loads of these
functional tests interesting Lee there
were absolutely no unit tests here
either as the development team had
decided that writing unit tests weren't
necessary as they were writing these
functional tests which were better and
because they covered everything so write
unit tests waste of time what really
happened here were they were slow
running flaky tests as you can imagine
so at the start of my time there we had
a lot of image changes which is really
boring it should be really boring
and so the two front end developers that
we had we're working on making really
simple changes and checking in their
work so he had tests running on the
build server here but the issue was that
these tests would take half an hour to
run because they were work and to end
and everything in between and they were
really flaky so they'd fail it would
sometimes require for reruns to get the
test to pass even though the developers
that they just changed to knew that they
just changed an image so there wasn't
anything really that was going to break
so tests that a flaky mean that people
won't run them it would have been really
easy for the developers to actually
exclude these tests so it didn't take
two hours to build a piece of software
where they hadn't changed much but the
one person doing it means that everyone
I want to do it and then he won't have
any tests running at all because we had
no sensible tests so this was really bad
for the developers but when I first
looked into how we were going to release
this software as a tester it was looking
even worse so there were some UI layer
tests that we were in in the Citadis
over the top of J behave these are both
BDD frameworks so they'd layered a bdd
framework on top of another bdd
framework and I'd have no idea
why you would choose to do that because
I couldn't really ask them but it was
really difficult to navigate around and
yeah trying to pull them apart was
really really difficult so they I had a
look in Jenkins to see what kind of
stuff they had running as part of the CI
and these crazy facilities and J behaved
tests hadn't been run in a year and a
half they were pretty much abandoned so
we had absolutely no idea of how the
system was meant to actually work as
there were no unit tests and no working
UI level tests changing things was
pretty terrifying the release system we
created an RPM because it's Java to test
- the test environments and then two
testers spent two days manually testing
the different components now I'm really
 lazy my testers and I were having
lunch
one time and talking about how we were
one of the testers is really really
thorough really good to do your code
reviews and stuff like that and I'm
cowboy as there's no way in hell I
want to spend two days testing some
really out-of-date piece-of-shit
application is just not in my interest
so there are also some smoke tests which
were written groovy but they couldn't be
run on the Jenkins boxes someone had
upgraded Firefox and not upgraded it in
the tests so these of course had to be
run manually on your machine and you had
to ensure that you have the right
version of Firefox which was Firefox 35
or something and there were only 13 of
these tests actually so as you can
imagine we had a test team that was
totally champing at the bit to try and
get some automation up and running as
they all had different opinions on how
they wanted to do it so as testers we
generally write any language but you're
going to have your favorite everyone has
their favorite language so the mix that
we had at the time was we had two ruby
testers to c-sharp testers including me
one Java tester and one python tester so
everyone always thinks that their
language is the best as I said before I
think see shouts pretty badass but yeah
but we really needed a framework that
everyone would use because routing
frameworks in Java and I mean this is
how he got into the whole situation in
the first place we had all these test
fitting and groovy or Java or whatever
so dull Connie G says throw down a
challenge so we needed to write these
smoke tests and the best way was to
actually throw down a challenge we'd
write it in our different languages that
were chosen and present it to the team
so we had a mix of cucumber Ruby and
selenium gauge Java and selenium
cucumber Java and selenium and cucumber
Python and selenium so we gave everyone
a week to do it in this meant everyone
had a really fair chance on building
their framework and trying to make it as
awesome as possible
also I've thought um now you needed to
show everyone else your work and this is
where it became really unfair
and I didn't think about it until it was
actually happening at the time so it was
a bit too late to take any action on it
we didn't mention that part of building
the framework meant think he had to show
up to everyone else in the team at the
end and as I said our team's huge it's
about 60 people so that's testers
developers scrum masters and the ops
team etc so the most competent tests are
the tested that built the framework the
best as she's she's actually a developer
now she is a badass developer she was
writing it in a language Python that she
really knew about as well but she is
really painfully shy and she doesn't
like getting up in front of people so
Python wasn't going to be chosen as the
language because she had a really unfair
disadvantage that she wouldn't be able
to sell it so when he set a challenge
like this make sure it's fair her option
didn't really stand a chance because she
was so painfully shy so another quote
from Dale Carnegie merely stating a
truth is not enough the truth has to be
vivid interesting and dramatic you have
to use showmanship mmm the movies do it
television does it and you have to do it
too if you want some attention so back
to the presentations we showed our
different frameworks and explain the
benefits of each framework if you
haven't heard of gauge it's an open
source tool to write test cases in it's
really similar to cucumber except you
don't need to use the given when then
pattern personally I really don't like
the given when pattern as I've never
heard anyone speak like that in my life
so I don't see why I should have to
write tests like that no one speaks like
that
so talk in terms of the other person's
interest gauge also has some really
amazing reporting in working with
developers previously I know that
developers absolutely love the reporting
in gauge cucumber reports of really
quiet clunky and so
they're not as easy to follow as gage
this is a really nice UI so I also knew
that we had a bunch of JVM developers in
the room even if they focused on
different languages like groovy Scala or
whatever instead of Java and so routing
a Java framework would most likely win
them over
so I presented it we all voted and we
chose gauge in Java for the framework
perhaps a little bit of showmanship
knowing and as well as knowing what
developers particularly liked in there
helped or I just chose the right
automation framework in the first place
so it ended up that we had the
developers on board with what we were
going to be using across the board to
write the new framework in which is
important aroused in the eager person in
the other person an eager one so it's
funny
testers seem to actually get to write a
lot more codes than developers
especially when you backfilling test
cases we are writing so much code so
here we ask for help from the developers
and they assisted us with improving the
test cases we made our code
way more fun to write than in developers
code if you remember they were doing
image changes and like that we were
adding cool automation so what this
encouraged was cross-discipline pairing
which ended up building a really strong
team and a pretty good framework so
mm-hmm
by this point we have the smoke test
written but these were really the
smallest of our worries
the smoke test didn't stop the testers
from having to perform two days of
testing for a product the smoke test
gave us pretty much diddly squat really
as there was something if I remember
correctly they did actually run but they
were a real easy part of the system to
tackle so I'm sure chunk of tests that
were important here with a horrific J
behaved serenity tests sorry facilities
they renamed it to serenity so people
could actually say it that weren't
running and they hadn't been running for
a year and a half but these were so hard
to tackle and almost impossible we had
several people look at this but
absolutely no avail real really they
were totally impenetrable in their
messiness so we decided to tackle
something else in the meantime
so also fixing the UI tests weren't for
the benefit of the entire team
there was only one team that actually
had a UI the rest of the team so the
proxy API and the API layer with a core
system wouldn't have benefited from the
UI test at all
we would have been able to share
knowledge of how we were building the
tests so instead we started on the API
acceptance tests but unfortunately this
wasn't done in the same manner of
choosing the frameworks so hopefully you
can learn a few lessons from what I
didn't do right here so it was done as a
bit more of a solo endeavor and the
problems from this are still really
around I'd ridden API tests before I'd
written them in c-sharp using rush sharp
which I really loved it was a really
great API library absolutely marvelous
so when I was looking for the equivalent
in Java some things just didn't really
fit the same I looked at a few different
frameworks so I looked at uni rest and I
looked at rest assured and the apache
httpclient
so I totally disregarded the party HTTP
client as it was way too raw for my
needs just as we're really not the
strongest coders and so we need fairly
simple things to work with and I
disregarded rest assured because my
previous misconceptions so it has the
given one length when then layer and as
you know I hate that
it seems really silly but I could
actually abstract this away in my code
so it wouldn't have made a difference in
the end however I was really blinded by
my hatred of the BDD language and I was
choosing this framework by myself I was
having chats outside with the other
senior test engineer while I was smoking
but that didn't really help so I chose
uni rest although I'd probably look at
rest assured if I did this again because
apparently it's really really awesome
and I think there's a little bit more
documentation around so yeah um so don't
choose technology as a solo so
also the problem here was that I was
routing the API tests for a system that
uses siren Jason which as you can see
it's really really complex and trying to
write details for that is just painful
and quite upsetting so we use Jason path
which is kind of like XPath but for
Jason where the other testers use Jason
or Jackson because they had systems
where they could actually write D Tio's
for them all the systems are the same so
this has caused all kinds of headaches
this here was pretty much our largest
mistake with these frameworks and we are
definitely still paying for it we're
looking into Jason I don't now to solve
this as we're basically going to need to
write from scratch a new framework of
course swapping it out not just like Big
Bang because that's silly and horrible
in regards to a deserialize ER as you
would be surprised at how attached
people get to their different libraries
so yeah we'll need to replace it
entirely so the only way to get the best
out of an argument is to avoid it so we
aren't going to solve this issue by
people shouting each other down by
saying that Jason or Jackson is better
and in the end who cares so just
starting you libraries move on and get
better sell than you and don't dwindle
on the old so on the topic of Jason Ida
the way we found out about this is
through the thought works
TechRadar so one of our contractors
spends an hour a month reviewing the
thought works TechRadar to see what cool
and new exciting tools have come about
so we use the radar for more than this
though we've implemented the TechRadar
so choices like this won't bite you
any proposals for new tools they come
through the tech radar which is looked
up once a week by the entire development
team so what's really cool here is when
we review pull requests that don't meet
what's on the tech radar we can
for this reason therefore keep our
codebase clean so I had an incident the
other week where a tester was trying to
pull in the new library which just
didn't fit with everything and instead
of just being like dude you're wrong
don't do that it's like oh well it needs
to be on the tech radar it's how to work
with people better as well so as I
mentioned earlier the front end of the
system had almost no unit tests which
was causing very long build times as
these functional tests were read and
instead of the unit tests so what's most
surprising here is we had to actually
train the developers how to write unit
tests so quite a few of the developers
had never written unit tests before and
the idea of unit tests had to be sold to
them which I thought was mental
I don't know it's strange but here talk
in terms of the other person's interest
so we had to discuss with the developers
what a unit test was and why it was a
good idea to do it
why refactoring without unit tests is
scary and what guidelines we had for
unit tests focusing on refactoring meant
that the developers understood how doing
this would help them and it wouldn't
just seem like a lot of little work a
lot of extra work for a little pay off
the front end API was notoriously
difficult to work in as it was written
in gravy as I mentioned and therefore
had loads of groovy magic so touching
one piece of code would change another
dimension without you actually knowing
so they argued over what a unit was for
ages as well so I had to make what a
unit was clear to them so this is kind
of what I told them so unit tests should
cover isolated bits of code if codes
inherited from in another class do not
test that class in the inheritance
component test should cover this see I
don't say functional tester derive
classes we are just testing change code
so you remember at the start that we had
functional tests and integration to
that we're the same without mugs don't
do that so we had to do code reviews to
include the inclusion of unit tests it
was quite a strange experience
explaining yuning unit tests to
developers but really worth it so here
just don't assume that people understand
everything because you'll find that
sometimes they won't but sometimes due
to cultural differences or that they're
just shy they won't actually pipe up an
arse so they might not actually
understand unit tests and I only found
that out after a while because I didn't
believe that anyone morning so which
brings us up to another section so when
I was messing around with these complain
component there are some really massive
problems going on in another team so the
API layer for the core system so it's
the yellow part here so it's a really
big piece of the system it's where the
logic should be kept and stuff like that
basically and so there were constant
arguments in this team about two sets of
tests so the cucumber tests and the
gauge tests the developers in this team
were actually pretty good they had unit
tests so they were organized you know
here in comparison to the team that I
was from so they also had integration
tests which was really cool but it also
became the problem so what happened here
was there was a bug found really late in
a release of software so two developers
decided to work over the weekend and
redo all of the gauge tests which we
call the acceptance tests and while
redoing all these tests they merged them
into the application code base which
meant that every change to the tests
bumped the version of the application
with a way that we've got this sorted so
it also meant that the code base was
larger and it was already a massive
monolith and that the developers had
written the acceptance test for all
their own work um on top of this they
said that the tester on their C team
was and that they didn't need
testers specially one a is that now
don't get me wrong you don't always need
testers I don't have a problem with
people not needing testers but the
dynamic of the team meant that the rest
of the team was constantly bulldozed
into what one Rockstar developer wanted
who would work on stuff all night if he
could so don't criticize condemn or
complain so this should go without
saying but don't say that someone else
on your team of like publicly to
everyone and redo all their work I'll
repeat that
don't say that someone else on your team
is it caused so many problems so
this tester refused to work in that team
and like so many developers refuse to
work in this team I'm still dealing with
the confidence issues of what this our
soul did to this tester basically so if
you haven't seen Netflix talk on
brilliant jerks I'd really recommend
watching it to get an idea of you know
what kind of people shouldn't beauty
team so brilliant jets can cause issues
within a team such as no one wanting to
work with them so it doesn't matter how
good their work is if no one will work
with them their works absolutely useless
especially in an environment where
pairing is key so it was about this
point that it was starting to become
apparent that component teams weren't
working there were there were too many
silos so at this point the other tester
that was on that API core team had quit
and as I said I had to move the other
tester into a different team because
he'd had such bad confident snark
and he couldn't actually work with this
dude or test his software so because he
was shouted out constantly as well and
so we had to move a contractor into this
API core team so by this point I'd moved
into a different team so I'd moved into
the proxy API team
which was the green one on that and it
was really interesting as I was so far
from this team that I had to learn how
their entire system worked people were
in the same tribe working on pieces of
software without knowing how another
component that it interacted with worked
at all and it wasn't just the testers
that had this problem it was the
developers as well so the developers
were routing different languages and if
someone was sitting over the other side
of the office there was a fair chance
they hadn't even really spoken to them
and we also had a new tech head of tech
join who wanted to make his mark as they
all do and so we'd also had the other
senior Leif and so I ended up being
promoted to the test manager as I was
the only one left to actually do that so
we came up with the idea of feature
squads on an away day when this new dude
head of tech came in he got us all to go
away on her way day and we worked
together as a leadership team to work
out how this could work so Dale says let
the other person feel that the idea is
his or hers so we came back from the
away day and without any planning one of
the scrum masters plant presented the
idea of feature squads and it was a
total disaster so this was
beyond a disaster there were pretty much
riots at this point the way it was
presented was in a really over
complicated diagram which was this one
and everyone thought it was a ridiculous
idea especially because it was just
forced on them just like hey dudes we're
doing this now whoo so we set up working
groups to discuss how we could implement
it so the working groups identified
issues that could come from working in
feature squads and we came back together
to see how I could present it to the
team actually prepared this time so here
Dale says dramatize your ideas and so
here here's seen the infomercial for
hello nasty by the Beastie Boys okay
sorry I'm gonna show you a clip of it
it's a work of
it's really overdone and ridiculous and
absolutely brilliant say the following
program is a paid advertisement and
expresses the opinions of the producers
and not necessarily of this network
the juice ladies hi I'm peg this is Bev
did you miss us and we're going to your
juicer today this is very this we had
some trouble last week with the you know
little racy with race and it's rectified
those raisins we had to reduce but
nobody knows us because we have fun with
fruit they can share in this juice from
the audience join us right in here okay
oh this machine is my favorite what
happens we push this button is this
so discussing how you're going to
present the idea oh sorry
and I and I asked the team to watch a
snippet of this so the thing with
infomercials is they actually know how
to sell something even if it is a piece
of so how to appeal to your
audience there's a specific formula
formula and if you have to present
something this important and it's going
to change the way that 60 people work
you have to make sure that you prepare
and look into how it's actually going to
appeal to them so the structure I
followed for this presentation was this
so statement of what the actual problem
was proposal of the solution I got some
testimonials you know Mike so John in
the Beastie Boys clip he was like oh my
god this is awesome
concerns of the proposed solution and
how the solution takes cares of the of
the concerns and repetition of the
solution so infomercials you need to
repeat things to get people interested
and thinking that it's a good idea
repeat yourself so everyone knew that I
was using cheap selling techniques but
it made it fun and it made it
interesting and I actually listened to
their ideas so it ended up that everyone
agreed to work in feature teams because
we actually prepared ourselves to sell
the idea this time and by including
people in the discussion it helps them
feel that the idea was actually theirs
as well so those working groups we
worked with them to see what their
problems were and I brought the ideas
into that presentation as well so by
this point we had people working across
different components we had people
writing tests and I was managing the
testers so I'd been able to start
coaching them so it was this point that
we received the news that the bigwigs
were coming up from London so working at
Sky you have people that people are
scared of like oh my god this person's
coming up by working at startups and
stuff before and really had to give a
 about that before but in really big
organizations it's weird you
actually seem to have to so I hadn't
actually met them before but word on the
street was that they thought testing was
an absolute waste of time they
hated testing they hated what it costed
so I had a pretty big seller my time on
my hands so Dale says talk in terms of
the other person's interest so we were
told that we'd have an hour with them
and with that we had to present the
technology strategy the feature team
strategy and the testing strategy I
didn't I
I only did the testing strategy so I
work with a really awesome principal
engineer who speaks as well and he'd
noted that these higher-ups what these
higher-ups actually wanted which could
be found in their newsletters so he
based his technology strategy on that
which worked perfectly know what people
want beforehand and sell them that so
Jay Swan knew what their interests were
and based the technology strategy on
that and they absolutely loved it they
sucked it up so I wasn't this lucky of
course because they hated testing so I
had to do these things a little bit
differently so make the other person
feel important and do it sincerely so
when the higher-ups were coming I was
actually pretty excited I hadn't met
them before and well if you have people
on like this on your good side means
that you can probably get funding for
your projects so this was a pretty good
opportunity to make a good impression on
them so I brought cake I brought cake
chocolate biscuits whatever people
 of cake if you have a visitor
provide food make them feel welcome and
actually like you're excited to see them
I was but cake really cemented that with
them so smile so look at them in their
eyes shake their hands smile they don't
know you either and yeah they might get
paid more but it doesn't mean that they
don't want to feel comfortable they
might actually be a bit scared so it
smile and make them feel welcome maybe
not like that I have a tendency to do
that
a lot I didn't scare people so try and
not scare them so remember that a
person's name is to that person the
sweetest and most important sound in any
language so there was only three people
that I was actually presenting this to
and if you're presenting an idea to a
small group of people call them out by
name say how wonderful it is to have
them here because it really is
they've taken time out of their schedule
to come and see you make them feel
welcome and make them feel like it was
worth it so although these people really
couldn't give a about testing they
left that room really happy and they
listening to me because I made them feel
important and well also I thought they
were important because I actually took
time out of their day they came up from
London to what everyone thinks is crappy
little Leeds but it's not it's really
awesome so on that I'm going to show you
the test strategy that I presented to
them and also it's the test strategy
that we use now to try and get people
actually writing tests and stuff like
that so hi this is identities test
strategy so first off I'm going to start
with the basic theory of why we test
testing creates confidence that your
product works or perhaps the avoidance
of doubt that your product will break
sky should be a synonym for quality we
want to ensure that customers can log on
to the platform at any time whether it
to be to watch friends at 2:00 p.m. on a
Wednesday or to watch Game of Thrones at
9:00 p.m. on a Monday night the identity
platform should always be available
frictionless and secure for the customer
by our performance load security and
automated testing we can create a sky
product that can be deployed quickly
with known quality testing also ensures
that we are delivering software of value
by aligning with a business on what
scenarios are expected within the
application we can deliver a journey
driven solution which adds value to the
product but really why test a stable
system isn't just for the customers
working in a vague version of the
Spotify model it isn't only the ops team
on-call team members from all
disciplines are on call
creating a stable tested piece of
software means that your life is easier
as a member of the identity team as he
won't be the one getting woken up at
2:00 a.m. to keep the system up so it's
all very well and good wanting a system
that is stable with a minimal amount of
show-stopping bugs but how do we
actually create a quality system
identity want to look at the testing
pyramid a little bit differently we
would like to reimagine the test pyramid
instead as a bug filter only bugs unable
to be found by the prior component of
testing will be able to reach the next
stage of testing we will cover unit
component integration acceptance and to
end an exploratory testing in the future
I would like to align the bog filter to
our continuous deployment solution unit
testing will be the layer with the
largest amount of tests having a large
unit testing layer has quite a few
benefits the unit tests are quick to
write and run and they greatly assist
when refactoring units of code if code
is written without unit tests it's very
difficult to go back and refactor that
code as a developer will be unable to
see if refactoring has actually broken
anything a component test is a test that
limits the scope of the exercise
software to a portion of the system
under test component tests will
frequently include mocked or stub
components so that the tested
functionality can be isolated to the
component that the developer is
interested in testing integration tests
cover multiple components and will find
issues between multiple component
speaking to each other
acceptance tests will be read into the
acceptance criteria on a card and
written in clear language that can be
reused for business documentation for
specific areas of functionality and
end-to-end test cover user journeys that
will be the journeys that customers are
actually making through the product
exploratory testing will only catch the
most subtle bugs bugs that haven't been
able to be caught fire automation next I
will be showing how we are planning to
make the identity tribe excellent free
support and learning part of the purpose
of these tests are also documentation
around the application the test create
many opportunities for learning
especially sharing knowledge across
disciplines learning also brings us
together
and builds better bonds within the team
with strengthened communication we
should be able to work in a more
cohesive manner to deliver more cohesive
software developers and testers pair
across a tribe which promotes cross
learning the developers learn more about
testing and testers learn more about
development this also improves quality
across product as two heads on each part
of the process is way better than one
pairing also allows the sharing of
technical knowledge and the development
of shared techniques more consistent
code helps remove the mental barrier to
exploring a previously read and test
allowing the observer to focus on the
testing element through the testing
Guild will we will be building up a
mentoring relationship with the testers
we want to encourage the testers to grow
in the right direction and within
identity we have many fantastic
directions they can go in with our team
interested in their work we will be able
to deliver better software so we've
started chapter ships within the Tribune
identity where we're bringing all the
testers the scrum masters and the
developers together in their
retrospective specialisms to share
knowledge and discuss common issues and
solve them together as a team
Joe Swan has implemented fat Fridays
where the tribe can work together to
solve pressing issues that have occurred
during the team during the fat Friday
times have solved pressing issues like
building off branches dock raising some
of their applications and working on
test frameworks this is also a great
place for the teams to learn together
so while mentoring team the testing team
members we can focus on where the
individual is at the moment and where
they want to be very interested in
security testing we compare them with
someone in the tribe who has knowledge
and recommend some courses for them for
example we want our team members to be
constantly learning and not only be
proud of where they work but to be proud
of where they work so what I did there
was I created a new model to show them
people have seen the testing pyramid
they are so sick of the testing pyramid
if you show them something different you
actually capture their interest so they
were really interested there and I
talked about how I wanted the best for
identity and stuff like that
so yeah if you want to
the testing cone and have a chat with me
and like if you didn't take a photo and
you can have it so I just want to say
thank you it's really cool talking about
testing at a development conference it
makes me really happy and getting to go
to my first development conference so
any questions so we didn't have a
problem with pairing actually because
the London team really encouraged it and
so we had a lot of the team kind of
looking up to the London team I'm not
sure why but and so we've only got one
problem with one of the developers
pretty much refusing to pair but that's
because they have anxiety issues and you
need to work around that
so making what you do is you make it
exciting so especially with the
automation framework because like and
you make it so that they will actually
it'll be in the language that they're
interested in and stuff like that also
getting so we've got the front-end
developer who works in JavaScript which
no one else really does so he did demos
on fat Friday showing like what his
language was and how you could how you
could write unit to a centre and stuff
like that and if if people are doing new
stuff and it's like hey this person is
working on this does anyone want to work
with me that might work dessert
does that sound okay yeah
I found it really difficult to get the
tester Guild started so because
everyone's always got something else
more important to do that's always kind
of their attitude so what what we did
was so for the developer one we brought
in the tech radar review and basically
if you don't go to the guild then you
won't be able to review the tech radar
and have a say in technology so make it
import it also what was the most
important thing with the Guild's was so
me as the task manager I don't run the
guild because it's not my guild
it's the testers guild and so what we do
is every month we have a different
person run the guild and they come up
with the ideas and stuff like that so
it's not me
dictating to people like what they
should be interested in it's the testing
team and they come up with what they
want to talk about and stuff like that I
can't recommend doing that enough so
we've got the we've got the testers and
the developers in different guilds but
we talk so if at Friday's we all hang
out and talk about stuff and you can
show people stuff on Fat Fridays like do
presentations about stuff I think I
think the unit testing one was one that
I did in a fat Friday but we have spoken
about so us joining together for one if
we've got something that we all want to
talk about so yeah I think we will be
doing that in the future although we
haven't yet because testing guilds only
been going properly since November
because I had a few false starts until I
got the testers to actually lead it yeah
I
yeah say
so
like this in kind of natural language so
create profile and it returns the
response and then sign in stuff like
that
so yeah just in normal language how
you'd kind of say it so that's that's
just an example that I've got there yeah
any other questions
sorry so it does because we're moving in
between all the different teams like so
we've got all the different feature
squads and so if you want to know how
this part of the system like the bridge
works god you really need to read
through this it is a really complex
system so it really helps like with how
stuff actually works otherwise it would
be so hard to understand as a new
starter yeah
so we did have that for the gravy one
and it made it really complex so we're
testers like make it as easy as possible
we're not like we're not coders and also
I can export this so if the product
owner wants so if the product owner
wants to know how this works I can just
give it to them also I've had so I work
with an Italian and a German team and
they don't have any automation in there
like can you provide evidence that
you've tested this his expect file
please go away and write some automation
instead of asking me questions we were
really lucky in that they hired all
automation testers so all of us could
code to differing degrees like we've a
lot of us have so none of us wrote Java
we had to learn but yeah so with the
with the release of the horrible
front-end stuff we were still having to
like do manual testing and trying to
write automation in the meantime so we
we had so much automation to catch up on
but with the developers pairing with us
it made it easier so also developers
would actually write automation if they
had time because we made it fun to write
so yeah does that answer it properly
yeah maybe I don't know I don't so I
don't really check the metrics because
otherwise people get really focused on
the metrics so we do exploratory testing
around so every card that comes through
because we've really got api's and so
everything that comes through we do the
automation around it so yeah there's I
think there's a manual testing for the
front-end application still yeah
yeah
it's mostly just poking like explore a
by well if this is kind of covered and
we did this any other questions
cool oh hi so um with the with some of
the developers not understanding unit
testing so we're getting there with it
so yes some of the developers do and it
is good to pair the ones that don't
understand this kind of stuff with those
developers so they can learn how to do
it but developers make a lot of excuses
why they don't want to do test-driven
development I found over the time so
yeah just little bits but not as much as
we should
yeah yep yeah yeah you yeah but then you
know that you
yeah it is really difficult
yeah yeah that's cool yeah that sounds
nice bikes know something that you get
to pair with them yeah cool okay thank
you so much it's really nice to talk
about testing at a dev conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
