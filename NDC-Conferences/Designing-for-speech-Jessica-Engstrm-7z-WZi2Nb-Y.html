party last night not a single one of you
102 look at that this is why you
actually are able to get up in the
morning because you didn't go to the
party yeah me neither
thank you so much for coming to see me I
know I'm up against some really great
speakers and even a legend so thank you
I am going to talk about designing for
speech now why is this important
well actually let me start by asking you
a question how many of you have ever
talked to Cortana
Siri Alexa or anything like that that's
almost every single one of you good for
you and this is actually one of the
points I'm trying to make we are all
doing this today that's why it's going
to be so much more important to you know
what we're doing and doing art stuff
good right today we talked to our user
interfaces everywhere we even control we
control our lives and we can even talk
to our cars and things like that and
what user interfaces are growing in a
really rapid pace I mean we talk to our
phones we talk to devices like smart
speakers and things like that you guys
have that in UK right you get Alexa and
Google home yeah awesome in Sweden where
I'm from we get some of the devices so
we have to be a little bit more smart
about how we get them which is kind of
tiny of a country I think but all of all
of the mankind I was going to say but
not all humans actually liked talking to
the devices it can be a little bit
awkward I take it since you were here
and your developers you are usually
jumping on the training really fast when
it comes to technology but most people
don't so sometimes when they actually
try to talk to to their virtual
assistants it might be a little bit
insecure ish so they don't know what
exactly to say something
mumble a little bit which makes the
experience so much worse for them
because if you're not handling that kind
of thing they might think that voice
isn't all that so this is why it's
actually important to design it good
from the beginning all the big companies
are making huge investments in virtual
assistants or digital personal
assistants whatever you want to call it
we have Amazon who has Alexa we have
Google with Google assistant
Apple has Siri Microsoft Cortana just to
name a few but what is it getting so
much popular how many words per minute
do you guys think that we speak know
that we type per minute so on average
words per minute how many words do we
type any takers forty hundred that's
that's a big difference actually forty
is is spot-on so really good of course
most of you are probably a little bit
faster because here you're used to the
computer and things like that but still
on average we type 40 words per minute
how many do you think we actually speak
per minute
a hundred quite good guess 150 on
average some speak more than others but
still actually if you're an auctioneer
you speak like 300 words per minute so
even if you're like an expert typer you
will talk faster than you time and also
we learn from a really early age most of
us how to speak and we continue to speak
basically every day so this is something
that we already learned we don't have to
learn different layouts and keyboards
and things like that and also why would
I want to take take my phone swipe over
start my browser go to a search engine
engine and type in a question when I
actually just can say hey Cortana when
it's the next up engine movie premiering
because it's so much faster so let's
look at some predictions for the future
by the year 2020 50% of all searches
will be made by voice imagine how much
you search half of that will be by voice
in just two years 30% of all searches
will be done without a screen at all
so with voice first devices like the
echo dot or or similar even your
SmartWatch 75% of all u.s. household
will have a smart speaker at home and
I'm sorry I'm localizing this to us
I'm not from from the US but this is the
only data I actually can find so
seventy-five percent of all US household
will have a smart speaker in two years
today forty percent of all adults
actually use talk to voice user
interface at least once per day that's
at least once pretty I'm doing it a
little bit more but still Cortana has
over one hundred forty five million
monthly users and this number is a
little bit interesting first of all it's
the latest number I have but it's still
a little bit old so it's probably a lot
more but this is active user per month
so if you use it every month or in this
number the echo dot which house Alexa
was the best-selling product of all of
Amazon all categories this holiday
season they sent sold tens of millions
of devices tens of millions now we try
to actually figure out exactly how many
Ekadasi there are out there but it is
impossible because they are keeping the
numbers really secretive but it's a lot
google assistant is now available for
over 400 million devices you can even
have it on your television today and
ninety-five percent of all people that
has a smartphone actually has used the
virtual assistant on
we as developer can actually take
advantage of this I mean they already
talk and write so this morning I will go
through what you need to think about
before you even start to develop your
voice user interface how to plan it out
and a couple of considerations that can
be good to think about to get the most
out of your voice user interface my goal
is to give you some tools and
understanding of how to start developing
a voice user interface in a really good
way so you can actually get ahead of the
competition already my name is Jessica
angstrom
I'm a windows development MVP I together
with my husband in the audience and I
actually have a company which is focused
on future tech yeah I know it's a buzz
word but we're actually working with
things like hololens bots and also UX
because we think that UX will be so much
more important in the future especially
if we take away all the screens and and
talk to them because if that doesn't
work people will rage quit we also have
a podcast which is called coding after
work so if you're interesting to that
please tune in I have been talking to
our house and computers for a little bit
over 16 years now granted in the
beginning it wasn't all that but it was
super cool because we could say just
like in Star Trek computer dim lights
and sometimes it actually worked
we had remember those almost like
microphones like this you had on the
desktop for your computer we had those
in the ceiling that's how you did it
back then I have a lot of material to go
through so if you have any questions
please save them to the end and I will
be happy to hear them nowadays we talk
to our devices even with really small
screens or without screens like
your Microsoft band if you still are
lucky enough to have them or other
smartwatches and and stuff like that so
we don't have to cram in a full-blown UI
into that device if you have a really
small screen and that's that's a relief
right if a user doesn't know how to
navigate your application or a bot or
whatever you want to call it they can
actually ask for help and they will the
device will tell them and that is that
is so much easier for for you guys and
it's also easier for for the user so
it's a win-win situation
so before we even start to plan out our
voice user interface we need to ask us a
question a very important question and
that is will the user benefit from a
voice user interface it's a really
really important question because even
if voice user interface is the new black
or orange or whatever color is in now we
can't just cram it into everywhere if it
doesn't fit because it will feel awkward
so it should only be you should only
have a voice user interface if it's
actually giving the user a better
experience somehow or the same
experience if you will and voice your
story interfaces will continue to become
even better and better and you can
actually be a part of this revolution
and I call it a revolution because if
you look at the numbers we are going
like little bit a little bit and then
the skyrocketing so it will be a
revolution large companies like Google
Facebook Amazon actually have frameworks
that you can use to make it easier to
develop a bot or or voice user interface
for their platforms which makes our
lives a little bit easier so let's think
about when is a voice user interface a
good thing when is a good thing well if
I'm going out and I don't want to look
out the window and I ask
alexxa if i need an umbrella today
that's good it might not be raining now
right or if I'm driving in the car and I
want to book an appointment or or make a
call or something like that and we all
know we shouldn't drive and text at the
same time all right then it's perfect
actually can do all of those things
today in our house I can turn on the
lights and things like that but the most
important thing is I can do so without
awkwardness or embarrassment because
sometimes voice user-interface isn't a
good idea
so when is it not well let's say you
have like an embarrassing illness or
something you're embarrassed of and and
all of a sudden on the bus a voice comes
out and say don't forget to take your
medicine for insert your illness here
that's not a good idea that's when you
want to do that or if I tell my virtual
assistant that please show me all the
documents I was working on yesterday
problem is in the office we all use
Cortana for the Windows 10 virtual
assistant
so everybody all of a sudden sees their
documents they were working on yesterday
granted most are well not most of it but
some of the via voice well the
assistants can actually be tuned in to
listen just to your voice so that can be
avoided but it's not always the case but
what if you're in the supermarket and
and you have a you're really bored in
here we're in the line and and you want
to read up some text but you forgot that
you have your ear plugs unplugged and it
starts reading up really sensitive
material from your workplace that's a
lawsuit waiting to happen so if you're
handling sensitive information or
information that someone can interpret
as embarrassing
voice user interface isn't a good idea
speaking of ideas you're going to need
one
a good way to think about it is that
think about your ID and why you are best
at that idea because this is a common
problem not only when it comes to voice
user interface but also apps and and
other things like that we tend to want
to be the next Instagram or or the next
Facebook or Twitter or whatever we want
to make it as big as possible which
sometimes means that the Pizza app also
can tell fart jokes the weather and you
can tweet about it so all of a sudden
you don't even know what the main focus
is of that app so a good way to actually
think is what your solution is going to
be best at so try saying my app is best
in its category at then you fill in with
a short descriptive sentence and the
sentence shouldn't be at being an app
because that's not helpful
so try to be as specific as possible
like if you are doing an app for
departure times you could say my app is
best in its category at departure times
for buses or even better you can narrow
it down and say finding departure times
for the user that is closest to them
because many of these devices are
actually location location aware so we
can do that then I have narrowed it down
to what I'm going to be best at and
being this specific actually helps you
to sort out the different focus areas
you need to focus on and not focus on in
the first version then you can add on
Twitter and fart jokes or whatever you
want to do but this will make your
solution a little bit more unique and
stand out from the crowd so you can
actually concentrate on what is
important for the user also try finding
out why you are going to be better than
their competitors in that area and
include that in your best at statement
like why are you going to be unique in
this
and this is important when adding voice
otherwise we might end up with that
weather app that tells fart jokes and
you don't know which which is which
right might be fun but it makes no sense
accepting in Swedish we say instead of
fart we can say let go of weather or
something like that so maybe in Swedish
is fun but not anywhere else so now we
have an awesome idea we know what makes
us a unique and it's time to start
planning so a really good way to start
your process is to write some sample
dialogues and this is like an overview
of the interactions between the user and
the voice user interface and this is a
good way to see what this system is
going to say to the user at all times
but also look at it as conversations
rather than this is send flowers to
someone and this is do this and this is
do that what am I going to say in this
different kinda times look at it as
you're going to have a conversation so
it doesn't sound stilted later so
pretend that you're writing a movie
script that's a really good way to
actually plan this out so pick like the
five most important things in your app
that you can do and start writing your
script also pick five or so things that
can happen when it things go wrong like
if the internet go down or you don't
understand the user and write down how
it would go in the worst case scenario
when you have written your script if you
will read it out loud
preferably you can ask a friend or a
co-worker to read one part and you read
the other part because this is when
you're going to catch those phrases that
will
come a little bit stale or off because
sometimes when you write it looks really
really good and it sounds good in your
head but when you actually are speaking
it's that's not the way you're talking
right so that's a really good idea so
when you're done with the sample
dialogues it starts to sketch out your
voice user interface flow and this is
simply diagrams that illustrates the
different paths that can be taken
throughout your app well the branch is
if you will so let's say we're designing
a skill and this is when you're
designing for voice user interfaces it's
usually called skill actions apps bots
it's basically the same thing so the in
this time we call it a skill and we're
going to talk about we're going to
design a skill for for showing departure
times for buses there are many ways I
can ask that question as a human this is
just a few of them and if I handle this
I can make sure that the user actually
can speak in a natural way and I don't
have to force the syntax on them which
makes it a little bit more easy for them
to interact with you all these different
ways you can say things is sometimes
called utterances but we don't need to
sketch out every single utterance
instead we group them together in
intense so the intent is to get the new
the latest well when the next bus leaves
right so we group them together and we
sketch it out if you are doing larger
app an app that has a lot of data like a
huge FAQ or or if we take Cortana or
Siri for instance they don't need to
sketch out every single intent instead
you group them in different topics like
you have book calendars you have
messaging or you have one topic for your
FAQ and another topic for your tap in
fact so you actually can manage and
sketch this out
another thing you need to think about
when designing for for speech is if
you're going to use visuals as well and
actually you need to ask yourself will
the app or or platform you're developing
for even have a screen like a cell phone
or a SmartWatch or similar to that if it
does if it doesn't have a screen do you
want to opt out of the possibility to
actually project to a screen for
instance the Alexa or echo doc it can
actually project to a screen if you're
talking it doesn't have the a contrived
a screen but it can project to a screen
so you need to decide if you want to opt
out or in of that and if you have a
screen do you want to support that
that's also a decision do you want to
use a visual avatar like a mascot or a
representative that represents your
brand or company like you probably have
seen the shaft bot sometimes there's a
guy or a girl
sitting there looking like they're
talking to you right
that's also a decision you have to make
some people think it's more comfortable
talking to someone they can actually see
even if it's an sketched avatar a visual
representation can make it more clear to
the user so they can understand what
they can do when they're expected to
talk if they understand what I'm saying
and things like that and it can also get
give hints like if you didn't get a
response you can have our please state
your state of emergency or something so
they actually know that you it's their
turn to talk if we decide to have a
visual representation as well no matter
which one year you're picking
very important that it goes hand-in-hand
with this speech speech part of the app
so you don't end up with one voice user
interface and one user interface that
doesn't doesn't work together so don't
just use it in the beginning or in the
end use it through all throughout all of
the process otherwise it can be a little
bit confusing for the user am I supposed
to look at my screen now or no no right
that was later so that's something to
think about as well if you decide that
it's a good idea to have visuals then
it's really good to sketch them out or
do mock-ups and this doesn't have to be
beautiful it can be blocks and scribbles
and and God knows I don't know how to
draw for the life of me but I still
sketch it out it's just for you so you
can know exactly what the user will see
throughout the stages of your
application so let's say we are ordering
a pizza with the help of a voice
interface okay
so I say I want to order a large
pepperoni pizza please and they say one
large pepperoni pizza is that correct
yes okay adding one large pepperoni
pizza to your order place order your
order is one large pepperoni pizza
shall I place the order yes now I'm
really hungry and the order is on its
way and this is basically how it goes
today but if we instead use the help of
visuals it could go something like this
instead I want to order a large
pepperoni pizza please
one large pepperoni pizza is that
correct and now instead of waiting for
the answer from the user we can show an
image so this is the visual and I order
a large pepperoni pizza right if you can
see this this is chicken bacon ranch
pizza so already I as a user can know
that this is the wrong pizza and I can
change it or I can place order but what
is all
it gives me a little bit more time to
ask my husband did you want some salad
to that or or is this okay because if
you are doing voice-only
there will be a timeout eventually you
have to stop listening right but here
you can just leave this up so I can pick
it up whenever I'm ready to and I can
also remove the item because it was
wrong from the beginning
right from or I can talk to it but still
gives me a little bit more time and this
is also a way to confirming that they
understood or didn't understood in this
case they didn't because pepperoni pizza
sounds so much like bacon chicken pizza
right so we need to make sure that the
user knows that we did understand or
didn't understand them and this is
really important so we need to think
about confirmation there are a few ways
to think about confirmation if you're
designing for four devices that doesn't
have a screen how you confirm things
will be so much more important because
they can't see that that pizza is wrong
right so we can look at confidence
thresholds a conference threshold is
basically what we get back from the
speech recognition engine and it is how
the speech engine think they performed
or understood you so if I say order me a
doll house the confidence may vary they
know they heard that but they don't know
if they're really sure like are they 90%
sure or 45% sure we can handle that by
looking at the confidence threshold so
have you heard about the the girl and
the doll house and Alexa awesome you
have it yeah it's a few of you but not
all of you so this girl was the luckiest
girl ever she her mom actually got on
Alexa
this girl loved to talk to her because
she got her response and everything and
one day she asked her if she wanted to
play a dollhouse with her and get her a
dollhouse lo and behold she got the
Tesla of dollhouses if there's a
dollhouse who won this is the one of
course she was super happy her mom's
card credit card wasn't that happy but
this story doesn't end here because
apparently there wasn't much news
happening in the world that day or that
week so the local news got a got a hold
of this news and got an and go went in
them interview with this girl and then
the anchor came back from from the clip
and she said I can't believe how smart
that girl was to say Alexa or to me a
dollhouse yeah you see what's happening
here right all of the people that had on
the likes are watching this newscast
yeah allegedly they sold out of the doll
houses I don't I'm not sure to the truth
of that I can't find any truth or or
false your regarding this but anyway it
goes to show how important it is to
actually listen to their confidence
threshold if we look at the confidence
if we had if they had looked at the
confident threshold on order me a
dollhouse the confidence would have been
lower because this is a child her vocal
cords aren't developed yet that's why
their kids are always lower on the
confidence threshold so what they should
have done and what they probably are
doing today is look at look at the
threshold like if it's between let's say
45 and 80% then you should use an
explicit confirmation and say I think
you want me to order a dollhouse in
Seattle is that correct and would have
saved the mom a lot of money and if it's
lower than 45 if you could have sent I'm
sorry I didn't understand that can you
repeat and if you're really daring you
could if it's over 80% you could just
say the dollhouse is on its way and
don't take these numbers like like the
law because it's
it's just a made-up number so you
actually have to look at those yourself
if you're daring enough to to send it
out if you're 50 percent sure go ahead
but we'll be a newscast probably which
might be a good thing hmm so another way
to confirm is to always confirm things
implicitly so we without double-checking
with with a user so for example we say
what is the best superhero movie they
would of course say Deadpool what would
be a little bit awkward was if they're
going to say I think you said you want
me to tell you the best superhero movie
is that correct yes oh it's Deadpool
that's just just awkward so then we can
use this implicit confirmation is dead
Burger King they had an ad in the US did
you guys get this out here no awesome TV
ads are really expensive so they bought
a 15-second ad because they were and
they also wanted to make the most out of
it so let's look at this video which is
unfortunately not enough time to explain
all the fresh ingredients in the whopper
sandwich I got an idea okay Google what
is the whopper burger
according to Wikipedia the whopper is a
hamburger consisting of a flame-grilled
quarter pound beef patty sesame seed bun
mayonnaise lettuce tomato pickles
ketchup and sliced onion kind of nice
right smart way to actually invoke that
if you control the data you might have
noticed they said according to Wikipedia
yah-hoo updates Wikipedia well it's not
Burger King so they quickly realized
that people actually could change that
according to Wikipedia the whopper is a
burger consisting of a flame grilled
patty made with 100% medium sized child
with no preservatives or fillers topped
with sliced tomatoes onions lettuce
cyanide pickles ketchup and mayonnaise
served on a sesame-seed bun' yeah so it
might not be the best idea if you don't
control the data you're watching a 15
second so what what they try to do was
going because Burger King realized that
this is not good so they went in and
edit it again
so they probably had some intern that
had to look at Wikipedia all the time it
ended up with Google stuff to invoke on
that ad so didn't work out that well in
the end anyway
sometimes you need or want your voice
user interface to perform a task for you
like turning on and off the lights or or
things like that do we then have to
confirm that we are going to turn on the
light or is it good enough that the
light actually just turns on well you
need to decide that for yourself but
there's a couple of things to think
about when it comes to this non-speech
method for instance if it's something
that will take a few seconds to complete
like the lights actually take a few
seconds to to come on or or go off then
it's good if you have some type of
confirmation that you did understood or
not
the echo dock has a red ring it doesn't
say anything but it has a red ring if
you didn't understand what you're saying
or if I asked them to turn on the light
she will say okay and that's it she will
not say okay I will turn on then didn't
hit the living room lights for you so
it's good to have something if it takes
a few seconds especially when it comes
to things like the heater or a water
kettle or things like that that you
actually can't see in the beginning you
you won't notice if the heater is on at
least four four in half an hour or so so
then it's even more important sometimes
we don't even have to act on the
information given that's good
perhaps we have a little bit more open
dialogue like if I have an app that
wakes me up in the morning I turn off
the alarm and the voice says good
morning how is your day and I can say oh
it's good thank you
and then we don't have to act on that we
can give them a more generic answer like
thank you for sharing so we don't have
to pass through that data to have a
precise answer to that I was called out
during I did this talk in dev
intersection I I I was called out by one
guy and he said are you really that nice
to your BOTS at home like do you say
please and thank you I don't believe you
yeah I do I actually do for two reasons
one I'm nice too when the uprising comes
they will kill me last
so I'm actually that nice to the bots
visual confirmation we already talked
about that that's exactly what the pizza
acted it can also be things like they
say out loud did you take your vitamins
today but they show yes or no button so
you can choose if you want to say yes or
no or if you want to press the buttons
that's also a way to to use that
or it could be like hey Cortana
show me my to-do list you could start to
read out all my 4502 dues but that would
take like a couple of weeks right so it
might be a good idea to actually show it
like that in a visual and and if I if
I'm asking my invoke Cortana is speaker
she can show it on my phone or my
computer as well this make it a little
bit more easy for me to actually consume
the data there are a few other things to
consider when designing for our voice
user interface like are you going to
have a command control or a
conversational mode conversational
interfaces how many of you have heard
that ever yeah we hear it every every
day everywhere everything is convertion
conversational right so what is it
really I recently talked to Cortana I
told you I'm nice to my my boss right so
it looked a bit a little bit like this I
asked her who she was and and how old
she is she's actually turning 4 soon
where she's from and how she's doing and
she's excellent by the way and she has
the best superhero ever as a favorite
and she can turn into Yoda how cool is
that and now it's skipped a bit there we
go
she loves her job and then we finish
table off so did I just have a
conversation with her or did we just
have a bunch of one-offs and this is
this is this is a funny thing we had a
bunch of one-offs but I think we have I
thought we had a conversation but if we
look at all the voice user interfaces
well not all but no
of them it is only a bunch of one-offs
it's usually not conversational there
are a few exceptions like Alexa Cortana
and Google assistant has a few
exceptions where you actually can have a
real conversation but constraint for
instance if I order another dollhouse
and I tell Alexa or de miedo house she
will say last time you bought this giant
super really cool dollhouse you want the
same thing again so she will remember
what I bought before so I can get the
same brand and that is kind of the the
main point she remembered what I've
talked about before so if you sit and
talk to your friend and you're like I
was just in Vegas in this last week and
it was amazing they had tigers they had
drinks and all the parties and it was
amazing and then you say I really want
to go and then I say come on let's go
next month and you're like I'm sorry I
don't understand because if we are going
to have that conversation you need to
remember that when I say go there
I mean Las Vegas so that is the key
point you need to remember to have a
conversation
so if you want to be a little bit more
constrained and not handle all the
natural language understanding yourself
you can use the command and control mode
instead which it's a little bit easier
than doing the next Cortana and Alexa
and this means that you have a series of
commands that user can do but in this
mode it's really important that you are
careful on how you ask the question
don't open have open questions like hi
I'm the pizza bot how can I help you
today or hi I'm your assistant how can I
help you today because that for me who
is used to Siri Cortana Alexa Google and
all of those I think you can order me a
movie ticket you can book a plane ticket
you can show me what my to-do list is
but all you can do is actually order
pizza so it's a better way to to say for
instance hi I'm the pizza bot do you
want me do you want a pizza today or are
you hungry today or something like that
so you actually steer where the
conversation is going fritzy
yeah we know don't know what happened
here
too many Bluetooth devices perhaps so
you can also give them clues like
Cortana is doing here they say hey try
singing are you a ninja I know the
answer but I'm sworn to secrecy so you
actually have to ask her yourself but
this is a way to give the user a little
bit more positive mindset about how to
learn what you can do for them in your
app discoverability is another really
important thing how do the user know
that they can talk to your app or how do
they know what they can say for instance
so I've been a longtime Windows Phone
user I only stopped using it because you
can't get them anymore and it broke so I
went to the other side sadly and got an
Android I had no clue how an Android
works right no clue at all I'm used to
Windows Phone that's all I know
so all of a sudden I discovered that if
I say say cheese in my camera app it
will actually automatically take a
picture but there was no prior learning
to how to do that I didn't know it could
I couldn't even read about it in the
phone setting or the camera setting or
something like that
I actually looked for it later I
accidentally found out that's not
discoverability right but it's a really
smart way of piggybacking off the
natural speech that the user is using I
was going to say say cheese anyway so
let's use that so that's a really clever
way you can also give smart examples
when you're act asking questions for for
instance America tends to switch around
the dates you guys do a year month date
right or date month year yeah awesome
that's the correct way
oh this is recorded yeah well anyway so
let's say if if you say please tell me
your date of birth with a month day and
year then you need to try to remember
what what order did they say it and okay
month that's January and it will take a
little bit longer for me to actually
convert that to my date if you in
stealth steps say please tell me your
date of birth such as January 29th 1975
it would be so much easier to actually
just switch out for you for for your
numbers instead or your dates instead so
I don't have to actually think about it
so it's a little bit easier if you if
you translate it more generic answer but
sometimes discoverability isn't enough
and the user wants to know more commands
that you can provide them with so make
sure that the user can actually ask for
help you could if you have visuals show
them a full list or or for one topic or
things like that
of what commands they can actually use
or you can also read them up loud and
say this is you really like three of
them because if you read like hundred of
them that will take forever so if you
read three you could say would you want
to know what else I can do so they can
opt-in to continue another important
thing is constrained responses if the
system if I ask the system do you know
if the system asks do you want me to
order pizza I'm constrained to yes or no
that's it I don't know it's not an
answer right but what happens if the
users say yep uh-huh okay
or something like that if you don't
handle that you won't get a yes and you
won't sell any pizzas so we need to
think about that another question like
what is your favorite animal is also
constrained even though we have lots and
lots of animals but if you constrain it
much to let's say just cats and dogs you
mike misra coon switches we're cute we
don't want to miss that right yeah it's
actually Jimmy's my husband's favorite
animal and he is trying to get one and
it's illegal in Sweden he's super mad
about it so if it anyone knows a dealer
of raccoons in Sweden well what we can
do here is we look at well actually we
look at the recognition engine what they
return to us they return something
called an M best list and I won't go
really deep into this but this is
basically the same thing as confidence
so let's say we asked about what is your
favorite animal and they answer I think
it's a raccoon but this is what we get
back now we we can parse through this
and we know that raccoon is an animal
and balloon is not unless it's a balloon
animal I guess I don't know it's not in
the zoo anyway so that means that even
though balloon has a more higher
confidence we can still get that raccoon
is the best animal ever
no that's cats just just to make sure do
we have anyone from Scotland here today
one okay I don't know if I'm going to
apologize but I'm on your side okay good
so this video is a prime example of how
much what can happen if you are not
considering the different types of
responses it's a bit long but it's
hilarious so bear with me okay
mr. buttons though voice recognition
technology must love the health of us
voice recognition technology and a left
and Scotland you know try it voice
recognition technology no it won't do
Scottish accents eleven could you please
repeat that
eleven eleven eleven eleven could you
please repeat that a lug been whose idea
was us you need to try an American
accent
eleven I'm sorry did you please repeat
that plan English on segment eleven
before the same Paula England is Dick
Van Dyke yes
and smiles please speak slowly and
clearly smart house 11 I'm sorry could
you please repeat that
11 if you don't understand Elango oh
babe I came here in country whoo some
talk nerds are we back there in country
oh don't start my stop bleeding how how
can you b racist air left please speak
slowly and clearly eleven eleven eleven
eleven the city to save white
eleven eleven eleven elevators please
state which floor you would like to go
to in a clear and calm manner come was
that common fit why is it telling people
it become because if you did you say
honesty stories people would be going on
for months you have not selected a floor
if you would like to get out of the
elevator without selecting a floor
simply say open the doors please please
please open the doors please please
authentic please remain calm just wait
for it to speak you have not selected a
I'm gonna faint that's right please give
your voice and I'm gonna like
[Laughter]
I will the dark-haired guy totally I'm
from south of Sweden so I have a bit
different dialect as well but yeah this
is a prime example what happens are you
okay I saw tears before poor guys
sometimes if you are not developing for
mainstream voice you turn faces like
Alexa and Google and and all of those
platforms you might have your own
implementation right so then you might
think about using text-to-speech
if you want that computer voices which
can sound really cool of course but you
can also think about if you want to
record snippets of words or sentences so
you can get a little bit more natural
language to the users other things to
consider is will you have a push-to-talk
button or do you want to listen all the
time like Alexa does but doesn't
actually do something until you invoke
used to invoke name which is Alexa in
this case there are of course a lot more
to think about when you're doing your
own thing but this is a good start do we
have any questions before I summarize no
awesome day so to summarize think things
through before you even start will the
end user benefit from a voice user
interface and start your planning with
sample dialogues and flow and visual
mock-ups so you actually know what's
going on and consider all the other ways
you can enlighten the experience for for
your users in your solution I hope that
I have given you us some tools and and a
little understanding on how to think
when when
designing for speech so you can actually
get ahead of the competition and I will
leave you with a story on how wrong
things can go if you don't think things
through all the way there is this guy in
Springfield Missouri he said kind of
like me my husband he loves gadgets he
loves home automation so it's probably a
little lazy just like me
he realized that he needs to operate his
house because it was a little bit dumb
if you will so he went to the store and
he bought basically everything that had
the text works with apple homekit he
bought I thought - I think it was 20
Phillips hue he bought a kobe
thermostats and temperature sensors and
august smartlock so he could actually
let in his dog walker from his work on
his phone instead of actually giving him
the key which is not security right and
he had his prized possession his iPad
and in the center of his home on the
best place in the living room where he
can control everything from he was so
proud so he went home and he started to
connect everything and he invited his
friend a neighbor over and he showed him
everything look at this I can sit here
with a bear in my hand and say hey Siri
turn on the kitchen lights and it will
just go on and I can even unlock my door
I don't have to use keys anymore because
if I my phone is close to my door Siri
will know and unlock it for me I live in
the future and his friend was super
impressed and then they went about their
evening and the next day the guy comes
home from work he's driving home from
work and he's in the parking area and he
sees his neighbor and he says the
neighbor says hey can I borrow some
flour from you and he's like yeah sure
just let me parking grab my things he
said no no no need I can / myself and he
went off to the door and he said hey
Ceri open the door imagine the face on
that guy when he realized that his
friend just unlocked his door when he's
still in the car so use what I've taught
you today and go out there and make the
next generation of voice user interface
awesome
