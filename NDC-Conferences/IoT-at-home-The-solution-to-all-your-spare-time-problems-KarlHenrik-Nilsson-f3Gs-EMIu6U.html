to all your spare time problems I'm
gonna you know say sorry because I'm
going to be the guy who's going to spend
the next hour between you and beer so
I'm going to try and make the most of it
and not be too boring for now I have an
echo effect i don't know if that's good
or bad but so i'm going to talk about
hardware programming and not as much
programming there's not going to be no
code no code at all i'm just going to
talk about why you should do it and when
you do it what you should think about
and if you don't think about it what's
going to happen ok am I not seeing the
right type of slides in a second
alright so
there were okay sorry about that all
right so I'm going to talk about why
would you do this and how we should do
this but and there's a big but here the
Internet of Things is something that we
all been talking about for a long time I
said earlier today that I do not believe
that we're ever going to have one
internet of things because people love
their data people make money from data
which means that nobody's going to give
you their data because they're going to
sell the data which means that we're
going to have a lot of Internet of
Things we're going to have like maybe
the Oslo Internet of Things or in Norway
Internet of Things communicating what
Norway would like to sell to the Swedish
in other things and the English internet
things and so forth but every one of us
here there are developers will be
touched by this movement we will do
hardware development customers will
request that hardware will become a part
of what we do in the future when we
build when we build like a business
intelligence solution they're going to
want to have data from the physical
world into their business in I to help
them make even better solutions so we
have to learn this we have to understand
the implications of it and one of the
best ways to do this is simply building
your own stuff in your own home that
brings me to Todd when I started talking
I wanted to talk about the Internet of
Things I wanted to talk about building
countrywide networks where everybody you
know shares data and everything is
awesome Internet of Things and
everywhere I went somebody sat in the
front row and said but what do you build
at home what about home automation
because we love home automation don't we
who loves home automation everybody
loves home automation I love it how many
have more than one Raspberry Pi
connected in their house doing something
that automates their home or any
hardware technology like fifty percent i
love it
Todd wanted to do that Todd came to me
after Todd didn't dare to ask a question
up front but he came to me after talking
he said hi can i buy your beer yeah sure
you can buy me beer and he said I want
to start doing this at home I want to do
this in my home and I just given a talk
of how would you start doing stuff like
this he said but I'm married and it
turns out he wasn't just married he was
married to sitar is not his real name I
changed the name and he was married to
like the queen of decorating and stuff
like that and interior design and
fashion and everything in his country
like a blogger with five hundred
thousand readers or something like that
I mean good for Todd but you know he
couldn't really do stuff in his house
his house was extraordinary perfectly
arranged and there is something that we
call the wife how many people know what
the wife is everybody knows for the way
it is the wife approval factor I don't
like the wife approval factor because a
lot of my friends there are developers
have husbands a lot of my female friends
that are developers have wives it is not
it doesn't work that way so we started
calling the marriage interference factor
which meant that you had to be married
for this to work so now we call it the
spouse acceptance factor what I'm going
to go with that so what this is this is
basically in short what you can get away
with in your own doing but it also is a
measurement of buy-in if your wife or
husband or spouse or whatever you have
lot rocking chair doesn't like what you
do that dramatically limits the
opportunity that you will get to
continue doing it and it will happen a
the most southern way I'll tell you what
if you come home today and you search
your husband or
why for what i rambling not gonna put do
like that and i want to build automatic
stuff i want to automate this they're
gonna be pretty okay with it because you
like passion right you like when you're
your family has passion for things we
like that and we're gonna be like so
messy because it's a messy hobby and
suddenly you're gonna pair that people
go around to you and you know the lawn
needs cutting have you noticed that
isn't it a bit dirty in here should we
should be cooked together do you want to
have a bath there's many many ways to to
not get people in your life to do things
right we mean you'd be like them so let
me help you i have prepared an exercise
for you guys let's just practice that we
all got this hands up awesome other hand
up great so if you think the picture I'm
showing you is hi spouse a provable
factor raise your hand does this picture
have a high spouse approval factor by
the way this is my office in my previous
flat we have found the exception alright
this one then I agree with you this one
then that very common mistake if it
looks cool but it isn't practical
usually it is in a high sought spouse
approval factor it also has to be
practical and look cool last picture
good ok I think most of you got this
awesome
so why should we care about what our
family thinks why should we care about
our loved ones screw him I say no
actually if you want to do stuff at home
how many of you are gainfully employed
and works 40 hours a week or more how
much time do you actually have for this
yeah Sarah but your spouse can become
the most interest in a motivated product
owner you have ever met and you need
that I guess you will have so many ideas
to get get a fraction of knowledge a
fraction of knowledge and you will have
so many ideas I I get new ideas every
day and and I'm very thankful to have my
wife my lovely trees because she keeps
me grounded when I the Internet of
Things which knew when it was just you
know boo me and we were talking about
everywhere we actually we started
talking about things in 1997 I'm talking
about like 2012 but anyway when it
wasn't but it is today I was imagining a
fridge think about a fridge that knows
how much milk we have if you and I were
married we go shopping and we would know
exactly how much sheets we have how much
how much milk we had how much salad
or whatever you have in a fridge and I
said it to my wife and she was like nah
why not this is amazing this is amazing
this is amazing no it's not then yes
okay tell me why it's amazing so I
started well well think about this like
like you know I like milk in my coffee
and we don't have milk from any other
things that so it's often out because I
forget to buy new one now I could get
like pushing applications that would
tell me buy milk and she'd say how would
that work exactly and I said well
perhaps because it wasn't prepared for
that question like I don't know and
maybe we scales you could put scales
beneath things and you would know like
how much the way and you would get the
proportions of the things she sees a bit
of a drama queen
she walked over to the fridge she opened
it up and showed me this and she told me
in my own language which is a geek a
fridge is a stackable storage space it
is true it is true we stack things on
top of each other in a fridge we have no
idea where things goes we just throw it
in there if you're going to have party
we have beer if you're going to have is
normal if a family dinner we have food
we have potatoes we have meat and we
need people that tell us this my first
attempt to build this product would have
been a scale and it would have sucked
but because I have buy-in from my family
I have a motivated and smart product
owner who cares about the end result you
can have the same if you consider
building good products when you start
building things for home which leads us
to why on earth would we do that i'll
tell you one because we are smarter
we're smarter than google or smarter
than microsoft we're smarter than
facebook we are smarter than most people
because when we see a smart lamp we
realize the potential of it when
google's your smart lamp they try to
sell it to a thousand people we see our
needs there is impossible to sell a huge
group of people the same IT solutions
because our homes are differents our
needs are different what we do is
different we who are a collective of
people can figure out how this works but
I do not think that a bunch of people
that sits with the same people 12 hours
a day writing code will ever crack that
code you need to be in the rely on the
real
old to understand how this works also by
the way this is a smart lamp and I hate
smart labs so I just gotta say this this
is around sorry about this give me two
minutes smart lamps are horrible
horrible horrible inventions why because
you sell lamps that are connected to
with everything in it like you take 240
volt AC and then you you turn it down to
like 5 volt DC to be able to our
microprocessor inside your light bulb
with a Wi-Fi connector how dumb is that
when we can just hook up one Wi-Fi
connected one thing to control all our
labs let's change that it is just silly
idea I don't like it Lou but what about
data I told you previously data is
valuable why do we give it away where do
you give your data way would you tell me
where you were yesterday for free you
wouldn't hmm suspicious if i gave you a
thousand in norwegian crowns when you
tell me where you were yesterday
interesting so we determine that data
has a value to you but why do you
constantly give you data way you have
facebook twitter something like that we
give our later way i give my data way
every day for free to reserve a software
so to get to get through receive a
software-as-a-service solution i give my
data way to somebody restores it and
doesn't even let me access it there's no
Facebook API maybe there is whether
there is a Facebook API sorry about that
but there's not an API where I can do
like smart searches for my data data
that's just me i can do smart started
towards the data that facebook chooses
to show me through their api so that's
also one of the reason if we build it
ourselves we can be the first frontier
of data we can store our own data and
then we decide what we want to share
with the outside world make sense
and your brain gets smarter this is I
mean the Internet of Things is going to
be a thing probably not what we think
it's going to be but it's something I
mean so something is going to happen
with it something is going to become of
the Internet of Things and we might as
well now start understanding electronics
and stuff like this for dinner things
because if we don't we're screwed other
developers are going to be better than
us smarter than us quicker than us are
there any web developers here today how
many of you do not know JavaScript when
I started in this industry there were
web developers who told me how I don't
need to learn JavaScript they're not
there are no longer gainfully employed
all right so I'm going to tell you about
the first project I just bought a house
by the way I'm going to tell you about
the first pride I did and why that also
is the reason to why we should build
stuff and then i will stop nagging you
about why you should build stuff so this
September I had a happiest day of my
life I bought my dream house I moved
there with the woman of my dreams my
beautiful product manager and I suddenly
had a place to do all those projects
that I had envisioned in my mind I'm
gonna build this I'm going to automate
that I'm gonna fix these things but
apparently having a house means that you
have to mow the lawn and stuff like that
so I haven't built that much until till
one day my phone rings in my office yeah
it's Carl can do for you oh hi honey
what no i didn't gain mail are you got
the mail awesome no i didn't see the
heating bill how much 6,000 swedish
crowns
what did you do so I had a 6,000 so you
know almost a six hundred euro heating
bill was november fine but i was shocked
why was it so expensive so i started
thinking with you what is the reason
behind this okay what changed okay so in
june we almost cold showers just you
know getting clean now we take warm
baths and warm shower maybe it's the
shower that is the most expensive part
maybe it's the bath maybe it's that
stuff that actually cost a lot money so
I want to figure this out I want to have
something that tells me how warm or cold
is my shower how much does every shower
costs me so I installed a humidity
sensor in each of our showers that would
tell me if a shower was running or not i
installed sensors on i install a webcam
on top of the reader for for water how
much water we used and i use an API hide
yeah I know but its analog what I'm not
gonna do OCR reading works it's a
technology all right sorry it's not a
webcam above the analog reader so I can
see how much water was being consumed
before during and after the shower and
then I can make an estimated guess how
much more am I actually consuming and
then I needed to figure out how much is
the heating of that water costing me
that actually helped because the heating
that we're using we have heating system
that's delivered to the house you know
they pump hot water into the house they
actually have an API so you can just
hook yourself up to it and it will tell
you so put all this stuff together just
to find out that we pay pennies for a
shower
but I could never ever have done this
with any solution that you could buy in
the store I really really wanted to do
this but it was impossible to me for me
to figure out that no ready-made
solution wouldn't help me do this and I
do not believe for a second that the
ideas that you have that you have that
you have or any one of you here is in
the long run ready-made purchase stuff
that's also one of the biggest reasons
what we really have to start building
our own stuff so I'd like to present to
you my four rules to white building
things with a high spot except the
factor these are also directly
translatable to building products that
actually people will buy number one
administration is the devil how many
notes of this is
this is the DevOps release cycle love it
learn to love it if you have one hour
every third day which is roughly what I
have to do you do not want to spend one
hour figuring out how to get your latest
piece of software published to your
sensor system you do not want to spend
time figuring that out do it up front
fix that piece of the puzzle how do i do
release is in seconds I want to write
code and test something I want to have
the DevOps solution I when I have
continued integration release it
extraordinary important to do this thing
the second most important thing with
animal administration is that this also
has to do a little bit about looks these
batteries you're going to use batteries
for a lot of your application at least
you want to use batteries for a lot of
applications but how many of you
actually do so almost fifty percent how
to raspberry pi or something like that
running in your house doing automation
shorts and one guy have battery powered
equipment this is why
so Arduino is extraordinary much less
power-hungry than rats papayas so with a
9-volt battery of twelve hundred
milliamps it will last less than a day
on battery power for a regular Arduino
if you use an arduino pro mini but you
don't modify to anything even get up to
10 days put your spouse enjoy changing
batteries on something that they rely on
do you think you will get buy-in if you
have to change the batteries every 10
days what do you think no you won't
they'll hate it and it will stop using
it and will just become a clunky piece
the thing that they hate low all right
but if we actually get an audience for
meaning and modify it we remove the
power light we change to a much much
better regulator that's all I did on the
ones that I've read about for this test
and I also duplicated this test so I
haven't actually tried that it runs for
three and a half years because you get
battery problems before that but the
math is saying you will get it down to
three and a half years in sleep mode
three and a half years now I said sleep
mode how many people know what sleep
mode for microprocessor is good good
people so sleep mode is one of the most
important things when you're designing a
hardware thing that you don't want to
have that administrative battery for if
you want to have a long strong battery
time you want to have use the sleep mode
of most microprocessor most people have
this Arduino asset for example which
means that at certain points they will
go into a very very low power
consumption mode and at specific things
like a timer or an event that triggers
it it will go back up connect to the
internet through whatever it does and it
will talk two devices around it then
back to sleep we do this to be able to
actually have battery-powered devices
another thing that's extraordinary
important if you want to have good
battery power if the way that we
communicate with our cloud services so
MQTT amqp stump and HTTP we have
different needs of different transfer
protocols there's a bit of a better
analogy to show how they differ the
mustachioed guide it just shows us that
amqp is a bit of a mustache amputee it's
a little little no you can notice it
stump is a big American man mustache and
this is HTTP don't use HTTP ok so MQTT
is the one I use most frequently which
is straw Denari small it uses very
little data which is good if you use
like a sim card at home that usually for
a night IOT device you have 30 megabytes
a month that is a lot for an amputee
package that's just giving telemetry
data MGT takes longer to connect to a
service then HTTP does but in the long
run you will save 5% battery using MQTT
than HTTP and you can send thousands
more message then you can do with HTTP
on the same amount of battery it's a pub
sub library spot it's good I like it
amqp is so advanced machine King
protocol it is more commonly used is
used by a lot of big band a lot of big
corporate people it is very similar to
amputee it is three times larger but
that's still an extraordinary small
footprints like six bytes for a package
so if you want to implement em key to
your amqp though the specifications have
gotten
bit out of hand so I'm still waiting for
them to fix that Peter Hitchens wrote an
excellent blog post a critique of amqp
which is very very detailed in what the
problem with day and QP specifications
are both are these are asynchronous
those are based on tcp and is pub/sub
libraries that are really really well to
use my normal design factor is n QT
internally inside my home network and
amqp between my home systems and
services outside of my network i'll talk
more about that moment so the smaller
the protocol the less power we use it
makes sense it takes less time that we
have to wake up send something and go
back to sleep it's that simple we want
to minimize time we want to minimize the
power that we need to actually calculate
what we're going to do up building HTTP
strings in JSON or doing binary data I
know what C is the best at so radio
radio transmission protocols Wi-Fi they
all support this kind of stuff you don't
have to choose life 66 Wi-Fi lo pan and
ble or whatever you choose to use they
can all support as long as they can
support TCP you can implement these
protocols over them you can also
implement them over over radio systems
and a small CPU it's not ideal for big
protocols it's also something you think
about because the Arduino isn't a
powerful processor you can't do amqp
with ssl reputation on the Nate mega
it's probably you can do but it will
take you forever and that is not very
very good all right
sorry I've been talking a lot sorry so
building your own isn't always we have
to kind of like select where we start if
you know nothing of electronics I don't
think the building you're building from
scratch is perhaps the best option
unless that's what you want to do start
with an Arduino and abstract the
abstract away when you wish to learn
something or something isn't good enough
but build your own IOT devices build
your own automation devices but to not
go crazy start with modules and then
abstract your way down ok next rule
design with failure in mind so one of
the most common thing that people do
when they start automating things is
putting the processor in the middle
that's very odd I've been to number of
places people talked about yes I hooked
up the previous lamp controlling button
to the processor and made the processor
the lamp controlling process which means
that now when my code breaks I can turn
on the lights glorious let's say we have
another option let's say that we make
the lamp button a lamp button that sends
an event to our microprocessor now we're
designing with failure in mind if our
microprocessor dies we use as a service
we can no longer communicate with this
service we can no longer tell if
somebody pushed the button or not but as
we walk into a room we can still turn on
the lights and see if the battery is
dead or whatever happen if the dog ate
the cables are this is useful we can
also add things to the processor to
observe what everything we're automating
this means that if somebody pushes the
button and the cable is out and we
doesn't get the signal
but the service is still up and running
because he's wireless and has battery
power it can still tell us that ok so we
didn't get the signal but hey the lamp
is on so don't worry about it I got you
covered this is also part of the signing
for failure we think about how can we
observe the events they want to do in
more than one way make sense to you ok
let's talk about cloud services this is
a very very common way for people to set
up cloud services you sell your micro
processors to talk to the cloud and then
they do that no problems right and then
the internet goes down and you get
nothing you cannot communicate your apps
can only communicate your devices
everything is just gone again we should
design for failure so what can we do to
improve this well one of the things is
that if we have very very like sensitive
data that we want to take care maybe we
have an aquarium but it's very very
important that we actually store the
data of the water quality or whatever
we're doing that example I know but I'm
I don't actually know when this would be
good but one of the things we can do is
actually locally store data but a lot
better would be to have all the required
system inside our networks and then have
one point that speaks to the cloud
service because this means there are app
internally in our network can always
communicate with the devices even if the
internet dies and we can add more points
that makes the internet less likely to
die for example if the Wi-Fi dies we can
have an ethernet connection and stuff
like that we can even add more devices
we can add security and abstractions
upon this is currently my setup at home
and I'm actually because of asia's
amazing up time recently I'm thinking
about doing this but again
the more you design for failure the more
you think about what can go wrong and
how can I make sure it doesn't will help
you get buy-in from your family it's a
good way to make people like what you
build because it's available and it is
you can they can trust it they will
start using it and apps they start using
it you can do you can build add-ons with
your kids so you can you can actually
build this is amazing I've done this
you're gonna love this you can build
something for your spouse which is
basically you doing your hobby and they
will thank you for it which is lovely
don't worry i run a mac but if this
would have happened i would hurt a spare
laptop with this presentation on because
i designed this presentation with what
awesome right rule number three out of
sight is out of mind nobody loved likes
a cluttered home if you remember Todd's
wife she hated a cluttered home she
wanted neat and tidy things that she
could take pictures for input on blogs
sure I know people like that unlike him
but I know people like that so one good
thing is to actually start to think
about this right out of the box so how
can we put things where people won't
find them well people don't see what our
custom to you can buy a fire alarm
housings for one dollar each ebay and
i've tried this I made actual
experiments with this in the office I
put 10 in the roof nobody said anything
I mean if people actually thought about
it why do we have 10 fire alarms what
are they afraid of
but we don't people don't think about it
you go your brain goes fire alarm nah I
ignore that you don't think about people
don't see what there are customed to I
have a friend of mine for 26 years he's
been married for 24 of those years he
had a mustache it took his wife two
years no two months I mean to realize
that he shaved his mustache people don't
see what they're accustomed to also
people rarely look on their stuff you
couldn't sit at a public bench and
public place if you did which means it
is a possible awesome way to put thanks
put him under things people will never
see them now putting something inside a
wall can be tempting because I'm said
now that hide things hi things away
remove them and you want to put things
inside wall you don't do that because
putting something inside a wall means
you will never ever get to it it's gone
if it breaks down that functionality is
gone or you're gonna have to remove
drywall get the thing plaster I mean
you're not going to do that so and a lot
of people that dust this I don't know
why they do it but it put things inside
walls and then I go oh yeah also it's a
fire risk so don't do that you can buy
these at most shops and it's just like
firewalls even need the ocular fire
alarms firewalls people don't think of
them you can't put ten of these but you
can put one in a room and people will
not actually care that much won't see it
so hide things and think about it
directly which leads us to rule number
for everything is a project
when you start doing something and I'm
so guilty of this think about what you
want to do why do you want to automate
and how are you going to do it plan
ahead figure I'm going to need these
resistors I'm going to need this
microprocessor I'm going to need this
cable and I gonna need this sensor and I
need these two things then order those
and do your project and you will not
have an office it looks like this but
now you're thinking okay so learning
what if I have to try something I don't
know I don't know what I'm going to need
learning is a project quite a few things
you need to actually see what you could
do and then get rid of it you can buy
things anywhere anytime any day you can
go out in Oslo and you can have all the
things you need for a project at a day
you don't have to store it at your home
there will be times when you want to buy
sheep with stuff buy things for on the
cheap but in the end just make it a
project because small probably make it
small project because you can iterate
them two big projects this means and
this is actually not even that
complicate let's say you want to
automate a lamp and you do one you do
really well do really really well you
build an app for it you learn samuray
nor something cool so it works with all
the phones that people can get you do
that well and people who come home and
say okay click I worked nice but people
get accustomed to things very quickly
our brain is very lazy if we can
automate things people love that because
our brain no one to do things they want
to think think about things our brains
wanna relax and very quickly you can
make something that previously was
nothing into a hassle which means that
people want more of it you can get
buy-in from it that means you can
iterate your projects even bigger and
you can still have family that's happy
about it and you will not go crazy
because you have ten unfinished projects
that you
did how many people here have unfinished
project yeah I'm in the right room so
start thinking about this way and start
involving people around you is like
involve your wife involve your husband I
say wife because I have one not because
i'm sexist okay start involving people
and start getting them to help you and
it will have it will be so much better
so a good friend of mine mutts he he did
what Todd should have done he's a smart
man he built this this is the most
buying think you want to start with a
project build a magic mirror and just
make it say I love you then you can do
facial recognition and give personal
messages to people he do so much with
this if anybody doesn't know what this
is this is just a two-way mirror in the
front of a screen powered by Raspberry
Pi an extraordinary simple project to do
that most people love and also it's
super useful you I if you can start
collecting data from your home and
showing it on the screens you can start
setting everything up actually
controlling them from this place and you
might get away with having stuff like
this once in a while alright so
selecting the perfect hardware platform
this is impossible how many hardware
platform Florida when you when did you
first hear of eat IOT six years ago ok
how many hardware platforms were that
six years ago that you knew about one
yeah exactly without like rd you know or
something like that how many are there
today I don't think I can count them I
can stand here for 50 minutes just
saying hardware
from names for together the list there's
always new platforms but this leads us
into something that's quite funny this
is the problems we know about right
because we're developers how many Yahveh
script frameworks have you seen since
jquery because we have learned
abstractions we have learned to remove
our code so we can actually do something
with it we can actually exchanged things
for other things I mean we have the same
problem set and we can use the same
solutions we just need to DQ pool or
hardware things and make them less
necessary to handle stuff like this so
if we have an Arduino that talks MQTT
and we want to replace this with
something new that we just found the NBC
Oslo awesomesauce IOT device as long as
it talks MQTT this stuff around it won't
care that sounds the same that's the
same stuff I don't need this I don't
have a problem with this so this is how
I'll have designed my current system so
it's running an IOT hub Asher and I have
an AM qpq and i'm using adapters which
is there actually the raspberry PI's
that you saw previous picture I'm doing
this because the Arduino s and the
esp8266 that you see in picture aren't
very good at generating SSL and after I
if you have requires SSL and also
because i want the abstraction layers so
what i'm doing here is i'm sending crypt
ated MQTT to raspberry PI's the
raspberry PI's handle everything
internally so that I can connect with my
apps and stuff like that your raspberry
PI's and then uploads to the IOT hub
with amqp so that i can do services and
consumers on the azure side when I want
to aggregate data and stuff like that
and do statistical things that I want to
download but doesn't really have need to
have access to should the internet go
down because I don't think that my wife
will care
if you can see the statistics on the
weather or if you can see the statistics
of the showers but i do think she will
be pretty pissed at me if you can't turn
on the lamps right but now we're talking
software architecture and we have to
think in those terms but it is just
software architecture it's nothing new
so always designed for spouse acceptance
factor it will build a better system
even when you do have to work even when
you're working with customers think in
these terms what a user is not a techie
like how would I build this for somebody
who is not like me and we can beat all
of the big players we can beat Google
and Facebook and all of those people out
of the water by thinking ahead thinking
what people use when google recently
killed off the nexus was it what was it
called the little thermal thermostat
nest you know but nest they killed it
kill aphids they had over a hundred
products that it could connect to it but
it can sell it because it was a
specialized product it was an
unspecialized product people with
specialized needs that will never sell
keep it hidden accessible select the
device most suitable for the job but
make sure that you can replace it if you
need to DQ pull everything from each
other that goes for software and goes
for hardware design would failure in
mind and if it can't be replaced it will
be there forever if you put something in
a wall you will never get rid of it if
you can't the couplet it will be there
forever and in three years time you will
be sorely tired of that thing so like
software system then goal is scalability
and adaptability and so we want to use
cloud services but we don't want to lock
yourself to cloud services we want to be
able to access things outside of our
cloud services even if we don't have
internet we want to have decoupled
systems we can communicate with and we
want to do stuff that it's nice that we
can scale out and work in iterations
prior to start small but grows to big
things that our family loves so I lied
to you previously say I will solve all
your spare time problems but in a way I
have because if you start doing this I
guarantee you you will never have a
minute of spare time but on the other
hand you will also never be bored again
you'll never ever have a board minute of
your life because it will always be
something to do there's fun that is
interesting and that you hopefully with
some of my advice can bring your entire
family to enjoy and to work with all
right let's go grab a beer thanks for
listening
I have about five minutes left on my
timer I think so if you want to ask a
question are you come up here or you
know just shut it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
