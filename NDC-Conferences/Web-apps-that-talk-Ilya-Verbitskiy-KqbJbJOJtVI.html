and I'm doing information security at
work and today I'm going to talk about
application then can that can talk half
a year ago I started my own home project
like home automation and I wanted to use
speech recognition to do that and you
know nowadays you can go to amazon and
buy tools like as except for example or
various curtain and you understand and
Google now for Android so I just didn't
want to use those built-in things I want
to plate my on my own and since I'm
working mostly with web i found that we
already have some speech in egyptian
features built into our browsers and so
it was just quick and easy to start
building something well speech API so
right now it's a just a draft and the
latest version was done in june 714 and
it's still evolving so hopefully it'll
be production ready soon there are three
main components of this API first of all
there is a interface called speech
recognition this interface which is
responsible for actually recording your
voice and converting it into text and in
Google Chrome you have to use WebKit
graphics to use it speech synthesis it's
another interface which is responsible
for actually providing sound from your
text and there is a short interface
speech changes to pterence actually this
is an interface which actually which
takes your text and converts into sound
and you can attend voice or volume and
configure how to have sound will be
played on your browser
so let's go and see the demo okay so I
do a really simple application here is
like Google something like Google
Translate where you can start recording
test so and though once i convert my
speech to text I can translate it and
let's pronounce it or you can use
different language hello technology so
send the buck report to google so it
kind of worked as you can see not
perfect and let's see the code again
first of all I will show you the
function get the better fistful i'll
show you the function which is recording
the speech so speech is an object or
WebKit each other kid speech recognition
and what you should do to use it first
of all this about the language it will
be English French whatever and for
example Google Chrome supports dozen
different languages like French Spanish
Chinese I think you in Korean or
Japanese and then you have to have a
handler on result this is only thought
is an event which is called once you've
done with species with speech recording
and once your text ready and inside this
the one result it went you will have a
parameter and it contains a bunch of
results because
for example there might be multiple
sentences and for example can say some
things and her boss and then some say
something else in this case you have an
array of sentences and different
variations how your web browser
understood what you said for example as
you seem like on the girl on the demo i
say i didn't say channel but browser
understood that is channel but for
example if you have better speech
recognition engine you might see like a
channel or I know hi so they might be
like a different variation situation you
have for a number which shows how goods
or how good results are one is maximum
so if it's one then it means it's like
hundred percent sure by browser hundred
percent sure that you say this and
usually it's like 0.9 0.8 at it so
google chrome and so and then you just
go start and you will see a small pop-up
in the browser to look at it ask for
permission to access microphone and then
you just record the sound and at the end
when you click stop we just go use stop
method here and once top method is used
your own adult event will be cold and
you will see the evil seem result and so
then once you get results you should
convert text to speech and played it's
even easier so it's all done here first
of all in my demo i have different
languages in this case you have to
convert your language texas presentation
like p.m. to english or are you too
russian so the web api provides you get
voices
method these medical journals list of
supported languages but there is a
workaround unfortunately get voices
method looks like a synchronous but it's
an seng journals in general so when it
will go to the to the first time your
browser will wait for like for a second
to to to upload all speech synthesis
voices and in this case you should use
you should use this fact we set interval
so you go get what is first time either
it's nothing then you have to record
again and again before your browser
actually loaded and this is a re known
bug or feature of google chrome so
you're this way unfortunately so once
you have your voice you create your
current object and in my example i just
say okay i want to use the particular
voice like language depending voice for
my sound and you go speak method that's
it
and last question is can we start using
this right now for real world
application and the answer is yes and no
as you can see this feature is fully
supported in Google's wrong for years
now and so this picture is not
particular correct because this
speciation is also included to Firefox
but it's on the sandbox so you have to
go to Firefox configuration and enable
special features media web speech
recognition enable it should be true and
unfortunately other browsers do not
support this yet I like from my opinion
this is the future and this is a more
this is a target where our world is
moving and this speech interfaces are
getting more and more popular nowadays I
believe that sooner or later age and
Safari will support the speciation
engine as well and since we have the
progressive web application nowadays you
can start experimenting and playing with
this feature and for example builded for
google chrome if it works and like work
around for a full age and the 1h
supported it will start working yep
that's actually thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
