my name is David Briella
I'm a senior Technical Evangelist at
Microsoft I'm based down in Melbourne
now with Microsoft I've been going
around flying around asia-pacific doing
a lot of initial blockchain peripheral
concepts with our customers
so these big enterprise customers around
the APAC region and I've been seeing a
lot of things again and again questions
that arise when I go to talk about
blockchain usually what is it how does
it work how does mining work what is
hashing etc and so my session today is
I've got I wish I've got like two or
three days worth of pure content I could
just present non-stop for three days and
this stuff I condense it down to about
two hours of content that I'm going to
present in 60 minutes so I've got a
hundred and twenty slides I'm just going
to keep clicking rapidly so my
objectives for my talk today is of
course there's just so much and all of
you here hearing about blockchain for
the first time by jected for today to
just introduce what the blockchain is
trying to explain a lot of different use
cases for why you would want to use it
and just mainly get you guys excited
about what it is and why you would want
to use it it's not just another database
and so my agenda for today I'm going to
go cover off what is a blockchain again
go explain blockchain 1.0 technology go
and say why should skip down and go
straight to the 2.0 technology stuff
what is up on Azure events you can go to
you in Australia to go and start
learning about this stuff that's the
first 30 minutes and then I will go it's
been the last half hour just on pure use
cases how cool and futuristic and just
like in cyberpunk this stuff is so I
just came back from holiday on two weeks
and I spent the two weeks on the coast
of Croatia just sitting there with my
Kindle rereading back through
Neuromancer the original cyberpunk book
and going but we can do this stuff now
it's cool so all of my slides I got from
he used to be a Silverlight MVP Alex
Knight so he now lives over in Japan and
he's been taking all these neon future
cyberpunk futuristic photos around Japan
so this asked his permission to use his
photos throughout here so let's jump
back before blockchain though
so when we wanted to go and buy
something would have to go and do it
physically in person well if I wanted to
go and buy a buy a phone I'd have to go
we'll go meet somewhere and I'll go to a
physical store
I'll give them money they'll give me the
phone yeh but the problem with that is
having to be physically located to go
and purchase things really limits what
you can do you have to go travel to the
next city the next village go to the
store etc so when we got to online
trading ecommerce this unlocked a whole
bunch of stuff I could go send them the
money they would go send me the phone
and we're all happy except for the
scenarios that we've all heard on eBay
we send the money they don't send the
phone what do we do them so that's why
we have this concept of trusted third
parties these intermediaries that sit in
the middle because we can't trust random
anonymous people on the Internet
we can't just send the money straight to
the bank account we go through PayPal
would go through eBay and for the
privilege of using them they take the
big cuts and so what I want to do and
this is where all the crypto Punk cyber
futuristic stuff comes into is let's
just get rid of the corporation's we
don't need them what if instead of
having to pay a trusted third party to
do that for us we use a smart contract
on the blockchain we spin up a smart
contract for this transaction I send the
money into it they go and send me the
coin send me the phone once I've got it
I go and send a message as a smart
contract saying everything's good on my
side they send it saying everything's
good on their side and we go and I
forgot to start my timer we both sign it
and then the smart contract will unlock
the funds and send it to the person so
that's all good and if we do that we've
cut out those corporations cut out the
middleman we're saving money on those
merchant fees we've got faster money
transfers because it happens instantly
now there's a great joke that happens
there it's faster to stand an anvil to
China then is to send money to China
because the amount of intermediaries and
banks and clearinghouses have to get
through and take seven eight days to get
the money there or two days to set an
anvil to China now of course things can
still mess up they may not send a favor
may still have an argument so what we
can agree to up front when we create a
smart contract is if there's any
conflict or disagreement in the smart
contract it could go and bring in an
intermediary to go and arbitrate between
us and there can be a penalty clause in
the smart contract to go and trigger
that so we can still go and put some
trust in it now let's move on to a
business scenario now we've all built
systems exactly like this we've got our
company we're interacting with another
company and we need to send purchase
orders to each other
now we go and send it but we've all seen
this happen as much as we put in as much
checks and exception handling and etc
things just don't reconcile between the
two companies no matter how hard we try
with service buses and all this type of
stuff things still get out of sync you
still have this monthly reconciliation
process and they never line up and so
the next thing logical thing we usually
go to is okay let's go and put a
centralized database between it all we
can do that and yeah technically you can
do that technology's not the problem
here a problem is governance once you've
got this the problem is who owns and
controls a centralized database
it requires trust between all the
parties around who's hosting it it may
be okay with just two parties if you've
got five different companies all
interacting with each other who's going
to be the company if who's hosting that
you're pointing a lot of trust in them
to not go and mess with the data and
what if that company starts doing bad
things and the other four don't have any
recourse so what if instead we put a
blockchain in the middle we can have now
save the source of truth is the
blockchain so we're removing the trust
and the governance from people and
putting that trust into a blockchain
instead and how does it all work not
through that because that's just the
same the advantage of the blockchain the
advantage of the blockchain is mostly
I'm going to keep driving this home and
a ting the need for trust with middlemen
cutting out those corporations we're
reducing the
all because we can trust the data in the
blockchain we can go and speed up things
we can go and confirm things instantly
instead of waiting days or weeks for
things to go through clearing houses we
can reduce costs etc but the four main
key tenants that all blockchain
technologies have is that it's all based
on cryptographic functions I'll get into
them more it's distributed we don't have
one single database that's running this
this blockchain is replicated and
decentralized over many many many nodes
so you can't just hack one though you'd
have to hack all nodes simultaneously
which is a lot harder it's shared you're
the networking effect to get out of it
I'll talk about later about calling into
multiple smart contracts and importantly
it's a ledger so what is a ledger it
just looks like normal accounting thing
it's just a line by line David sent
bitcoins to daran daran sent them to
Matthew just line by line by line so
just a giant transaction log and that's
what bitcoin really is under the covers
just a giant transaction log I've got
five Bitcoin I'm sending them to someone
who's sending them to someone else so
that's okay we can have those but how do
we really know that the transaction that
says David sent five bitcoins to Darren
how do we know that that's a real
transaction and this is where all that
cryptography comes in comes down to
basic public private key cryptography we
I generate a public/private key pair and
my public key that's what my Bitcoin
address is so we can go and assign five
Bitcoin against them just an address
which says one two three four and we
know that that address has five Bitcoin
so if I want to go and send so I can see
my account has 50 aetherium I want to
send enough to Darren's address I would
just go down write that transaction send
five from me to him I'll sign it with my
private key so now everyone else in the
network knows that this transaction is
valid because it's going from this
public key address and spin signs of
that private key and everything gets
updated through that transaction log
that's basics of blockchain now some of
the other things that are built on top
this though is cryptographic hashing
functions so in programming we will
probably use sha md5 etc the idea that
you can take a text ring or a digital
file like an image or a PDF etc you run
it through md5 or sha-1 and you get out
just a cryptographic value the idea here
being if you change a single bit or a
single character so if you change the 5
to or 6 it massively changes the
resulting output so that way you can go
and prevent fraud by seeing what if the
cryptographic hash has changed so if
someone tries to modify that transaction
massively changes a hash they can't go
and change something under the covers
another concept is this idea of Merkle
trees where instead of just having a
single hash for a single value we can go
and combine all these hashes together up
into a top-level hash so we've got four
individual bits of data I can hash each
of these individually we can go combine
these two hashes into a another hash we
can go and combined these ones into that
so we can go and use a single hash value
to secure vast and vast vast amount of
data underneath it and that those are
all the primitives you need to know
about blockchain from then on it's
rather simple so inside of a blockchain
we have multiple blocks a single block
has a number of things it has the
address it has a the hash value what the
block before it was it's got all of the
transactions that are in this block a
nonce and a hash for this block I'll
explain this in a second
so if we were to generate a new block
the first thing a block needs is what
the hash walls of the previous one
rather block that we're building on top
of we go put the transactions in that we
want we just start off with a nonce of
one and then we go and hash this entire
block and what we see is that the hash
of this block is 2 2 F 4 8 8 etc now one
of the rules with securing a blockchain
is that's this hash it's got to be below
of that got to be below a certain number
so this is why this block starts off
with zeros our
because it has to be below nine could
drill Ian and so this is that numbers
much much larger so this is where the
idea of this Bitcoin mining comes in to
go all these miles are trying to be the
first one to find a valid block so they
keep on modifying the nonce so the model
change it to to rehash it it's still too
big it will go through trying random
nonces and this is why they're burning
more and more electricity than some
small countries around the world running
these algorithms trying to be the first
ones to find a valid nonce that will
give you go they finally found a valid
nonce give us the hash which is below a
certain number boom they're the first
person in the world to find it they get
rewarded with a couple of Bitcoin which
at the so every ten minutes someone gets
awarded something like fifty thousand
dollars or something every ten minutes
and then then when it gets a reward and
we keep going so once someone has found
a valid block they would go and now to
the whole network it would go get sent
out redistributed and everything happens
again so everyone start racing to be the
first one to find the next block now the
reason why they we secure it like this
that make it makes it so hard for
someone to find a valid block is where
all the security and blockchain comes
from so we keep on building these up
building these up each of these point to
the hash of the block before it which
means when Darren sent me five Bitcoin
and I try to modify it say another
Darren's sent me 500 Bitcoin which is a
couple million dollars if I go and
change this transaction what happens if
I go and rehash this well it means that
this hash has changed because I change
that one small value here through that
Merkel tree this hash has massively
massively changed which means this block
is now invalid because it's pointing to
this hash address so if I'm modifying
this I'd have to update this which means
this hash dress is gone it just keeps
going all the way up and up and up and
up so the point of this is to try and
stop troy hunts favorite people that the
hackers wearing hoodies this case we've
got a cyberpunk neon hacker going on
here
but this is all the secured through
blockchain is from this a small trying
to change something tiny in a block has
massive repercussions doesn't have to
regenerate the entire blockchain which I
couldn't do on hardware available to me
meanwhile everyone else is still on the
main real blockchain still going forward
so I've never catch-up in time and all
of this putting a combining all this
together meaning that we can trust the
data that is inside of the blockchain
means that we get the internet of trust
so whereas the web and the Internet is
just the web of data we can't trust in
the information of data that's on there
because it can be changed at any point
in time the blockchain is the internet
of trust and this is where all the
things are built on top of now we've got
three main things to consider when we're
looking at blockchain technology if
you're thinking about using this in your
application the first one is where is
your application target audience is it a
consumer to consumer app or a business
to consumer app if so it's probably
going to be a public blockchain which is
at the moment Bitcoin aetherium if
you're doing anything in a b2b space
you're doing back-end process
improvements doing purchase orders etc
most people will in public internet
probably don't need to know or care
about your purchasing of widgets so you
can do that in a private consortium
between yourself and the other companies
in that case you'd be doing a private
consortium with a theory a more hyper
ledger etc once you know if you're
running in a public or a private
blockchain then you can figure out the
consensus algorithm is it going to be
mining like we saw that's any really
useful for public blockchain where we
don't trust anyone if we're in a private
consortium we kind of trust people in it
so we can use different types of
consensus algorithms which means you can
do block times faster get more
transactions per second out so we can
use proof of stake proof of identity
peripheral thority many many many
different consensus algorithms if you
get to that point you should probably
bring me in a lot of stuff to consider
there a final thing is to worry about
are you gonna be working on blockchain
1.0 or 2.0 tech
so let's explore that what does
blockchain 1.0 give us
what does 2.0 give us so 1.0 block
change these are the original ones that
pioneered this and all these are single
use case fixed function things where all
the functionality is just built in you
can't change it and this is Bitcoin -
dead cash dogecoin etc now these are all
good but they all have single functions
and if we think where these ones fit in
a typical three-tier architecture would
have a user interface business logic and
then data being stored somewhere and
blockchain 1.0 stuff is only really
focusing on this data store area so for
example who owns which Bitcoin if we
want to go interact with a Bitcoin
network we need to have some business
logic somewhere goin executing on it
which means we have to trust whoever is
running this business logic on our
behalf but now that we've but because we
have a trusted data store any
appointment can look at the data store
and look up who has what Bitcoin and so
because we can use that to see the
source of truth yeah it unlocks three
main different use cases now first one
being ownership now the ocean can be
over digital assets or physical assets
digital assets can be things like again
money Bitcoin aetherium but it could be
for other digital items could be for
Magic the Gathering cards or yu-gi-oh so
when you in the schoolyard instead of
having to physically have the cards you
can go and pull out your phone and prove
that you own the blue-eyes White Dragon
we can do it with board of warcraft
items so i go and find a legendary hey i
can go sell in a secondary market and go
and do it on a decentralized exchange
pokemon if i'm going doing a battle just
before the battle we can go and verify i
do have that level 100 pikachu we can do
all of that on here oh it can uh strike
skins and Team Fortress 2 hats these
things are going crazy so these are just
in-game skins you can unlock for your
gun which puts like flames and stuff on
them you get them from random unlocks
and so people are trading these for
literally ten thousand dollars just for
a single make your gun look pretty and
so there's heaps of
fraud going on with this where people go
and buy these skins online people take
the money not send the skin and so
people are screaming out for some type
of blockchain based system to show who
owns these items and they can trade it
more securely they can deal with any
digital asset domain names media so with
paintings and physical art you can have
one and those things go for a lot when
you have an original by Van Gogh or
something like that but no equivalent in
the digital space so what some digital
artists are doing now is they'll go take
it put a watermark over it sell it to
put on the blockchain who the owner of
this piece of digital art is to create
some digital scarcity about whose owner
of this item and they're doing this for
when people are commissioning them to do
things so people can still go and on
sell here was an owner of this piece of
digital artwork and we could go and do
with physical assets so whose owner of
this car so the car could be smart to
only let you and members of your family
into the car you can go and get
insurance for your car because you can
prove you own this car you can do with
apartments letting people in things like
that so the first one was around
ownership second one is around
attestation going and proving that
something happened at a point in time so
it could be I go and sign a home loan
and we're going to take that home loan
run it through the cryptographic hash
again put it up onto the blockchain so
later on if the bank and I are having a
disagreement because the bank has gone
changed the paper contract to change it
from 5% to 8% interest I can pull mine
out and go no no no no but it's the 5%
will go to the courts and would have
lots of arguments but if we can go and
prove what the hash was of the original
we could go and prove that mine were the
5% was a real value so this is being
able to prove what's that stuff happened
at a point in time we do the same thing
with IOT data so for in a factory or
somewhere that needs lots of safety we
could go and every 10 minutes worth of
IT data go build up a massive miracle
tree so we can have one value for that
ten minutes worth of data keep putting
it onto the blockchain slater when the
auditors come in and we're giving them
all of the IOT data from because we're
trying to prove that we did do the
scheduled maintenance on this we can go
and prove that all
ìit data is true and correct who have
just got a couple of little miracle tree
hashes so they can go and check that all
the data we gave them is true so
attestation is a very important one and
this is where I'm most of the customers
I'm working with are learning about
these type of scenarios at the moment
and provenance is being able to go and
track the origins of where items came
from and where they've gone so if we're
going and building up a smart phone we
could go and check where all the
minerals would dug out of the ground
give each of those truckloads a hash
value all those come into the factory
could turn into metal the power bars of
metal get tracked on the blockchain go
through until they make the circuit
board the CPU and the RAM each of those
components have a unique serial number
with their own hashes so if we gain
thinking about some apple trees we could
go and say that this smartphone its
value is made up of a massive hashable
of individual components so I can check
if this phone is being modified I can go
and check all the serial numbers on the
RAM and CPU make sure no one's modified
it same thing with things like vitamins
sending them to China they've all of
them want to make sure these are real
authentic Australian vitamins that are
going there they can check the problem
to where it came from
same with classic cars that could go
open up the classic car check all the
components make sure it hasn't been
updated or any parts replaced because
they can go and check the hash of the
entire car with all of you and are all
the parts rural originals okay so that
was blockchain one you can do some
pretty cool stuff of blockchain one but
you know kicks it up into another gear
when we start talking about blockchain -
yeah blockchain - is this is blockchain
one technology came out eight years ago
no one paid it much attention until the
blockchain two technologies came out
around two years ago and now this is why
hearing lots of buzz about it when
enterprises die to adopt it it's because
we go and raise it up so it's not just a
data store layer thing anymore it's also
we can put business logic in here as if
we don't have to trust other people's
business logic we can put the business
logic in here we can verify the business
logic
because it's in the blockchain we can go
and see that the business logic hasn't
been updated so they can't just change
the five percent interest to eight
percent interest and we can put a lot
more trust and security in here now and
this is why people are starting to pay
attention at this point in time it's
because of these things called Smart
contracts this is what puts the
programmability into these block chains
a smart contract just looks like a bit
of typescript code
it's got functions it's got some
variables it's got boolean logic we can
do them in a turing-complete way to do
anything
voting applications like we saw my very
first use case the two parties vote to
unlock the fund to the seller now a
smart contract you can think of it like
a class it doesn't do anything and she
actually pay the cost to go in a stand
she ate an instance of that class into a
memory address and so you'd have a
deployed class as an object with a ram
memory address same thing here the smart
contract when you go and deploy a smart
contract you pay the cost to deploy it
into the blockchain and now you're
deployed to my contract we'll have an
address and have an address on the
blockchain so we can go and call into it
call the functions on this instance it's
got its static variables or stay there
forever
and so with these static variables you
can go and see who has the Pikachu who
has voted to unlock the Pikachu's to the
next level etc now because blockchain 2
is turing-complete
anything that you could do with
blockchain 1 each one of those different
blockchain technologies were single
fixed function use cases just like
calculators or pages but when we got the
new smartphones this weren't single
function anymore
you could learn multiple apps that could
go and replace multiple old things with
just one device now that's the same
thing here with blockchain 2 so with
aetherium what we're seeing now is what
before would have been a brand-new
blockchain to do one function that's now
just becoming a single smart contract
the etherium network which is why we're
seeing all of these new tokens and coins
appearing on here because you don't have
to run all new hardware you just utilize
the hardware
in the running support on the theorem to
just host your new token and these are
the three main blockchain 2.0
technologies at the moment what I've
been seeing with all the customers we've
been talking to it's about ninety
percent of customers are using aetherium
it's only banks using quarter because
that's what I spilt for four banks I'm a
Harper ledger is just used by a couple
of people couple of companies and from
what we've heard companies who've gone
to try a hyper ledger have gone ship and
then gone on and jump back over to a
theorem I'm just because all of the
developer mindshare and all the things
are happening in the open source
community and all the tools and
frameworks are mostly happening with
etherium my mark software supporting all
of them and you'll see later that we've
got to pop all of them but if you want a
heads up of what I'm seeing in the in
the community it's all a theorem at the
moment now blockchain one unlocked a
couple of things blockchain two unlocks
with programmability and that but this
is probably the most important thing for
me the UM contract oriented architecture
so if you cast your minds back about a
decade ago when we're getting web
services out people were talking a lot
about service-oriented architecture and
the dream and the promise that was gonna
be that all these businesses were going
to expose their business functionality
as some web services so you'd have one
eight hundred flowers and hotels etc and
be abs our corner to multiple of them
and create brand new businesses and
value by creating one application that
would go and call it to multiple web
services and it never happened because
what we discovered was service on to the
architecture was that everyone would
create the web services differently so
it never happened but then rest came out
everyone went okay it's easier this time
it's gonna still kind of hasn't happened
we're seeing it happen a bit more now
that we've got things like swagger and
that but people still have different
rest implementations we have different
exceptions coming out etc yeah but now
if we've got a blockchain
we can have all that business
functionality exposed as smart contract
entrances into these companies now so
from one order an uber
I could call uber smart contract stand
me in uber put me a hose booked me a
restaurant booking etc so I could go and
create a new adapt decentralized
application called a package date so you
go and pay for me once and my smart
contract could go and orchestrate it for
you in your significant other to go pick
you up on the uber booked a restaurant
and have a hotel room for you so you can
go and hook and book into all this
orchestration much much easier cause
it's all just different contract
addresses within the same blockchain you
smart contract can hook into all of them
and so this networking effect is one
that gets missed out a lot okay so we've
covered off all the basic technology
what a blockchain II is how it works
what's blockchain one what's blockchain
- what have we got an offer on is your
blockchain as a service so although my
although in my talk is hey let's cut out
the corporations
I'm gonna use my corporations pay for me
to be here so upon Asia we've got as
your blockchain of the service and as I
said we support all of the major
blockchain to theory am hyper ledger
block apps Gerardo parody etc and bunch
of developer tools the idea here being
that if you're doing any blockchain
development and you need to have a
private test net sandbox to go and
develop against you can go and use Asia
to spin up that private test net for
yourself and do it all in a scenario
where you doing a private consortium
with yourself and a few other partners
like the article we released a couple
months ago about how we helped Webjet
with them and some of their partners so
we use this type of templates here to
build up those private consortiums so
how it looks here is you jump onto Asia
we've got a whole section for blockchain
click aetherium or popularity cetera
click create say which subscription you
want it arm
how many mining those how many
transaction those how many different
companies are going to be in this
consortium so they can all self host
some of their own components click
create boom spins up all of the things
behind firewalls all the networking
rules you get pretty dashboards so you
can see all of your mining nodes going
on what's your average bot time is etc
so you get all of that and because we're
Microsoft
all about developer tools to help you
guys build this stuff really easily
we've put the support into Visual Studio
code so you're getting syntax
highlighting and things like that
and I'm using Ubuntu bashing Windows 10
to go and do all of the smart contract
unit testing because these things are
using real money you need to do more you
know testimony usually would to make
sure that you don't just lose millions
of dollars there was last year one bug
so it was literally just two lines that
were flipped around and because of that
twenty five million dollars worth of
value was just lost because some people
were able to pull all the money out
these two lines are switched so you need
to test more than you would and I can go
and deploy at my smart contracts out to
the Asian Network gets contract
addresses etc now I've written an
article about how I helped a company up
in Brisbane rub a little bit of DevOps
on their blockchain and we were able to
go and use visual studio team services
to go and do those smart contract
compilation unit testing deployment etc
its online if you want to read it and
our massive blockchain of the service
strategy is to help you build blockchain
based solutions so what I just showed
then was just this bottom bit building
up the basic infrastructure to go and
host your blockchain the blockchain
network but then we've got middleware
and frameworks to help you build that
enterprise level of smart contracts and
just a couple days ago we just released
this announcing around an open-source
framework called cocoa that we're
releasing consortium contracts we'll
think it stands for to help you write
those enterprise great smart contracts
on top of different networks now the
great thing about this is you can write
it on this and under the covers you can
use the theorem or hyper ledger etc and
so you can focus on this and just swap
out the block chains underneath it and
so this is all announced by our CTO at
Microsoft Azure mark russinovich so when
we have the marks of CTO talking about
blockchain you know it's kind of a big
deal okay I was trying not to talk too
much about what's up in Asia because I
want to talk more about how you guys can
use this stuff so events in Australia
I've been to a bunch of different events
here we've got generic blockchain events
we've got crypto trading events etc what
I've seen is a lot of them are just a
lot of talk a lot of people just wanted
to speculate so they can make mad
millions from Bitcoin training trading
etc so what I've seen is these are the
ones which talk actually about doing
things and these are the ones that have
the tutorials and examples and show you
how to actually do it so I'd recommend
joining one of those in Melbourne Sydney
or Brisbane I helped organize something
called the blockchain Association of
Australia and so we're running events in
Melbourne and Sydney soon where we're
bringing in international speakers to
come and talk about this stuff and so
yeah that's blockchain dat ASN at AU so
I recommend you to have a look at that
um earlier this year I ran a three-day
hackfest down in Melbourne where we
blocked shame-based hacking for the
regulatory regulatory requirements in
the energy sectors and Finance sectors
so it's a mouthful but we had a hundred
people in the community come along I ran
for three days we had 14 teams that were
a part of it and presented and up to the
leading up to it I ran multiple training
event at how to get started with the
blockchain and blockchain based
development and I'm running another one
later this year called the smart CDs
blockchain hackathon so it's down in
Melbourne unfortunately but I'm doing
the same thing again doing multiple
training events leading up to it now if
you're not down in Melbourne next week
or the week after I've got a bunch of
video tutorials I'm releasing on how to
go and get started with us using a
theorem truffle Visual Studio code
that'll be available online so follow me
on Twitter if you want those now to
summarize before I get into the use
cases the key takeaways I want you to
take away if you're going to take one
photo take it of this one so you can
take it away
the main use cases are chooser there's a
trusted data source for the attestation
for the provenance etc the whole point
of this try to remove these
intermediaries that were there as those
trusted third parties you know those
trusted third parties were just there
because we couldn't trust each other we
trust the blockchain and cut out those
costs we're doing it to our test as
something happened and most importantly
these networking effects that are going
to happen wants multiple businesses
start building and releasing the smart
contracts they are to orchestrate
calling to multiple smart contracts to
build up new value between different
companies another recommendation just
jump straight to blockchain 2 because
nothing you can do with the 1.0
technology can't do a 2.0 and based on
what we're seeing go the theorem because
that's all the developer my chair is at
the moment and all the open-source tools
now so misconceptions to clear up go
here these ones all the time there's
usually people who've heard of
blockchain they hear what it should be
so that's what's locked in their head
they say they hear anything different
they start arguing with you because it's
what they truly believe now it I keep
hearing on a lot that they should only
be one blockchain any other block
channel isn't the original public
Bitcoin network is bad and evil because
it means that the Bitcoin network isn't
worth as much they're not earning as
much money no there's going to be
multiple multiple block chains it's
going to be tens of thousands of them
most of them we won't hear or see
anything about because they're going to
be private blockchains between a couple
of companies we don't care about they'll
be a bunch of different public block
chains because they're going to be
focused on different core value
the other one is must be public I've
just explained why you might want some
business businesses or business ones
blockchain must be transparent that
doesn't have to be so now you've got
your bank account at the moment and not
everyone can read every single thing
that you're buying on your bank account
so if we're all moving from bank
accounts to cryptocurrencies we don't
want everyone to still be able to see
everything we do especially if you're a
business you don't want your competitors
be able to see who all of your suppliers
are easily so there are things now
called rzk snarks so
dead case narc zero knowledge proof that
we can use now so we can put blockchain
transactions in and no one can see what
it was it has no information about who
it was from
how much will sent who it was - because
instead of putting that plaintext there
and put a cryptographic proof in there
that something happened and no one can
pull out what it was so can be
completely anonymous people can use it
and so the biggest one at the moment is
Zedd cash zed cash is one that does that
and those zero knowledge extensions are
going to be poured into aetherium in a
couple of months to be able to do
private transactions in the theorem
network again so if you're doing
business transactions that would be very
useful another one is that all
blockchain must be secured with proof of
work Mining know it's only useful for
public chains and so and those public
chains are the ones which people have by
- lots of money and so it's all the
Bitcoin miners that set up their big big
Bitcoin mining farms mostly in China and
other places with cheap electricity so
they have a vested interest in making it
only mining because I keep earning their
thumb tens of hundreds thousand dollars
a day from their mining but if you're
doing anything on a private consortium
you don't use proof-of-work mining at
all I'm a going for time okay thirty
minutes left
perfect now what I want to spend the
rest of my time on now that you
hopefully have some kind of idea of how
blockchain works under the covers
hopefully I'm steering here seeing lots
of blank looks I'm sorry I want to spend
the rest of time talking about use cases
because I just if you guys don't see a
reason why you want to use this you're
never going to go to learn about it so I
just want to talk about ways we could so
let's start off with a car now how many
people here saw my ignite talk cool so
let's start with a car now let's say
this is one of those new Tesla's that
are coming out so we've got a factory
and we saw how we can go and track the
provenance of the origins of where a car
came from so we can go track the
problems where each of those parts came
from we can check this is an original
authentic I've collectors care about
vintage electric cars but marks off
we've got a project that we're building
at the moment called project manifests
where we're allowing companies to be
able to track this stuff we track the
IOT data automatically coming through
they go through different logistics
pipeline to pump it all in secure it
with a blockchain and so there's some
blog post on this if you're interested
in one way to do this so we've got a
Tesla that's great but someone wants
let's say someone's to buy it but that's
too easy let's say we've got a group of
people that want to buy it it's a
retirement home and so they've got
mobility problems they want to go and
get out and about but they don't want to
keep hiring a driver so they just want
to grab and autonomous Tesla to come and
pick them up now problem Wiz with that
is traditionally that have to pull all
the money together and some one person
would have to collect it all Jeff and
Jeff would collect it but Jeff would
just rather the Caribbean with all of
their retirement retired people's money
so and that's because we have to put our
trust in one person so let's remove the
trust from that one person and Trust the
blockchain instead and so if they're
trying to get this money together they
would do it through a neighborhood crowd
fund for that retirement home now that
could use something like Kickstarter but
we're only using Kickstarter because we
need a trusted third party to do it and
Kickstarter take a big chunk of money
for being that intermediary so let's use
a decentralized crowdfunding now there's
way fund is one of them and the same
thing in it's just a smart contract
where people can go put the money in to
do the crowdfunding so we cut out those
middlemen we're reducing our costs okay
they bought the Tesla but now our
arguments are coming up because some
people want to pay for the scheduled
maintenance some people don't want to do
it I'm having arguments around time
sharing so it needs some sort of
governance model around this and there's
a DAP for that so boardroom
it's a boardroom allows people to go and
set up decentralized organizations where
there's no single CEO or owner of a
company or a single decision maker you
can put the decision the start of a
smart contracts now
they all vote on what the outcome should
be for these decisions should we go to
get their get the scheduled maintenance
done enough of them vote yes it unlocks
some of the funds from their shared
blockchain wallet to go send the funds
to the maintenance crew okay now they're
happy
although segments have stopped the time
sharing is going well but what they're
saying now is that a lot of the time
it's hazel sing they're doing nothing
and if you read a lor Musk's blog posts
we've talked about well if you're
autonomous Tesla sitting there doing
nothing why can it go off and make money
for you so you can make a go work for
uber but again boobers taking a cut for
being a trusted third party so we could
go and use a ride-sharing DAP to cut
them out and cool things that happen
once we replace it with a smart contract
here every time the car goes out picks
up a passenger and the passenger pays
they'll pay into the ride-sharing DAP
sure they may take a small cart back
that would be much smaller than uber
maybe half a percent or something the
rest of the funds will go up up into
here and then based on the shares or how
much they brought the fun to
automatically go and we split up
automatically every single time a ride
gets paid automatically and they can
check that Jeff isn't just keeping all
the money in they're paying out
correctly just all there on the
blockchain being orchestrated by smart
contracts paying out based on their
shares now we've got randoms getting
into our car so we're going to pay for a
high insurance premium but what if we
could just buy insurance has been
picking up a new passenger so we just
get a higher level of insurance just for
that single ride so again this could
just orchestrate buying it from the
insurance DAP each time a new passengers
getting into the car and this Tesla
whilst driving around you could have its
own crypto wall crypto wallet Bitcoin in
it so we can go off to go and charge
itself at some charging station by
itself so this car can be really
autonomous now their adapts to do this
there's swarm city for decentralized PAP
ride-sharing they're adapted ER
insurance all this stuff is being
created at the moment
okay we're riding in the car and we want
some music so we go and open up Spotify
and listen to the music now what happens
is although we listen to it on Spotify
or we buy their tune from iTunes the
artists the the creator of value they're
kind of only going to get a tiny tiny
cut we're talking you know ten to ten
percent of fair lucky and all values
being sucked out by the record
publishers record labels the promoters
etc so the value creators aren't getting
rewarded for what they're doing let's
change that let's cut out all these
corporations and replace them with a
decentralized application so whenever we
go and buy it now the artists can be in
control of how much they sell each of
their piece of music for they can decide
who gets paid out watch what the senate
shares are and the cool thing is once
this is a decentralized app you can just
get music licenses
again there's networking effective share
contracts me out to call into each other
hooks in so now if we're doing something
like live streaming music or each time
it's played an advertisement it could
just go and just get a micro rights from
that transaction to go and play this
piece of music just before this once and
so ugiy music has this we can see we've
got this song and by four sixty stands
you can see each of the people who were
involved in this the brass ensemble all
the people etc you can see how much it
is for each are streaming each time to
stream the song once it's 1/6 of a cent
you can see all the things you get with
it but importantly you can see that
under the main artists who created you
can see what the shares are gonna the
percentage splits gonna be for each time
a song sold so he's assigned 90 percent
of it to herself and she's come to an
agreement with a brass ensemble and the
down here the marking people each time
the song gets sold each one they get a
one percent cut so they can go and do it
so maybe she gets a better mixing mixing
engineer on who because they're more
high-profile haggles with her together
hype exchange a two percent cut or
something like that but the point is the
in value credit and now is in control of
this and we can see on the blockchain
that the piece of music is being
purchased since other people who are
getting the percentage cut can go and
verify and that are getting paid out
correctly which they are because it's
all been done by a smart contract okay
continuing on this is where we start
getting more futuristic so we've got
people who are not part of any of this
at the moment not part of the global
economy because they can't afford to be
around the world we've got well
conservative estimates a two and a half
billion people around the world at the
moment we can't be a part of the global
economy because I can't afford a bank
account because how much the monthly
fees are for a bank account is more than
they get paid in the day so just can't
afford to have a bank account which
means we go right back to it very first
scenario I talked about well they have
to physically rock up have the money on
them pay for it to exchange the goods
and go away which means they can't buy
anything in the next village they
definitely can't buy anything overseas
because it kept out of that global
economy so we see that the third world
does a great job of arm just
leapfrogging technologies we saw with
our telephones they leaped over the
landlines went straight to mobile phones
are probably gonna see the same thing
here
getting into the global economy they'll
just leapfrog over traditional banks and
go straight up into crypto currencies
which means boom we're cutting out the
big Bank conglomeration corporations etc
and once they're in the global network
with their own blockchain wallets means
now they can be part of a global economy
they can go create music which they are
now in control of their getting the
value so we can go and unlock all the
creative potential all these people
around the world just by giving them
access to block chain wallets they can
go create other decentralized apps and
they can get it get the money etc now
this was all talking about consumer to
consumer and business to consumer back
over here we're going to talk about
business of business of business stuff
so we've got the Tesla factory with a
supply
and logistics networks and things like
that this goes back to a private
blockchain and a private consortium
because no one else needs to know about
this and for competitive advantage they
don't want their competitors to know who
their suppliers are how many purchase
orders they're doing when they're
getting the next shipment of silicon etc
there may be another one for government
so for around regulation for the
emissions testings on cars so that would
stop things like the scandal with BMW
putting in fraudulent emissions testing
they will go certified on the blockchain
so if later if they say there was a
mistake like we can say no you said it
was that so we can go track all of this
so the point of this is just to show
that all this can be massive Network
effects from smart contracts multiple
different block chains here is not just
one blockchain to rule them all they all
have different use cases now across all
of this we're going to need identity now
with Microsoft we're doing things around
identity that we've talked about so we
can have use things like Azure Active
Directory to have blockchain accounts so
then we can track an identity in this
type of space we're in the consumer
space if we're hooking into this how do
we do it there's multiple different ways
but the biggest one at the moment is
called you port and so you can have
multiple digital identities in here and
you can go interact with multiple
different depths and I'll come back to
why having digital identities is
important later sorry okay
so that's that big scenario and so all
of that was what you can do now and so I
want to talk about were the last ten
minutes I've got a lot of what we can
kind of do in the very new term future
there's in six months a year it's not
that far away most any of this stuff and
again yeah this is just in Japan so alex
has taken some awesome photos around at
the moment so let's start off with stock
exchanges so stock exchanges are all
done in a centralized way etc now there
are good reasons while I do that for
regulatory etc
but general users who just want to go
and just exchange some exchange to try
and Ernst a bit of money with day
trading by themselves they didn't bother
with it cuz it's way too much overhead
but now that we're seeing the stuff
happening cryptocurrencies we're seeing
a lot of just random people who've never
been into trading before starting to get
into it now
we do have centralized exchanges and
like mount GOx and b2c markets and
things like that but we can see what
happens when we've got a centralized
entity that we need to trust so mount
GOx a couple of years ago that was one
crypto currency exchange where you could
go and buy and sell Bitcoin you could
exchange Bitcoin for a theorem and
things like that and so you would send
your Bitcoin to them they would keep it
in a wallet and then they'll send you
something back and you're trusting that
they will send it back to you but what
happened was lots of people kept their
bitcoins in there because they would go
and do day trading etc things like that
and they got hacked and I forget how
many tens of millions of dollars worth
of Bitcoin we just stole them because
one entity was in control of all of it
and so and they also take really big
fees for the privilege of being able to
buy and sell Bitcoin and trade trade
through them so even these new really
new businesses which are based around
blockchain they are being replaced
because we don't need them if we can do
it in a decentralized way so now there
are actually smart contracts we can go
and do decentralized peer-to-peer
trading now one person puts up I will
trade X number of Bitcoin for X number
of aetherium other people with a bias
still rates are the smart contractor
door door boom cutting out those
centralized people were cutting out some
of those big fees and we're doing it
much much faster and securely because I
have to trust that they'll send it to me
it will happen automatically all through
those smart contracts now those are
stock exchanges which moves us on to I
cos see probably hearing a lot about I
cos at the moment because it again goes
back to general people not using a stock
exchange because too much overhead same
thing with people wanting to invest into
new businesses so venture capitalists
venture capitalists does have a monopoly
on being
to give out big amounts of money to
companies who wants to go and raise
money about general people we just want
to invest a little bit of money here and
there and so what we're seeing now is
lots of new start to just completely
bypassing venture capitalists and angel
investors and just doing a via smart
contract instead these initial clone
offerings at a ploy a smart contract
that says for every hundred dollars
worth a Bitcoin you put in you get X
number of shares of this company or X
number of tokens to use the services
we're about to launch and so we've seen
moe over the last couple of months there
are five different I SEOs we're in 30
seconds they raise 25 million dollars in
30 seconds
and so those blocks were just saturated
and they sold out in 30 seconds okay
they put caps on it of 25 million
dollars just to see one while it
wouldn't have too much money so there'll
be a target for hacking and this is
happening now
and so you're just hearing multiple tens
of millions of dollars being raised in
just minutes at the moment again because
people just want to get and cut out
these corporations and dorsum sells
clothes just so much easier identity and
reputation I talked before around our
viewport we now have another digital
identity now the great thing about this
is is this is one of the reasons why
I've got such a draw towards blockchain
because I'm sick of companies like
Facebook going yeah I'm taking all my
personal information they've got in
their data silo I have no say over what
they deal with it I think it's doctor
thought and so blockchain gives us a
chance to be able to take the power back
once we start going to decentralized
applications with multiple digital
identities we can go on the blockchain
and say who has access to our name who
has access to our Danity it also means
that we can prove things without
actually showing them our real identity
so it may be when we go into a club we
need to know that the over 18 and they
take a scan a photo photo copy of my ID
when I go into a club I hate that they
know who I am but you just need to know
that I'm over 18 so with these digital
identities you could go get a
cryptographic hash proof from the
government saying
I am over 18 it's attached to my
identity that I have my name or my date
of birth it's just a cryptographic proof
that I'm over 18 so I can go and show
you that to them and they can let me in
same thing with if you need to show you
that you're an Australian citizen they
don't have to see my real passport will
all my details on it there's have a
cryptographic proof that I am an
Australian citizen so a lot of these
things where people need the real data
they don't need to data anymore there's
need the proof that I am so we can be a
lot more private about this and take
back control back to ourselves
it also means that we can split up a
digital identity a lot easier because I
do this a lot myself I've got my
professional persona which is me up on
Twitter but I don't want people to know
what I do on reddit for example please
don't look at what I put on reddit and
I've got my identities on when I game
things like that because I don't want my
when I'm gonna LinkedIn people to see
that I'm messing around in League of
Legends it's just I don't want people to
know that so you can do this multiple
digital identities you can have a
trading persona and one that you do when
you're doing your digital asset creation
when you're being a creative and the one
we're doing over here again taking a
privacy back into you you have a single
wallet with multiple identities that you
can use also means that we have the
digital identities we can do great
things around reputation so at the
moment you've got a problem when you use
uber you have one reputation score on
eBay you have one reputation score on
Amazon you have one reputation score and
all in totally different data silos your
reputation doesn't carry across with you
if you have digital identity in this all
going through smart contracts now
against that digital identity a
reputation scores can be attached to it
so although I'm a great seller on eBay
on Etsy I have no score but a reputation
could now be carried around with me so
that again is taking it back from the
corporation's have a control of our data
and reputation and we're pulling it back
towards us programmer tickets is an
interesting one so we've got a problem
with event ticketing tickets get sold
like with MDC and there's always a
secondary market for these things so it
could be a lady Gaga concert etc if you
have ticket scalpers who will buy them
all up and still on the secondary market
and
so lots of arguments back and forward
about this but one of the main ones is
the event organizers hate is that the
Solon's secondary market and they don't
get a take of it what we can do is
because what we can do is instead of
issuing physical tickets or a digital
ticket which is just a PDF with your
barcode on it we can actually go and
issue each person on the blockchain
their ticket now if we do it as a smart
contract it means we can now make these
smart we can go and put programmability
into these event tickets so we can have
a function on this ticket which is a
transfer ownership so I've brought my
ticket and it's assigned to me it's when
I go and scan into the event
yeah I'm led in but they won't let me go
sell it off to Darren cause he wants to
go Britney Spears instead of me and so
but I'm not allowed to chance for the
ticket function on their transfer
ownership I can do that so I've got
control I can do it on a peer-to-peer
decentralized network on the secondary
market but what the event organizers
could do inside of that function the
transfer ownership function they can
hard code a thing that says yeah okay
well we'll let you answer this ticket to
other people but you have to pay a
penalty for each time you do it and so
they can put these smart into these
event tickets saying yes do that but you
have to pay through a small car to
change the name who it's on etc or you
can get a refund if you call the refund
function on it so this is a great thing
being able to take what were before just
previously dumb physical tickets or
tokens and then put some smart on to
them talking of physical tokens on the
flight back to Australia I watched John
wick it was very very cool again very
young
lots of neon photo colors in there for
you now one thing that happens in there
is they had their whole economy the
Assassin's Guild to go and get anything
done that had these gold coins at the go
and trade so they'll go and do favors
for people or they go and do a hit job
and they'll go and get paid and the pay
child when these gold gold coins there's
a hotel in there called the Continental
you can go and stay at the continent or
if you have these assassin guild coins
to pay you can use it to go I've tried
it for body body armor suit up with guns
it's
now these are physical tokens they have
to physically go and do it and which
means that they're carrying a whole
bunch of really valuable tokens on
themselves they could get mugged in
their stolen we could change this to
just a single smart contract up so now
all these assassin guild tokens are now
up on the up on a network that can go
and trade them and so a bumping future
we've now got ninja assassins doing
stuff with cryptocurrencies so I've got
about three minutes left so that's good
I've only got two main slides left this
is going super futuristic now so device
autonomy so we talk about autonomous
vehicles autonomous cars autonomous
planes what about hackers hackers who
are going to go modify the firmware so
the cars going to go and drive off a
cliff what if the car could start up it
checks the cryptographic hash of its own
firmware it goes and checks the
blockchain to see all the other cars
have an industry on their blockchain
ledger that what the hash of the
firmware should be they can check their
firmware hasn't been modified so we can
go and do I 80 security really great
with this thumb decentralized network
but I have to have a centralized
authority about this or the i2 devices
can talk amongst themselves about what
this source of truth is and we can get
super futuristic who start thinking
about Darwinian genetic evolution of
artificial intelligences so if we go and
got a whole bunch of artificial
intelligence we're talking five years
time or something but I can go and we
want them to earn as much money as they
can we give them a little bit of Bitcoin
each say okay you have to pay for your
own server hosting on Asia
here's your Bitcoin wallet and so
they're all there with their fitness
functions try to go and earn money the
ones which are bad at it would just die
can't pay for their own hosting the ones
that are good at it will earn enough
money to keep paying for the hosting get
more server hardware that could support
arm spawned off new children was
different subsets of AI go give it a
fragments of its Bitcoin wallet so we
can keep them doing get some Darwinian
evolution from AI at this point we get
to like the end of the Neuromancer book
where the AI Gama escapes and does bad
stuff but again cyberpunk
but this is the most I've a Punk example
I could think of and you can get these
right now so in all this cyberpunk books
and movies you always hear them having
credit sticks they can go up and trade
credit sticks to get them things done
now
these are little USB things which have a
little processor on it it will go and
generate a private public key in the
processor so that I've never been leaked
ever you plug them in you can see what
the public address is for this Bitcoin
wallet so you can go load it up with
like half a Bitcoin so now I've got a
wallet credit stick with half a Bitcoin
on it
I can go trade it for what I need out on
the street and we can go and trade this
credit stick with half Bitcoin on it the
only way to get the money out is this
little hole here you have to get a pin
punch it out it pops off this resistor
which goes and modifies the processor at
that point unlocks the private key so
you have to bust open the credit stick
get the private key so you can go and
spend these credit sticks awesome that's
awesome
so we're think about in the future I've
all the corporations hate me now cuz
I've been telling you guys to how we can
cut them out so I have to go out into
the street to go and buy some credit
sticks so I've gone down to this is
Africa Buchinger so a gun down there
gotten it I've used one of my other
digital personas ago cool a
decentralized Buber to get me out get me
out of in a Tokyo I go down the side
street find the old man down there I
pass him the credit stick so let me into
the club give me some sanctuary
unfortunately the corporation's use
those John wick assassins tokens and
they've dumped me in the water so with
that I mean David Barilla add me on
Twitter if you want those tutorials
