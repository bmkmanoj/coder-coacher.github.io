Friday afternoon loll isn't it so uh has
anyone here heard of Cosmo I know one
person has but yeah a couple all right
that's cool but yeah more of that later
so the whole idea of this is I yeah I
kind of got ahold of this guy and I'll
tell you the story and it's just such a
charming little fella so I thought I'll
cheer and it is it's kind of I don't
expect the great technical revolution
here okay this car the disclaimer of it
there'll be some Python code but it'll
mainly be about just having a bit of fun
with this guy okay it's pretty good so
hopefully you'll you know end up making
friends with Cosmo that's the whole idea
now first of all did you enjoy the party
last night
yeah was that a good idea with the
failure stuff yeah yeah good excellent
yeah cuz I guess my idea with it well
when I talked to Jack Ivanov was to kind
of get all these speakers that you only
see do these really heavy technical
talks and just kind of throw them off
left center and you know make me swear a
bit and stuff like that kind of you know
make him a bit more human right and I
thought it worked really well so I was
pretty happy with it so I was just
making sure that you guys were happy as
well
all right cool now throughout this talk
if you do want to ask questions please
do it's pretty casual I like and having
questions during the talk because that
kind of creates a bit of interaction you
might actually learn better remember it
and then eventually that's my method of
getting you to put a green card in the
box
now before we get to this guy I just
want a car backtrack because ah do you
know this does anyone know this robot no
okay it's just a cool picture yeah Tim
knows about it now we didn't just arrive
at having robots in our house right it
there's a bit of history to it this one
in particular kind of takes my fancy I'm
kind of jumping a little bit around the
timeline but the radicand robot is
actually from Japan but for some reason
they wrote in English anyway it was the
world's first lips remote
controlled toy while second
remote-controlled toy at least the first
remote-controlled robot it's about that
high and it could sort of go forwards
backwards and turn knows it right but it
was 1957 and it was made from steel that
was bloody heavy thing really cut
revolutionary but I like the box okay
and I think that yeah anyway who has a
robot in their house now
Hey okay what kind of robots are they
Arduino
okay what does it do so so as just
that's its purpose okay cool
but so I was wondering if it was like
nuclear detonator or something yeah
yours is okay get in
anyone else this one yeah you got Cosmo
excellent have you done any programming
with him okay so you know what I'm gonna
talk about okay yeah I just we didn't
just arrive at this right we didn't just
end up yeah oh hey robot in the house it
actually started way way before that
anyone know what this is not quite
that's a pretty good guess though this
is actually I have to read this because
I remember it's a water-powered
astronomical clock tower from China and
it was actually built in the year
thousand and 88 it's like almost a
thousand years ago that was one of the
first examples of an atomic on not quite
a robot but you know something automated
but with water which I find very
fascinating because obviously there was
no electricity and there was no you know
fuel your petrol engines but this had
like chain drives and it would show
times and little diagrams based on the
astronomical seasons and very very
advanced and he was a made by a Chinese
inventor called su song which is Pope
really incorrectly but there you go
another really cool example is this
Indian guy well he's not actually Indian
we're not quite sure where he's from
because there's no history of his early
sort of life but he there was algae's re
some say his Persian some say he's
Pakistani some say you know there's few
different ideas around it but he also
used water Bahia Lee made kitchen
utensils in 11:36
he made things that you use the kitchen
water powered as well to help automate
everyday chores like eight nine hundred
years ago he also did this thing here
which is again otama tons that are in
water and singing and playing music not
quite sure how that works but very
fascinating that so we have a quite
history of robotics or automatons at
least alright that brings us to this
about 400 years later anyone ever seen
this diagram it was discovered in the
1950s and is like almost 100 percent
sure that it is Leonardo da Vinci's
first humanoid automaton or robotic kind
of invention and that was a diagram they
found and it turned out like there's a
bunch of police and stuff that's
diagrammed and there's some arms and
legs and they kind of put it all
together from this notebook that they
found and made that right so it was like
an armored house suit of armor that
could move so that's probably they got
scooby-doo from me
quiet advanced again for 1495 I think it
was it was made for one of the Italian
Royals I was trying to impress him at
some party you know better entertainment
automated it was all done with pulleys
so someone was pulling all the levers
but he could walk and raise his arms and
turns his head and everything quite
advanced again and then that brings us
kind of a little bit closer to to here
does anyone know that movie
Celie question actually didn't see it
until isn't add up because in Denmark
where I'm from that is not a thing right
no one watches that so the Wizard of Oz
the Tin Man was while he was ridden in
my 1890 or something like that and was
kind of the first real example of
someone trying to create what we
consider a robot it wasn't called a
robot it was called a tin man but the
idea was kind of the same even though he
has got a funnel on his head and a bit
of trivia did you know that the Wizard
of Oz had five different directors and
14 writers
that amazing it was one of the most
successful movies ever made but they had
the tinman so in the 30s or thereabouts
when movie came out and the first use of
the word robot as you can see there was
in 1921 this is a Czech play so the
Czech Republic and it was from the word
robota which means servitude and check
that's where the word robot come from so
it is to surf which is obvious what
these do - there's some sort of robots
there's service servants automated
servants so it's pretty obvious that
robots have been around for a long time
before what we consider robots which is
with computers and electricity and
automation in that regard and then this
was popularized in 2003 or whatever it
was from the iRobot movie came out but
in 1942 the science fiction author Isaac
Asimov came up with three laws of
robotics
has anyone heard of those because
they're pretty like it's part of popular
culture now right but it wasn't at the
time and people thought he was a bit
mental because it was really science
fiction like no one's ever gonna use
that right and then what happened so
this is kind of they've been revised a
few times he's added a Serie of law and
a fourth floor but these are kind of the
three that I sort of printed in people's
memory right these are the three laws of
robotics
not that we're going to go much into it
but it's nice to know that there are
people that are thinking about
especially the ethical aspects of these
things right so that's a whole other
conversation yeah you can read him if
you want but yeah they kind of make
sense right
basically we don't want robots to roam
free and kill everybody I think that's
where he was coming coming from and that
kind of brings us today all right so
there's pepper robots today comes in
view it like a lot of shapes and sizes
so you're saying in Arduino just roaming
around the house we also have these guys
right we've got Roombas and we got the
the automated lawn mower which I'd love
to have in tractor size
because you cut 50 acres of land and I
don't know what to do with it
but the rumbas is is like the first
thing to be saw that was really
automated and really made sense right
because who likes vacuuming exactly
right no one so that made sense having
that to kind of do the menial chores for
it just don't feed its ox
okay there's my socks and then the robot
on the other side as well that makes
that's my really quick recap of Robotics
history anyone want to add anything if I
missed out a prudent part don't you
think no thanks no way so the reason I
kind of got into this guy is because of
that guy so this is Jordan and Jordans
11 Jordan is on the autism spectrum
which you would never know if you met
him
goes to regular school or that sort of
Jess but it does mean that he either has
no attention span for some things or he
get deeply engrossed in other things and
it's quite tricky finding the things
that he does like and then when you do
find the things you like you can't get
him off him right so it's kind of a you
know evil circle almost but he's into
computers big time more the IT pro side
I went from he was 5 years old he was
setting up VMs he would find VMware and
they installed Windows 2000 on it and
then he would put a VMware on that
Windows 2000 and so some emails in it
just because he could write and there's
also the reason that he will never ever
touch my computer because he goes that's
you don't want it like that and he
changes all the settings right but he's
brilliant at it it's something he's
really good at and he would spend from
here till eternity configuring something
until it worked but he has that tenacity
when it's something he really really
likes and I was kind of thought okay
what do I need something to kind of
engage him I'll try programming no he's
not a programmer mathematics it's not a
big thing he doesn't enjoy programming
because it's slow as in I can't write
two things and press a button and
everything goes right there's not that
immediate reward as there is when you
install Windows 2000 you see you install
that's perfect by playing dirty as it
works right
so I saw this talk last year in November
it's a lightning talk actually by team
that sits right over there and I'm just
gonna point you out to him I know you
don't like that on Cosmo and I hang on
there's something here because it's like
a computer right it does stuff but
there's also programming to it so I got
him one for Christmas Jordan from Amazon
because Anki unfortunately does not
accept Australian credit cards for
whatever reason and and we started
playing with it and he started taking
interest in Python and he started doing
the games that are on you know that
comes with a mobile app then I'll show
in a minute and it just made him engaged
on a whole different level than with the
computers and I thought there we go like
we've kind of find something the problem
is that my three-year-old all the think
it's really really interesting but more
sort of picking it up and running off
with it so we do know when we had
another challenge but I finally found
something that was engaging him in a way
that wasn't just sitting in front of a
screen right there was actually some
interaction there was some you know
programming essentially he needs my help
with it but that's okay
so that's where I ended up with Cosmo it
was an engagement exercise for unloved
your autistic child
all right enough about all that let's
you want to meet Cosmo yeah yeah
shut up again that was terrible
you try that again is that me or you
whoa okay hang on guys I kind of ruined
the velvet but let's go do that okay
I never do that again yeah something
and that tagline big brain bigger
personality is so true and I'll you'll
see it is fantastic but that's Kozma
right he's a product from the US from
from California made by a company called
Anki I think it was a Kickstarter or
something like it I'm actually not sure
there's a nodding and it's just an
attempt to create something that's how
do we say that has personality and
interaction without taking all the fun
out of it right there's no massive setup
and everything just before we get to see
him there's some interesting tech specs
on it now that we are geeks here it has
this little LCD on the front you'll see
him close in a minute they call it an
emotional display because it kinda is
that's his eyes and they convey a lot of
emotion they really done a great job of
getting his eyes right you know
inquisitive or angry or bored or
sleeping or whatever it might be has
facial recognition so it has a little
little camera on the front actually
recognizes your face so he knows who you
are
and he'll seek you out so the person the
place the most with him he'll go to that
person and say hey you know and the app
will tell him tell you what he wants you
can set him up with about 10 different
people that he can recognize and it all
comes through this pretty rudimentary
VGA camera but good enough right 30
frames per seconds not bad it's got four
motors so he can he can roll around with
these you know belts here and he can
lift his his little forklift type thing
and he'll play with the cubes
Asher yeah I'll get to that in a minute
and then he has with a guy like this CPU
evaluates reactions as in that's the
only reason there's a CPU in it is that
he evaluates what you're doing right and
how you react to what he's doing which
is kind of cool obviously there's more
to it than that but that's the way that
they sell it all this means that he's
really cheeky
this guy has personality and here all if
you don't play with him he'll roam
around on his own and he'll know and
he'll he'll find things and you know I
don't know if he likes to recognize his
dog but I like the idea right well he'll
get mad if he loses a game he'll throw a
hissy fit and get annoyed with you and
turn his back to you and you know he'll
he'll he'll walk you know you I was had
mean hurt my hotel room obviously
because I was playing with him to try
and you know do all this stuff and sunny
sneezes just going around the floor so
he he does come with all these emotions
that we recognize and that's actually
another thing now think of it with
Jordan as well because being on the
spectrum he doesn't recognize emotions
the way that we do he learns emotions by
people showing him and this little guy
he's kind of getting it he understands
what he's doing right and he's just he's
just hilarious to look at he just
becomes a happy little man all right
enough a talk here ok let's have a look
at what he actually does now I'll see if
I could get this to work here so I've
got a webcam here so that you can see it
there you go so there's Cosmo hopefully
you can see that all right now I also
have my Android device here which I can
kind of overlay each I mean that's just
so you get an idea of what that looks
like
oops and I was turned the phone off that
went well
you do need a device that is not a
Windows Phone so I actually went out and
bought an Android device just for this
so now it says turn Cosmo on right
because he he's asleep so I just gotta
lift him up and put him back on there on
the cradle and then turns on so that's
the charger as well that sits there and
then just he does yep there's an iOS app
as well so now we just gotta wait for
him to connect to Cosmo so he's gonna
wake up now he might not be as loud as
we would have him he does have lots of
sounds right so I'll try and be a bit
quiet as wrong you go alright so now
Cosmo is on I might just go and turn him
up a bit
again yeah okay
so this is the app that comes with it
right so right now he's just looking at
things because it's going around these
cubes are remotely activated so he can
see them and he can interact with them
right so he's seen that cube because
that lit up and he'll use the cubes for
games you know throw build whatever you
might do and you can do different things
with him so for example we can tell him
to pick up a cube okay so then he's goes
and throws it and I'm not doing any of
that right he's just kind of doing his
own thing but I would just ask him to
pick up a cube so it's finding a cube
it's just kind of lining up there you go
he just keeps going right I didn't want
that one okay he does have edge
detection as well so ideally he doesn't
fall off the edge it does happen though
robotics but he shouldn't he shouldn't
fall off the edge so now he should go
for that cube now I'll see hey I guess
and then ya put it down boy come on
there we go thank you
and there so you can do different
actions like that right so that's kind
of the app part of the thing I don't get
fixed you're not updating what's
happening yeah okay so is that not okay
for some reason this is just frozen a
bit it's not actually updating music so
I've had still haven't asked him to do
that he's just doing that in its own
right okay there you go there we go so
there's gamification in it so the app
will ask you to play with them so I've
already done this for today you get
points that unlocks more features and
that keeps you going that's the idea
that's the kind of the way that they let
you explore what he does he will get you
can see down here oh you can't see that
hang on
it actually tells you what he's doing on
the bottom here so now Cosmo is creating
a stack of cubes because I'm not doing
anything with him so he's bored so he
comes up with something like he's gonna
make up his own mind right so while he's
doing that I can show you something else
they've got this new thing so I I got in
contact with Anki and there's a like an
interesting thing I can tell you in a
little bit later that might make your
life easier but they've got this new
thing called suppose we can find it
where is it no here codelab that thing
there right so these are the Cosmo apps
so the codelab
is if is anyone familiar with what's a
call you know they're kids programming
languages scratch or must've want to lay
in on so block block lis yeah there's
many they all have kind of the same idea
okay and this keeps not doing it I'm on
update there we go yeah okay so now I've
got control of Cosmo when it comes to
these sort of building blocks right this
is a really good way for kids to start
getting the idea of logic constructs and
you've seen it with scratch when you do
it on the on the computer and on the
screen and this is very similar there's
I've been told by Anki that this is just
the first version in about two months
they set fall in the US about two months
I'm guessing this is going to be
extended dramatically to do a ton of
stuff that that will just expand the way
that you can get them to do all the
blocks and everything but essentially
this you can
what does let me be able to do actions
we can add something you just drag it up
there yep you know so and then you can
click Drive sorry Oh on the flag play
and then you'll do whatever it
that I asked him to do right so now he
turns around whoops sorry
so this is just completely me
controlling him now right I've taken
over his brain he's my slave so that's a
really good way of getting kids involved
really really good way and that's even
my three-year-old kind of gets what that
is right he doesn't quite get that it's
a sequence of things but he knows that
if he moves those around Cosmo does
stuff it's quite a good idea and
obviously scratch works for lots and
lots of kids so why not
and it's straight it's right in the app
and I've only plugged this in by the way
because I want you to show it on the
screen right it's completely wireless
you can just see you know next to the
floor on the floor next to him if you
want so that's code lab any questions on
that
okay cool all righty so it's and that
just doesn't update so now he's back to
doing his own shenanigans all right so
that's that's kind of the the app part
of it right now there's something that's
much more interesting for us developers
and just give you a quick peek here
there's a Cosmo as well oh that's
amazing
there's a Cosmo SDK right so I'll just
do just a quick slide on that or Cosmo
is doing his thing because this is
probably more okay yeah this is probably
more what we want to know about right
this is all very cute and it's on an app
and it's like me we had at the belapur
conference right you know but that's the
introduction to it and as I said it's a
nice Friday afternoon talk so the Cosmo
SDK comes with a ton of ioveiy PRS and
you can pretty much control everything
that he does and more even more than
what you see now so you got the vision
systems you can do face tracking you can
do animations on his screen you can
actually put your own pictures on his
face that comes up and shows giraffes or
handbags or whatever it might be that
you think is good but it also got all of
the actions from moving him for lifting
his his forklift
grab what it was called and it has
access you know a low-level access to
robot senses cubes everything even
object recognition but to quite a
rudimentary extent but he cannot he can
recognize objects in sort of a
mathematical way I guess pet detection
well you know dog tails obviously so
there is a pet detection part of it I
haven't played with it because I've only
got a 45 kilo German Shepard no doesn't
work and but dude there is a pet
detection API that does something I'm
not sure what it does to be honest do
you know Tim have you tried it it just
recognizes hairs okay so teddy bear
would do the same thing kind of thing
yeah okay but yeah it does that right
it's kind of it's cute but you can do
lots of stuff with it and I've got
plenty of scripts that I'll show you so
let's do that
all right so now we'll get to that in a
minute today that's me hello so it's all
just Python scripts right all of its
powers night I have to buy weather I
have to enable the SDK which is you know
very hard because you click that button
here and that's it
now he's programmable he has stopped
that kind of kills him right that's all
that screen really gonna show maybe if
you're logging ik messages so I'm just
gonna hide it not gonna actually look at
it now these are all Python scripts
there is a c-sharp wrapper now I have
not tried it but there is some wrapping
around but from what you were saying Tim
it's quite basic still they haven't
taken advantage of async/await and all
those things so you get in c-sharp it's
all just kind of broken a bit they've
just taken the Python code and directly
part of it but this is the the simplest
of programs right and I'll show you all
the Anka examples
hence the the nice commenting because
you can just go and grab them right just
going download it and play with them
so rather use those too
I'd be clever and come up with my own so
this is all you do import Cosmo there's
a really a simple way of setting all
these up and download the right packages
into Python I won't bore you with all
that there's a nice tutorial on that but
once you've got the the Cosmo library
you can there's a robot definition and
there's there's lots and lots of
different things that the robot can do
it like if we just bring up intellisense
here it's a whole bunch of stuff that
you can get him to do right and events
and and methods and actions and
everything the cool thing is that
because you've got the tutorial is set
up and the cone is connected with the
USB it's as simple as just going you
know just run the script in Python
that's all you have to do right and then
if we're quiet we might be able to hear
him talk hello well that's cosmos voice
um and it's as simple as that right so
there's an Android connection there will
be a similar one for iOS that it just
knows and it's set up in your path and
it's set up as a device driver to find
the Android device and it's that easy
which is why it wants you as the parent
has set it up it's so approachable for
kids as well because it's just the code
you look at there's none of the
orchestration which is poor by their
chose Python right so I find that quite
approachable quite nice and of course we
can start doing other things
somebody can now start here saying a
drive straight or turn in place and you
give it some degrees or you give it a
distance right and this will just be him
driving the screen I'll just move these
a little bit out of the way and if you
run that you know you can kind of almost
get what it says what it does it's in
the comments but even if you just read
it you can say that you know four times
it does that it's drive straight to
Andros so it just goes into in a square
so it's I know that's very exciting and
now because no one reminded me that you
actually couldn't see the screen how
about we just look at the webcam again
as well right so it's more
come on yeah okay
can you still kind of see that that's
all right just let me get them both on
the screen here so we'll run there's
Drive square thing script so you guys
four words and then he turns and he
talks as well course let's see if he
actually falls off the edge now edge
detection works most of the time and
then he waits and then he keeps going
right so there's no smart surrounded
when you are running the SDK he's just
gonna keep going this is why he would
probably fall off the table if you went
far enough so you just gotta make sure
that your program is right and you get
all the logging as well
yeah tells you tons of stuff about what
he's doing yeah yeah yeah he'll notice
if there's a wall he'll stop you can
actually detect that as well there's an
API for that if there's a like an
immovable object don't know you know Tim
I don't know can he can you detect noise
no there there's no microphone as such
yeah that's good question though never
thought I'd watch perfectly yeah
there is I've gotten there so you can
see him yeah I always use him on the
floor except when the docs around
because he's big dog but no he works
perfectly on carpet like these these
belts here have amazing traction so he
works on the smooth service as well as
the cabin all right go back to I know
that's actually not when I want to but
that's okay I start off yesterday why
not he's got a voice right we can make
him sing no okay so you give him like he
can give him a pitch and you know scales
and he lifts his head because he move
his lifts and he moves his head so he's
singing and dancing right and then
you've got the notes here so you can say
hey can you give him them the pitch so
you can control the pitch of his voice
as well and he's got another eye he
changes the pitch obviously as he goes
through there though
yeah that's my singing okay I'll just
kill that one so let's try that one
um PI okay let's see if we can hear him
again oh they're too short right the
voice snippets but you get the idea so
the pitch change that there's really
hard to hear though in the room like
this but the pitch changed as you went
up so you got control of the voice he's
got some lights on the back kind of up
here that changes color as well and you
can control those as well so I'll just
run it first so it's kind of hard to see
but maybe if I do this yeah so now I can
control the backlight here so changes
color just not a great you get the idea
red green blue white red yellow and off
absolutely yeah and I think I have
actually seen that some nerd have done
that so you get Kozma running around in
the office or something and because you
can have you can just have an Android
device running all the time that's
connected to him he could yeah you could
do whatever you want with the lights
yeah they usually used to tell emotion
or state of something but that could be
a build light as well yeah just because
we we like those lights that's good and
the way you changed the back lights you
know surprise surprise he's got yeah a
backpack light and you just sleep you
sleep in between it it is that simple
right that's quite a I've really liked
this API they've gone they've done an
amazing job of making the abstraction
really legible and really approachable
because there's so much going on with
the you know we'll do face detection in
a minute
that you just kind of you've is a
developer you sense that they've tried
to make it as simple as possible maybe
so that kids could do it
certainly also a novice possum
programmer like me you can just kind of
jump in and do it right
there's no mathematics involved unless
you want to do something like object
recognition
now the cubes of course we can control
the cubes as well so we have three cubes
it comes with three cubes and you can't
buy them on their own
I know because Jordan put a 12-volt
battery in it it's one of our volt don't
do that it's died so he'll are a Amazon
they actually replaced the whole thing
in like five minutes they had a new one
shipped so now we have two cosmos so
that's yeah good service if it looks at
the cubes right so he's trying to find
the cubes and he'll let the light and
set the lights on the cube so we've
defined what the cube idea of the cubes
are up here a light cube ID comes from
the cosmic objects so that's a building
library that they have and then he can
just he can light him up so we'll see we
can get him to do that sometimes a
little bit if he because depends on
where he's placed when you're
programming him he doesn't do that all
the automated stuff will try that so
ah yep he got him all in one go did you
actually could you see they were
lighting up no he couldn't I see you
know this is all new because that light
is kind of brought let's see if we can
do it again hey Connor you've got the
idea you can see the reflection turn
blue but they go blue red green and you
can control the colors as well and cubes
can have two colors there's some games
on him where they are you gonna match
the colors so he'll have a cube and you
have a cube and then when they're the
same color you gotta tap it first so he
taps it as well and then when he loses
he throws him and yeah it's pretty good
fun huh so that's kind of all of the
basic like in control it pretty much
everything right you control his face
his arms his way he goes his voice what
he does with the cubes you can get to
pick up the cubes and stack him all of
that is accessible through the API with
very little effort now we'll get to a
example a bit later that has a little
bit more effort involved all right let's
do some of the facial recognition which
again is not there's a little bit more
involved but it's not difficult so you
want in this case his his little
backpack lights got to light up if he
sees a face if you detects a face and it
goes off when he doesn't see it so
that's what all that says here face dot
is visible again building API we said
all the backpack lights which means it
becomes sort of a whitish color or we
turn them off and then you can try again
until you see it's another face and then
you always have this cosmo done broaden
program usually done here so we'll try
that one
did you know I just took two pictures I
think well
okay so now just put up you see the back
there so now when I run this you can see
there comes a whole bunch of stuff over
this and I was taking his fork down and
he's looking he's just looking for
someone so oh he goes he says hello and
he little screen there hello run wrong
script yeah sorry I ran wrong script it
was a face image my bad it's just to
show you how you can actually control
the LCD I think I'm in the wrong folder
give me a second everywhere these are
yeah I'm in the wrong folder all right I
think oh you control those LCD as well
okay there we go okay so there is the
screen of what he's seeing there's the
the video camera so you can see when you
know that should light up there it's
really difficult to see that
unfortunately so when he sees me you see
her walking in front of there and lights
up as soon as I move away turns off
alright so it's quite good face
detection it's actually a lot smoother
than what you see that's a little bit
jerky on there compared to the screen
here the refresh rate might not be as
that's good but he'll just keep doing it
right you know oh no he didn't oh there
you go so very easily again the code
verse just kinda like is there a face
you do all of the hard work of detecting
the face has been done for him he can
yep yet he'll tell the difference
between different phases or if it's a
pet because that's very you trained him
to do different faces though and you
know you're gonna search it name with it
so when he runs around and suddenly sees
he goes
how are you know and then he'll
recognize if you play a game with them
so if you keep playing games with them
then he'll continue to go to you more
than others because yeah that's just
that's the kind of AI part of it okay
any questions on how this
cuz there's all the heavy coding right
ok we can also get into follow someone
right so here is the bulk of it if he
finds a face he you turned it towards
the face so that's another API thing
that you can get him to follow your face
so if you want to play a game where he's
trying to find your face and you get
away from him or something you can write
your own games whatever you want he
tried he follows you and turns as you
move which is kind of neat really
because it's it's a bunch of thing
that's happening at the same time he's
he's continually attracting the face as
well as tracking the direction that he's
facing with the camera so that he moves
in the right it's a little bit jerky
thinking probably it'll probably improve
but mostly I'm gonna try that so again
the camera comes up to show us so then
when he sees a face should come on Cosmo
no you go okay and then as I move around
your lecture you turn right and you'll
turn the other way as well and then
obviously I mean eventually he'll just
lose me yeah hey where'd you go so
that's a way of controlling the the
facial recognition as well as using that
data to do other things like a compound
thing almost then of course we can get
him to play with the cubes did I kill
that no I didn't and we can get it we
can get him to create a wall and this is
sort of the world is is the table in
this case it's kind of like where am I
in the world and you can create these
fixed object and then you keep this is
where the mathematics come in like you
tell them the structure that you want to
build based on pixels sizes and angles
and yeah relativity to the robots and
all that and then he goes to and he
actual
builds the thing so yeah okay can you go
over you thanks
okay this one though is a little bit
tricky it doesn't quit that come on
sometimes control Z and zet does not
work I just will not do it come on
as I'm doing yeah that's yeah yeah I
could
that's usually the only action sometimes
it just takes five seconds before it
actually quits but yeah I have like
spares of command prompts for today I'm
built you know I got JB hi-fi
yeah so okay hey no no this is all just
hard-coded brute force oh yeah in here
we can want to create a wall okay I'll
see if he'll play ball today
all right while he does that any
question I hear this Python code like
dessert
does anyone hear code in Python like
almost for a living or kinda okay he
didn't like that one so this this am I
correct in assuming this is really
approachable because I'm not a Python
programmer but I find it really basic
like just in terms of you know even copy
pasting these bits I could probably do
something pretty amazing with it
no he decided to not do it fixed object
created successfully really yeah we can
argue that one um so I don't know how
much of this you want to see before we
get to the really cool beard but I'll
just go through this because it's tell
me if it's boring right tell me if I
need to move on whatever I'm I'm good
you know you can I can handle it but if
you want to play with the cubes you look
around it's pretty good one because it
gives you an idea where everything is
and he actually you know can observe
where the cubes are and then here based
on how many cubes you get if you get
zero then he gets this and it made me
trigger so he just has his fail he just
takes the shits right he just really
gets annoyed if he finds one then he's
gonna do the roadblock so he picks it up
and goes and if he finds more of him
then he's gonna stack him right so again
there's a compound kind of example of
okay well we could probably use that in
a game that's based on you know what's
in his view that sort of thing
this one intrigued me because I didn't
think he'd actually go to the charger
Tim and I had this conversation the
other day but I found this script that
said drive to charger so I it looks like
he can actually see the charger which I
didn't know Rover the world of charger
he knows where the charger is so that's
again I'll project recognition of what
the charge is right which is handy the
problem is though that he has to back up
onto it so he has to go to and see it
and then turn around and then back up on
to it to charge which is kind of tricky
but again we've had this conversation
like that's surely that's a solvable
problem
it doesn't sound terribly hard but it's
more difficult than just driving up on
him okay I want to get to these things
over here which are much more
interesting okay
so anyone here uses Twitter it's like
Bobby really I'm sure that's all of you
almost all of you but he can he has
interwebs connections so that you can do
stuff online with him as well right and
you can then use that data or that you
know whatever comes back to create all
these emotions and these actions and
these behaviors that he has so in this
case we're going to use Twitter this is
again one of anchors examples but I
think it's really quite cool it's it's
not super complicated if you go down the
bottom is actually whets does did it
today come on this is the biggest one so
here we have a run function and this
connects to Twitter you just create an
app on Twitter if you ever done that so
that your thing that has the right keys
can do stuff with your Twitter account
so I have created a little account for
Cosmo and then he can reacts to tweet so
that's a function that's created above
and in this case because this one's just
called tweet at Cosmo well we can make
him do stuff right so if you run this
before I don't want to go through all
the code because that's kind of it's a
little bit boring let's see we can get
him to
I had it there we go and we want to do
tweeter Cosmo all right so we do that
it's going to start up it's going to
connect to Twitter the app on Twitter
conference Wi-Fi and it's just going to
sit there wait so now if I go over to
the Twitter's which is here and I say
something like the handle and obviously
you can do this now - because you're
gonna see what the handle is right
and easy Cosmo and you say ah is it
Drive I think and then then it's the
number of seconds right so that's so - I
think that's what it is I'm not sweet at
Cosmo you go he drove for two seconds
let's just do that again okay Oh
someone's doing it here we go you got to
make him fall off the table on you now
obviously I have Kozma over here as well
and we can see what people are tweeting
him oh thanks Chris and you can also
make him turn and we could create our
own keywords obviously whatever it might
be but anyone can now kind of when that
script is running you can do and that
could also work for you build or
whatever you can integrate him with
whatever you want right
it just has a standard HTTP connection
to some endpoint and in this case it's
Twitter's API and he you can you know
tweeted am i come from what they all I
think and reply on this because I got
this one wrong you can say head lift
photo say or turn so you're also getting
to talk you can say and then a text that
is correct thank you there we go so
that's all you have to do all right it's
got fun and it gives you this extra
layer like now we have access to the
interwebs which means that we can kind
of do anything really because we're
nerds right we can do stuff
and that just elevates the powerful like
API ness of this thing shut up now
obviously I can just kill that script
right there we go so the other one that
is integrated with Twitter as well is I
know there wasn't to us the one we just
did
remember last one here where you read
your tweet right so you can tweet out of
them and you read out whatever is in his
stream I saw everything solution if you
make him follow 200 people he's just
gonna not shut up he's just kind of go
nuts but you could do that you know
based on handle or based on keyword as
well or whatever you want to do but in
this case it's the same thing it's much
smaller script connect to Twitter same
thing we did before and when he gets a
tweet now he's a little bit of clever on
here so it does say : every tweet
appears in the stream but it like you'll
remove an RT prefix because that's just
stupid oh who does that and you know add
retweeted and stuff like that so you can
you can do that again and we could make
him you know flash the lights or say
turn on a cube and you turn on the cube
whatever is in the API is now accessible
Twitter right good idea I don't know but
hey it's cool
so if you run that cars memories tweets
now whatever you tweet at him now with
that and easy underscore Cosmo handle he
will say that's just keyboard mashing
what the hell
thanks Ryan Ryan out now so you get the
idea right the thing is he also reads
out the handle like he literally reads
everything so it just becomes a legit
run you can't figure out what the hell
is saying oh yeah that's not annoying at
all
shut up there we go all right I'm sorry
to ruin your fun um we good idea yes so
that's a good question how does the
connectivity like what's the pipeline
right what's the stack is what you're
asking this thing is connected that are
not turned on for again it's an Android
phone I'm not used to this new
technology this thing is connected to
the computer of the cable and the
computers got Wi-Fi connection right so
this is connected by Wi-Fi to him and
then okay and then he uses via the cable
the Wi-Fi connection on the computer so
that's kind of the way that it works
yeah no he has no memory no it has to
all happen through the app but then
again Android devices about 40 bucks now
so you know it's not a big deal yes Oh
same question communication with the
blocks
I think it's Wi-Fi as well I'm not sure
it might be Bluetooth how do you know
Tim oh is it okay proprietary there you
go I actually don't know so it's a some
sort of proprietary
and that kind of makes sense because you
don't really want interference with
those things I don't know if you can
recognize more blocks I don't think
because they all have different they
have different symbols on them I know if
you've seen that they all look different
so I would imagine that they each have a
different proprietary signal to him to
find him but he has to look at them in
order to see where they are and then
they light up so it's not just a matter
of him sending out waves necessarily you
can do that as well as we did when we
lit him up
okay so back to my amazing slides
because yeah cool because you might want
to get started with this and I had a
question rather start I said how much is
he hey wait I paid a hundred and eighty
dollars us plus whatever the postage was
but then because it malfunctioned
I got another one just sent under
warranty so it's kind of good that way
if you deal with Amazon and I guess
that's part of their service and that's
it you just get the Box the app is free
if you've got any kind of Android
devices like version 4.4 went above
which is I think every single Android
device out there almost is probably not
much running lower than that you do need
an iOS on an Android device as I said
before and then here's the really cool
bit because it's the US market only
device right so the warranty is through
the US
luckily Amazon is pretty good about that
Anke support there's only like kind of a
you know in the US or we don't know what
to do I guess
possibly but I've been I've been allowed
to say that they're going to announce
the release date in Austria very soon so
we're going to get an Aussie version of
Cosmo I don't know when they're gonna
announce when it going to be but it's
very soon like probably the next few
weeks so you will be able to buy it here
as well under all the Australian
warranty rules and all that stuff which
is kind of cool like they're expanding
so must be working for it and I mean
he's hard not to love right is so
annoying sometimes like he'll he
literally will run after you and bump
into you if you don't want to play with
him he just gets angry or throws a block
at you or something it's pretty good fun
if you want to do want to know more
about all this
please take a picture or something of
this or I have to send it to you
whatever might be because these are the
official references or links from Anki
this is where they would like you to go
it's back to the forum these forms are
really good there's a lot of active
and people post their own scripts that
you can then take and copy and use bits
from and you know put your own together
and all that sort of stuff it really is
a good resource and then the API
documentation is pretty good as well
it's pretty useful if you do use I use
Visual Studio code on this and if you
install the the Python plugin you do get
intellisense and code completion and all
that stuff anyway so that's that makes
it easier now at the end here I've got
this little kind of fun thing that Anki
is done because they realize so I spoke
to him about my talk today and I've
brought some articles there was about
Cosmo and they said hey we see that
you're doing a RvR stuff because of Mike
Hollins right and say hey do you know
we've actually done something with Cosmo
oh really yeah and they sent me this
so that does anyone recognize when said
the start ins AR kid so that's the new
and Apple iOS AR initiative call AR kit
which has from the videos I haven't
played with it has amazing tracking and
they're using that with the Kozma API so
they when he presses the block which you
can catch her obviously it then triggers
that animation through a arcade now they
haven't shared the code with me so I'm
not exactly sure how they've done it but
that's certainly opens up and how they
know whole other range of possibilities
it's pretty pretty impressive and I'm
not sure where it's gonna go from here
to be honest I kind of have an idea that
something you know something big is
gonna happen maybe who knows it's it
could go horribly wrong Cosmo was pretty
independent that's me I'm last I get
some stickers from Microsoft that says
MVP on them because I'm loud yeah I do
write about this stuff as well on my
blog if you want to go check that out
and I also write some stuff for
Pluralsight if you want to listen more
to my voice I have a podcast which is
called the day in the pain it's with a
guy I've never met who lives in Alaska
which is kind of interesting but we
connected on Twitter and we thought it
was a great idea to talk rubbish for an
hour every week so that's kind of what
we do we do find some really cool stuff
sometimes like this global speed say
speed test index guess what the fifth
fastest internet in the world is which
country is that North Australia what not
Australia today is not too bad
Romania not Korea I also do some puerile
site causes which is I'm a freelancer so
that's part of you know what I do for a
living if you don't know about PubCon
fits on tonight I think there's still
tickets left
I hope so this is the after party friend
you see and it's ten ignite talks for
five minutes hawks with slides that
change every 15 seconds whether you like
it or not and as a speaker you just got
to keep up and it's hilarious not
recorded highly inappropriate lots of
swearing all that sort of stuff
go to popcorn that I owe if you want to
come along that's it that's all I have
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
