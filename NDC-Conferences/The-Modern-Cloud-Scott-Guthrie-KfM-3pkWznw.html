do people hear me okay in the back
excellent well I want to say a big thank
you for everyone attending in DC I think
this is my fourth or fifth in DC
conference that I've been able to do and
it's an amazing audience and amazing
event and it's real privilege to be here
and be able to talk to you Friday
morning about what they asked me to talk
about was the modern cloud and kind of
you know what do I think about in terms
of some of the new trends that are
happening in terms of cloud computing
and you know more importantly like how
do what are some of the opportunities
for all of us in this room to really
build new types of apps not just sort of
hopefully better code or better
architecture than we've done in the past
but also just brand new scenarios and
enable things that just weren't possible
before and you know one of the things I
often say when I talk to developers at
events like this it's just it's an
amazing time to be a developer when you
think about just the wealth of different
technologies that are out there that are
emerging whether it's around IOT whether
it's around machine learning in AI you
know whether it's around you know new
types of hardware like FPGA and GPUs
whether it's around new frameworks like
container orchestration with kubernetes
or technologies that are emerging in
terms of handling large scale systems
like never before it's you know it's I
can't remember a time in the industry
when there's been so much innovation
happening really at the same time and
you know in many ways cloud computing is
helping really Drive a lot of this
innovation by making it much much easier
for all of us to really experiment with
this technology without having to buy
new servers without having to kind of
dedicate a whole bunch of capacity and
it's driving a new level of scale and a
new level of innovation that we all get
to take advantage of you know at the
same time you know the scary thing with
all this new technology is it is
overwhelming and I think one of the
important things to always keep in mind
is as a developer when you're
approaching things like this is you know
don't always try to learn all of it and
today because hey you can't and be you
know try to find places where you can
get bite-sized chunks of value and you
know really learn and be able to build
new apps and then continue along the way
and that's why events like this are so
great kind of get exposure and to really
hear from others that are actually
practicing the technology and really
learning about what's the art of the
possible and also what's the best
practices to implement it so what I do
is since we have an hour here this
morning it's talked about three of the
trends that I'm particularly excited on
this slide which is the Train around AI
the trend around serverless and then
also the trend around data at Planet
scale that I think are three things that
hopefully most people in this room are
gonna be able to take advantage of in
some way shape or form over the next
year or two and again hopefully provide
ways that we cannot just write better
code but also do new types of things
that we just couldn't do before and
rather than just talk esoterically about
it what I thought I'd do is actually
show off some demos of kind of each of
them in action so you can also get a
sense of the art of the possible of what
you can do with it
and hopefully have a little bit of fun
with a couple of fun and sometimes silly
demos throughout the day so I stopped
talk first about artificial intelligence
how people who are doing stuff today
with AI only three hands I'm not sure if
that's so only three people or the
coffee hasn't sunk in yet but uh but
yeah I think everyone's heard about AI
and I think one of the things that you
know it seems like every day in the
newspaper there's something about how AI
is gonna replace this or kill us or kill
that or do something and there's I'd say
the buzz factor and the hype over AI it
is pretty high but there's also a lot of
real truth that in terms of what you can
do with it and you know I think
increasingly the expectation as software
developers it's gonna be how do we take
and write software that when combined
with data delivers much more intelligent
experiences and you know things that I
think a lot of cloud vendors including
my own are spending a lot of time on is
both you know how do we provide some of
the tools that allow you to build as a
data scientist or someone who's a
deeply immersed in AI new types of
applications and be able to unlock new
insight with your own custom algorithms
and so we're investing heavily and kind
of building platform technologies that
allow you to do that but at the same
time also how do we just make it so that
you can integrate AI much more
seamlessly into every app that you build
and you don't have to be a data
scientist you don't have to be a machine
learning expert in order to actually
start to integrate intelligence in terms
of the systems that you build and make
them a lot richer and you know having
the combination of both being able to
have rich platform that lets you go
infinitely deep but also a set of
pre-built models that we can all just
take advantage of like we do today when
we reference a library or framework in
our language of choice is a nice balance
and hopefully means that AI can really
be something that all of us can easily
take advantage of and so specifically
you know one of things that my team's
been focused on is these things we call
our Azure cognitive services which are
kind of again pre-built rest api is that
you can call that have models behind
them that have been pre trained so you
don't have to be a data scientist and it
literally is like calling a method call
or a rest call in order to invoke it and
you know really provides simple api's
that you can leverage and use as part of
it and I thought you know make a little
bit fun is maybe I should show off a
couple of demos or the types of things
that you can do you know again just by
integrating a little bit AI into your
applications and hopefully get across
the fact that this is something that
everyone in this room can start taking
advantage of now as you start to build
applications and solutions so let's go
ahead and flip over here and yeah what I
thought I'd do is just try to make all
these different trends real by showing
off real code and actually showing off
some real solutions of how you can go
ahead and use it so I'm actually gonna
do for like coincidentally for all my
demos this take advantage of Azure which
is near and dear to my heart but you
know the meta concepts we're talking
about obviously you can do with other
cloud platforms as well but this
capability to create sort of AI and
cognitive services is something that
again you know I think is something that
we're trying to make super easy for
everyone to take advantage of so I'm
doing here is I'm just inside the azure
managed
console which is just a browser-based
experience and one of these you can do
very quickly it's just go ahead and say
new and I can so for example create a
new computer vision API or a face API or
text analytics API this just stands up
an end point where I have a little
security key that I can go ahead and an
arrest call basically invoke to be able
to take advantage of this pre-built API
model that exists and this is sort of a
sample app that you can download a
couple sort of pre-built applications
that you can leverage their kind of show
off what all you can do as part of this
and what I was going to show here is
something called real-time crowd
insights and basically this is showing
off kind of a simple AI algorithm and so
everything so there's a client app here
that's running on my laptop it's using
the webcam and my in my laptop here but
it's doing all the AI in the cloud using
this endpoint that I can stand up you
know in a few seconds and you'll notice
here as I'm moving around there's a
rectangle around my face this is
basically taking advantage of face
detection and so you can feed any video
or you can feed any image in and it'll
basically identify all the people in
terms of the face inside the picture and
you'll notice here if i zoom in that's
scary you know it also will do basic
kind of identity detection so it's
noticed I'm a male I thinks I'm well I'm
aging in front of you yeah you know it's
the eyes AI is not always truth AI is
sort of you know trained statistical
analytics based on past data and so you
know it doesn't know who I am this is a
completely anonymous case right now and
so I've aged maybe a lot but it gives
you a rough approximate I'm turning 43
in two weeks so it's you know it's not
too far off and it's been able to think
you know identify my gender and then
you'll notice it also has this thing on
the right which is sentiment detection
so right now it's neutral I'm happy oh
come on yeah and if I'm sad yeah yeah
and so it's a basic sort of sentiment
analysis and attack
and the cool thing here is this is just
an API call rest call give us an image
will return back a rect of all the faces
or an array of racks of all the faces
with you know details about sort of the
sentiment and the gender as part of it
and so it's something again every app
can take advantage of whether it's a
mobile app whether it's a web app
whether it's something on the backend
you know it's also you know nice about
you know some of these api's and you
know some of the things you can do with
them is again not without having to be a
data scientist can you provide basic
training with your own data that you
upload that can make it richer and so in
this case here you know the other thing
the API let you do is actually pre
populate pictures of people that you can
then train the model to identify in
terms of the feed that you provide so in
this case here I could search the
internet here for pictures of me you can
see here that's me a long time ago with
more hair this is me with less hair four
years ago I don't know where that is you
know these are all I think about six or
seven years ago these are not me I wish
that was me that looks like me and jail
but anyway
so anyways so I'll just pick a few
pictures here these are literally random
off the internet
just always fun and it's basically
uploading these pictures to this API I
can go ahead and just say train retrain
the algorithm and now one of things
you'll notice is when I actually do the
face detection it's now not just
identifying I'm a male in my age but
it's also being able to identify oh this
is actually Scott Guthrie based on those
images it's about seventy six percent
confidence you can see the percentage
confidence that it has and it is
definitely on face rather than shirt
color but maybe you just higher
confidence if i zoom in and yeah these
weren't pictures I took this morning
these are all you know in some cases
ten-year-old pictures but
enough about faith structure that's able
to infer and if it was obviously a more
recent picture the confidence interval
would go way up and no it's definitely
me and so you think about when you use
Instagram you use Facebook you upload a
picture of an event and it sort of pre
identifies your friends in the picture
that used to take facebook thousands of
engineers to be able to train the models
to do that the cool thing is this is now
something that all of us with four or
five method calls can actually go ahead
and do using whatever language or
technology we want and the cool thing
you can also do just to make this sort
of infinity basis I noticed check that
out it's creepy it's really creepy
anyway yeah so anyway so a little bit in
terms of you know the types of things
you can do and again I think the cool
thing about this is you think about a
eiegant is you know that there's
different degrees of power you can
leverage when you start thinking about
machine learning in AI
you know to get the ultimate power you
are gonna want to need to spend time and
learn sort of really the science behind
AI and you know some of the core
concepts around statistical analysis and
data science and so it's you know if you
want to do the ultimate it is gonna
require that you invest time and
learning it but the cool thing is you
know for the rest of us and I put myself
in the rest of this category I think
you're gonna find also yeah he's gonna
be something you're just gonna take
advantage of very naturally in the same
way that you reference a library inside
your applications or a framework inside
your applications and leverage it today
and so definitely recommend exploring
ways that you can start to integrate you
know this type of intelligence inside
your systems because it really does make
building apps more fun and as an end
user you know you can be a real delight
err in terms of the experience you put
in front of people that's one of the
kind of things that yeah I I think with
cloud computing is going to become just
more pervasive in terms of all the
systems that we're building you know the
only one that I think is a pretty hot
topic right now is around serverless
computing and you know new ways for us
to even sort of execute code in a
cloud-based environment that doesn't
require us to have fixed servers or fix
infrastructure that's up and running but
instead allows us to really schedule
code that can execute on demand based on
events or triggers within our
application that we fire there's a
couple reasons you know things I think
are compelling about this you know one
is it really changes the economics of
how we can build apps I like to tell the
story of you know one of our customers
that's a big manufacturer doing
industrial things and they were doing a
test with serverless computing on answer
and they basically pumped about a
billion events in a day through the
system and thankfully worked well and
then they should I figure I'll get how
much is this going to cost us and they
got the bill and they call us up on the
phone and they basically said your
billing systems broken because it says
it's $40.00 for his billion events and
we thought you're right our systems
broken our billing systems broken and we
kind of dived in and looked at the bill
and came back to them and realized
actually that is really the price it
really is only $40.00 to spend this you
know the billion dollars of IOT events
and they kind of went yay we would and
you know but it is you know blew their
mind in terms of like this is possible
because we would have thought we need
you know hundred servers you know
basically allocated and costing
thousands of dollars to do this and you
know it suddenly changed the way that
they were able to think about computing
logic on top of the data that they were
gathering in radically new ways and I
think you know one of the things that
you're gonna see and I'll show some
demos in a minute
it's this sort of marriage of AI plus
server lists together so it's that you
can actually trigger off server list
code in response to data changes or user
input changes inside your system and be
able to you then run AI algorithms
asynchronously in a server list way to
actually understand and actually reason
over that data in deeper ways and the
ability to do that easily at scale and
then cheaply really changes how you
build applications in new ways and you
know on you know a lot of things that
we're doing for example in Azure is how
do we make it easy to do this in
response to lots of different events and
so we have an ability now to run code
again asynchronously don't pay for any
anything up front you really only play
for the clock cycles that you're
executing and trigger in response to
lots of different things so an HTTP
request coming in or a timer going off
every five seconds or a storage change
or a database change or even things like
you know a CRM record changing in
Salesforce or Dynamics or an IOT event
or you know a tweet coming in through
the internet and the ability to kind of
you know be able to respond to any of
those types of events schedule code and
have it execute you know ends up being
really cool and we have a service we
call our as your function service and
you know every cloud has you know the
equivalent kind of server list service
you know some of these things we have
about our Azure functions is lets you
write any language and you can do
everything in the browser so I'll show
in a second but it also has a really
rich development tools support and so
you can actually execute and debug it
locally and you know you can actually
package up this code so it's not just
for snippets of code but can be real
application logic that you can develop
using your language or tool of choice
and be able to edit and manage it in a
rich way let's go ahead and walk through
a couple you know fun use cases of
server lists to kind of just illustrate
what you can do with it
how many people here a view server list
before built a service app okay good
number and it's good so you know we need
to start with hello world for people
that haven't and then we'll show off a
little bit some more advanced stuff it's
pretty fun and so again for azor it's
pretty easy basically just say I want to
create a new service function app and
you know we stand up sort of an
environment that looks like this
where you can basically code inside the
browser if you want to and basically
register events and this is often sorry
it's a the easiest way to get started
I'm one of those people that eventually
doesn't want to program in a text box
inside a web page I'd much rather be
able to use an editor of my choice which
is why we also have the rich tooling
support so I'm going to show off just a
few hello world demos using the browser
since it's really easy you don't need to
install anything and then for the more
advanced demo I'll flip over and I'll
use Visual Studio with a little bit
richer code to show that experience off
as well and so you know basically
what you can do inside here is very
easily say I want to go ahead and create
a function assuming the internet works
there we go and basically we have a
bunch of triggers that are kind of
predefined templates that you can use to
go ahead and schedule code so you can
say for example every time an HTTP
request comes in or timer goes off or
something gets put on a queue etc and
you know there's hundreds of templates
and you can create and publish your own
and so I'm just gonna create a very
simple one here which is an HTTP event
and so I can choose the language I want
so you do Python JavaScript Java cetera
I'm just using c-sharp here and I can go
ahead and just say call this the indc
HTTP trigger and when I do this it's
gonna go ahead and create for me a
simple text box with a little bit of
sample code here on how to do kind of
the equivalent sort hello world like
scenario and I can either just hit this
directly or I can go ahead and hit run
which case I'll get sort of interactive
logging experience and then I just take
the URL to this function we created
paste it in the browser and by default
right now it's just gonna spit back and
say you know please pass a name on the
query string of the request body and
that's because the code if you look at
it basically just says if there's
nothing coming in on the query string
called name spit out please pass it
otherwise if you supply the value return
okay and say hello name so we said here
oops go back here and say aim equals in
do you see see spits back hello in DC
and the cool thing in is just the fact
that I'm not spitting up a VM I'm not
paying for anything that's sort of
sitting idle as I'm doing this you know
instead I'm literally just paying based
on the indications that are coming in as
part of it it looks like oh cool some
other people in the audience have found
it and yeah and you go from there
so this is a super simple run some code
in response to an HTTP event let's look
at something little bit richer so you
know how many people you know you might
say well what can you do it's just
running code on an HTTP event why is
this at all better for different things
you know the place where I think server
list ends up being sort of really
compelling is where things that don't
happen all the time but happen
asynchronously or you know occasionally
in particular is where the economics
makes a ton of sense for server lists
and so for example you want to process
an order that's put into a queue for an
e-commerce site you might not need to do
that every second you might only do five
orders per minute server this makes a
ton of sense to be able to schedule that
code reactively in a really fast way you
know other cases where I think you're
going to see serverless used a lot more
is with things like web hooks and the
ability to kind of compose different
applications together including SAS and
other cloud services built by others and
be able to kind of stitch them together
so that you can get a notification when
say your CRM app has a record change or
when you know something happens in a
social media app and then be able to
kind of asynchronously schedule code
based on it some people here today I've
ever used a web hook technique in order
to actually kind of enrich their app
okay so there may be 10% 15% of people
how many people your use github a lot
more hands so github as rich web hooks
support so you can actually wire up web
hooks to any github repository it's
worth I do is just actually show off a
super simple scenario where it looks
actually for everyone that's using
github you know how can you actually
write some code in response to github
data changes and you know enrich your
github based workflows a little bit and
basically not have to pay pretty much
anything to do it so what I'm gonna do
to do this is I'm going to create a new
function and yeah one of the templates
I'm gonna use here is a function called
a github webhook
and so I could call this again I could
write it different languages and you
know this is going to create again super
simple a little app here it's four lines
of code
and obviously make it a lot richer if
you wanted to but it's this gonna
basically by default spit out to the log
from github he was the message that came
in so again not super rich and what it
exposes here in the top right is two
little things which is a function URL so
in other words the HTTP URL to invoke
this code and then also a github secret
which is just basically we just
pre-populated if you click it you see it
but since I don't really want to share
my github secret with all of you
no offense trust me when you click it
you get something like that that's just
the URL and what I can basically do now
is just take this and go into github and
so this is a standard github here I can
click on let's say a repository I have
if you go to settings you know one of
the things that's there on the left is
called web books and so if you never
added a web hook to github before it's
pretty easy all you do is you paste in
the URL of that you want them to call in
response to an event happening you paste
in that secret feed key right there you
do want to make sure you pass the right
content format so I think our template
defaults to JSON but you just wanna make
sure you select the right one that
matches the template in terms of how you
parse the values and then you can
effectively say have them forward
everything to me or you can basically
select individual events inside get up
so if you just wanted to know and say
someone posted an issue to your to your
project just click the issues one and
then they'll call that URL only in
response to issues occurring so super
simple kind of approach just so you
don't have to watch me or you can't
watch me paste in my secret I just
created one earlier that points to that
but I use basically that approach in
order to do it and again this is the
same default template that I had where
I'm just spitting out the value of
github it's now if I run this oh look
other people have already found this
cool isn't that fun um even more
interesting with the next demo so I just
go the issues list here and go ahead and
want to blow in DC ah you know it is the
low back and I can post this and basally
what I'll find if I go back the browser
here is github so all initially was
posted saw it right we had registered
web book called my URL this code
executed and then just that back in the
command line you know get hello back and
so you know that's how easy it is to
kind of do this wire up of integration
you know pretty much with anything that
exposes a web book and since most sass
apps out there now expose web books yeah
you can now do lots of simple
integration scenarios really easily and
the beauty here is let's say for example
I have a horrendous project on get up
and I get hundreds of thousands of
issues that are submitted you know every
month on it you know I'm probably gonna
pay for I don't know six pence worth of
compute to be able to execute the
responding service list code to
basically get notified and so again it's
super cost-effective way that for
effectively nothing I can now integrate
my systems into other systems and start
to build more interesting and and
scenarios so this is all kind of flow
world default template stuff and you
know right now I'm not integrating any
AI obviously into these apps but I could
obviously call those same AI algorithms
easily within this code and so well do
is now show like an even sort of
slightly richer app where instead of
developing everything in a text box in a
browser yeah I want to be able to kind
of write a little bit more more rich
code in whatever editor or tool of my
choice
so in this case here I've got a visual
studio project that I've created if
you're using vs and.net today we
actually have kind of a nice Asscher
function project that you can just go
ahead and create this puts all the right
files in there but it also kind of wires
up a local emulator as well as debugging
and publishing experience so you can
also easily work with it locally without
having to kind of upload code
continuously in the cloud and run here I
just kick this off is
sort of a fun silly app which is a cat
moderator app and basically what this
site is is you know it's a standard sort
of content upload site where you can
upload pictures of your cat does anyone
hear a cat person few people are I'm
more of a dog person but someone built
the cat site for me so it's it's a it's
a fun download you can substitute
whatever content you want in it and
basically you know you can go ahead and
upload a picture
so let's you know go ahead and say cute
cat it uploads it and way this works is
it uploads it and it's putting it in
what's called a pending state so instead
of this going live for the whole world
to see what I want to do is since people
can upload arbitrary content is make
sure this really is a picture of a cat
and that you know someone can't go ahead
and potentially upload something
inappropriate or something that isn't
specific to the site and what I have
here is the server list code that's
running in the background to do this
moderation and so basically what just
fired here in the debugger is an event
that I'd wired up not in response to the
actual HTTP POST so it's not an HTTP
event instead I've wired it up so that
anytime data changes in my database I
want this code to asynchronously execute
and so it's basically running in the
backend and again only firing when
something gets uploaded and what this
basically is doing is just calling off
to those same cognitive services I
talked about earlier in AI and it's
gonna do effectively image and content
moderation and so it this is sort of the
code to basically invoke those cognitive
services and it's basically uploading
the image the cognitive service and
saying bring back to me a human readable
version of what's in this picture and
you can see here broken the debugger
this caption error and this wasn't the
caption I entered as the user uploading
my picture this is what came back from
the AI algorithms which is this is a
picture of a black cat sitting on a bed
and I can then basically say okay
there's a cat in the picture great
of it it also checks the caption that
was that the user specified I said cute
cat it's there's a sort of profanity
checker or appropriateness checker on
this in the text and so if someone also
uploads something inappropriate I can go
ahead and remove it and since right now
this picture contains a cat and the text
passes the moderation I can go ahead and
hit continue and it approves the picture
and if I come back here and hit refresh
on the approved page you can see the
cats there and this is cool because
other people are now uploading their own
pictures this is where it gets scary but
a brown and white dog so cool thing is
my suspicion is this is not someone's
pet cat it's a brown and white dog and
so I'm gonna hit continue
Oh a cat lying in a desk in front of a
computer Oh lots of people have found it
awesome and you know the saving grace is
close-up of a cat more dogs anyway
before it's dangerous listens go ahead
and refresh but you can see the Rideau
who's who owns deus in here thank you
okay I'm not sure who's that one is but
it is a cat and it is sitting a desk in
front of the computer yeah and so you
can see also why it approved it and the
rejected ones
click it or not there we go there we go
and so you can see here this is a brown
and white dog thank you for
demonstrating and not doing anything too
bad anyway so simply again simple
example of just sort of wiring up here
you know the this this sort of
surrealist code that fires in response
to data that can then use AI and execute
that and again the beautiful thing about
an app like this you're doing in the
past would be hard because you wouldn't
necessarily have those AI algorithms to
be able to use you'd have to have you
know some human go in and do it and the
picture would take forever to go up and
it would probably be from an
architectural perspective you'd have a
VM or two for your front end you'd have
a VM for the backend processing the VM
in the backend would mostly sit idle or
you'd have a daemon that would be hard
to scale out etc and in this case here
again unless you have a ton of cats you
know the overall cost of running the
back-end in this case is probably going
to be you know less than a penny for
something simple like this a month and
then if the site got really popular you
know the beautiful thing about survival
is computing is it pushes us in a
pattern where we actually end up coding
our applications in an event-driven way
which makes it much more in scalable
from an architecture perspective and so
if I literally had a million events come
in simultaneously I could actually
schedule a million functions to execute
simultaneously and I wouldn't need to
scale out my infrastructure manually you
know the clouds just gonna basically
take care of that for us and give us
that flexibility so you know lots of
scenarios here and since I'm scared
about what else anyone's gonna do I'm
gonna stop showing pictures of approved
pending stuff and talk about some more
serverless stuff that we can take
advantage of so the sum I showed here in
that cat demo you know was really sort
of showing off how you can write custom
code in the server list way and you know
obviously being able to write custom
code gives
sort of ultimate flexibility in terms of
the logic that we ultimately want to
execute and you know you know if you can
for example debug it locally and if you
if you can add any number of files and
libraries to your server list code you
know anything you can do today
programmatically inside your
applications you can now run service Li
at the same time I think one of the
things like even that github sample kind
of shows off is you know it gets super
powerful when you could also rather than
have to write procedural code for
everything you know can you take
advantage of some of the data
extensibility that different
applications have and be able to kind of
leverage also kind of more of a
composition model of data or app
connectors that enable you to more
easily stitch together solutions end to
end and you know I think you know one of
things that we're also trying to do and
have a nice service to enable is kind of
these declarative workflows word that
you can make there's some sometimes very
long-running that could be multi-day
workflows where you can leverage
pre-built data and app connectors that
do a lot of the grunge work for you of
extracting data from this system and
passing it along to a different system
and being able to do that with security
and reliability and everything built in
and the nice thing with our logic app
services you can leverage these built-in
connectors and I'll show you some demos
in just a second but you can also then
drop in your own connectors using the
same approach that I just showed with
these ads or functions where you write
your own custom code and so you have the
flexibility of both pre-built connectors
but also the ability to write your own
code that you can go ahead and execute
let me show you what that looks like it
means so show off show off a sort of
service that we've actually been running
ourselves on our team that we found
super useful which is an example one of
these logic apps and so you just go new
logic app to create one this is what I
have sort of pre-built and basically
what the service does is it is
automatically scanning for social media
feedback on Twitter and server lessly
executing workflows every time a tweet
comes in that matches a certain criteria
and it does a couple different things so
you can
kind of see the logic here just expand
it
and you can kind of use this sort of
declarative connector model to stitch
this together and so I'm using a built
in Twitter component and so it's
basically just searching for the hashtag
ash or every 15 seconds on Twitter and
we have kind of a firehose access to the
Twitter feed so basically every time
there's a new tweet that comes in we'll
kick off a workflow and then what I'm
basically doing here you can see this is
we're getting where we can weave in AI
similar to what we did in the last demo
is I can call off to a sentiment
detection ai algorithm that's in
cognitive services that's gonna
basically given a chunk of text come
back and tell me on a scale of 0 to 1 is
the content in here positive or negative
in tone you know so similar to that face
detection where I was frowning and sad
you know it'll charge so try to
statistically understand it and I'm
using another built in connector where
I'm calling out to actually extract out
from this block of text what are the key
phrases that stand out and how can I
build a model so that I can actually
train based on a set of text what are
the things that people are talking about
and I basically pass in this into an
Asscher function so this is a place
where I basically taking a bunch of this
custom code and I want to synthesize it
in in a in a additional way I could do
it declaratively but in this case here
it's just easier to write Java or C
sharp or Python code to do that and so
this is just gonna call out to one of
these Azure functions and execute it
just like you saw me do earlier and then
basically going to pump this into a
power bi dataset so I can actually
visualize what this tweet data looks
like and I'm gonna basically put into
this data set the tweet tax the score on
sentiment where it was tweeted who
created it and what the key phrases are
and then since I want to make sure if
someone is upset I'm gonna basically
wire up here some logic that says if the
sentiment score is less than 0.3 meaning
if we think the user is upset I'm gonna
basically pump this into a Microsoft
team's room which is sort like a slack
channel where all my engineers can
basically see the tweet directly and
then I can open up a support case
in our CRM system that someone can then
go ahead and reach out to that customer
to help them and these are all kind of
built-in connectors and the beautiful
thing is you know you can leverage these
built-in connectors so you could just
sort of drag and drop these and wire
them up for lots of different scenarios
because different sass apps frankly
implement rest and implement security in
different ways so if I want integrate
with marketing exotic use Adobe or
Facebook we have connectors or Google we
have connectors or DocuSign or Dropbox
or AWS or Gmail or you know you name it
MailChimp you know these are all
built-in connectors Salesforce etc slack
you can also go ahead and connect
on-premises so if you've got an S AP
system that's your ERP system or you've
got an on-prem work or sequel database
you can also wire it up these things
declaratively and what this thing now
does once I hit save is it's now running
serverless code so I'm not having to pay
for you know a server workflow that's
running around instead I think I pay for
every million invocations of this
workflow and I think for every million
steps it's something like I think 15
pounds worth of usage so you can run a
lot of these steps for very little if
nothing at all and you know in terms of
what this looks like then and this is
always scary because this is real
Twitter data you can basically see here
are all the tweets that have happened in
the last through an hour or so across
the world on Azure and all the locations
for them you can basically see our
sentiment chart of what actually people
are saying about Azure from our AI model
in terms of positive or negative again
0.5 is neutral which is sort of the
default which is why you see you know
heavy bass there you can see the good
news is people are mostly pretty happy
and then you can also see here you know
what are the key phrases that people are
talking about so I think I was in Munich
yesterday talking about our azure
kubernetes service you see someone liked
it and that had perfect sentiment score
they thought it was great and then these
are all the key phrases they've been
pulled out of all these different tweets
and their relative scanning sentiment
score so this gives us a nice heads-up
display and if you remember from the
logic perspective we said if it's
negative though we want to know about it
and so if it's negative pump it into a
channel that all my engineers can look
and open up a support case and so this
is where it's dangerous so these are all
the negative tweets about Azure people
upset and you know sometimes it's just
hard I don't know the latest done in
community daily I'm not sure where that
was negative but you know it's it's hard
with AI with a short amount of text
sometimes to get it completely right
this is a lot better when you have a
paragraph of text so there's a lot of
you know things here I sort of say it's
not really negative it's just neutral
but this is one that is actually looks
bad or real which is hey I'm getting a
rate limit per day in my graph on
dashboard when trying to access the data
from application insights and so this is
someone who either has misconfigured
something or maybe hasn't actually
scaled their thing up and this is yeah
they're having a problem
the nice thing now is my team can know
about it literally in real time so that
tweak happened you know 15 minutes ago
or less and you know we can reach out
and actually help them on Twitter
without having to wait for them to open
a support case without waiting for them
to get even more angry after a couple
hours of them not being able to figure
out how to do it and we can close the
loop in an easy way and you know we
actually used this for real and Azure we
actually have a team that watches 24/7
and our average response time when
someone posts something negative on
Twitter it's today three point five
minutes before we actually reach out to
them and we'll direct message a support
case so that's a really good way if you
want to get a free support ticket
actually and you know you get it it's
amazing
the feedback when people get when you
actually help them that way
and so this you know really does
actually drive business value in terms
of how we use it and then the nice thing
is again from a server list perspective
it's easy to whip one of these things
together how do you know if it actually
is working and so what this actually
gives you is a way to actually monitor
all of the workflows that are executing
and so if I see it false positive or I
want to understand why did this workflow
kick off the way it did I can basically
click on any of the individual tweets
here and so you know I can actually see
someone a marketing message sent
came back 0.93 so it sounds the thrilled
so i guess they're happy you know here
are the key phrases iot extension as
your CLI cetera and then yeah you can
see it didn't notify the team's room
because we thought the sentiment was
positive it's a simple easy way i can
actually see how much time in terms of
seconds you can see most these things it
was you know under a second to execute
this particular workflow which basically
means i didn't pay pretty much anything
to do it
so again simple way to kind of integrate
server lists in another way into your
apps and again be able to kind of start
to build even richer systems as a result
so talking about AI talking about server
lists and one more train i thought i'd
talk about in terms as we think about
modern cloud and what you can do going
forward which is really you know this
this change that's happening which is
the fact that we can now build systems
that are truly global that can out
interact with everything you know using
iot everything will have an IP address
going forward that we can reach to
everyone's pocket with a cell phone or a
smartphone or new types of wearable
experiences they have and you know that
starts to put new challenges on all of
us as developers for how the heck do we
manage all this data how do we actually
reason over that data how do we scale
that data and in the world where our
users are no longer just in the country
that we're in but they're in australia
they're in the u.s. they're in asia
they're in africa they're all over the
world you know how do you build an
absent planet scale and really how do
you manage the data in those apps at
planet scale and do it in a robust
reliable way and you know it's gonna put
new pressures on all of our
architectures and all the systems that
we use as developers and there's no
silver bullet so i'm gonna talk about
some of the stuff that we're doing to
make this easier but also recognize this
isn't just like you flip a switch and it
works but the more that we can leverage
in the cloud systems that helped us
towards that journey the more we're
gonna be able to build even richer in
cooler apps and you know one of things
that we've been hard at work at and i
have just been some talks here at the
event
is you know a new database system we
call cosmos DB which is kind of this
sort of the first really globally
distributed what we call multi model
database service that can help as part
of this and basically the way cosmos DB
is designed is you know unlike a
traditional relational database where
you kind of pick the place where you
want to run it and that's where it runs
it's really designed so that you can
actually run it at a global level and
actually run it and scale it out across
multiple regions in the cloud and so we
have 42 regions across the world so
those are datacenter regions two of them
in the UK here and so I can actually
configure where all my data will be
present so I could say I want in
Australia I wanted here in Europe
I wanted North America South American
Asian and then any time you write data
into cosmos DB it will put it in all of
those different locations and it will
keep it coordinated in sync and we'll
talk about from a transaction
perspective even gave you the ability to
coordinate transactions at the
consistency level you want to be able to
access that data and that means that you
can have an instance of your app say the
front end or the API layers in each of
those regions so you can provide super
super fast latency to your customers
against that data and then know that if
that customer hops on a plane and goes
to Europe they'll still have super fast
latency because your dns will send them
to the Europe region instead of the
Australia region and they're still
hitting the same data that they've saved
in Australia at single-digit millisecond
response time so that gives you kind of
the global nature you know what's nice
also about a system like this is it's
really designed to be able to again
support and handle lots of different
types of data ranging from a few
gigabytes in size to literally multiple
petabytes in size and from being able to
do say 100 transactions per second to be
able to scale up to over 10 million
transactions per second we actually have
a couple customers that are now at the
10 million transactions per second range
in terms of how they're using the system
and in fact one of our retailers for
Black Friday in November scaled up to
manage a hundred trillion transactions
in a single day and I actually thought
that was a typo because I've never heard
of 100 trillion transactions in a day
but that's you know that's the type of
system where when you want to have rich
AI running you wanna have Richie
analytics and you want to be able to do
rich curation of your customer and
product data you know that's the like
level you'll do if you really operate at
a global scale and then you know one of
things that we do with Cosmo TV which is
nice is provide not just an availability
SLA meaning like the system stays up but
also as to lays around performance
latency and around performance
throughput it's one thing to say you can
scale to 100 trillion transactions but
it does it actually perform at that
level and perform within certain
performance characteristics and so one
of things that's nice about Kosmos TB is
a guarantees single digit millisecond
response time for all your operations at
the 99th percentile so meaning 99
percent of all operations per guaranteed
to complete in single-digit millisecond
response time or you get money back and
that gives you kind of a scaling point
you can an architect around again very
large systems and that's true also for
performance throughput and consistency
and then lastly the cool thing here is
it's not like a new programming model
you have to learn you get to choose the
programming model you already know and
be able to take advantage of it so if
you're a MongoDB developer today you can
point your existing MongoDB code and
libraries against it you don't need to
install a new library it's binary
compatible with a MongoDB protocol the
same is true for SPARC four gremlin for
example graph based systems and then we
also just recently released Cassandra
support in preview so you can basically
program against this type of system at a
global scale again using any cassandra
code that you already have and then the
cool thing is and this is sort of how it
ties all the stuff together the AI the
server lists and now this is you know
when you can actually store infinite
amounts of data when you can handle
millions of updates per second on that
data
and then if you can go ahead and execute
serverless code in response to any of
those data changes where you can write
arbitrary logic against asynchronously
any of those data updates and then be
able to integrate AI into it then you
really have the power and the ability to
kind of understand your data your
customers in your scenarios at a level
that was never possible before and be
able to design for a footprint and
architecture that can support literally
billions of users around the world
interacting and hitting your system and
you know this is one of the nice things
that's now integrated is the fact that
you can kind of stitch together this
data stitch together the server lists
and then again be able to integrate AI
throughout the mix there's anyone from
ASOS here actually there's a they're
busy working on features I guess they're
a great company that's based here in the
UK and I've been a big ashore customer
and a wonderful partner of ours and you
know I have a nice video from them
talking about some of the ways that
they've been approaching the asus comm
retail experience they were using cosmos
DB they're using Azure and they're
really pushing the boundaries of what
you can do in AI and so I'll just play a
quick video and we'll show another demo
in terms of you know you know how
they're trying to approach it and how
they're thinking about it Isis wants to
be the number one fashion destination
for 20-somethings around the world
fashion is in our DNA we have just over
12 million active customers over 800
brands and introducing about four to
five thousand new products onto the site
every single week we don't have shops
people know about a sauce from the
internet we have one minute when that
digital platform is out we're not
serving our customers we want to be
there for our customers 24/7 365 days of
the year
when you have 85,000 products in your
poet range as far as me to have a
personalized into many spirits we took a
couple of big decisions early the first
was to go microservice the second mr. go
as your platform as a service using
advanced machine learning techniques to
synthesize custom and Pollock
characteristics to create data sets that
will allow us to rank products relevance
in milliseconds and what that will mean
for our customers is we're going to show
Pollitz they might like and those would
be more relevant the experience will be
more elevated and clearly this is all
about maximizing the sales on the time
that the consumer shops with us we use
in cosmos DB because it allows us to
distribute the data models to be near
the services wherever in the world they
deployed the likely immediate elasticity
we like very low latency for random
reads and as you has delivered it's a
rock solid platform to create a and ever
more compelling consumers careers
let's go ahead and walk through you're
kind of you know this sort of cosmos DB
experience and and in particular how do
you you know leverage kind of data at
planets scale and and build systems that
can can do really interesting things and
so this is a simple example that was
going to show here it's sort of like a
Content site so comic wiki who here
likes marble comics safe question at a
developer event I have to talk in Canary
Wharf on Monday and I'm not sure how
that answer is going to go down with a
bunch of bankers but you know and so
this is again sort of simple sites like
Wikipedia you know it's got a lot of
content in it about Marvel characters
which and there's obviously a graph
which we'll talk about in a second in
terms of how Marvel characters are
represented and then the other thing we
have and just make sure it's running is
sort of a chatbot here and so if I
wanted to ask for example 20 Sark here
who are your friends I could do it could
bring back people if I want to know for
example you know who are your enemies
who are so your enemies that work for
Hydra it brings those back and you know
the interesting thing about kind of
building a chat like system here where
you're basically asking arbitrary
questions is you know the data model
doesn't always lend itself well the
relational data model often doesn't lend
itself well to answering these types of
questions because it very much is I'm
asking about not just information of
entities but also kind of the social
interaction experience and the
relationships and hierarchy between
these entities and you know what a lot
of social networks have found is you
know using a graph based data model
works a lot better in those types of
scenarios but kind of I can ask friend
to friends who are also joined and
intersected across different parts of
the graph and that's sort of how this
system here was built and you know the
code in it is was written in in this
case nodejs and
it is using a popular graph a syntax
called gremlin and in fact just using
the vanilla gremlin NPM package to
actually connect to the data data and
actually perform these types of queries
and so you know from the snow gs apps
perspective this is just a gremlin
database you know what's cool is we're
able to build this Grambling database
using something like cosmos TV and take
advantage of kind of those planets scale
capabilities and so when I go ahead and
create a new system here I could just go
and you know just say I want a new
cosmos DB system and when I specify I'll
give it the name and all that stuff you
can notice I can choose the API I want a
program I could use sequel like use
Mongo Cassandra a table API or getting
this gremlin graph based programming
model and I even have multiple
programming languages or programming
models and data models inside my overall
database for each table or collection
but this allows me to kind of use the
data model of my choice as I'm
interacting it and this is you know this
is the Marvel database that I'm using as
part of the demo and so this is already
created and populated and other things
I'll do is just drill into or data
Explorer experience here and you can
kind of see I'm just doing a gremlin
query against kind of the root of that
particular database and you can kind of
see zoom in a little bit here
you know here is how that overall oops
collection of Marvel characters are kind
of interacting again in the graph level
from a relationship perspective an
entity perspective across the list and I
can you know obviously do this inside
our management portal like so the other
thing we do now have is or the ability
if you want you can also go ahead and do
it in your developer to a choice so this
is on my Mac so using BS code and so if
I wanted to I could basically directly
my development tool and just so I don't
pull down like a petabyte of Marvel
character data rather than pull back the
full graph I'm just going to basically
pull back a little bit around Tony Stark
and so this is basically you know
showing effectively again the
relationships across that graph and it
allowed me to work with it directly
between my code kind of in a nice
integrated way what's cool though is is
not that I can just store data because
obviously there's many different graph
databases out there but really the fact
that I can store it all over the world
and now take this Marvel app and
basically scale it so that no matter
where you are in the world it's only a
few milliseconds to basically get an
immediate response back when someone
visits or interacts with the app and
that's sort of the beauty about having
sort of this global scale database and
so you can see here these are all the
regions around the world where cosmos TV
is deployed so these are each Asscher
regions and so you can see we have two
in the UK we've got Ireland we've got
Amsterdam we've got Germany and France
coming shortly we got three in India two
in Australia cetera et cetera and
everything that has a dark blue right
now is where my Marvel database is
currently deployed and so if I wanted to
enter for example Brazil I could go
ahead and select that I could hit save
and this would then go ahead and you
know expand my Marvel database to also
be present in Brazil with the exact same
data such that if someone in the UK
right makes a right it'll show up in
Brazil so that all my Brazil customers
will see it simultaneously as well I
don't need to write any replication data
basically the database will do that for
me and help guarantee it's available
everywhere and what's nice also is you
know obviously for anyone that's built a
distributed system you often struggle
with the question of you know so what
happens when you write that transaction
in the UK you know when is it guaranteed
that that data is going to show up say
in Australia and there's a you know the
challenge with any type of distribute
system especially one that's global is
you can never go faster than the speed
of light and since it takes about a
millisecond to go 130 miles of cable
there's no way to instantaneously write
a transaction in the UK in in Australia
simultaneously that goes faster than the
speed of light so there's always gonna
be some delay when you make a write in a
distributed system before it can be
propagate
everywhere and they're one of the things
that that makes cosmos a little unique
is it gives you the ability as a
developer to also choose what is the
consistency model you want to have every
time you make a write in terms of when
the transaction completes in the UK
versus when the data shows up in
Australia and so for example you can
actually choose if you want to have
what's called session level consistency
or sorry strong level consistency so
that the transaction will not commit in
the UK until the data also is committed
and is available in Australia that's
really good if you're doing financial
transactions and you want guaranteed
consistency it also is the downside
though it's the slowest because again
it's going to take some period of time
to go to Australia and back to commit
that transaction and you can't go faster
than the speed of light as part of it
you also do what's called eventual
consistency which says as soon as you
write a transaction in the UK the
transaction is completed and your app
continues and then it will eventually
replicate the data to Australia and we
do have a guaranteed period of time by
the time it'll be there that gives you
the best performance but at the same
time also means that you don't
necessarily guarantee that someone
instantaneously in in Australia will
have the correct data and then we have a
nice thing we call session consistency
which frankly is one of the best because
it's sort of in between and that
basically says in the UK as soon as you
write that transaction it's guaranteed
be committed and then any subsequent
connection on that session or using the
session token you provide is guaranteed
to always have the committed data no
matter where in the world that it
actually operates but other people that
are not looking at that data won't be
blocked and so it's great for like
shopping carts and for other
capabilities where you just want to make
sure the user if they hit refresh and
they just happen to be bounced to
Australia it's still going to see the
same data and not get confused but at
the same time you don't have the
performance latency of let's say a
strong consistency model so you can
choose which consistency model you want
with Kosmos TB is the default and then
you can also override it on a per
transaction basis so that also means
depending on the scenario in your app
you can also control which way it is and
then again the great thing a cosmos is
you can also then go and monitor how the
system is actually being you
and so right now I'm basically my one
demo app hitting it so we're not really
getting hit heavy hard and hopefully you
haven't figured out the URL to it but if
I wanted to I could measure again the
throughput the storage the latency and
actually see am I getting a guaranteed
single digit millisecond response time
at the 90th percentile and I can see it
on a global level throughout the world
so nice way I can now suddenly replicate
that data and then tying it together to
the previous two sections if I want to I
can then go ahead and say let's now
write serverless code so that every time
one of those million writes happens I
can actually schedule code in a language
of my choice and basically run AI models
on it update the code update the data
model to reflect that and be able to get
in scale out this system so it is global
every change can have AI associated with
it my user experience is lightning fast
and you know I think you're gonna see
more and more this combination of AI
server lists and being able to work with
data at a truly planet scale become kind
of fundamental design points and
literally every application that we
build going forward and the cool thing
is it's no longer rocket science to do
that it's no longer something that
requires a well-funded startup in order
to do you can literally get going and
you know with less than 10 pounds a
month actually get that system working
such that it could scale to around the
world and handle that types of millions
load or if it doesn't reach that point
you still have a well architected system
that was easy to build so anyway so talk
a little about the sort of three trends
AI service and planet scaled data
there's obviously a lot more trends that
are gonna be emerging as part of the
modern cloud again as I said the
beginning this really is the best time I
think ever to be a developer and you
know the fun thing is there's lots of
new technology to be able to use and
take advantage of and you know these
events like in DC it's a fantastic way
to kind of get exposure doll that to
really hear how people are practicing
those new technologies and
to learn how you can build these amazing
systems as well if you're interested you
know all the stuff I showed here is
running on a shore today so there's no
like private hidden things that I'm
taking advantage of and you know hope to
see some of you experiment with it and
learn it there's a great trial you can
basically try everything out here with
over I think 150 pounds worth of credits
for a month and so everything you can do
here you can do as part of that and then
we also now have a perpetual or
year-long free trial and so even after
150 credits are up you can use the
cosmos TV database for a year you can
use their service functions for a year
and you can use those a I cognitive
services for a year and not pay anything
an experiment and use some more so
anyway I hope regardless of what
language 100's you're using you get a
chance to play around with it and I look
forward to seeing what you're building
so thanks so much and I hope you enjoy
