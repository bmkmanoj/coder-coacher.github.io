of the United States not a lot of people
know we're there but Kansas City is
fantastic if you're ever in the mood to
visit I would highly recommend we've got
a fantastic food and dining scene but
let's get started who's excited to talk
about jewel BOTS
does anybody yeah yeah all right let's
get pumped is everybody familiar with
jewel watts oh okay that's so exciting
so you guys looking to learn all about
it for the first time so before we get
started I do want to say thank you to
all the fantastic sponsors hopefully you
crept the food boost yesterday they had
a fun assortment and I don't know if you
have any idea what goes into putting on
a conference but it's a lot of work and
a lot of money so be sure to show some
love to all the sponsors here today
they're what are providing such great
content for you guys making sure take a
price and stay reasonable so definitely
show them some love mm-hmm
a little bit about me my name is
Jennifer wood Ella you can follow me on
twitter at like OMG it study I do like
to warn people that I live tweet The
Bachelor on Monday night so you you've
been warned if you're gonna follow me
just like yeah mute me on Monday nights
cuz that's just my happy place I'm a big
advocate of what I call work life
volunteer balance so I love programming
I love writing code but I also love
having other hobbies and other things in
my life like watching trashy reality
television so I am a JavaScript
developer that's my happy place I work
at a really teeny tiny like I'm engineer
number 3 tech startup in the United
States angular it's cool I get to write
javascript I'm low maintenance I'm happy
mm-hmm I'm a community organizer and so
I'll talk a little bit about that work
in a minute and kind of how that plays
into jewel-box why why do I discover
this product why I find it so amazing
and I'm a big diversity advocate
splitter alert I'm a woman and when you
look around the room or around the
conference we tend to be small in
numbers and I think that should change
so a lot of the work that I do revolves
around trying to get more women into
technology careers and creating a more
diverse pool of software engineers
mm-hmm and I am self-taught so I kind of
like to talk about
the different pathways of education that
people have gotten into software
engineering we're moving away from that
period of time where you're expected to
have a four year computer science degree
to be successful so yeah that's me
was anybody like coding in the my
spacers and good days any but was that a
thing okay like your angsty blog that
you had online when you're like this guy
I really like doesn't even know I exist
and and I'm changing the background to
like do my mood and do the JavaScript
falling stars that were super classy
mid-90s anyway so I wanted to take a
minute to kind of talk about the work
that I do back in the United States so
five years ago I founded an organization
called Kansas City women in technology
and the idea was I wanted to find more
women like me women who are excited
about technology and software and we
could geek out over stuff together
nothing against any of the guys I worked
with they were all fantastic but there
was just something missing when I wasn't
around people who were more like me so
we had this big launch party everybody
was excited we did all this marketing
and like 300 people showed up and maybe
like a couple like a handful were female
engineers or women in technology so it's
like okay well who's everybody else we
had a ton of educators show up and they
were like well we want to help bring
code to our program and you're you're a
technology organization so this is a
place right and then we had a lot of
women who are like well I'm not in a
tech career but it's really important
this is the future like I want to get
into a tech career and I like to share
that story because it definitely wasn't
what I anticipated or set out to do but
it shaped the trajectory of the
organization so from there we launched a
chapter of coderdojo does anybody
familiar with new okay and I'm like I'm
reading that do we need more coffee like
sand we need to get it delivered in okay
mm-hmm so for those who don't know
coderdojo is a global nonprofit actually
founded in ireland with this idea of
being an after-school Club for kids to
learn how to code so they made like this
kind of really cool model where you can
implement it however
works for you in your community as long
as it's free and with the idea of
teaching kids kids how to code so our
Kansas City chapter has been running for
four years now and the way we run that
is we do it mm-hmm once a month in the
morning we do about three hour sessions
we've found that's a really good time to
get kiddos on boarded to get them set up
maybe if they have to sign in like sign
up with an email address or that kind of
thing and then we provide them with a
kind of project prompt because if you
take a kid you'll just like create
they'll kind of look at you and be like
but I can create everything and so we
found it helps if you kind of give them
boundaries to frame their ideas and then
push against those boundaries so we give
them a project prompt we give them kind
of an idea like we might decide that
well we want you to use variables in
your project that's that's your little
check mark or maybe we want you to be
choosing a random value from a list and
sort of very small tangible programming
concept and that kind of keeps them on
track and then they can do this in
scratch they can do it in HTML and CSS
they can do it in JavaScript and then if
their project is on theme so with the
presentation if they have completed like
the checklist for whatever they get to
go up and get their presentation checks
make sure there are no bad words no
obscure references cuz sometimes kids
will do something and you're like I
really don't think that's a good idea
for the five year olds in the room to
see especially the boys that are really
obsessed with doing games of like aliens
shooting each other and blood
splattering everywhere we're like let's
let's tone that content a little bit
they get to come up on stage and present
because a lot of what we're trying to do
is not only teach kids how to teach
themselves to code but build a lot of
those skills that we don't always see
being prioritized as a software
engineers so getting up on stage being
comfortable presenting your code
explaining your thought process and one
of the things we do is we always ask the
kids what was the hardest thing you had
to figure out because we want them to
reflect on their challenges and reflect
on their struggles and realize that if
they persevere they can figure it out so
a lot of what we do is very much trying
to shape their mentality to to be what
we think is important for the future of
Engineers engineers who are going to
push boundaries and make things happen
and not expect everything to be handed
in a textbook hmm okay so that's the way
we run our coderdojo
that being said you can make it fit for
whatever model your city is so if you're
interested in doing any of this kind of
work and would like a really great way
to like bootstrapping it started highly
recommend checking out cutter dojo
resources and bringing it to your
community I like to say it's like
reliving your hello world moment over
and over again each time the kiddos get
excited hmm okay so from there we got a
lot of interest and selling out and we
would get asked to come to schools and
talk about it and so I noticed this
really interesting thing that started to
happen cuz we're like oh yeah like come
check out this coding Club and the
programming dads are like rush up to our
table right and they're like oh my god
this is amazing
how can I sign my daughter up really
yeah come join us have a great time and
then off more often than not it's the
moms that would come by our table and
kind of look and check it out and we'd
explain what we're about and what we're
doing and they'll be like mmm I don't I
don't think my daughter would like that
maybe I'll bring my son so it's not the
kiddos for having a problem with it's
this these predispositions the parents
have about programming these
misconceptions they have so what do we
do we brand it we make it pink we make
it girly and all of a sudden it sells
out all the time same content underneath
I've got eight year old girls pushing to
get hub pages on the command line to
display their cupcake website so if it's
pink I don't really care because they're
doing awesome stuff the code underneath
is the same and all the sudden they have
this idea that they deserve to be in the
room they deserve to be included mm-hmm
so that's my little marketing gimmick
I run a slack channel for developers in
the Midwest and then from there we
launched coding and cocktails because we
had a bunch of women who were like well
I don't have a daughter but can I sign
up anyway so we're like okay well we're
gonna we're gonna create this this
program that's gonna teach women how to
code of course again with the marketing
the branding in the gimmicky coding new
cocktails was born so this is
an 11-month program I wouldn't call it
like a structure in rigid curriculum
we're teaching front-end development
we're teaching source control we're
teaching like ensure to the command line
because if you're reading these
tutorials online and and they're like LS
and CD and you're like oh my god like am
I gonna press a button and like alert a
nuclear strike you know so um kind of
breaking down these things that aren't
necessarily spelled out really well in
online content like anybody can go to
code Academy right and figure out
semantics for HTML and CSS but we try
and bring together all those different
pieces that you're not necessarily gonna
be able to get very easily hmm
without resources so we've got a
presentation we've got all female
mentors all female presenters who were
there to help attendees so we'll present
work through curriculum and it's been a
really great model for us and we've had
women who have started coming to our
programs decided oK you've you've broken
down these misconceptions I have I want
to compute pursue computing now and so
they'll maybe sign up for a boot camp
and then eight months later they've
landed their first job in technology
have come back to us and started
mentoring so it's really cool to see
that full cycle of getting women at
every age level into technology and then
finally we do a django girls session
every year during the summer has anybody
familiar with django girls yeah so again
this is another bootstrap concept
actually founded in Europe where they've
created this workshop in this amazing
curriculum like it is so damn hard to
write curriculum and they've written
this amazing guidebook to how to launch
your first blog and Django they've got a
mentor guide so many amazing resources
so they're like here it's all pretty
impactful into code so if you're ever
again interested in doing this kind of
work definitely look into Django girls
they've got everything bootstrapped and
amazing and yeah those kind of efforts
are fantastic all right mm-hmm
so what inspired this talk
waits for laughs anyways so representing
women in technology my community and it
particular conferences this was the
question I get asked all the time people
wander up to the booth
well coding is important this is the
career path of the future it's the next
blue color job how do I get my daughter
engaged and they're asking me because I
do a lot of this so that's why I was so
excited that jewel box came out so they
were actually a Kickstarter founded by
the founded by the founder of girl
develop it which is another program
teaching women to code and so this is
her her passion project so it was really
cool to see something that was
explicitly being marketed to girls
saying hey this is a way to code this is
for you
but but why why do we need to have a
particular product like this marketed to
girls so we need to talk about the idea
of why girls aren't getting into coding
to kind of break down those ideas and
then understand why jewel-box and
concepts like it are so powerful in in
solving this problem of making
technology a more inclusive place so a
bunch of different things that are kind
of preventing girls from getting in
because you hear that question all the
time why are more girls into code why
are women into code so we're dealing
with issues like psychological barriers
leading back to that story where the
moms like no no not for my daughter or
maybe my son okay so we've got some
issues going on there lack of
encouragement and role models you
definitely think of the stereotypical
programmer in a certain way and that's
maybe not what a little girl wants to
grow up and peer like mm-hmm
gender-based marketing and the idea that
tech isn't made for girls excuse me and
then of course societal pressures which
it's not gonna change anytime soon but
we're gonna do the best we can to work
with what we have so I always like to
start off talking about this study and
this was a psychological study done on
ten-year-old boys and girls high IQs and
so this study basically took these
kiddos he's very smart kiddos and
which them with challenging curriculum
and challenging material and they found
this really interesting thing that the
harder the the challenge was the heart
of the curriculum was the more quickly
the boys pursued it and challenged it
and took to it versus the girls the
higher the girls IQ the more quickly she
dropped the challenging material so
what's going on okay we've got kids of
equal intelligence what do what do we
think how do we normally describe girls
when they're like first getting into
school or no okay how do we normally
describe boys when they're like first
getting into school like up to about ten
years old boisterous good word okay well
we'll just go from there where you know
they might be a little more boisterous a
little more rambunctious kind of all
over the place excited passionate full
of life and so they're told hey hey
focus
hey keep working on this hey if you just
pay attention you can get this done
whereas we have girls that at that age
can sometimes mature a little faster and
so they're told oh good job you did so
well you're so smart
you got this right away you're so smart
so so what message is that sending we
art you know we're not doing anything
maliciously but we are giving girls the
idea that intelligence is innate it is
this one level and you've only got this
certain amount of intelligence right and
you've never been encouraged to
challenge or try harder versus the boys
are being told hey focus hey if you pay
attention you can figure this out and so
boys are getting this idea that as long
as they focus as long as they work hard
they can you know figure out any
challenge and when I read this article
it just blew my mind because I was that
girl that I was always very smart I
breezed through school things were not
challenging and then I got to college
and I'm an econ and it's a stupid
subject anyway but I'm balling on the
phone every night to my mother about how
I'm too dumb to be in college because
I'm flunking econ and I don't understand
and I was just wasting money and like I
just needed to come home because I was
too stupid and I had never been
presented with something before that
challenged me I had no idea how to
tackle something that I did
ideally understand and that very much
followed me into my programming career
where if maybe I struggled a little bit
with a concept oh well I'm just not as
smart as those other programmers I just
can't figure it out and then error this
article when I was like oh my god if I
just try a little bit harder I can do
this so I say this to kind of frame one
of those psychological issues that's
going on with girls that can lay into
those challenges that we have getting in
coding let's cycle back to that question
that we asked the kiddos at coderdojo
what was the hardest thing you had to
figure out because again we want to
reinforce that idea that they had a
challenge and they were able to figure
it out and make it work and then they
can go on and take it on the even bigger
challenge next mm-hmm so we talked about
role models does anybody watch Silicon
Valley okay all right yeah this is
Richard losing is losing a over
tabs versus spaces but again this is
kind of what we see is a traditional
programmer and so if you've got a young
woman who is looking for a role model
and see somebody like this I mean the
show is spectacularly entertaining but
this maybe isn't the kind of thing she's
gonna be drawn towards versus you see
maybe like the sexy doctors on Grey's
Anatomy right ooh that looks way more
glamorous and then poor Richard okay
mm-hmm
so it's interesting showing a screenshot
from Reddick because we all know reddit
is a wonderful place and read it as a
horrible place much like the rest of the
Internet
but when we do sometimes market products
that heaven forbid are pink and may be
meant to appeal to girls we see backlash
where people are upset about the idea
that a technology company would have the
audacity to make something pink because
it might make it more inclusive so we're
talking about some more subliminal stuff
when we talk about the messages girls
are getting but here is pretty blatant
no this is our space as you know
men girls don't belong get out this is
us so there are actual people and that's
a message that girls and women are
hearing that they don't deserve to
belong here and that's a very loud
message when it comes through and nasty
comments like that um girls are judged
so harshly on their appearance when you
walked in this room installed me on
stage what did you think about me okay
that's valid um but again like I chose
things for my appearance because I as a
woman as an engineer need to kind of
prove that I deserve to be in the room
so of course I'm wearing minified lodash
on my leggings before anybody asks that
question the woman who created this
these are from a website called naughty
gets calm so they've got a whole bunch
of great content like they have an HTML
tag that's slash mansplaining mm-hmm
they do have like inspir guys too by the
way so if you two would like to model
lodash leggings but I'd contact the
organizer to ask what the code was and
she's like it was just the largest
javascript file on my desktop at the
time and I was like yes anyway okay so
we we judge everyone but women
particularly are expected to fill a
certain image because if I was onstage
and maybe a really fancy dress would be
like she really an engineer like these
kind of things are what we think about
women I'm sure all the women in this
room have had an experience of you walk
into a year's a group and the whiplash
from the next says everybody turns
around they're like oh and you kind of
learn like walk in the room and I'm
really uncomfortable being judged right
now but this is a fact of life this is
not gonna change anytime soon us as a
society
you know we'd love to be altruistic and
work towards this you know ultimate goal
of not judging but that's not going to
happen today so I bring this up because
it plays into the way we need to market
to girls knowing that they're gonna be
judged on their appearance
and helping them emulate the kind of
appearance they want to project her
fitting in society I was super into Star
Wars and it was well I'm still into Star
Wars but in middle school I had to go to
the boys section of the store to find a
star wars t-shirt because why would they
make a Star Wars t-shirt for girls so I
had you know where the where the baggy
thing and you know so that kind of thing
plays into the way I was judged in a
middle school and the kind of things I
dealt with so all these things are
coming together to why drool blots is
amazing so what can we do better how can
we help this situation
okay so jewel bot step one we want
exposure to opportunities so all those
programs I talked about those are the
kind of social engagements and things
where it's like yeah coding is fun that
girls are going to feel comfortable and
like they deserve to be that in that
environment mm-hmm positive
reinforcement we want to encourage hard
work and perseverance we want to be you
know telling them you can make any
challenge happen you you can do anything
you want it you can build it you can
create it the sky is the limit
female role models kind of having some
key people to point girls to or women to
to kind of show them what's not Richard
angry tabs versus spaces mm-hmm
and helping her wardrobe reflect her
empowerment again this is another thing
that toolbox ticks off but we'll go
through some examples as anyone familiar
with Simone Gertz she calls herself the
queen of shitty robots so there are so
many fantastic things about her but
obviously she's a woman in stem building
robots but the fact that the robots are
so terrible it gives it such this
endearing intangible quality right like
it's one thing to look at a woman
working in NASA and she's like working
on a massive rocket and you're like oh
my god I could never do this but when
you're looking at somebody building
crappy robots right that's like really
tangible that's really obtainable
so if yeah I always like to reference
her and there is a more age-appropriate
queen of most wonderfully craptastic
machines so you know you can tone that
down for for the kiddos
but so finding women like her to kind of
show girls the fun side of tech and the
there's a way to just be fun I don't
know if you guys have seen her lipstick
alone where it's like all over her face
yep yep yep so I always like to point
her out so when I talked about having to
shop in the boys section for for Star
Wars shirts it's really amazing that
we've gotten companies that have finally
gotten their together and said oh
we can empower girls instead of giving
them t-shirts that say I'm too pretty to
do math or my brother has to do my
homework for me true story those were
actual t-shirts from like five years ago
so mmm a couple of these the squad Bulls
won in the future coder those are
actually from a local company in Kansas
City called crossing arrows where this
mother her daughter didn't feel like any
of the clothing was representing who she
identified as and so this one was like
okay well I'm gonna launch this awesome
clothing line to give her empowerment
and some of these actually come in adult
women sizes too which is kind of funny
some of the other ones are from Old Navy
and I know it's kind of hard to see the
links but I'll give you guys a slide
after this and you can click through if
you're interested in purchasing some
empowerment gear mm-hmm okay so now now
what we're all ready and waiting for
right jewel BOTS okay so jewel bots are
essentially a programmable robotic
bracelets they are bluetooth enabled so
they can have a very social component
that girls can use to code so they've
got some default functionality but they
are a really great entry point into
starting to write code and having a lot
of fun and because they do connect mmm
doing that social component and sending
super-secret messages at school as far
as I know they're not banned yet I don't
think the school systems have quite
caught on to this like hot tech so so
created by Sara Chipps who did girl
develop it is what she's well known for
and so he spent a lot of time in
in the women in tech space thinking
about the idea of like how do we get
girls how do we get women interested and
engaged in this okay
so program via Arduino has anybody done
Arduino coding before
okay so fair bit of hands in the room so
yeah you can just use the basic IDE
do you know they've launched a cloud
version pretty cool so you can you can
code and upload on the go we're still
trying to figure out how to get ours to
work with Chromebooks but for now
anywhere you can download the IDE on
this is gonna work
use a C++ it's open source and one of
the things that I like to call out is
they do have a really great form but
they have their own documentation and so
kind of this recurring theme I've been
talking about is teaching kids to be the
kind of engineers we want and so what's
so crucial to being a programmer being
an engineer is being able to take a new
look new library or some sort of idea
and then go and read the docs and figure
out how to implement and so it's really
cool to have Jewel lots kind of getting
girls in that mindset from the beginning
so instead of giving her the answers you
can say hey let's go let's go look at
the documentation and figure out how to
do that point her to the docs and equip
her with those tools to problem-solve on
her own hmm
all right so basic set up mm-hmm just
meaning your jewel bot bracelet you can
see my lovely custom strap bracelets
I've done they're programmed via micro
USB they of course give it to you in the
package but if you lose them and does
anybody else have like that big bin at
their house just full like USB cords and
like land cables and like old routers
that you'll never use again but for some
reason you're like but it's my router
from the 90s it's been with me for years
so in case you lose them in there just
micro USB mm-hmm a computer or do we
know IDE and then you just have to do a
little bit of setup and this is kind of
the thing you do once and then forget
about it hmm but we've got a couple
boards that you need to go ahead and add
and then restart your IDE to get those
update
so this is available to paste in from
the slides but it's also available in
their documentation so whatever floats
your canoe all right so the first thing
we're going to talk about is kind of
what the default functionality these
offer because they do have just some
basic settings that you can kind of play
with and that really sets the stage for
when girls want to go in and start
customizing and writing their own code
mm-hmm okay so we're gonna make sure our
firmware is updated which you can do by
just uploading a blank sketch
super simple and I'll show that in a
minute in the demo but that's kind of
your starting point get it updated make
sure it's up to speed in case it was
sitting in the back of a box on a
shipping truck for a long time all right
so jewel box work best with friends I
need two friends okay so you guys you
guys are gonna come up in demo I did
this demo last week and uh and jeonse
came up to demo and he's like trying to
get it on and I'm like oh crap I made
this from a like teeny tiny girl wrist
but this works out okay so I've got the
instructions behind you so this is gonna
take a moment to figure out so in jewel
box we have a specific counting time so
when we have to count a number we do
one-mississippi two-mississippi and i
don't know if that translates well just
cuz it's a state in the United States
and it takes a long time so you're
playing hide-and-go-seek like to make
sure people aren't like what do you
three four five six okay I'm gonna come
find you
you're like one Mississippi two
Mississippi okay so when we talk about
holding the magic button down for two
seconds we go one Mississippi two
Mississippi okay so the first thing you
guys are gonna do is press the button
once in the middle just kind of press
down and you'll feel it click oh yeah
okay so it's lighting up your tool that
is now on yeah super exciting all right
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
put these in pairing mode and you guys
are going to become friends with each
other with your jewel BOTS okay so
you're gonna hold the magic button down
for two seconds
one-mississippi two-mississippi all
right let go and then yep you're gonna
get the cerulean okay you're blinking
you need to try it again so she's got
some yeah okay so they've got these
blinking cerulean lights which means
they are now in pairing mode and so one
of them should start cycling different
colors and so I always budget extra time
for this cuz you never know how
temperamental they're gonna be try
clicking yours once is that kind of
started cycling no okay put yours back
into pairing mode oh there goes what we
are waiting to happen is start cycling
colors and so they're I don't know if
I've had that issue before but these
little start cycling the light colors
and then they can choose their different
friendship color and so what happens is
you compare the different jewel-box
together so they could like choose the
color red and they would be red friends
and then if we paired we could be blue
friends okay so now her colors are
cycling so it's gonna go through
cerulean red green or blue so you guys
can choose your friendship color so
decide which one you want and then when
it's on that light color okay there you
go all right so she chose cyan so give
it a moment and you guys should both
start blinking cyan
yeah press the middle button see if
it'll okay we're gonna turn it off and
turn it back on so to turn it off you're
gonna hold down for five Mississippi's
wait is it did that put it in a pairing
mode yep off okay now turn it back on
and what should happen is you should be
paired it should light up cerulean to
let you know that your cerulean did you
buzz no oh okay that should let you know
that your cerulean friend is nearby
because you're lit up cerulean all right
let me see let me see if we can be
friends maybe you guys weren't meant to
be friends
[Laughter]
okay oh shoot I don't
this is currently has one of my custom
sketches uploaded onto it so let me put
it in friendship pairing mode real quick
so we can actually be friends pairing
mode
all right shall I shall I try and pair
again yeah see what happens if yours
goes into pairing mode because what
should happen is it should cycle colors
that you don't have paired with yet okay
I think you turned it off okay while
they play and figure out their jewel
BOTS and then once we get paired we can
send messages which is super fun okay mm
I will show you guys what it is like to
get these working so mm-hmm
here I've got my micro USB and you can
see I've got this backwards okay if I
can figure out okay there we go all
right so mm-hmm
when I go ahead and plug this in I need
to set it into uploading mode and so
we're gonna mm-hmm because I figure out
my camera I'm backwards okay so to put
into upload modes we hold down to missus
Sippi one Mississippi two Mississippi
and we're gonna get a magenta kind of
flash if you guys can see that color
it's not great and we are now in upload
mode so I am going to go into Arduino so
we already downloaded those boards that
we wanted and so mine is currently in
solo coding mode but I want to go ahead
and reset it back to the factory state
so I can pair and try and figure out our
friendships mm-hmm so I'm just going to
upload a bank sketch can you see that
okay where I'm in my factory firmware
update mode alright I've got my blink
sketch I am going to make sure that I
have my serial port selected for my
jewel box and then we'll go ahead and
upload this blank sketch and that should
put mine into friendship mode so I can
try and pair with them hmm so you have
to set the different modes on the jewel
bot to change between what's going on
alright so did you guys get yours
figured out that's not charged enough
from last night so if you've never used
the Arduino before this is kind of the
basic set up where you're gonna write
your code obviously this is just a very
blank sketch that we're using to reset
the jewel bot and you'll get some
messaging down here and there might be
weird error messages they aren't really
valid but once it's uploaded it will say
specifically this this has been uploaded
so we'll give that a minute okay alright
yep or sending so once we do have all
our jewel box paired and we want to
start to send messages mm-hmm
to send messages we're gonna click our
button once to put it in a messaging
mode very much like the pairing mode
it'll start to circle and so all your
friends are in Bluetooth range of the
different colors those colors will start
to cycle
and so let's say you're like oh hi my
green friend is here I want to message
my green friend when it's cycling on the
green light you'll click the green or
you'll click the button and then you'll
give the button to press to send a buzz
to them so once we're paired we'll be in
good all right so it says device program
so we are good to go to Mississippi all
right so I'm in pairing mode now so try
putting years into pairing mode okay
okay all right you're cycling yeah sweet
okay pick a friendship color for us blue
I'll put mine under here for the wow
factor
yeah all right so we're now paired yes
okay so we were blue friends yeah mm-hmm
looks like I also have old cerulean
friends and blue I've got lots of
friends on this one okay so do you want
to send me a message yeah here I'll
trade you we can be substitute friends
all right and I'll see about uploading
this one
okay so you've got it selected for
message so if you hold down one missus
oh so click it and it'll start cycling
the colors okay
okay and so you've got a green selected
so hold down like a one-mississippi or
you might have to send it oh okay yeah
so send it on the blue so click it again
it'll start cycling maybe it takes it
takes the a bit to get the timing down
but again this is the fun part of the
process let go so it should give you a
long bus okay normally there's a bit
more about alright so you guys can take
a seat for a moment and practice buzzing
each other if you would like okay so
that is we just kind of walk through the
default functionality obviously it takes
a little bit of practicing to kind of
get your timing down so you can press
and you can send it different lengths
buzzes when you're messaging your
friends you can send a short buzz or a
long buzz but this is kind of cool so
you can get the girls excited and kind
of like creating their own messages and
our languages sending their super
discreet buzzes from there super cool
tech toys that the teachers don't know
about in school because they are
bluetooth they work in range from each
other so it's like one of you was to
like go in the other conference room cuz
you got really bored of this talk when
you guys met each other in the hallway
your lights would sync up and so it
would let you know which friends are
near and buzz mm-hmm we did test this
cuz I did this talk a couple months ago
my friend like ran down the hallway to
test see how far you'd go before we'd
come in and out of range so basic
default functionality so let's go ahead
and look at the API again really cool
product because the way they've
documented it in the way they've written
in API it's very much in line
what we use as full-time programmers so
going back to doing that mmm idea of
getting girls in the mindset of reading
documentation reading an API kind of
understanding what's going on and how to
start using technology in that regard
hmm so the first thing to know about the
Joule BOTS is kind of the way they align
so we've got four different LED lights
that we're gonna be working with and
lighting up and they've mapped out kind
of this compass and then it's always
going to go with the microUSB at the
bottom so we're gonna have our north
west north east south east south west
and so that's how we're gonna target the
different LEDs we've got a couple of
different light options so these are the
default colors that are available to us
with the yet red yellow green cyan blue
magenta and white you do not have all
these colors available for the default
friendship pairing only only four of
those mm but that's one of the cool
limitations that we can go and say oh
but what what if what if I want to have
magenta friends that's kind of code we
can go in and start customizing mm-hmm
okay so super basic for dealing with our
LEDs we've got all these different
methods where we can turn on just a
single one we can turn on all of them we
can turn off one or we've got this kind
of cool flash which is gonna do just
kind of a blink mm-hmm so really cool
thing about this is it's not very
complicated so it's not super
intimidating to a first-time programmer
who's gonna kind of look at this and
they're gonna see this and say LED turn
on single I bet that turns on a single
LED so very readable to English speakers
anyway to kind of figure out what's
going on we've got a couple different
animations that are set from the default
so we can do a rainbow we can do the
jewel box logo or we can do a breeze
single color which is kind of cool that
Odle kind of fade in and out instead of
just like a harsh blink it'll it'll do
more of a little custom animation so
different different things that girls
can play with that being said I haven't
seen a lot of them do the default
animations they normally want to like
code and figure out their own stuff hmm
so when we get to our buzzers we've got
um some really really complex methods
here we've got an extra short buzz
medium buzz a really long buzz and a
custom buzz yeah so again not very
complicated on the surface but pretty
unintimidating for a new programmer to
kind of figure out what's going on and
then with the custom buzz exploring that
idea of oh well okay I can start to set
what I want with these different
parameters right so there's our buzzer
functionality and then when it comes to
using what they call the magic button
which is that button in the middle
you're pressing these are the different
ways you can initialize so a button
presses just like our basic button press
like when we were choosing a friendship
light that was cycling button press long
is our two Mississippi and then I find
it really helpful if you want to be
testing your code while it's plugged
into your computer mm-hmm you can do it
charging button press and so that way
you can sit there and test it while it's
plugged in like you've just got it in
the mail and you're really excited you
rip up the package and oh no it's not
charged and so that way you can play
with it right away so another cool thing
we can do is if we want our run loop to
go ahead and execute while we're
charging in our setup we can go ahead
and do set run loop charging so these
are things that I found is I was kind of
playing around in coding that just
helped me get the process set up and
these are the kind of things that you
can help lead the girls into to make
sure that they're not getting frustrated
early on so they can test their code
right away if you want to go ahead and
allow Arduino code and do kind of like
if-else statements super easy to just
set Arduino coding when we look through
the API fairly limited right you is a
program where you're like okay that's
not a lot going on well the really cool
thing about Jul bots is is by creating
those boundaries the girls are gonna hit
those boundaries and be like but I want
it to do more I want it to do this and
all of a sudden we have a future
programmer you're bringing me water here
my hero thank you
hmm so I love by the the fact that
because it's so limited it's kind of
encouraging girls who as soon as they
start exploring as soon as they start
creating they really have a concept of
what they want to make happen and
because they can't do it based on the
API then they start exploring then
they're like well what can the Arduino
do okay well how do I take it a step
further how do I do this but I want it
to do this and all the sudden you got
somebody inspired and hungry to create
and that's exactly what we want
hmm okay so when we were in friendship
coding mode these are a couple of our
different ones we can see our red
friends our green friends our blue
friends or our cyan friends and so when
you've got those functions that's when
your friends come into Bluetooth range
those are continuously going to run so
that's kind of when you into the
friendship coding mode how that's going
to work hmm okay so we do a little code
we kind of already uploaded a blank
sketch so you guys saw what that looks
like so the biggest thing that you'll
probably run into is when you are doing
this if you don't put it into upload
mode it's gonna give you an error and so
that's just kind of a thing to keep in
mind but again we like making mistakes
because that's how we learn so I'm gonna
put it into upload mode for to
Mississippi all right so I've got kind
of that magenta light going on all right
I'm good to upload and then I've just
got a super basic sketch that I created
that's gonna circle some lights around
so I'm gonna make sure that I have my
port selected so I've got my serial port
and I want to go into solo coding mode
because I'm just going to write code for
myself because I'm lonely now that my
friends have left me second
yes anybody know if you can see my
Arduino mmm okay there we go
not that there's anything remotely
interesting going on in this sketch I
promise you like go go check out the
forums with the six-year-old girls are
doing or way more interesting to me this
is just the demo purposes but okay so
we've got our sketch ready to go I'm
gonna upload it mmm so speaking of
badass little girl is writing cooler
code than me while we wait on that
sketch to compile
mm-hmm this is Ellie Ellie does YouTube
tutorials on how to do cool stuff with
jewel BOTS she's a lot cuter than I am
so we'll listen everything you need to
know to combine your own color for geo
bot these are of the colors we can use
but what if we want to use a different
one go to Arduino first we're gonna
write Lloyd set all right I'm gonna
pause Ellie real quick because my jewel
bot just buzzed and let me know that the
sketch is uploaded and so now you can
see that I've got mm-hmm I can get my
camera to focus okay I've got these
lights cycling around so super basic
sketch there okay so that's as simple as
a product it or the product is it's just
uploading your sketch getting that going
on and kind of starting to play a rap I
can get this camera okay so the really
cool thing is when you look through this
code to figure out like how I'm
targeting the different lights this is
where you can get the girls excited and
starting to map out and kind of think
programmatically okay well if I want it
to go around in a circle I'm gonna turn
it off on here oh but then I have to
turn it off and then light up the next
one and so really visual really tangible
ways to get girls excited about what's
going on and in understanding the power
they have to control that okay and we
have about 13 minutes left so if you
would like to see more sketches I I did
this speaker timer that's super fun
because normally I do like 60-minute
talks and so I read I wrote a timer that
I set the button with a press and then
for every 10 minutes it's going to buzz
at me to let me know what's going on and
then it's gonna blink however many
increments into that that time I am so
it'll blink once at 10 minutes twice it
20 minutes and that kind of thing so
this is where you can use a little more
interesting code with mmm you know more
programmatic concepts like doing a for
loop and kind of engaging girls and
using math and and doing all that kind
of thing to explore these different
ideas there's a really popular Joule bot
sketch right now called catch the
Leprechaun that was all the raids and
the duel bot storms a couple months ago
where you play a game where you have to
click on the green leprechaun light fast
enough to catch him so if we go and take
a look at jewel box calm here is where
we're gonna go to here's where we're
gonna go to kind of see what's going on
so this is going to give
you the basics of how to turn off an on
your jewel bot how to charge em hmm
our code setup so when I was showing you
guys those those sketches if you don't
want to get them for my slides
everything's available here and so this
is where we're gonna introduce some
really basic concepts where the girls
can kind of read through here getting
understanding play with the jewel bots
know what's going on but this way you
don't have to be there holding her hand
to figure everything out you the pointer
and be like oh let's go find this in the
documentation what do we want to do okay
we're coding solo I want to find out how
to do a buzz we can go through and start
looking at the buzz documentation and
figure out what's going on so that is
the basic overview of kind of their
documentation the way they have
everything set up they do have a couple
different troubleshooting issues here a
lot of it is just getting that
one-mississippi two-mississippi
countdown right so if you go and take a
look at the forums this is Ellie who is
a obviously top contributor on the jewel
BOTS forums but so she's talking about
how she figured out how to make a pink
light and so she's posted her code here
for other people to try so it's really
cool to see the girls engaging in that
kind of way showing off their projects
they have an ambassador program where
you can kind of get more involved get
some updates and and help build the
jewel BOTS community so all sorts of
different opportunities in here for the
girls to engage with you know other
girls online doing this get excited
again that social component is really
really key to getting girls excited
feeling like this is an acceptable hobby
it's very clearly made and built for
that
hmm okay so before we wrap up I want to
go through a couple of Jennifers rules
of mentoring so these are just some kind
of rules I've created and especially
when you're an engineer you just want to
like two hands on the keyboard oh let me
do that let me do that do not do that so
first of all keep your hands off the
keyboard and you'll be surprised how
quickly kiddos will pick up keyboard
commands so teach them command ass-like
teach them those different things and
you'll tell them once and then they'll
just retain it and it's kind of
mind-blowing
so feel free to teach them any ways that
you would do things ways to optimize but
keep your hands off the keyboard mm-hmm
let her make mistakes and so this is
really key so if let's say I forgot to
put my jewel bot into upload' mode when
I was uploading my sketch it's gonna
give an error well instead of correcting
her right away and being like oh did you
put that in upload mode let her see the
error and let her read there and think
hmm what what did we do wrong in this
process kind of help her start that
troubleshooting pathway of figuring out
okay this didn't quite work right what
are the possible things that could have
led to that don't give her the answer
help her find that I feel like I've
harped on this a lot with going to the
documentation kind of starting to build
that mindset I know it's really easy cuz
like as programmers we want to like show
off how smart we are and know the answer
and be really helpful but the most
helpful thing we can do is teach the
kiddos how to find their own solutions
teacher out of the read documentation
talked about creating diagrams of the
ideas kind of starting to map out oh I
want to light up this LED and then this
LED and then I want it to buzz so
perfectly fine to start diagramming on
pen and paper maybe help her be more of
a plotter than a pantser myself being a
super Panther I'm like oh all right all
the code okay why does it work let me
figure it out and then be patient again
like I feel like us as programmers are
like oh my god you could do it so much
faster this way or like have you ever
been trying to help somebody and then
you tell them to Google something and
they go to google.com and then they go
to the box and then they type in their
query and you're like anyway be patient
teach be very patient mm-hmm okay so
ongoing learning resources obviously get
involved in the jewel apps forums there
have been some really cool STEM
subscription boxes so everybody familiar
with the subscription box concept like
sometimes if we get like beauty stuff or
socks for guys so tinker crate in bits
box or two cool ones
little bits are kind of more
programmable components that you can
start to put together to get engaged in
coding and then of course I talked about
different ways to start clubs start kind
of community movements to help
teach programming to kids women girls
whoever you think wants to learn to code
because we all need more engineers
mm-hmm
my slides are available here so you can
pull those from github whatever you need
does anyone have any questions he's
gonna come around with a mic is there a
scratch plugin for coding my daughter
yeah she doesn't speak English yet
mm-hmm so there would be a big barrier
to start I guess yeah so there is not
necessarily a scratch plugin but this is
open source so if you would like to
translate Yule Lads into your language
you could definitely submit a PR to them
and be like hey can we get this
translated so yes there's this other
open-source project called our new
blockly which is blockly it's like
scratch but made by Google on top of
Arduino so I don't know if it works with
this one but it works if this is a
generic or do we know right so I think
art you could try to see if our new
blockly works out which is not exactly
scratch but this is a blow based
interface that also also translatable to
other languages okay have a great rest
of your day you lovely humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
