seven of you seven teacher can't add
nice isn't it teaching our young people
um so I guess I should start off with a
little bit of an introduction because I
probably need to do that here because
I'm new to this space and it's really
fantastic to come and speak to all seven
of you because I think it's really nice
to make a connection between education
and the things that you guys are making
and how that might play out in a space
where people are actually using the
things that that you bring to our kind
of community and in my role as a teacher
I get to work with students that are
four years old all the way through to
hire EDD so I've got a really broad
spectrum of people that I work with in a
consulting role as well as my own
classroom which is its in Hilda's on the
Gold Coast so I'm a bit of a nerd and
I'm always interested in particular
looking at the trends the things that
are happening in the future but with
education things that are happening now
have sort of this interesting tension
between future driven education and what
our students need now is kind of where
teachers are always looking so it's been
a big year and things seemed to be
getting bigger and smaller all the time
for us in it but if we stop thinking as
much about devices and applications and
more about learning I think in general
or on the right track so today out of
everything that I'm going to tell you
I'm going to talk about that word
learning a lot so it's going to
transcend the technology kind of spiel
and it's going to really be about things
bigger than hardware and software
because what I live and breathe is
supporting students now as I said I am a
real teacher I think that's important to
say from the get-go because when I
talked to teachers about education that
comforts them when I talk to them about
technology they're comforted by the fact
that i actually do stand in front of
actual real little people there's
sometimes a bit of a disconnect between
our worlds and I'm finding more and more
that people who come to the education
space are doing a really heavy sell on
the education market and even that term
market has I guess a lot of pressure
points within it in a space where you're
talking about young children so you know
in the workshops that I do in terms of
selling apps and really I guess
giving educators opportunities to engage
with products and practices that will
work for them I'm constantly trying to
connect teachers to their roots to the
idea that developers have wonderful
things that they can offer in terms of
perspectives but that their perspectives
will of course always be valued as well
and so it's a conversation I guess
rather than one way traffic and that's
probably what it's going to be today too
so this is not going to be one-way
traffic from me if you don't want it to
be I can stand here and being on about
kids all day long believe me I love
those little people but it's probably
going to be much more fun if you laugh
along with the stupid memes that I've
got for you and you really kind of
construct your understanding along the
way so feel free to cringe and shout out
and interrupt it's all good okay as long
as you put your hand up yeah see the
jokes won't get any better I hope you
understand that i really do this whole
slide deck is just scratched up with
memes i've been really kind of conscious
of the idea that it's three o'clock on a
friday and you guys are doing really
well to be here and to have your brain
intact at this point so there are some
really hard bits of data that underpin
what I've got for you here and if you'd
like the attributions and the research
notes for those I'm happy to give them
to you if you send me an email and we'll
talk about that at the end but really
there's not a test at the end of this
it's about tools so it's the thought
provoking stuff that we're really
interested in today and we're going to
start with teachers because I think it's
really important to know who's actually
teaching our kids so that you know where
you can connect and where you might find
some really informative kind of points
of contact so I guess I want to start
with a negative and then try and leave
that behind because I'm generally a very
positive can-do kind of person the sad
thing is in teaching we have more
teachers exiting the profession who have
spent less time actually doing the job
than they did training for the job I'll
say that again we have at the end of
five years if you can imagine this more
than forty seven percent attrition in
our role and that's a really really
scary thing the fact that people can
actually train for a job that they then
spend less time doing than they did
training for is a scary thing now
there's a whole lot of reasons for that
data and accountability or two of the
big ones and the third is the idea that
technology is putting a lot of pressure
on our teachers and I'm just going to
keep saying the term technology but it's
incorporating all of those things like
meaningful ways of using devices
constructing new curriculum that really
leverage the devices that we have access
to and I guess training facilities
schools and communities really trying to
analyze what the benefits are for the
students and being responsive to those
sorts of roles and as I said I'm usually
a very positive person because I'm on
the side of students and that's where
our teaching staff are too they don't
come to the profession for the money
let's be real about that there are
opportunities elsewhere for a lot of
these very talented people that would be
quite different but what they do is get
really excited about what they can
provide our kids and it doesn't mean
that they don't see that there's
challenges when they enter the
profession but often they're really not
aware of what they might be and how
that's going to work so when it actually
comes time to have those precious
holidays that we do all really enjoy we
often find now that our teachers are
trying to make up the time and a lot of
our professional development is actually
being situated in the holidays and bit
by bit the holidays that we do have
access to actually being pulled back
it's interesting because there's a
window of opportunity here for
developers because even though there are
so many other tools that we have access
to again the uptake in our classroom is
very slow and we haven't seen a lot of
significant changes in education as far
as I'm concerned I mean what you're
looking at here is a classroom that's
you know old and gray look at that kind
of miserable kind of slide isn't that
awful but then this is something that's
very much the reality of today too and I
don't know if you'll see many more
smiling faces there's a few but
essentially we're still sitting in rows
looking at the sage on the stage out in
front and I guess you'll see what I'm
saying and kids they've always been kids
as well I really feel like most of the
time our kids have not changed despite
the rhetoric and the advertising I
remember fist pumping when that video
got rolled in you know what I'm talking
about right it was exciting when you saw
that thing happening and you knew you
didn't really have to do much work that
period and yet the heating on kids for
using technology and appropriately or
for opting out of stuff at the moment is
quite outrageous I believe I'm on site
of kids I told you that right so let's
talk about the ideal teacher for a
moment as we sort of shaped this
conversation that we're going to have
because there are some things that come
naturally to really good teachers
they're usually people that have a
calling to the profession the burning
desire to help little people and care is
definitely a word that I would use to
describe people that choose to put
themselves into situations where they're
charged with you know beating the NAPLAN
data and cleaning up wien vomit on a
daily basis sometimes I pick up devices
and feel like I need another tetanus
shot just for touching that thing
looking at what's on the screen so it's
it's a big job right where you're caring
for people that are going through all
kinds of life experiences deaths in
their family and your supervisors are
looking over the percentage improvement
that your kids are having in your maths
classroom so some big challenges I've
got to say that despite people coming to
the profession for the main reason being
care the understanding that teachers
have when they walk into a classroom
about all of the diversity that comes
with in that role is really late coming
in the education process so sometimes
our teachers are only having an
experience in the classroom in year
three of their journey through
University which again means that it's
really difficult to attract the right
people once they're at year three the
idea that they might pull out at that
point that's a really big thing when
you've invested three years of your life
to get to that point so we've probably
got to do better at actually getting
people to understand when they sign up
for this job what it means and perhaps
advertising and being an advocate for
the fantastic opportunities that there
are in education because I never
imagined when I started teaching and
university technology for me was using
email and that was it then I'd be
traveling the world talking to you know
teachers administrators community about
large-scale deployments that are worth
over a million dollars in a classroom
teaching role that was never something
that
I imagined was going to be possible so
let's have a look at what our learners
might need because this is where we
start to hone in a little bit more on
what it is that you guys might be able
to provide for us the 21st century
learner is kind of a bit of terminology
a bit of jargon that we like to throw
around at schools because it helps us to
unpack the things that are embedded in
our curriculum but perhaps the things
that really need a bit of an explosion
around them as well we're all very
familiar with the three hours we're
really familiar i guess in this era of
high-stakes testing that there are
certain things that are tangible that we
know our students need but some of the
things that really represent what our
employers want and what the future kind
of marketplace for our little employees
are going to demand really is better
represented with some of the skills like
is open to change and that's a challenge
for teachers when kind of building a
curriculum how do you actually support
that and then measure the success of
your programs and one of the things
that's sort of popping up quite
obviously is that there's a very direct
relationship between technology and of
course the needs of the 21st century
learner it's a no brainer to us in the
room because we're sold on this because
we live it every day just by being here
you're a part of that journey but
different players in this game or at
different points along that journey so
some heavy stuff right so you need
another meme I do with this kind of
level of technology understanding i
guess on a day-to-day basis because our
teaching communities diverse and it's
very easy to get frustrated at times i
know sometimes there's a smile on my
face that may have a little edge to it
but the reality is if you've missed one
step along the way on this journey it
can be really really difficult to get
back on track because of the rate of
change the incredible rapid uptake that
we kind of need to be on board with to
keep on track we have left a lot of
people behind and there are people in
our profession who have really fantastic
experience in a whole variety of areas
outside of technology but who didn't
move into that space quickly enough and
and now find it a real
struggle to to bring much to the table
when it comes to those 21st century
skills we just had a look at so we need
to be able to learn new things as
students and we have a shared
responsibility as teachers to do that
too and I think that for teachers as it
is perhaps for everybody including
developers we need to know that it's
okay if a very small person actually
knows something more than us as a much
bigger person and partnership is key
here so less of me telling you you're
doing it wrong more of you being able to
find out the right answers yourself or
even perhaps revelation that there are
more than one solutions to a problem or
that maybe perspective is actually the
key so if it sounds utopian we are
chipping away at it right and you guys
can help because even though I get
frustrated there are lots of us who
believe in this idea so what do you
really know about how ed tech is working
in the classroom what do you know about
how we use apps and devices and what do
you know about the difference this is
super important between entertaining
kids and actually educating them
engaging them giving them a voice
helping them to feel empowered so to
start that thinking process now I want
you to have a think a little bit of a
think about the history of educational
technology because it's a weird one
right there are stops and they're starts
but the main things that I think stand
out for me the idea that our first
public education worldwide was only
really available in 1651 that's a bit of
a freak out for me and in fact the whole
idea of that kind of educational
structure where kids sat in rows and
we're learning to actually kind of
produce something at the end of their
education that hasn't really changed in
all of that time the goals of education
are really not much different in terms
of being able to read and to write and
to add and subtract the first modern
pencil this is important came about in
eighteen sixty eight and you're talking
about 1977 as the first pcs coming into
the classroom Australia actually had the
very first one to one laptop program did
you know that big deal really big deal
and that was in 1979 so really quickly
we moved from
77 you know really early adopter kind of
deal to train a mainstream access for
everybody in a classroom two years later
so that kind of rapid uptake I think is
important to note because if you look at
where we are now all these years later
we still don't bloody well have
one-to-one access for kids in classrooms
and the idea of BYOD or bring your own
device is still in a state of absolute
tension and i'll talk more about that in
a minute but what you had in 89 if I
fast forward another 10 years there for
you is a ratio of one computer between
18 students in only about twenty percent
of schools worldwide and we are still at
that same ratio today the world has got
bigger the access hasn't increased in
the classroom when you look at K through
2 12 so the ratios and who has it and
what they have are completely different
and I can't show you graphs on that
because they look like someone has just
thrown up on a screen they make no sense
unless you do some serious data analysis
because of the different ways that
economies have worked globally because
of the different pressures and products
that have impacted on our schools and so
I guess what you're really looking at
now when it all comes down to the data
is that still only about fifty four
percent of students in classes that are
grades six through twelve have daily
access to technology as part of their
curriculum okay so that doesn't mean
they don't have a device they may have
their own but only about half of our
students are getting access to
technology based curriculum each day so
to me that's a big problem you think
you're thinking I'm right no you're just
staring at me yeah come on get on board
right so here we are technologies has
had a few problems long life for us in
schools for a lot of teachers the
conceptualization of technology is
Google was something that we had to
fight against the idea that a computer
would no more than a teacher was really
really frightening for people who spent
their life trying to you know feel like
they actually had knowledge to impart on
children this was a really big game
changer and I guess also understanding
that for some students the way that we'd
always done it in the
it was successful was not actually going
to suit students was a challenge because
the idea was well if I know how it can
be done you should get on board with it
that's that's something that's really
changing now as we move to
personalization and individualization
and you'll start to hear those words
that really mesh with technology
integration popping out now it's really
all about mobile this is the biggest
single trend in education that's
affected the way that we teach in the
classroom BYOD is happening as much as
possible so that concept to bring your
own device is really desirable in school
structures where they can't afford to
roll out one to one access for all of
their students it's a really nice thing
to think that your kids can bring their
own stuff and then your teachers can
utilize it but can you see some problems
with that utopian idea right the kids
who have access to things have the
advantage in whole different
socio-economic zones you're going to
find that some have advantages over
others and you're also going to find
incredible and we do find incredible
stress on our teachers because they have
to find ways to deliver the curriculum
really meaningfully to people who have
all manner of things from a mobile phone
to an iPad to a Chromebook to a four
thousand dollar Mac it's really really
tough stuff I don't have my iPad today
you know I've broken my Mac and I don't
have access if we don't provide the
things these challenges become really
really problematic so if we want to
leverage the power of the device that
our kids do have have with them then
most of the time it's actually going to
be through their mobile phone because
that's the one that they carry around
with them all the time now and we're
finding that most of the time in state
schools where we are not in the lowest
of the socio-economic bracket all of the
students have mobile phones almost with
almost to the one by the time they're 14
years old it's highly unusual for kids
in state school systems now that over 14
years old not to have a mobile phone
with them so that's where we are and
it's probably no good arguing about
whether that's a good or bad thing
because it is what it is right and so
talking to teachers about how to use
that rather than block the hell out of
them
kind of an interesting proposition
because that was our natural way of
thinking and if you look at some of the
classrooms that I've taught in Asia
they've got some really amazing kind of
constructs for dealing with this one of
them is charging / phone jails where the
students walk into the room for students
will have a number and they put their
mobile phone in their little pocket that
corresponds with their number and that's
where it has to stay for the whole time
that classes on and you know kids being
kids don't you love them they have fake
phones that they put into those pockets
so that they can have the burner sitting
out there doing nothing and of course
teachers being teachers realize that
this is happening and there's this
marvelous thing where they actually
asked them for the second one or ring
their numbers and spend ridiculous
amounts of time at the start of the
session actually checking to see that
the phone is for reals we're a part of
course the students buy another one get
a second line and go to an incredible
amount of effort just to be able to
carry their mobile phone on them it's
fabulous this is one of my favorite
things ever this is the cell block this
is a jail essentially for mobile phones
so that our students come into the
classroom they can put it into the cell
block and if you'd really like to make
your own it's on Pinterest so you can
create this beautiful thing for your own
classroom I love it but so many teachers
aren't like that there's a lot of
Mythology about who behaves in which way
and how that all plays out and at the
end of the day we're really breaking
through mobile technology is
mainstreaming in classrooms and thank
God it's been a long time so considering
our curriculum is supposed to be
responsive to the needs of behaviors of
our students it's only natural that our
curriculum is starting to become
designed to take advantage of these
tools that our kids have we've got a new
curriculum coming in Australia as you
might be aware but this is a very
general model that you're seeing here on
the screen that represents most
curriculum so I would now suggest across
the world the idea that all teachers are
actually teachers of ICT or information
communication technology is a pretty big
deal so your art teacher your math
teacher your science teacher they are
all charged with the responsibility of
incorporate
ICT into their classroom now for some of
us we've been fist pumping about this
because it brings us all into this you
know together pneus thing just like an
art teacher would correct spelling on an
essay it makes sense to me that all
teachers would be using technology in
their curriculum I can't think of a
single subject area and I've had people
push back on me about HP and I've burned
them about how fantastic digital
technology can be in that space of
physical exercise but you know really
it's taken a very long time for us to
all hold hands and do this in terms of
the curriculum but it's still absolutely
not happening in our schools and again I
think that's a challenge and an
opportunity for you guys because in
providing the right tools the right
access the right conditions for our
students to be creative across the
curriculum that's something that you can
think about this is another model that
has a lot of currency in our world at
the moment this is the sama model that
you're looking at and if you look at the
acronym it's coming from substitution
orientation modification and
redefinition and what it's trying to do
for teachers is really unpack the idea
that if we substitute one tool for
another so something that wouldn't be
considered technology with something
that is then we may be making no change
in the learning outcome for the student
so for example if I asked you to write
an essay on a computer and the task
would have been exactly the same if you
wrote it on paper it may really be the
exact same task perhaps if you're using
spellcheck then you're starting to take
it to augmentation so that tool that
spell checking is for you really upping
the standard of the product that you've
been able to produce but again perhaps
not changing the learning because if you
don't understand or really take on board
the corrections then it might really be
doing nothing in terms of that change
state for the learning the best place in
classrooms at the moment as far as this
model is kind of championing are in this
top column is top row sorry where we're
looking at redefinition that's where
we're challenging teachers to use
technology to bring things to the
students that were possibly
inconceivable opportunities for learning
where they're doing things that could be
done through no other analog tool we're
starting to talk
about things like socially working with
other students in different countries
across skype playing different games
where they create real worlds around
themselves where they can actually meet
other students and talk about things
within those environments the idea is
that the task is hard to create and you
may not want to do this all the time
because the effort is pretty high in
terms of level but that the reward is
great and that you're really leveraging
technology for something that's
meaningful so this takes a lot to unpack
with teachers because it sounds hard and
it often is hard and so the key in this
space is training and this is where it
gets really difficult because quite
often even though you know you're
dealing with deployments in hundreds of
thousands of dollars for hardware and
perhaps even for software the spend on
professional learning for teachers is
very very low often for teachers limited
to one or two staff days at best in a
year even though the time that they
would be spending with the students on
technology or using technology is
incremental e increasing so it's an
interesting thing the teachers who are
really embracing technology to their
students you might want to know a little
bit about them because these are the
people you might want to connect with
their the people that research and by
technology to try out and they usually
do that with their own money which is a
really interesting thing they're often
guided by the things that they are
already using or the things that their
children are already using which is a
challenge and an asset both in itself
because often their early adopters of
things they bring their interest to the
table with the students and that has a
wonderful authenticity but it's also
probably going to mean that if you want
teachers to try things out you're going
to have to try to hook them in get them
to want to use it themselves and
possibly give it to them for free
because they're not going to be able to
buy it with their school budget if you
want to get them to see which tools work
for their students you're also probably
going to have to give it to them for
free because they certainly won't be
able to buy 30 or 60 or 90 sets of
whatever that tool is teachers are
constantly facing budget restraints but
the bigger difficulty is not the cash
the bigger difficulty is that for
teachers who apply to actually buy
things they have to show
it's going to make a measurable
improvement in the outcomes for their
teaching and learning now how do you do
that if you never use something before
how do you do that if you've got
something that you want to try out
something that may actually fail and to
be honest a lot of times things fail
when you're moving from the cutting edge
to the bleeding edge and back again in
education things get messy because we're
talking about students we're not talking
about people who have time to waste and
kids who you know have a minute to spare
the teachers that you probably want to
collect with they're probably also going
to be looking at what their colleagues
are using and they're going to be doing
that globally in America the number one
way that teachers connect with other
teachers that they previously haven't
networked it in through is through
Twitter okay in Australia it's a
different story we really look at
facebook for interactions and closed
LMSs that work within our school
environments but visiting conferences is
starting to become a thing in education
that's really a new space but it's
developing all the time so if you want
to connect with one of these sorts of
teachers you're going to have to be
looking in spaces that are a little bit
outside of trying to get at them through
their staff room mailboxes as was the
past now when we look at wise teachers
will actually choose to use a particular
tool there's three three reasons that
they identify themselves and you're
looking at the idea that they can adapt
it to produce a diverse learning
experience for their students so in
other words they want things that they
can have personalized the learning for
their students in most classes now in
state school systems you're looking at a
huge variety of learning needs across
that spectrum and often a four-year
level stretch of abilities so teachers
have got real challenges when they try
to meet the needs of that diverse
population so if the technology the
product the app can suit a really
diverse space then you're probably on to
something another thing that they're
really looking at in their top three is
that it boosts student motivation or in
other words is engaging and enhancing
the material that's already being taught
is a big factor that you'll want to
connect with them on so if they can see
that it's actually going to bring
something extra to the table for them
outside of what they were previously
able to do
you might get by in ninety-one percent
of your teachers have access to
computers in their classroom but those
are still often old desktops and that's
a bit of a revelation to a lot of people
but when we see surveys about about
technology usage you're often looking at
really crumbling old Dells in the corner
of the room and there's usually two or
three or four of them at any given time
half of those are broken that landscape
is a very challenging one as I said and
it's a reason why BYOD OD really appeals
only one in five teachers feel that they
have the right access to devices in
their classes so that's a huge challenge
for us that means that eighty percent of
our students aren't being facilitated in
the way that our teachers want them to
be our tech leaders think a little bit
differently I'm sure you find that
revelation airy I just make up words all
the time like that because it just blows
my mind that we have this big disconnect
three out of four schools in Australia
are still purchasing devices for
students but at the same time sixty-four
percent of those same people have a
clear vision for BYOD in the next two
years so if you let that process for a
minute that's a really interesting thing
so they're buying stuff now but knowing
that it's going to be a completely
different landscape in their school
within the next two years or at least
hoping for that BYOD structure in the
next two years connectivity though now
even just over the last 18 months has
improved so so much with most school
leaders now saying that they're sort of
reading system out of stars would be
around a for four and a half for
connectivity and what we're seeing is
less and less IT staff being directed to
those issues so that's a really nice
thing seventy-two percent of
administration say that training for
staff is effective and adequate but you
can imagine that those thoughts are not
echoed by teachers right so in other
words almost three-quarters of admin
think they're doing enough to support
teachers but the biggest priority and I
think this is really telling the biggest
priorities for next year for admin is
number one staff resourcing and
upskilling so there's a huge
connect there with what administration
says about their own staff there's a
whole lot of reasons why so much of it
is attached to government funding and
support so having a clear picture of
what administration is actually thinking
is really difficult at times so the
biggest priorities for next year as I
said number one staffing resourcing and
skills number two is going to be
bringing the required IT support and
training to the team on-site and number
three is device management okay so it
was probably not too many surprises
there but what might hurt someone's
feeling in the room is that the lowest
on the list of 20 priorities was
security so I think that's an
interesting challenge for the future
yeah well I know someone so here's the
little kind of status on what people are
using and how that's playing out
eighty-three percent of classrooms are
using web tools more than once a week
sixty-two percent are using mobile
devices for learning fifty-nine percent
are using digital games this is a big
mover this is almost doubled in the last
two years fifty-eight percent are using
online educational resources and
forty-two percent again more than
tripling this number are using social
media in their classrooms this is
opening up the students world and if you
want to know more about all of these
things as I said I was really reluctant
to throw stats at you all over the
screen today but the new media
consortiums horizon report goes into
depths about all of these trends and is
the most reliable report in terms of the
educational space so that link will be
there for you but you know Google the
heck out of that when it comes straight
up horizon report for education and
you'll see all of these different ideas
coming forward here's a bit of a summary
of what they tell us the landscape is
going to look like in the next couple of
years device agnostic approaches are
going to be extremely important okay we
know that this is the neverending story
again stupid meme this one probably the
least relevant of my entire collection
but you know just checking you're still
there with me good big data is a huge
deal because most teachers don't know
how to use it and they're being asked to
constantly now numbers in e-learning for
example becoming so
that processing the user generated data
using traditional methods is just about
impossible and yet stakeholders now in
education is screaming for mobile
analytics they want deeper understanding
of the learning process and they want to
be able to look at statistics as simple
as who's completing what on time in a
classroom all the way up to kids
progress from prep through to year 12 so
it's really really difficult to think
about the capacity there of our teaching
staff and it's a huge opportunity in the
developer space there the thing that
we're really not seeing a lot of at the
moment but I'm sure that it'll be coming
through soon is the ability to compile
comprehensive reports on learning across
a whole variety of spectrums and sources
that's something we just don't have
access to yet so for example if a
student leaves a school almost all of
their data will stay at that previous
school there will be an a plan report
and a school report that will go with
them very little other tracking will
follow gamification as I mentioned
before this has been a really big mover
so that concept of applying gaming
mechanics and game design over the top
of learning to really motivate has
mainstreamed and this I think is a
really pleasing thing because engagement
is something that we know is a powerful
force in education tapping into the
basic desires and needs of a user
focusing on the impulses this revolves
around that idea of status and
achievement teachers didn't like
gamification in general for a long time
they really felt that if something
didn't look rigorous feel rigorous if it
was too much fun it couldn't possibly
represent real learning and we've moved
past that now so it's exciting here's
some of the reasons why if you want to
know how the brain works learners
generally recall only about ten percent
of the spoken word so today you're not
going to get much out of my presentation
there's some visuals to help you so you
might go towards twenty percent that's
where we're talking sort of in that
space of having visuals and the voice
going as well if I show you something
using an action we might get to thirty
percent but you're talking ninety
percent retention when learners actually
do the job themselves and here's
thing with gamification in the classroom
the mind doesn't really know the
difference between a simulation and
reality so if the students move through
a virtual world and complete a task the
brain doesn't really know the difference
between having done it in that virtual
space or real life and this is why I
visualize visualization methods have
been so popular in the sporting world
it's a proven thing it's not some kind
of hocus-pocus deal that when you
visualize success you are more able to
enact on that to act on that kind of
goal orientated thing and make it happen
interestingly to ninety percent of users
in any game and there's been a really
broad spectrum of things used in this
particular research I'm referencing
ninety percent of users said that they
found completing the tasks fun and these
tasks that they were given you know some
of them weren't that fun but the concept
of working through an online space and
actually winning or losing and going
through that iterative process seems to
really suit the mindset of children
sixty percent did say when they were
pushed in second level questioning that
it was only fun sometimes so I think
that of course is tells us that
implementation matters so does
personalization this is the tailoring of
pedagogy and we're being told that
adjusting the pace or the level with our
M learning is really important and the M
learning or mobile learning for us is
going to be absolutely the dominant
medium for offering support to our
students through technology by next year
okay so that's a really really big deal
once again so laptops we're not
considering those mobile learning
anymore it's about tablet devices so
essentially if it connects to a keyboard
and and can't be disconnected from that
keyboard then that's the kind of device
that we're going to be looking for in a
classroom because students can walk
around with it having access to the
camera as a window into their world and
as a vehicle for producing original
content is absolutely key and the
keyboard itself is going to be a thing
of the past in education I think much
sooner than most people realize we're
starting to see in desktop computers in
kindergartens that students are
absolutely struggle conceptually to
understand how those desktops work
they're touching the screens they're
holding the box they're literally trying
to pick up something that weighs more
than they do because the idea that
mobile technology handheld technology is
ubiquitous and all-consuming means that
desktops are now positioned as other two
children you might have noticed that if
you've got young people they're touching
the heck out of the television screen
it's a constant frustration so last
couple of things from the horizon report
your return on investment is very
important so when you're building things
being able to actually talk about how
it's going to calculate the return on
investment in data supported stories of
success is going to be crucial there's a
really increased drive to make sure that
in the testing environments that we're
dealing with that practices and products
actually connect to those goals of
lifting student achievement so good luck
with that automation is something our
teachers are asking for so this is a
little bit different to some of the
other things that are coming out of the
horizon report creating content for
teachers is often really time-consuming
and tedious when they're constantly
needing to update what they're doing
automatic the process of content
creation could be something really
really useful so we're starting to see
things like quizzes and exercises and
tests auto-generated from content but I
think we can get much better at doing
that algorithmically and that students
need some control over that
customization as well so that they can
really respond to their own level of
skill set and it's not all in the
teachers hands the last couple of areas
AR augmented reality and geo you're
really looking at things that when we
link the site and the experiential
learning you know we've got this lovely
way of engaging with mobile devices it
just makes sense that you would take
them into that next space right it feels
like the next space because you've got
students who are able to go on
excursions and respond to what they're
seeing on site and then to bring those
products back you know to their school
site is really really important and
wearables connect to that too we haven't
seen anywhere near the adoption on that
that we were expecting it's much much
slower burn at
point and interestingly i mentioned
health and physical education before
that's the single biggest area where
we're seeing wearables utilized so
connections between science areas and
health and human relations or physical
education are the big move and the
reason for that is still the idea that
we've got the health monitoring capacity
in most of those so we haven't really
gone much further than that but we know
that even for connections with science
the students using their own bodies
really brings an authenticity to that
space and social approaches kind of
using the idea that brainstorming
discussions working collaborative
something that's really old news
everybody that's had a job for the last
20 years in general has already sort of
discovered that they can use those
different spaces to communicate but in
classrooms the big drawback has been
actually getting students ideas for
things working out how they can protect
their identity even how they can
communicate with each other on shared
devices or things that they don't own
themselves we're finding more and more
that the virtual spaces that they can
actually create bring a whole new level
to this kind of idea and minecraft has
been the big winner in this space so
students actually learning to build a
Coliseum together in six classrooms in a
school in that virtual space and
connecting between science maths are all
that sort of stuff that's the big player
in that kind of idea well slide ever you
won't be able to read this but just
showing you that the all of this
information as I said is in the horizon
report and it goes into a lot of detail
so that's all there for you with the
different ways that emerging
technologies connect with those big
overarching kind of thoughts so as we
start to track towards the end here it's
probably obvious that there's a lot
going on in the classroom and a lot of
change and that means that a lot of
support is required so it's that idea
that there's these challenges but
opportunities at the same time I wanted
to talk to you a little bit about the
hacking that's going on in the classroom
because teachers have become really kind
of interested in finding
workarounds for things and it's that
bleeding edge vs cutting edge kind of
tension that we see a lot of the time so
some of it does crack me up i mean i
look at the cost of a charging station
for for instance with ipads often those
things aren't even budgeted in for when
a deployment goes down and you can see
that teachers are finding ways to go to
the two-dollar shop and to make
something work for their kids it's a
beautiful kind of idea that you know
where di wine that kids have been
showing us the way with that kind of
creativity the way they leverage tools
for a long long time but in terms of
mobile devices there's some useful tips
here that we can sort of ghana from the
way that they do and teachers are
hacking up their classrooms it's
important I think to know that in the
educational development space I don't
see a lot of dialogue between child
psychologists teachers people in the
educational community and product
builders it's it's really it's a fast
it's a point of fascination to me that
we just don't talk part of it is the
disconnect between money and kids no one
likes the idea of selling two little
people there's a lot of discomfort
around that but I think that we need to
know that we do need to talk to build
the best products possible in support of
teaching and learning sometimes in the
educational space we can't buy apps at
all some schools will have free apps
only for their mobile devices did you
know that that they just won't actually
ever spend so they'll they'll purchase
iPads or what have you but they will not
give teachers permission to actually
purchase things to put on those iPads so
free apps become really important in
that space and on top of that our free
apps then often have ads built into the
structure of the way that they work and
then they get banned because the ads are
being pushed out to the students in the
classroom so the hack for that that
teachers have come up with is just
turning off the Wi-Fi before they go
into the app so that the ads don't pop
up on the free app so then everyone
loses because now you're giving up to
people that then on X
seeing the ads which are paying for you
to develop the apps and to monetize the
whole process of bringing great creative
tools to the classroom and around we go
that the best half ever is that you know
if you log on with your Apple ID to an
ipad for example then you can drop the
apps you've already paid for on to your
students device and so we have teachers
sitting up all night logging out each
one of their students iPads putting
their Apple ID on to that I've had
downloading the 20 apps that they want
their students to have the term are
taking themselves out of the equation
again by taking their Apple ID out and
giving a student permission back and you
just think on one level it's simple
genius like to come up with this evil
scheme but it's not doing anybody any
favors and the fact that that's the
environment that we're working within is
is pretty scary really so yeah we really
need to talk more another thing I find
is a very eyes the the level of literacy
required for a whole bunch of different
apps they might be geared towards
students that are five and six years old
but the reading level is actually
pitched at nine and ten and eleven and
twelve year olds so education definitely
needs to start talking a lot more to
people that build in most places we're
still seeing Facebook blocked you'd be
you know eighty percent of schools would
have facebook blocked almost all of them
have snapchat band and we're still in a
space where at least fifty percent of
schools have mobile phones banned all
the way up to your 10 but if you ask a
ten-year-old how to download a free copy
of Game of Thrones they've got you
covered so it's pretty fun right and so
the conversations probably for all of us
need to start with our kids need and you
know they need more than just products
because I'm not just talking about prior
piracy here i'm talking about personal
data social etiquette communication
skills collaboration these are the key
things that we can be working towards i
often say to people you wouldn't give a
car to someone who couldn't drive right
and yet far too often we're seeing that
the social responsibility to provide
opportunities for little people to use
their
races responsibly as they engage with
our tools is not embedded into the tool
so thinking about the position that what
you build might have within the
curriculum and in fact even engaging
specialist teachers in building that
curriculum is something that can be done
and I'll just let this sit with you a
little bit because this is a really
great quote it kind of relates to one of
the big tensions in this space which is
screen time I always push back on any
discussion about screen time because to
me there is no such thing as screen time
there are all different ways of using a
screen some of them are very passive
some of them are highly engaging and
interactive and of course there's
everything in between and so if you can
communicate that in your products and
you can bring things to the table with
an articulation of why they're creative
and how they actually offer experiences
to the students that they can't get in
any other way then that's an asset so
these are the three kinds of golden
rules that i talked to particularly
parents about when they talk about
screen time and what apps have value and
how they should use mobile devices so
the first one is always ask your
children to teach you what they know and
when you're testing your products if you
actually can't have students at the end
of that time articulate what it is that
they're learning through using that
product then that's an opportunity for
you to do more work in that space
because really understanding and being
able to reflect on what it is that
they're doing is critically important
for adoption I always talk to parents
about seeking out opportunities to play
and learn together with their kids so
anything that you make that really makes
clear the idea that yes you can do this
in isolation or independently that's
that's okay but they're actually
collaborative ways of using this tool
and ways of bringing people together
that's going to be a pro for you and the
third one is that students should always
be able to choose apps that allow them
to create so whenever you're producing
something that's open ended
and for students something that allows
them to have a different experience
every time they engage with the tool
then once again that's in the right
direction for adoption from the
education community if every student is
following directions and producing the
same thing that's not learning that's a
recipe and that's a real problem in our
space for adoption so in finishing up
here there are four key things that
teachers identify when they're selecting
tools that they'll use in their
classroom the first one is that it's
future oriented so the future for kids
in the classroom is now through to the
next 20 years you know we're talking
about students come into a space in
pre-prep where we're preparing them for
jobs that don't exist yet everyone knows
that's hard stuff so if we do what's
best for them now with the thought about
the future we're probably doing the best
thing we can at this point the second
thing that they're looking for is always
engagement this is a word that has been
coming up for the last 12 years
particularly and its really related to
the idea that there are challenges in
connecting the kids to the curriculum in
other words kids now will not do
something just because they're told that
it is good for them they actually have
to be directed to spaces where they can
make authentic connections for
themselves to find engagement to be
motivated so for teachers things that
really connect students to the content
and curriculum a key the third thing is
that skill improves and is measurable in
its improvement and I've alluded to that
across a whole bunch of the topics that
I've talked about but teachers are under
the pump to actually be able to show in
a concrete way what they're doing for
our students and how that's playing out
as they track up hopefully track up the
fourth one is that it increases
collaboration and communication and I
don't know why those are lumped together
so often by teachers but it sounds like
a good deal to me because when you're
actually collaborating it's almost
impossible to do that without
communicating and vice versa so I think
it is a nice way to kind of experience
that that thinking process so I hope
that's given you like a kind of full
throttle
is what we're thinking about in
classrooms and education all the time as
I said there was a lot of data there so
the horizon report is your go-to and if
you would like more of the research and
studies that I've been using they're
just flick me an email you can find me
at Kathy at ipad art room it's Kathy
with a C and thanks so much for being
such a three o'clock Friday audience
that was awesome you turned up please
I've left ten minutes for that so there
are factions on this and it's a constant
tension like right down to the staff
room level with teachers I personally
don't believe that the same pathway that
we used to teach reading writing and
arithmetic is useful that doesn't mean
that I don't think the same level of
skill will and should be developed so in
other words perhaps we're not doing the
same exercises at the same key stages
perhaps we're hitting it in different
directions but you know I will see
students that are ten years old who have
literally developed different thumb
muscles and can text at a million miles
miles an hour and Link images two words
to create meaning like with memes or
what have you in ways that I could never
have asked young people to do ten years
ago over the same age so our
understanding of literacy has expanded
there are more ways of communicating
that our students have access to now
that we need to unpack so for example I
doubt very much that in 20 years any of
our kids are going to be applying you
know with a resume that's in text most
of the time they're going to be doing
something else that's going to be folio
based that's going to be a whole variety
of media mashed up together and so in
terms of even just plain and simple time
how do you put all of that new stuff in
without some of the old stuff going out
and i think if we stop thinking about
classrooms as static programming and
more about living breathing organism
that have to be responsive to our world
and to the people in it we're probably
on the right track but as far as hard
and fast answers I don't know like our
kids don't have the vocabulary that they
used to absolutely don't and so that's
an interesting thing but their
vocabulary is hugely increased in their
ability to unpack a video and to talk
about how the subtext might be something
that's affecting your emotional response
to film you know to be able to produce
you know in new media what they can now
when you know it was hard pressed to get
a kid to take a photograph fifteen years
ago that you know was framed correctly
as an interesting thing it's a brave new
world
yep
yeah so the Australian Curriculum is
putting out their own resources which is
a game changer so scoodle is the avenue
that they're using for that so if you
want to investigate that that's what
it's coming out of and as you say the
quality is hugely variant yeah and so
it's it's it's all a work in progress
we're up to like the eighth revision on
the Australian Curriculum in some
subjects it's just a huge change fresh
net us nationally so can't tell exactly
what's going to happen with it but
definitely opportunities for people to
build things that sit within it and the
idea that there are opportunities for
tools to nest into the different subject
areas is a huge one now that all
teachers are being charged with that
role of being an ICT leader because
that's brand new like there are some art
teachers science teachers maths teachers
that were never using technology and now
need to have to it's mandated finally
yeah
no no yes so that the challenge becomes
like if you want to get your products
and things out there how do you do that
with your teachers and so you've got to
find the people that are going to be the
good evangelist for you the testers
teachers just love free stuff I got to
tell you like that it's the biggest win
for you is that they're paid rubbish
money for the job that they do so if you
give them something they'll try it out
and they'll tell you you know if they
think it's useful I want 40 of these and
then you're on to something and they'll
tell you 12 other teacher friends who
are just desperate to get their dirty
little hands on it so it's yeah well you
know all about it she's got boxes of
jars and pins and toilet rolls yeah
imagine what she'd do if you gave her
free apps be nuts it's true right it's
you just that's the thing is connecting
with the right people so if you're if
you're into twitter the hashtag of ozzy
EDD has really social teachers on it all
the time you watch you see who's talking
about maths or science going to hit you
up to help me out
yeah so most schools have an LMS that
they work with that's just the way that
that's panned out but things that work
within the classroom space are kind of
different and that's what I was alluding
to with the disconnect between the
personal in class day-to-day data that's
happening and then the way that the big
data on the students and then you know
the ecosystem of the school and even
MOOCs and things that sit within the
curriculum are all nested together
there's no at the moment there's not a
lot of solutions that work between those
spaces
at best at times yeah that would be a
good day yeah sometimes I'm waiting for
a green flash to the sphere yeah yeah
welcome to my world yeah slowly but the
thing is there are the priorities as
well right so getting the devices in the
hands of the students is the priority so
to you know go through a huge migration
you know on site of things that actually
still don't impact on the teaching of
learning is is hard to sell you know
it's much easier to sell to your
community we're giving all of the kids
Chromebooks this week because they have
no access in a one-to-one environment at
our school than it is to go all we
actually need to change your LMS so and
again that puts pressure on the teachers
and stuff right oh so a learning
management system yeah so that that's
something that puts pressure on the
teachers because they're like this
thing's heinous and I have to use it
every day but looks much better to put a
device in the hands of every kid and
then the problem with not spending on
the professional learning to use it yeah
mm-hmm was it coding awesome it is it's
a good question that just before I
answer that the the coding thing I
purposely didn't mention it today
because coding has got the best press
possible and I I think it's a wonderful
thing but like that's something that's
charging forward again in schools in
Australia not necessarily the same way
worldwide but it's really going forward
in Australia and apples right about to
build out the Swift playground so that's
invader at the moment which will mean
that all students can use the same code
that developers are using you know from
four years old which is really amazing
so that's coming and those spaces are
really nice and but lots of other people
have got great products to interact with
as well so you can kind of use that as a
model for what you're talking about
because you can kind of go well this is
where it's happening in terms of support
for teachers and learner's really well
and if you think about taking the the
kind of mindset that's happened with
coding from the marketing of it to the
linking to the curriculum to the getting
the teachers on board to the having the
discussions with school and of course
then the resourcing it not just with the
product but with all of the information
behind it and the programs for
professional learning behind it then
that's a winner minecraft did it very
well but nowhere near as well as just
coding as a thing has done it through
kind of osmosis so any time that
developers spend in education you know
is time well spent there are spaces at
the moment to make a big dent but just
understanding that you know the Pokemon
thing for for example massive craze in
the same way of course that yo-yos or
marbles and things you know were but in
terms of education when something's that
big we're going to use it in the
classroom
every teacher is going well if our kids
love that thing so much then we need to
find a way to use it in the classroom so
what do they do they don't give all of
their kids devices and say go and use
Pokemon go they develop curriculum that
matches the Pokemon go so they can
justify using it in the classroom
because they know it's engaging the
students yeah so that's the mindset all
the time is trying to leverage whatever
is working in the real world and bring
it back to the kids and if you're going
to develop from the from the ground up
with an idea you're going to have to try
and reverse engineer that process you
can have to try and underpin it sell it
to the teachers on that idea that it has
that quality to it give them the
curriculum and the learning to support
it and then blow it up so it has to be
nested like that anything else you look
like you don't want to go I don't know I
feel like I feel like maybe you just
want to go to sleep in here now could
turn the lights down for you thanks so
much you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
