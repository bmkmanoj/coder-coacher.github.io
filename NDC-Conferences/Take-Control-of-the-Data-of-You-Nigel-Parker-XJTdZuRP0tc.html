afternoon and we probably should be
sitting in the session with some beers
but what I want to do is spend the next
hour talking about a bit of a personal
journey that I've been on over the last
four years but I want to start with an
experiment and this is really a test to
see how we are humans in comparison to
machines so anyone in the room tell me
what this is yell it out if you know
Opera House so the computer that that's
a close-up of a water fountain and it
thinks that were very low confidence now
still the Opera House right picture
containing sky and it should be clear to
everybody in the room that this is the
iconic building down on Sydney's Harbor
the computer sees this as a large white
building with high confidence which
technically is correct
now what was going on there it's the
context of that image was relevant to a
lot of the people in the room how many
of the people who called out opera house
live here in Sydney yes and most so
you're used to seeing this building and
you're used to seeing it inside of this
context so even when you don't have all
the information you can still make the
assumption that that's what you're
looking at and that is the building that
you see now to get the machine to
identify that as the Sydney Opera House
should be relatively easy because it's
pretty iconic it's got the shell shapes
and it's something that you know you
might instantly recognize but it turns
out it's not as easy a problem as you
might think
so I'm just going to show you an example
here this is a custom vision AI so this
is a API that's been released by
Microsoft that enables you to take a
base training a based image sorry base
trained solution so this has been
trained on landscapes and buildings and
then enhance it with additional
information so what I've done here is
actually upload a bunch of images of
shell-shaped buildings including the
Sydney Opera House and the Lotus
Building in India as well as the
Science and Innovation Center in
Singapore and what I've done is I've
tagged this based on the particular
building that you're seeing so this is
the Science and Technology Building in
Singapore this here is the Sydney Opera
House oh sorry if I insulate that one
and I've also shown variation when it's
been during the light festival and vivid
and when you can see it when it's just
that the building that's here and then
over here are buildings that are shaped
like a lotus so if you didn't have the
context of knowing Sydney knowing the
Opera House a lot of these structures
would look quite similar to each other
and to give you an example of how you
might test that you could load an image
that the model hasn't seen before so
here's an image is the image we trained
of the Sydney Opera House now it hasn't
seen this particular photo but it's been
trained on photos that are similar and
if I scroll down here you'll notice that
didn't want to zoom in but you'll see
it's a hundred percent sure that it's a
building it's a hundred percent sure
that it's a shell-shaped building and
it's 99.9% sure it's seeing the Opera
House and then if I show it another
variation of that and maybe this photo
here which is a little bit more
difficult to recognize now this photo is
a close-up of the Opera House with the
Harbour Bridge in the background that I
took yesterday morning and when it's
looking at this image it's also
identifying and what it sees in the
image so if I come sorry I just see down
here it's identifying a shell-shaped
building and again the Opera House now
that's pretty hard to do because that
image there looks very different to say
the iconic version that I showed you at
the start of the talk and if I look at
some of the other predictions that have
been made and I've shown at photos that
it hasn't seen before version of the
Opera House that's it out of Lego world
and you'll see that it's identified
there as the Opera House here it is
during vivid so it sees it as vivid
here's a building that is similar to the
Opera House but not the Opera House and
you see there is identified as a shell
building but not the Opera House
change the belt pack okay sorry Thanks
so the real yeah so the reason I'm
showing you this is and I want to
introduce to you this concept of how the
machines you know learn to think
so if you haven't seen that before that
is how the deep learning is advancing to
such a point that it can be used inside
of an autonomous vehicle to drive and to
make decisions on the road that is the
Yolo deep learning library which has a
extension which enables you to run that
kind of speed for deep learning on a
mobile device so the example I showed
earlier transitions right out to that
concept of having the machines think and
interact and recognize things in our
world so when we think about humans plus
machines humans have understanding
purpose and passion and machines have
calculations instructions and
objectivity so when we put those
together a novice plus a machine and a
bit of process can exceed beyond an
expert plus a machine plus an inferior
process so these two guys here the year
was 2005 and Zack Steven and Steven Kemp
Crampton were two novice chess players
had they had a mature ranking in the
world chess rankings and they entered a
competition which was the first time
machines could be used with people to
play a game of chess and their approach
of humans plus machines beat out the
best supercomputers in the world it also
beat out the best grandmasters in the
world because what they did is they
augmented their intelligence using some
processing on three simple IBM pcs this
here anyone familiar with keggle com so
a couple of hands and Jennifer talked
about this briefly in her keynote at the
start of in DC and what Kegel comm is is
it's really a platform for people to
experiment and work together to solve
computer sorry can solve AI or machine
learning problems and the great thing
about the community is that companies
will put the data down there put the
problems they want solved and then
they'll offer prize money to those
people who can solve it and because the
solutions happen out in the open you can
learn from each other you can learn from
other
and then you can apply different
techniques to solve the particular
problems that you face so a few years
ago I think it was about four years ago
I was standing up on a stage not that
dissimilar to this and I was talking
about data is the new oil AI is the new
electricity and I felt like a real fraud
because I actually didn't have my own
big data set my own experience and my
own story that attached itself to data
at the same time I was a bit overweight
and I was starting to suffer from
vertigo from sitting in front of my
computer for ten years programming and
tapping on the keyboard and I realized
that when I went to see what was wrong
with me I went through all the medical
checks I've gotten a scan I got it I
went through the the doctors and they
couldn't really say anything was wrong
they said you were all fine and then I
went and saw a physio who said your
problem is lack of activity bad posture
crunching over a computer and that for
me made me aware and that I had to
change and I had to change my behavior
to fix the problem because it had been
going on for a few months now changing
itself something stops change happens
then something begins but I like to
think about it like this and this is the
change formula the formula for change
dissatisfaction with the current state
times by the vision of what you want to
achieve times by the first steps
required to get there as long as that is
greater than the resistance that you
apply on yourself change will occur so
starting with dissatisfaction my love of
craft beer plus my lack of activity was
leaving to my state of dissatisfaction
the vision of what I wanted to achieve I
set my self an impossible goal something
that I never thought I was going to be
able to do I said I was going to walk
4000 walk around 4000 kilometres in 2014
and this was near the end of 2013 when I
set this goal I was unfit I had no
understanding or comprehension about how
I was going to achieve that and then I
went on I achieved that goal I did 4041
kilometres that year and you'll notice I
still had quite a high intake on the
beers and in 2015 I set myself
5,000 kilometer goal and I achieved that
as well 5100 2016 I set myself a
different goal I didn't want to go for
the 6000 case but I did say I was going
to run an ultra marathon and I did my
first ultra marathon in 8 hours and 22
minutes for 67 kilometers and when I
wind that back to that vision I went
back to my first steps and my first
steps were to get a treadmill I got a
standing desk and a treadmill so that
when I was programming throughout the
day I was standing up and I was
programming while I could walk and I
could switch between walking and sitting
and I could start to move now I couldn't
run 1 kilometer on the treadmill at that
time I had a really high resting heart
rate and I was generally very unfit but
that was how I kind of put that formula
together to drive towards the change now
in any hero story if you've seen Star
Wars you know everything's going the
trainings going well you're on the path
to becoming the Jedi and then resistance
happens or something happens that
changes and takes you back to your
previous state for me resistance came in
the form of a virus I became allergic to
exercise so what happened was I was
running towards this goal of 4000
kilometers a year in 2014 and I said I
started to get sick and I got a virus
that I didn't want to stop because if
I'd stopped exercising I kind of was
going to lose against my goal and not
make the outcome I was driving towards
so I keep running when I had the virus
and off the back of the virus I can get
I conducted an immune disease with no no
and cause and no no and cure it
literally meant that when I sweated I
broke out in full body hives and
couldn't continue exercising and that
disease has a name it was called chronic
urticaria it's probably something that
many people have not heard of it was
something I certainly hadn't heard of
and I had to do some research and
understand what it all meant but what it
was is that my body my immune system and
my body had incorrectly identified
exercise as an something to attack as
the virus itself that I had at the time
while I was exercising and I cured
myself and through insight from data and
this is where
you know the story gets kind of
interesting and I wanted to share some
steps on how I did that so the first
thing track everything so I don't know
if you've seen Adam Cogan here at the
conference he's spoke on visual studio
and day one I notice he's wearing four
wearable devices two on each wrist that
he's been tracking and correlating his
data now I'd say that this is a little
bit extreme
I wear a single device and I've changed
the device over the years as well so my
journey started with the Fitbit one back
in 2012 I went to a band I went to a
surge at Microsoft band 2 and now I'm on
a Garmin Phoenix HR device which is my
main wearable device and when I come
back to the tracking so that enables you
to get access to the information and the
data that you've got one thing I will
say on this is be careful around the
ecosystem that you buy into I found
Fitbit was somewhat closed and that you
had to pay to get access to your data
and other platforms make it more
difficult to access data I'll show the
examples later where I'm using Garmin
and it's very easy to get your data out
the next putt learner learn how to
breathe who knew that you had to learn
how to breathe I had no idea he never
never taught it at school but I went and
saw a guy called dr. Steen at the
resilience Institute in Auckland and he
introduced me to this concept called
heart mess and it's really around
slowing your breathing and adjusting
your breathing to move from this chaos
state to this coherent state and
adjusting the settlement in your brain
and after I learnt that technique it
turned out that that same technique
could use could be used on an ECG
machine to adjust attention and
meditation and able to create the
machine to move things forward to move
things left and gave him mind control as
well as body control and so what I also
learned when I went through this process
is that I had a really high elevated
resting heart rate and my resting heart
rate was kind of made worse and by my
diet and my physical makeup so the next
part was learn how to eat so if you look
at this little chart here up here on the
left is when I conducted the virus over
here is the period that I had
edik area just up here was when I
changed my diet and then 30 days later
was when I was cured and what I did to
change the diet is I treated it like an
experiment I took all of the foods and
things that I was eating and I reset I
went back to just raw Whole Foods vague
and kind of diet and then I reintroduce
things one by one and measured the
effect of reintroducing those things
like you would if you were working you
know on an experiment in science at
school and what I found out was that I
was actually I my body had a really
negative effect on caffeine and that was
you know made worse with the amount of
coffee I was drinking and also the
alcohol so when I had caffeine I had a
higher resting heart rate for a longer
period of time and what I was able to do
then was identified by removing caffeine
I was getting a bit of body state and I
also found that you know as I added
things back in if my ears went red or if
I had kind of physical outcomes from the
foods that were coming back
I would reduce them so doing things like
moving to almond milk in the morning and
stuff like that and so from there I kind
of had a base set of what the different
aspects meant to my body and when I
think about what was going on with the
data we're moving from a world of
knowing what happened and why it
happened to move into a world of
predicting what is going to happen and
what is needed to make it happen
I really like this graph here from
Gartner where it talks about hindsight
so traditional business intelligence is
about hindsight it's about having a
descriptive analytics of what happened
it's about understanding why it happened
and then we're moving to this world of
advanced analytics so we think about
advanced analytics this is insight this
is predicting what is going to happen
and how we can make it happen so in some
cases when you know what's going to
happen you want to change behavior to
avoid it happening or you want to
encourage it to happen and to actually
change behavior to make it happen and
this is really the area of advanced
analytics that we're moving towards and
it's what I wanted to demonstrate and
show you in the next examples and how
many people here are on Strava or for
Milius Java Wow half the room so
strauber
is the social network for runners and
cyclists it's a place where you can
extract data from wearable devices and
it can be plotted inside of this Strava
platform and what this is here is this
is the fitness and freshness graph which
shows increase in Fitness over time
peaking and dropping based on well-being
from your physical device and this is
fantastic because I follow this when I'm
training for a race or when I'm actually
developing and building my fitness app
so you see when I started I wasn't very
fit and then I kind of moved up that
mountain and then dropped down and
dropped along and move along as we are
and this is where I am today that I just
took this screenshot earlier today and
this is my bot and I'm going to talk a
little bit about the spot and show you
how it's been built and how the pieces
come together but what it does now is if
you look over on the left-hand side
it'll send me an SMS when I'm going when
when it predicts that I'm going to get a
virus or when I'm starting to get sick
or if I'm getting stressed and I need to
slow down so you'll see some push
notices up here where it's saying on the
July the second it predicted that I
wasn't sick was 63 percent confidence
the reason I got that one to push is
because there's confidence is going down
so that's sometimes a sign that I'm
starting to fight a virus or that I'm
starting to have some challenges with
stress in that case it was actually the
stress of a reorg at Microsoft that was
going on that pushed me into that state
and the next one down here
it was predicting that I was sick with
86 percent confidence now that actually
was a false positive and because I
traveled to Las Vegas and I'd ran in the
heat and I just got off the plane and I
was jet-lagged and ran in the heat in
Las Vegas so that wasn't positive
examples and I was thinking of ways to
actually get more data points to to
message that went out but I'm going to
show you a little bit about this whole
platform of what I've built and how I've
built it and how the pieces come
together so that you can I've also
published this on github so you could
kind of pick it up and take it for
yourself and maybe think about some of
the components to it now I use this as a
bit of a learning project I chose No
because I didn't know how to program a
note and I'd been working in c-sharp and
I wanted to learn and I also you know
picked up some of the other components
that I was looking to get experience in
I noticed here it still sees a search I
did use as a search originally
elasticsearch but then I stopped using
that and started going directly back to
the document database but what I want to
do is show you how the components come
together so I'm gonna come back over
here now and this is the github
repository and I'll share the and the
links a little bit later on in the talk
but the first component is actually an
Asia function now what the Asia function
does is it connects every I think it's
whatever got it running I think I've got
it running every half hour to maybe once
on the hour once every hour to the
Garmin device and it pulls the data that
comes off my wristwatch once an hours so
this is constantly syncing over
Bluetooth to my phone and once an hour
it's updating into my document date
document database I'm also going out to
my Fitbit scales which are sent to
through my fitness power into my Garmin
and it's giving my weight once a day and
I use a platform called untappd anyone
familiar with untappd it's a few so it's
the social network for our beer
it's like Strava but for beer and that's
the only thing I actually physically
have to do which is chicken my beers
when I when I drink them through this
air and then that gets my beer
consumption into the into the mix as
well and so what this does is it calls a
it takes the data out it gets the
information and then it calls the edge
of machine learning to determine make a
prediction as to if I'm getting sick or
if my there are some anomalies in my
data and I'll get into that a little bit
and then it writes it into a document
database so over here I've got the
document database and if I look at the
overview of this database for those who
aren't familiar Cosmos DB is you know
Microsoft's I guess it's its global
globally distributed
low latency document database and so I
could turn on endpoints in all these
different regions around the world and
it would guarantee less than 10
millisecond latency for the person from
the location closest to the data center
right now I've just got it replicating
in the west coast of the US and down
here and this is the number of requests
that are kind of coming in to the to the
database and it's got a nice feature
which is data Explorer where you can
look at the information coming into the
into the database so if I look in the
documents over here and look at the
latest document that Saturday 27th of
5th if I edit this and I say and we're
I've got I think I've got a copy yeah so
I can do an order by CDOT date logged
descending so it's kind of like an Oh
data and query language and if I look at
that one there that's today so this is
today's data coming through
over here and you'll see for today and
today Friday quite a number of steps
quite a quite a big distance and a
reasonable amount of activity as well
whoa max heart rate 222 geez that's not
good don't question the data and then
what that so what that's doing is that's
creating sort of this daily information
that I don't really have to think about
it's just automatically been pulled out
and pushed into into this database and
if you familiar with using power bi
power bi has got a better data connector
here which if you go to Asia and there's
a document DB and beta so you can
connect this directly to this this kind
of document database or cosmos DB and
then you can create these visualization
experiences so what I've done is I've
created some sample power bi and reports
and then I've published those up on the
github page as well and if you look over
on the right-hand side and you'll notice
that if you see that the page
information that the size here is for
Cortana and that's because I've turned
on
Cortana integration so the way that you
can do that
if you haven't used power bi before is
over in power bi you upload your data
source and you can understand it
refreshes from your data so over here
it's connected to my document dB and I'm
refreshing that once every three hours
and that updates that the data source
and then I've turned on this thing
called Q&amp;amp;A Cortana which allows Cortana
to access the data set and I've got some
featured Q&amp;amp;A questions so I can prompt
you know to know what sort of questions
I can ask of my data so if I come down
here I could then say and be as 2014 for
example and there it comes up here and
this is going to show me how many beers
I had in 2014 and it will show it by
month it shows me my weight over the
time as well so you can see my weight
adjusting based on might be a
consumption I had a lot of beers in May
and my weight dropped up in June a
little bit and you notice that this is
the period in the graph where I actually
did my full reset so that September and
then October I didn't drink anything
because I was doing my reset for that
thirty days so that's kind of where that
sits there also breaks it out so you
notice that's the day the week Saturday
seems to have more beer than you know
during the week and I can say okay well
distance traveled 2014 and that will
show the distance I went in 2014 so
you'll see up here that's the 4042
kilometers broken out by month with
particular activity days kind of down on
the bottom there so you can find pretty
quickly an insight from from the data
and the information itself I think the
last one I wanted to show is
heart rate 2016 to see heart rate 2016
and what that's showing via is is kind
of interesting because that's showing
like on Saturday and I've got a lot more
activity so I do a lot of my running or
my distance reading on Saturday and and
as a result I have a higher sorry it's
the Hat right a little bit on those on
that day as well
so I kind of get that idea about fitness
and form which is this one here and the
minimum heart rate maximum heart rate
and the weight change in fact
fluctuation during that time as well if
I come into here and go into my
favorites area and this is the dashboard
where I can ask questions of my data so
I could say what was my average sleep in
2017 by month and that's kind of gone
down and said well 2017 and you've got
your most sleep in January averaging
nine hours sleep in January I don't know
why that was but that's a lot but as the
years gone on you'll notice that I'm
actually having the least sleep at the
moment and an August on average and if I
said and instead of in 2017 I could say
by month by year try that one that
should work
yeah there we go and that's now telling
me that you know 2016 January I slipped
a lot less than I did in January this
year so you can kind of get there
fluctuation by month by year so you can
really start to find some pretty
interesting data come out and there's a
good feature in here as well which is
where it analyzes your data for you and
create some insights so you can come
over to your data see it and go view
insights and what that does is it
calculate it looks through your data and
it looks for stuff it looks for
anomalies it looks for things that and
you may not know so it's saying 2006
relatively steady percent of lowest
heart rate
but there's also saying there some
outliers now this is what we got me
thinking about where I might find some
of the signals around what getting sick
looks like or what getting stressed
looks like because I realized in some of
the places I was finding outliers I was
also finding and that I was sick around
those times as well and if you go down
further correlating sleep and beers
correlation between sleep and beers who
would have thought so the more beers you
have has an effect on on sleep and sleep
patterns and this is another one
calories burned as trending downwards
okay I'm not doing as much exercise as I
was when I was kind of crazy and you can
start to get a bit of information that
comes out of that kind of thing now if I
come over to the machine learning part
of this if you think back to Jennifer's
session at the start of the conference
in the keynote she talked about creating
a binary classifier for identifying if
her husband was lying or not or if
someone was lying or not and what I've
done here is I've looked inside of all
my data and I've marked the days that I
was sick and that's been my and that's
kind of my supervised learning so that's
my labeled data for where I'm
identifying whether I'm sick or not and
by taking that data set in putting that
label on it I'm being able to bring it
into Azure machine learning and and and
use the algorithms that are there for
binary classification to determine and
predict whether I might be getting sick
and so if you look at the information
itself if I visualize visualize the data
what you'll see here is there's the
information that I'm been collecting so
I could say something like distance
which shows you some information about
it over on the right-hand side if I
wanted to compare distance two steps
you'll notice that they correlate pretty
closely which is what you'd expect I
mean as you're doing more you know steps
you probably follow in greater distance
the exception being when you're running
you do less steps when you're walking
you do more steps but you get a feel for
for the correlation between those those
particular data points and then finding
things like weight you know there's a
bit of a histogram around weight and
things like sleep you know there's a
histogram around that be as tins - yeah
it's it's kind of marked as the wrong 0
to 5 is where the majority are there are
a few days when I have more than 5 beers
and in fact there was a day when I had
more than 11
so that's we'll call that an anomaly and
when you look inside the data here it's
about identifying the features what's
important and once you can identify the
features then you can start to train the
model to determine the impact that you
want to do now as I was saying before it
picked up falsely I thought that I was
getting a virus after I flew to Las
Vegas and read in the heat so that made
me think that I probably need a couple
more data points one may be an app on my
phone that poles to check by GPS where I
am each day and then maybe what the
temperature is outside a net location so
if I see change in location if I see
moving from country to country
I know I've kind of probably been on a
plane and then if I also see you know
outside temperature of 35 I might have a
different effect - outside temperature
of 10 degrees or or negative degrees and
so then what I've done is I've come down
and I've identified my label which is
this trained and which is once I
determine my features so over here I've
identified what's important and I've
labeled virus
oh the you know virus is the thing that
I'm trying to predict and then if they
look at it I've tried a couple of
algorithms so remember in the keynote
Jennifer also talked about this as
you're learning you know Asian machine
learning algorithm a cheat sheet that
gives you this idea that in this case
I'm predicting categories between sick
or not and I'm using two class
classification so I've picked up a
couple of algorithms here a two class
decision jungle and a two class neural
network I wanted to try than your
network because I generally find that
the deep learning approach will come out
with the more accurate results and then
I've put both of those into my model
down here and I've taken oh this is
important sorry this tip here is
important when you split your data it's
really important to choose a reasonable
amount of data to split so this is
saying take seventy percent of the data
and train the model on it and then take
thirty percent of the data and test the
model on that thirty percent and then
using stratified stratified split that's
also saying you need positive examples
in both sets of data because it doesn't
work very well if all of the places you
had a virus are actually in the 30
percent your testing and not on the food
not on the 70 percent where you're
training the model so that's going to
make sure that whatever you're testing
against is in both the training set and
also in the analysis step as well a lot
of people who try this for the first
time and don't do that and not you know
end up not giving as good a results as
they could and so on the Left I've got
the the two class in your network on the
right I've got the two class boosted
decision jungle and then it runs that
against my data and I can visualize that
as well so this is going to assess both
of those and as you remember the example
moving up towards the top is more about
how many false positives you get or how
many false negatives so with the neural
network I've got four true positives one
false negative one false positive and
two hundred true negatives so that's
pretty good result in regards to
accuracy in precision so
the thing that's lacking for me here is
over the last four years I haven't been
sick that much so I haven't got that
many positive examples to train the
model so this will get better as you get
more data and you have more examples
that you can you know run it in against
and then once that's been trained you
can publish it out as a whip in point
and then you can test against it so if I
run it against this test data over here
and it's saying with all this data input
you said you didn't have a virus I'm
predicting that you don't have a virus
with point zero five percent confidence
so it's sorry nineteen yeah 99.95
percent confidence so what it's really
saying is I can almost guarantee you
don't and if I increase my resting heart
rate which is a sign that your body's
starting to fight something so let's say
I put my heart rate up to 55 and I test
that again with the same data and it's
saying not still don't have a virus but
and I've got less confidence I mean you
know I'm 60 I'm 58 percent sure you
don't if I increase it to 56 and test
it's now saying actually you do have a
virus and I'm sixty percent sure that
you have that virus now if I say
actually I had seven beers notice it's
gone no you don't have a virus and I'm
you know 74 percent sure you died
because it knows that when I have those
beers my resting heart rate goes up so
it's not as much as one feature it's
kind of a collection of the different
features that train the model and give
it the input and so from there that's
then been published and I call that
every time from my measure function to
test and score my data and then when
there finds anomalies that then pushes
out to me and lets me know hey slow down
or take it easy or think you're getting
sick so I can actually make adjustments
before I overdo it or before I push
things too far the next part from this
is the the bot interface so I showed you
the power bi interface
where I've got the you know the power bi
data set and the the Cortana call the
next part was to kind of publish this
out as a bot and so I'll show you that
I'll show you that working for a start
and then I can talk to you about how I
built that so the good thing about the
bot is I can use natural language to
find information out and from my data in
real time so I could say something like
how many beers did I have last night and
what that's doing is it's now it's
taking the question that's passing it
through a platform we called Louis which
is language understanding and
yeah the language understanding platform
and then it's housing there and it's
sending it back now the reason it took a
little bit of time to get their answer
about the first time is I'm actually got
this running on a free version of Asia
functions which takes a little bit to
boot up the first time through I think
if you went to as Aaron Jordan's talk a
little earlier they going to show that
that startup time if your production
izing this you you know you'd put it on
a higher instance version and and make
it work that way so it's okay but then I
can get kind of tricky so if you look at
that question above it how many flights
of stairs to their climb on average
during the week this year on average she
climbed 20 floors per day so then I
could say how many flights of stairs did
I climb on average on the weekend this
year
and it can come back and that can say
okay on average she climbed out 24 25
floors per day on the weekend this year
I could say when was I fittest this year
so when was I fittest this year your vo2
max was 65 on cellular July the 1st 2017
so that's the day this year we're I've
through my vo Jim X which is the volume
of oxygen that you can process through
your body and recovery was the highest
so that's a scale and I don't know what
scale goes on but that was how I was
kind of training myself based on fitness
if I could say what was my lowest vo to
mix this yeah oh okay that's a problem
now that's interesting because that that
means that it's misinterpreted the
question so what I can see what I can
try and do is actually I can call Louis
here to see what went wrong so over here
I'm going to put that question into the
address bar which is what was my lowest
vo2 max this year and if I press ENTER
on there it's looking for vo2 max and
it's looking for lowest so what it's
done is Louis has correctly identified
the question and it's identified what
I'm trying to find so that means the
problem isn't in Louis it means that
Louis has looked at the nature of the
question that's broken it down into
these entities and it's parsing those
into my function so the function is
actually receiving the right information
here I'm going a little off piece
because I'm kind of interested to try
and debug this to see what's going what
see what's actually going on so if you
want to be with me and what we're going
to try and do is step that through in
the code inside of vias code here and
see what comes out from the Louis and
what the query is that I'm trying to
build to get to the database and so as I
mentioned before I've written
the solution inside of no dot no no J
yes I haven't used the amazing Bott
boiler framework that Jordan and I were
talking about earlier it's a little bit
more and JavaScript that I learnt ten
years ago which could be improved
significantly but it's a start
and so what I'm going to do here is
inside of Visual Studio I'm actually
already got a debug window open and if I
come over here this is the bot framework
channel emulator where you can test
against your BOTS so if I paste that
question into here into my bot what was
mobile EOT met this year I should hit my
breakpoint over here inside of my code
and here's my search query and so what
I'm actually doing behind the scenes is
that I'm taking the natural language I'm
passing it using Louis and bringing it
back as intense and then I'm reading
those intense and I'm turning it into a
data query that I can call against my
document database and so the query here
is top one from C where dirt logged as
this year so that's correct order by
okay so the problem here is it's saying
top one start and it's not saying
minimum or maximum so inside my code
I've got a gun issue which is not
interpreting that entity of minimum of
least I think and
imposing it so there's there's a bit of
a code problem there that I need to go
and fix but that's you know gives you an
example of how to how to actually step
through this and to get into deep agate
with that division but I and I could do
things like saying and when did you last
predict that I was
and well so this is following another
channel and it's saying okay you said
you're not sick on the 20th of July on
that day predicted you were sick with 82
percent confidence so that's kind of
going down that path and then I could
expand on that and I could say when did
you predict I was sick this year and
what that's doing now is it's going to
bring back like using these and these
cards all the times that predicted that
I was sick this year and it's saying and
I predict to do a set you said you
weren't or I'd predict to do a second
you said you were so you get that that
feeling of of of the information coming
back which is which is great and to show
you a little bit more about Lois so if
you how many people went and seen
sessions here at in DC we've talked
about Lois there's a fear in not not
everybody so what Louis is doing is it's
really making it easy to take natural
language and convert it into this idea
of entities and intense so that you can
then take it from a programming
interface and to turn it into queries
against your database or to turn it into
actions that you want to do inside of
code and so when you have a look at what
I've got over here and this is my
dashboard it's saying this is the
endpoints you know hit for the period
this is the breakdown of the kind of
things that I've asked of my data and
what's really good as as soon as you
build one of these yourself you test
with a small group of people as soon as
you push it out there to get a broader
group of people to test it a whole bunch
of stuff is going to pop up on here that
you weren't expecting people ask
questions and you know heaps of
different ways and they have a lot of
different approaches to getting the
information out and so the good thing is
that it also provides and suggested
utterances where it looked it's learning
from what people are asking or how
people are asking questions and it's
using that learning to suggest new
entities or new intense or
ways of doing things if we have a look
inside of the intents themselves I've
actually only got one inside this model
and that's get garmin data and the
reason for that is the only thing i
actually want to do with a spot is
search across my data I don't want my
bots to do anything else rather than
search across my data so everything kind
of lands and that if it doesn't land in
there at lens and none and the bots can
then say I don't really I don't
understand your question
try asking me things like and then give
some examples we now come into here this
is utterances so this is things like you
know what was my resting heart rate last
month and this thing on the right here
is is amazing
it's called date/time v2 and it is a
built-in entity so when you come down
under your entities you'll notice that
there's a pre-built entity just sitting
over here there's a collection of
pre-built entities which means that
someone else has done all the work to
determine what last year looks like what
last month looks like you know what all
of those things in relation to time so
you don't have to do that work you can
just pick that one up and what I've also
done is created this kind of hierarchy
for things like active minutes because
active minutes has very active minutes
and moderate of active minutes which are
two different data sets heart rate has
resting heart rate minimum heart rate
and maximum heart rate because those are
kind of my data points and then as you
asked for those different things it will
break those down into those those
different models and this thing down
here is really great this this is a
feature sets so what you can do in here
is you can actually swap a whole bunch
of different exchangeable so what what
I'm basically saying here the word beer
is exchangeable with these other words
now beers ale brew bruised ale and when
you start to put words in here it starts
to suggest other related words that you
might like to include as well so it
smart enough to say well maybe you want
to consider these other words and if
they're exchangeable they're purely
going to swap them when
seize them and the reason why this is
important is I don't speak Norwegian but
I can say how many beers did I have in
2017 and for anyone who speaks Norwegian
in the room hmm
so apparently according to Google that
is how many beers did I have in 2017 if
I was to run that against my lowest
model so let me come over here and say
put that text in there there it's saying
it's identifying that word beer as the
Norwegian word for beer it's also
identifying this word here as count for
how many so and then it's knowing about
the date and the year so if what that
means that it means that if I was to
paste that into my bot my bot
understands it and comes back with 411
beers so it
although Norwegian isn't supported
inside Louis as a language just yet you
can still gain support by using this
approach of you know putting keywords
into the entities that you have if you
want to understand the language the
other approach that you can take here is
that you can translate the phrase that
comes in using a Translate service API
and then call Louis in English and have
that response come back and then
translate it back so there are different
approaches you can take
right now Louis supports a number of
languages Norwegian isn't one of them
but that's kind of a technique to to
make that work if I have a look over and
back into my Louis example these are a
number of other approaches that you can
you can take so over here and publish
and train and test
and when you make changes to your Louis
model you need to retrain it and then
you can publish it out and once you
publish it out that end point is
available inside of your bot or inside
of your application now you need to
think about what that means in regards
to DevOps there is in point slots for
you know staging production so you can
you can run a different cycle if you
push it out to production you're
basically changing the behavior of your
bot in production when you make those
kind of publish changes down here as
well
you can enable spell checking which
means that a people must type it it
knows them as typing and adjust them and
changes it and you can change the time
zone of your endpoint as well so what
does last night mean and well you kind
of want to have a time zone reference as
to last night or as to you know this
week so that can that can give you that
and then as you extend that and provide
you know the different models for it
you bought your bot gets smarter and it
understands more things and it's able to
respond better to the information that
you give it so if I come back through
here I think so I think that's pretty
much what I wanted to cover up today I
know it's late on a on a Friday
afternoon and I didn't want to run too
long so I intentionally made sure that I
I wouldn't do that but I did also want
to take you through the repository and
so what I first gave this talk and when
I was up at in DC in Oslo and what I did
over there was I was still using as your
edges sorry as a search inside that
solution so there is some references to
that there but I've cleaned it up and
I've made the code available and I've
also published on this readme a step by
step approach of each of the steps that
I came together to put the solution
together so you can actually treat it
like a recipe and follow through and
I've included my own sample data out
there as
well so if you don't have access to your
own wearable device or if you're not
getting with your own data and you can
leverage my data because I've tried
having having a reasonable amount of
data is important I've got friends who
have just started employing the solution
from my code using their Garmin device
you know where they've had it for three
or four months and there isn't really
enough data beer to train the model to
get the the right feedback for them just
yet
but having that but so but when they're
running it against my trained model it's
still providing some degree of accuracy
in some degree of feedback and what I
want to do next with us is actually made
this a little bit more universal so I
can get more datasets and training so
that it can equate to more people who
are who are starting to use it and I
haven't extended it to two other
wearables just yet so it really is you
know working off garment but if you've
got other wearables and other forms of
api's you can you can use that as well
and as an alternative solution so with
the links of providing some resources
here so that's a link to the github page
with the code and there's also a good
tutorial on using Azure search and
cosmos DB with the bot framework at that
as you search bot sites so if you wanted
to step through a tutorial to get
started that that can do that there's
the email cheat sheet that we talked
about earlier and the bots are this is
the other thing I wanted to show you
bots bot framework comm that's where you
can publish your BOTS to the different
channels Louis today I and the bot
boiler which is the example from Ezzor
and Jordan so if I show you this mass
but here and this is where Microsoft
makes it available for you to publish
your BOTS up to Devo framework comm and
the good thing about this is that this
takes care of the hosting and
distribution of the different channels
you might want to have your bot consume
through so you could add things like
Cortana slack and you know a group
Twitter 1204 SMS telegram teams as
different channels for your bot to
interact
and once you add them they're published
up here as in points so I've got
facebook messenger running Skype Skype
for business and web chat if you want to
test your bot you can test it in here so
I could say and what was my lowest hat
right and this week and oh oh I know
what's happened it's the sessions timed
out
sorry so if I test that I could say what
was my lowest heart rate this week and
that enables you the tests you bought
and get your information out inside this
channel so you don't have to worry about
the the writing for the different chat
clients that's going to be handled for
you through this some channel connect
and then you just need to focus on you
know the workings of the bots and the
information that you want to put
together for it so overall that's my
little journey the experience that I've
had and if you've want to reach out to
me you know I can reach out on Twitter
really interested to see what people do
with us and how others can learn from it
as well because I'm really encouraged by
other people coming up to me afterwards
saying hey I was really inspired by you
know that idea of change and tracking
behavior and I'm seeing a lot of others
you know pick it up and run with it
themselves so thank you for that and
right on four o'clock on a Friday so
thanks a lot and I hope to get into a
joy of being with you at some point
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
