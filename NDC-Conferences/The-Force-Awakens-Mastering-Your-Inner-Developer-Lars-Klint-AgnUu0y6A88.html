the original session that was meant to
be in here right so you want to see Star
Wars yeah okay let me just close
that door there we go
all right so I'm it's kind of a bit of
last-minute but I'm pretty happy I'm
here to do this talk because I were kind
of pushing for it because this is
something that is really close to my
heart and I think that especially
developers need and we'll get into what
it is that you need but bear with me
it's probably taking me six seven years
to write this talk it's a talk that's
sort of been mulling even before I
started doing public speaking it's
something I needed to share I need to
get out this is also not a Tech Talk so
if you expect to see code you'd expect
to see you know Darth Vader running off
across the screen it's not what's gonna
happen so as I said about six years ago
my life kind of changed and it changed
in a pretty dramatic way but before we
get to that I got a few questions for
you first so this is a conversation
right now I want to talk to you guys I'm
not here to talk at you I'm here to talk
with you because see I've already scared
people away this happens this some of
you might not like what I'm going to say
and that's fine you can disagree you can
walk out that's fine you're lost
really so first of all are you satisfied
and I mean I use satisfied with where
you're at in life are you satisfied what
you're doing right now
are you satisfied with where you headed
are you satisfied with the way that your
life is shaping satisfaction is a core
human emotion right it's something that
we strive for but at the same time are
you empowered to do what you want to do
are you empowered to chase this
satisfaction have you got the
empowerment
that you need from family friends
colleagues whoever to actually pursue
this right and I know this is all a bit
airy-fairy because we like to work with
biedenbach bits and bytes right and
that's why I'm doing this because most
of us will never ever consider this are
you leading are you actually leading the
life that you want are you actually
taking charge there's a few nods here
that's excellent
let's see at the end of the session
alright I'll challenge you a bit I'll
kind of get a bit annoying to be honest
but these are really important questions
if you've never asked yourself those
perhaps now at the time okay now who
here has a family exactly right we all
have family and I cannot stress enough
that family is the most important thing
in your life family comes first
there are moments where I forget granted
yes does happen especially when I do a
trip like this right especially when
you're wearing a hololens but family
comes first
family is the most important thing and
it's all the stuff that I want to share
and kind of tell you it's all with
family in mind all right
anyone have ambition see there's like
three people five people all right that
should be the same as has you got family
right ambition is what drives you in
life you might not know this but
ambition is the key to move forward
right and I'm sorry there is no stagnant
state do you either move forward or you
move backwards that is in my experience
that's there's only two directions you
cannot stand still and who wants more
come on really everybody should be
wondering oh I don't care what more is
right it could be more time it could be
more time on your horse it could be more
friends accout or whatever it is you
gonna strive for more I know this kind
of that's very capitalistic of you it's
all about money and now it's not all
about money it could be more time into
kids ticket you if you
you're content where you are I'm sorry
but you sir you know very mistaken now I
wrote this talk I gave this talk first
time about six months ago and just
before that I had a what do we call him
Twitter friend a guy I've never met in
real life but I know him through Twitter
you have people like that or social
media you know snapchat I'm a bitter old
fish that shout I've been told but this
guy tweeted this need a new job getting
desperate now and I've secured his name
because I don't want to ask him right
but I don't think he was asking for a
new job it's a cry for help it's
something else that's going on because
changing a job is easy but you might not
like it but it's easy getting a new job
especially as a nerd is not hard right
there's plenty of jobs around so I kind
of reached out to him and said hey
what's up and it turned out that he was
actually not set he was not happy with
the direction he was going he had dreams
and wishes and and thoughts about how
his life should have been but it wasn't
and this is how he kind of told me all
right but he's not alone like they're
all over this was one search from
Twitter back in July or August look at
that guy
I'm ready to die I'm ready to die holy
 right you share that on Twitter I
bet you hasn't told his parents oh sorry
but we're not like these thoughts and
these feelings and all this you know
stuff that we don't talk about it comes
out like that and we all have them maybe
it's it's part of everybody that we need
an outlet we we want change we want to
move forward we might tell ourselves
that we don't for a bit but you will you
will want to move forward and they might
come and you know I don't know how your
journeys kind of pan out but you can
actually take charge of it now why am I
here telling you all this right so I
don't want to boast about a little me
I'm on stage right but to put a bit of
context around this this is me today
so I run crazy dane software I made that
logo by the way like it so I'm the
graphic designer
I'm the chief architect I'm the director
I'm the coffee lady it's just me right
I'm freelancer that's what I do but I
choose to do that it's a choice it's a
very conscious choice so I can choose
exactly what I want to do I help out
creating an event in Melbourne that's
where I live kind of called developer
development Villa I believe you haven't
been in the UK as well as I write DDD
yeah cool
excellent fantastic event I love it I've
been doing it for seven years now we're
gonna do it a number eight next year I'm
gonna change everything
it's awesome I do Pluralsight courses so
there's a bunch of pleura site offers at
the conference speaking and not speaking
and the content that we create I'm
really proud of it is by far the best
platform for technical learning in my
opinion and I get to be part of it and
it wasn't by chance I made a conscious
decision again to hey I want to produce
courses for that right I'm a Microsoft
MEP means I don't work for Microsoft but
they give me stickers you know they
wanted me to put them on here
I don't do stickers but oh well what it
also does is that it gives you a foot in
the door especially when you're
freelancer cuz I gotta chase jobs all
the time right I gotta chase all the
leads cuz no one else is gonna give me
work but me having that sticker or that
little title means that people go huh
even though they'd actually don't know
what it means but they've heard of it
and say he probably knows what he's
talking about
I'm part of what's called guru IO whose
girl status sounds very important
doesn't it it's actually job searching
platform but I write for him and I help
them build it up to something and from
that since I did this talk last time I'm
nicely taken on mentoring as well so
I've got a mentoring out of my business
because I like sharing people and you
know I don't I'm not very nice which is
why it works okay
I Lenovo inside I'm a little insider
which is kind of a way of innova saying
hey you talk about stuff we've
you talk about stuffing use our products
would that be cool and they give you
devices but it's not like I'm saying
Halen Oh was the best move if you read
my review of this machine I'll say it's
really good but you know so it's a way
of again choosing an Avenue that's kind
of fits with my persona I write for a
site called site point Melbourne and I'm
in the process of writing book for sync
fusion and it's it's gonna be done three
weeks ago yeah it's still in progress
but I'm not just all work right
I'm member of three car clubs Jeep
Melbourne Melbourne Jeep owners club the
BMW car club Victoria and vanilla
overclocked which is like a Speedway
type thing right I like cars I love cars
many many many people pays me out
because I like older cars yeah are you
like going to the shed and find rust
I run a B&amp;amp;B in Victoria in rim in
Australia the bed breakfast and we have
a used car business as well so I don't I
don't sit around okay and I do all this
because of what everything I'm going to
tell you in this talk alright I kind of
want to push you I'm not saying do all
this if you don't do it more why should
you but I want to kind of show to you
that you don't have to be 95 right oh
yeah this dude I cloned I think it's a
there's nothing of his mother in him I
cannot run away from this I didn't know
anybody's doing but this is the most
important thing in my life despite
everything else I do right this little
boys I'm his whole world so that is you
know it's paramount that whatever I do
is some way related to his benefit and
I'm sure you feel the same way if you've
got kids and I do get to live here which
is kind of cool right so that's our
property down to about there and there's
the house we've got some containers for
cars and we've got some fields and stuff
I love where I live and I've chosen it
it's a very conscious decision to go and
live in the middle of
know where I have a very interesting
talk in Australia internet hmm so that's
me
but I actually want to start the
beginning and when I say beginning I
don't mean me when I was born right
because that's pretty boring I don't
remember anyway I want to talk about
about six years ago seven years ago when
my life completely changed like 100
percent 180 degrees whatever we gonna
say it I thought I had a maid right I
went to uni I did really well at uni
because I'm a nerd I did really well top
of the class got medals and stuff and
 right whoo all right got an awesome
job I got a house I had a house that was
overlooking national park had big
windows big buckle and on top of hill um
my job we all got a job but I had the
job right I actually got to look at car
data all day my test data was cars it's
perfect yeah just made in heaven I had
the car I had the big Aussie v8 all
right the thing that you know if you
worry about fuel economy you don't buy
that car okay I chose to have that car I
looked out for it I've chose it was
right color black leather I had the car
taken oh shut up
it's a Kelly
ve que lo v v8 lots of ease apparently
if you ever been to Kelly
no-one they understand why the hell you
would name a care after that sound him
but I thought I had it made right I had
everything society dictates this is what
you need right my parents always told me
hey you go to school you do really well
at school then you go to uni do really
well uni you get a job and then you get
a house and you get better job and you
get a better house and then you get a
better job and you probably get a wife I
had a wife as well but what really was
happening was kinda like this this
wasn't me right I was doing everything
that society was telling me that I had
to do everything I was doing well I was
you know going up in the gray
whatever but it was just a bit of a
front
it was just not me I was not being true
to what I actually wanted
I even had that view from the office
that's not my office right I wasn't the
manager but the view from the office in
Melbourne but ever since I was kid I had
this little flame so I was the guy at
school you probably know this the same
guy if you weren't the same one was girl
that if someone said hey who wants to do
blah you might hate me pick me right I
always wanted to do the thing I always
wanted to explore I always wanted to try
the next thing you know and often I got
yeah not be enough right but close
because I was the nerd why wouldn't he
no--don't to teach her like to you what
but that was me and I had this little
flame and it was always there and I kept
kind of you know Fanning it and making a
bigger one but I got a job and it died
because I was no longer in charge
Society was in charge they were telling
me you got to do this you got to get a
you know job whatever and then something
else happened
there's something called a catalyst you
all have we all have one of these or
more in your life there will be a
catalyst moment in your life for me I
found out my wife was cheating on me
that was hard
that was the darkest moment I've ever
had
what the hell do you do I had about a
year I didn't know what I was doing
around I was living in this house I was
I didn't know what I was doing I had no
idea but I found that little flame right
that little flame came back in the midst
of all the chaos and I'm not gonna lie
to you
holy was scary there were moments
where I had no idea I didn't know what I
was doing because everything that
society told me what's going to happen
society didn't right I did everything I
did everything right and it still went
to
I'm sorry I'll get rid of that guy is
that better
so it's not easy right and there are
moment where you go I'm not even good
enough what the hell am I gonna do cuz I
had all these ideas I had plans I wanted
to do this and that and the other but I
like where do we even start I don't know
I didn't come up one day and say I'm
gonna speak it and do you see London
that's what I'm gonna do no I didn't
know I didn't even know that public
speaking was what I was really
passionate about so what do you do
luckily I did meet someone in my life
that kind of kicked me into gear I
happened to live with her and that's the
mother of that boy saw before and she
looked she taught me about goals
goal-setting
so there's anyone here set goals cool
that's good
yeah does anyone want to share a goal
you don't have to I'm not gonna you know
point out anything yeah Christmas Sagan
keynote ad build okay right so is that a
goal or is that a dream it's a go okay
so when it's gonna happen you say five
years no what is it gonna happen see
what I'm getting at in five years that's
right how are you gonna do it see this
I'm not having a go at Christmas because
it's pretty brave today actually put is
there not right but my point is that
what you're describing right now is a
wish it sounds like a goal but the fact
you gave our Fabia's to me that says
hang on have you thought this through so
I have something I want to share which I
use which is called SMART goals and I
know it's a stupid acronym for heard
right I'm sorry but it's the best way to
remember it
so SMART goals are a way of getting
goals that you say I want to be know to
bill because that I think that's an
awesome goal don't get me wrong one of
mine is I want to do a keynote at Ted in
2018
another keynote saratoga 10 I'll settle
for TEDx to start with but I want to end
up with Ted right
and the Smart Girls is part of the way
of getting there so they've got to be
specific the more specific you can be
the more chances are that they actually
going to be real if you can see them
well you know what you're working
towards specific specificity oh that's a
hard word in a second language there got
to be measurable if you can't measure it
how do you know you're staying on track
how do you know that from two years from
now I'm sorry I don't want to keep
picking on your Christmas but it was a
it's a good example how do you know if
two years from now that you already
three years away you know I mean you
gotta have these measurable milestones
targets whatever you want to call them
mini goals I don't know come on what you
want but you have to be able to say hey
I've done progress or I haven't because
otherwise again it's just a wish it's a
dream they've got to be attainable right
you can you can obtain anything you want
but you got to make sure you can get
there you've got to have small goals
large girl but in the end you grow with
the size of the goals right so don't
make them too small either because if I
had a girl say I want to speak at NDC
London next year right but I'm more yeah
but it's not really goal because that's
too easy that's kind of like Oh what did
well so they got to be big enough for
you to it's gonna be challenging it they
got to be relevant right it doesn't help
if I said oh I want to be an astronaut
it's not relevant I'm never gonna be an
astronaut right I'm old I'm a geek I'm
fat you know it's not gonna work so
they've got to be relevant to what you
are who you are and what you want to do
relevance is key in terms of bringing
motivation to reach these goals and then
what Krista's did do was town bound that
gotta be a time on it there has to be a
time on these goals because if you don't
have a time what happens know anyone
don't be a finish orange please
UMaine exactly right you probably won't
reach it because what happens I'll do it
next month yeah I know you know what my
leg really hurts I'll do it next month
you got to have a goal there's nothing
to say did you can't change the date of
course you can but if you keep doing it
it's not really a goal because you don't
have a date but who knows what happens
your life you don't you can't plan
everything so of course you can be
flexible that's not all I'm saying but
if you don't have this written down it's
not a goal in my opinion it's not a goal
it's a wish it's a dream it's a thought
it can be a goal absolutely but it
doesn't have God if doesn't had all the
attributes it won't be now the most
important thing of these actually is
that you write them down
I mean pen and paper I don't mean Excel
or an azure database or a manga or
whatever I mean write him down on paper
there's a connection between your hand
and your brain that does that if you
write them down they stick and then what
do you do when you've written them down
anyone yeah
tell other people yeah yeah absolutely
that's very good some goals you might
want to keep to yourself but if you want
to share by all means but what I was
getting in was that put him on the wall
flow text he could take whatever works
put them on the wall and put them on the
wall where you are every single day
because you keep looking at him and it's
been proven I think it's even Harvard I
don't have to reference as such oh no I
do have the reference sorry I did right
I mean they did a study with MBAs and 3%
of MBAs that were writing down their
goals we're also the top earners all
right so an MBA that's money
whatever your goal might be so ride him
down all right and you can do this in
about 38 minutes when I'm done okay
there's nothing it is anybody here done
a new year's resolution Oh get out no
news resolutions don't work right why
don't start now why do you have to wait
for the first January it's it's kind of
an excuse to just say well did Sami
it can start at any time it doesn't
matter so why do I have goals again
these dudes right I took these guys so
that's the Berlin Wall in Germany not
that far from me it really and I took
these little fellas there in June to me
that was a huge thing because it's part
of it's part of my history as a Dane
that they've all fell down
it's part of your opinion story it's
part of especially this guy's right
whoops that guy he's me and if I hadn't
had goals that would never have happened
you don't just take you know five people
into Germany for three weeks so that's
part of what I do to get where I wanna
go
does that make sense and you can ask
questions at any time I don't mind I
like questions because that means you're
listening okay if you don't ask
questions you have to put a green in
there now you can put whatever you want
now you've done your goals right so you
gotta list the goals however many you
can come up with and you keep anything
and you keep writing new ones you keep
completing them but you test copy work
in Walled right you can't just start
writing your goal and go I've got a goal
yes no to the pub you know it doesn't
work that way
and you got to work on your goals all
the time it's not a I'll gonna do it on
Sunday goal you've got to be every day
even mentally right of course you can't
do something every single day on every
single goal but because you look at them
every day right because you got them on
the wall means that they're always on
your mind
so you're subconsciously you're working
on them sorry I'll get realizing you see
very very often this is the feeling you
have you kind of know you're on the
right direction but you're gonna end up
in a hole you don't know where you're
going right I'm centering myself cuts
being recorded and and this is this is
important part of the journey right
because you don't know how the goals
gonna pan out you know how you want to
go there but the reality is that it's
gonna be kind of a you know SMERSH
worried way because stuff happens life
happens gets in a way stuff you didn't
anticipate but if you have a goal you
can at least readjust so you know
where you're headed right otherwise
you're just gonna get knocked off the
track and go the other direction
that scares me here still especially the
whole Ted thing no throw it feels like I
want to do it but like imagine stealing
what is it six thousand people or
something yeah okay so there's a few
ways that you can begin to achieve these
things and I want to go through a few
different methods or methods topics
there has helped me tremendously grow
progress whatever you want to call it
from about six years ago so bear in mind
six years ago I didn't do anything I
went to work because that's what you did
and I went home and I played a computer
game and I watched a movie or I mowed
the lawn or whatever it is that society
tells you you have to do right and then
I started changing so this is a big part
of sort of achieving your goals in my
opinion like you may disagree with all
these that's fine and please if you do
you yell out a lot feedback so that's
one way of realizing you goes it's it's
meeting other people all right and
there's this old saying that you are who
you associate yourself with right you
are essentially actually was talking
with Steve about this on the weekend you
are like the five people closest to you
all right so if you hang out with sorry
losers right if you hang out with people
who have no ambitions that don't want to
take initiative anything you're gonna be
the same way and it might be a childhood
friend you've known for 25 years but the
reality is if you don't want to if you
want to move forward as they're holding
you back right it's pretty brutal I know
but I've cut off people that were
negative that kept sort of going my
other half Fiona she calls it the birds
the birds that come around and pick and
go are you sure I sure wonder that sure
right sure sure sure
it is peck at you and they keep pecking
until Sun you go no I don't know I don't
actually think I want to I think no no I
want I don't I'm not going to do that
those people
should be chained up let's go with that
because how dare they tell me what to do
right
alright so network start your own me go
to group you know whatever it is go and
meet people go and talk to and find out
what they what makes them tick you don't
have to talk to them forever if there's
someone that you have nothing in common
with you go okay that was cool hey see
you just move on right but get out there
I know especially as nerds it's not
always that easy cuz you're a girl you
go you like Warcraft you know and we
have that sort of little bit of a stigma
to it but just get out there everybody
really and you know what the easiest way
is to get people to talk just ask them
about themselves
it works every time oh so what do you do
oh it works people like talking about
themselves this is kind of what
neighborhood feels like sometimes
because you more you do it the more
meetups you go to you keep intersecting
with people that you met before and then
certainly someone else did you talk to
no someone else you talk to and they
talk to each other and know what happens
suddenly opportunities come up and you
go hey we saw you do the thing with the
thing do you want to come and talk about
it or do you want to help us out at work
or do you want to you know what I help
us with this project and I promise you
if you just start talking to people just
really nearly even the conference right
I bet you you know about 0.6 percent of
people in this room just start talking
to people say hey that was cool I saw
you did the thing or what do you do
whatever it is just bring it up
opportunities will come but then what
happens on your flip side of this is
that it just keeps coming and you got to
learn to say no right if it's something
you don't want to do you gotta learn to
say no I am really saying no I
always say yes and I get in trouble for
it because what happens is that you go
completely bonkers because everything is
top priority and you can't do it you've
gotta learn to say no that's good isn't
it
so you just keep saying yes and there's
Indian you go yes sure okay no idea what
I'm gonna do but yay and then you just
end up looking like that
right you're gonna shut down and you
just it's going to be too much so
networking is good but the constant
traffic your way because what you put
out there comes back I promise you what
you put out there comes right back and
if you're positive about things and you
excited about what people are doing and
you collaborate you communicate it comes
back and you should see my inbox another
thing that most people are uncomfortable
with is leverage anyone know what I mean
when I say leverage or just have a guest
is not one definition of it but yeah
when you have something someone else
once and they have something you want
someone said ah so you have us you have
a thing or a skill or a trait and you
can use that to get others to do
something you wanted to do pretty much
right it's it's good example for example
is so um I don't have eight million
dollars but if I were pounds let's go
pounds but what if I found the perfect
block of land or rules you know building
site and I was a property developer and
I go alright how do I get eight million
dollars to buy that thing hey this guy
over here is filthy rich but he doesn't
have time to deal with it what if I use
his money to buy the thing and say hey
you know what I'm gonna give you nine
million back when it's all done it's
leverage right before you gotta do your
numbers but you're leveraging his money
he's leveraging your time and skill it's
leverage it's usually a win-win I hope
it's a win-win
otherwise it's taking advantage of
people but you can leverage everything
in life and there's nothing wrong with
it people are often not very comfortable
so hey do you want to do the thing for
me because I kind of I don't know how to
do it but you're really good at it and
then in you know I can give you
something in exchange people just don't
like doing that DeVry
especially geeks especially geeks I'm
one of them right yeah I'm just gonna
have a look at Wikipedia and you go oh
is that how you do it and you do it you
try and do just
right leverage this the the the some of
the paths is often greater than the
whole right it but you get all get more
out of it
something done I'm does that make sense
by the way please ask questions because
you've very quiet still alright
something that I struggled with and I
still do is focus I am not good at
keeping focus I'm especially as you saw
all the things that I try and do no
don't use the word try I just caught
myself
don't say try he either County can yeah
it's like Yoda says do I do not there's
no try right it's true don't say try it
don't say can't either but focus I'm
like a squirrel like all that shiny and
I do that thing right who there's an
email who I'm terrible at it but it's
something I'm working on focus is one of
the things if he can focus on a task and
I know people that are very good at it
also of this conference it's all shiny
guy if you ever met him very good at
focus like you talked to him what in the
morning in the afternoon you get and he
said oh I just did the thing we were
what I had lunch
you know because the focus is just but
I'm not very good but if you can keep
focus that's a huge obstacle yeah why do
you need focus whoa no no so when you
say works for me is that based on all
the that I put on the thing yeah
okay that just means I work way too many
hours but it no you're right that of
course I have focus in moments right
there there's always especially
something like deadlines like oh no like
a doing a talk like this that's a
deadline you've got to get it done right
but there are things like the book I'm
writing I just want to finish my pearls
like course first so I just push the
book out and it gave yourself another
three months but the focus to me is
often because I have the B&amp;amp;B and I have
the kids and I went I've just struggled
finding me even just 20 minutes in one
task yeah how do you
how do you learn focus there's certain
techniques there's some really good
music by Carl Franklin that's out in the
booth done every box if you haven't
heard it's called music to code by and
it's based around certain 60 to 80 beats
per minute something there's a he's done
a lot of research about it but listening
to that kind of gets you in the groove
so I've used a muse music a lot music
soundtracks like I started listening to
the interstellar soundtrack have you
heard that it's it's very sort of
ominous weird futuristic music but it
works it just kind of gets me away the
Pomodoro Technique which I'm not too
familiar with but essentially you have a
little clock and you set it for 25
minutes and you do that task for 25
minutes and it kind of like I know what
do you do if you get interrupted I guess
you shoot him I'd write sure off but you
keep doing that task right for 25
minutes come hell or high water
that's ask so there are there are
techniques that you can certainly
implement and it's all about routine as
well I should probably stop doing some
of the things some of the time to be
honest rather than doing everything all
the time because it doesn't benefit me
but you know I just want to kind of put
it out there that yeah I do lots of
stuff but doesn't mean that I can do it
all perfectly that's not how it works
anyone else okay surround yourself with
experts right because you cannot be good
at everything
I hate housecleaning I just and my other
half Fiona she hates it even more plus
she's asthmatic so she can't do it she
says so we have a housekeeper we have a
professional to do it for us because
they do a good job and they do it let me
tell them - it's like using an
accountant don't try and do it all
yourself because you go mad Hey yeah
whatever it is that you feel these make
sure the six-person your oh yeah but
they cost money
ah yeah but what happens if you don't
pay them you get stuck with it right and
the time that they spent say you pay
$200 200 pounds whatever fun accountant
helped you that frees you up to make
three
pounds right that's the idea so that
your time is spent on being focused no
I'm doing the stuff that you're good at
experts are key it's like having a
personal trainer there's a reason you
have personal trainer because if he
wasn't there she wasn't there you
wouldn't do it right you'd get fat I
don't have a personal trainer and
experts we can't all be as smart as this
dude right he is smiling mm-hmm
we need experts it's really important
that you have experts in your life
because you will go mad if you don't
this one I'm particularly good at
persistence as it says the fact of
continuing continuing in an optional
course of action in spite of difficult
or opposition the birds that's one of
them right you got to kind of shoot the
birds you got to get rid of them
persistence is not easy persistence is
when everything seems to fail and you go
I'm still gonna do it and you do it like
I'm not saying you know follow the GPS
off a cliff
that's not persistent that's just
stupidity right I'm talking about
following that goal and achieving it and
making sure that it happens despite what
everybody else says because if you do
all the stuff that I'm kind of preaching
know that I'm talking about you're gonna
end up in the 2% of the population that
does all right
the other 98% doesn't and they will try
and tell you that you're an idiot for
doing it there's knowing when to stop
yeah yeah absolutely
dude yes there I was I started writing a
book for one of the big publishers and
my background well my MVP was originally
in Windows Phone development I know I'm
that guy and and I'm still I still have
a Windows Phone right I still have them
I think I have all of them in Australia
and I started writing a book about
mobile development with Windows 10
and I wrote trip three chapters as
you're supposed to do within a certain
date and whatnot I got to a party this
is stupid
why am I writing this I'm spending a lot
of time like you we're talking a four
hundred and fifty page book right and
you probably won't spend ten hours per
page all up it's an amazing amazing
amount of time so right now I'm not
doing it so I wrote I wasn't being nasty
I said it's about saying no right I said
no this is silly it's not worth my time
it's not worth any effort whatsoever
it's not gonna benefit me in any way so
yeah there's absolutely the time where
you go no but persistent is critical to
especially to achieving goals because
there will be times where you go can't
do it it's not gonna happen but you can
you can absolutely do it questions
anyway change your quiet yes down the
back can you tell me about networking
yeah sure so what do you want to know
mmm-hmm
yep
so so you're asking how do you take the
first step how do you know what the
person next to you in front of you it
sure
mm-hm
mm-hm
I think I know what you're saying so the
question um I think let me paraphrase is
that when you start talking to a person
you've never met before and how do you
gauge the level of conversation that you
need to start at is that right
mm-hmm
so how do you gain experience to gauge
the level of technical skill I guess
when you talk to people it's that's a
kind of interesting question because I
don't think it matters if you're if I
stand next to this gentleman here in the
coffee queue right I go oh hi how you
going I'm last instantly you're
introduced right and you and I just got
us so what do you wit company do you
work for
you don't have to start with saying hey
do you do the handle bar J s JavaScript
on the theme yeah you don't have to
start right there you can sort of have a
much higher level because very offer me
to say hey where do you work
people go oh I work at the you know X
way X Y Z Zed Bank or something and they
go oh right you developer and they it
automatically so they just ask broad
questions and it might be that he go
what why are you talking to me in there
okay you just move on right you can't
control what people think about you
the changes are that if they're in the
same head space as you are trying to
actually connect with people and meet
them and explore and whatnot they'll be
very open to talking to people most
people have no problem replying talking
back is that first they were saying hey
how you going you know that's the hard
part
for some reason I've always found it
very easy oh but but I know it is you'd
need that first interaction I don't know
who that person is why would they talk
to me you have that barrier so I don't
think you need to worry too much about
the skill level I think they'll come
naturally and if it is that you suddenly
find yourself talking to Douglas
Crockford about JavaScript Rob's back
away right
you know actually he's very nice doctor
so does that answer your question in
terms of networking is much more about
just sort of almost shotgun approach
initially going who are all these people
who can I talk to and so what if you get
stuck for 20 minutes talking to someone
yeah you've had that experience might be
something comes of it maybe not but
you've got to talk to people like all of
the work I get as a freelancer all of it
has come through word-of-mouth
I'm not kidding every single project has
been through someone I know or someone
I've met
someone that heard about me all of it so
I'm not saying you should be a
freelancer anything because that's
freaking scary but you if you don't talk
to people all this is gonna be so much
harder so much harder anyone else about
anything yep absolutely
yep so I can go back to the book example
cuz I had a go I always wanted to write
a book because I wanted the experience
of I've always been quite impressed with
people to write these thick books like
how the hell do you do that like where
do you get all those words from right so
I want to do it so I started it and
that's when I essentially quit the goal
like I said I'm not doing this I've
reached as far as I'm going to go and
it's not worth my time
what I did there was I kind of rewrote
the goal and I got introduced to sync
fusion in their ebooks which are 100
pages and much more sort of high-level
lighter reading all right all right I
can do that so that's what I'm doing now
so but if you you can absolutely cancel
goals but it's got to be a conscious
decision not a I'll rather play xbox
decision right it's got to be because it
that is not worth my time
but you're in charge of that that's the
power you have that's the empowerment to
lead the life that you want to lead
right does that answer your question
yeah I want to touch on something that
most people always are afraid to ask
about you every good income right
because they don't like talking about
money we don't ask people what they earn
we don't you know we don't like it right
and I think it's an important part of
the equation of because we all like
money all right even if we're not a
capitalist or whatever we still need
money to pay our bills and buy food and
buy new iPhones and whatever else did we
buy right money is a part of it
and there's no way I could be a member
of three car clubs and we actually have
17 cars right now because we do cows
like cars they're not all drivable
there's four of them that kind of don't
have engines but there's two main ways
of earning an income does anyone know
where they are
yes active and passive exactly so what's
an active income someone else sorry a
job yep
that's a general term a job yeah it's
trading time for money right so it
doesn't have to be a job jobs or such
but you absolutely right I have some
time I sell it to you and I actively get
paid because I did those hours I did the
thing all right what I stopped giving
the time I stopped making money that's
an active income does anyone want to
guess what a passive income in that
investment yeah could be Pluralsight
it's when you stop doing the thing you
still get paid right we like that
because like what did the thing I'm
gonna go to holiday I'm still getting
paid yeah
that's passive income and those two are
really important to identify because
active income you might earn a really
good salary but when it goes it goes
it's gone right yeah there's nothing
else it's a good example of passive
income as Chris just said before Prasad
for me anyway so PROSITE you do a course
you get paid to pour complete the course
then you get a commission based on the
number of hours out of total hours
watched that your course are responsible
for right so the better the platform
does the better the more hours I get
more money oh but I can work on the next
course while the other eight or nine or
whatever I have still tick along right
it's compounding that's passive income
any other good examples those investment
that was good one
sorry pension okay we should talk more
are you talking about government pension
I'm not sure what the system is like in
Britain but I've never heard pension
being a good idea it is it is a form of
income after you start working sure but
it doesn't really compound and it will
stop eventually and to be honest I don't
know but in Australia when I'm 70 or
whatever odd there's not gonna be a
pension it's too few people to pay for
it I don't think there's gonna be any
patient it's gonna be you're on your own
so that's enough but it's not completely
wrong you're not completely wrong I just
kind of disagree anywhere else rental
properties yep
those are really hard because you need
quite a large margin to get in but
they're really good if you do get into
rental properties mostly the market does
not drop over time at least
but passive income it's it's really
important part of your safety net if you
think there's something called a secure
job no it doesn't exist all right this
is again what society tells us it's what
my parents told me get a good secure job
all right my brother's been in secure
job always been at several actually it
doesn't exist just as easily goes away
as if you're not having you I'm not
saying don't get a job that's not what
I'm saying you got to do what's right
for you but I'm just saying that's not a
safety net having a job all right any
other questions no all right
and you turn right
you you got to get deathbed out of your
life you got to get the the magic force
that stops you from doing what you're
doing out of your life and I think Goods
first step is write a goal if you don't
have goals if you do have goals look at
them again review them make sure you're
on track but if you get anything out of
this session that I can pass on that
make a huge difference to me its goals
and it might sound a bit wanky but it
works and write it down
not in Excel it is really important
goals is the one thing that will change
everything for you and you might not
believe me right now but it will and
then when you've done your first goal
you can email me and I'll print you out
a certificate how about that it's it's
my message to you anyone want to ask
anything you can come out of coming up
and ask afterwards as well if you don't
want to ask in a public forum yep
so the initial goals mm-hmm yep mm-hmm
so the question is what that that flame
I was talking about it's the best way I
can describe it anyway when it went away
is that the question what what were the
goals of the time what it was I was
pretty young I was I moved away from
home when I was 17
not cousin like my parents but I moved
to Canada and I just wanted to explore
and just that flame kind of kept me
going for quite a while which is why I
ended up here in Australia because I was
23 when I moved to Australia from demo
and that's when I went to uni and the
whole thing just started just slowly
dying out and I lost I lost that passion
of travelling well that's not completely
true but I lost the passion of exploring
travel is part of my lifestyle I still
went on holidays and one on and I think
that flame was probably still there but
it was being suppressed something
shocking because there were all these
stigmas of society that said hey you
know what you got to get a really good
car because if you get a really good car
you're gonna get respect from that guy
over there and you're gonna look awesome
right there's all these monikers that we
have around what society tells us and
this wasn't me I didn't give it
what they thought of my car especially
not now have a 1985 BMW Nights and I
think I think it's probably the girls I
had were not defined but I wasn't
pursuing anything other than kind of
what was delivered to me someone else
was controlling what where I was going
well
yeah six years ago first goal that's a
good question
yeah I mean it wasn't overnight
obviously took me about a year to
actually get into that mindset I think
the first goal was to to get out of a
rental from memory I think that was
certainly one of them that I was a Kip
so I had a house that we bought and then
I went into a rental and into rental and
I was just sick of sort of opening that
we don't go throwing money out so that
was a big part for me because I was I
felt like I'm not going any
I wasn't investing I wasn't doing
something I think that was it there was
also a couple around personal
development but they'd be more private
to be honest I was a question down the
back yeah
the experts is everything all the birds
sorry yeah oh yeah yep mm-hmm
yep how did you with that burden that's
a good question you need help it's very
very rare than you can know seriously
hey I don't mean that kind of help it's
good to have someone to hold you
accountable and that's in that regard
because if you constantly say to
yourself no I can't do it if you have
someone that keeps saying oh you can do
it and you're going to do it and you're
gonna do by that date and I'm gonna kick
you up the backside until you do it all
right you can pay me to do that I'll be
happy to do you need someone else to
help you with that I don't that's you
can do it on your own
but very rare you need to kind of like
let it out and then have someone on the
inside that knows kind of what you're
going through I don't think that's I
wouldn't certainly wouldn't deal with
that myself a mental personal trainer
yeah that's good that's good analogy
actually yeah I like that and it could
be like it could be a family member or
it could be your best friend it could be
your boss
it could be someone completely from the
outside that you find in the user group
the you network whoever whoever you can
trust in you feels gonna not just hold
your hand but actually gonna push you to
do more because I think we all have that
little bird that sits and goes no I'm
telling you the first time you speak in
an event when there's like 600 people in
front of you there's a lot of birds a
lot of it's kind of like how you deal
with it
anyone else Steve Steve Oh
so have I ever had to deal with impostor
how do I explain impostor syndrome I
guess it's kind of like why would I why
do I think I'm good enough to do that
when you set a goal because I was saying
you need goals that are big enough so
that you push yourself and that what
Steve just saying is a huge part of it
because you automatically go I saw that
dude up on stage doing it well I can't
do that why would I want to do that you
know I and how I deal with it hmm
because it comes
that's pretty natural to have impostor
syndrome it's good I'm not sure how I do
it I'll probably I'll probably talk to
someone as well and I'll probably try
and try us a dragon damn it I will go to
the first step of the goal and then
because I can achieve that bit I might
get enough confidence so not focus on
the end goal necessarily Rob Connery
that's here as a speaker if you've heard
of Rob he's just written a whole book
ebook on impostor syndrome and it's
unbelievably good because he's been
dealing with it a lot I think he's also
got a talk on it not here but in
somewhere but impostor syndrome that's a
good one
that's certainly something that people
struggle with because it's pretty
natural
anyone else woo-wee good hands now Hey
yes
oh there's a good one how do I make sure
I got enough family time essentially
almost always saying right it's
especially hard when you're not in a in
a nine-to-five job because I'm my
commute in the morning is about 27
seconds and it makes it really easy
right I work from home to go on just I'm
just gonna do another hour I'm just
gonna and it makes it really easy to
play with Christian on the floor and
just check your emails all right and I
get in trouble for that and rightly so
so how do i balance it I try and make
very very specific time available
especially for Christian like I kind of
feel kind of gets it although she gets
annoyed as well why are you stopping
when you quitting error and it's again
it's especially for using techniques
that were talking about but the Pomodoro
keeping focus on something if you say
I'll gonna do three of those and then
quit and then stop you've got to have
some sort of plan with me with
Christians kinda like when he's awake
I play with him y-you know not
throughout the day someone else is
looking after him buddy at night you
know if he's there I'm there as well the
11 year old is a little bit trickier
because he got to the stage now where he
says well you work all the time anyway
you know so it's hard finding the
balance it is really not easy yeah
yeah yeah so the question is do I have
shorter term goals that were you saying
am i making new ones all the time I
wouldn't say all the time but I'm not
hesitant to create a new one if there's
something at all yeah and I keep
prioritizing them as well like there are
some things that really are on the back
burner because you just can't do
everything but I had a goal last year of
I wanted to be paid to speak right
because these conferences here we don't
get paid as speakers right they pay for
our flights and accommodation but
especially as a freelancer I'm here on
my own time right so I had this girl
saying what by the end of 2016 I want to
be paid to speak I want to have I didn't
care what it was like you know $3 yay
but I just want to have someone
appreciate that I'm there and I'm you
know sharing knowledge that I've
acquired over a long period of time
whatever whatever and there's a fee
involved because it was important to me
to have that acknowledgement that I was
my time there was valuable and I did it
I was in Poland for a week in December
and they even found me again
it was networking I was putting it out
there you know hey and they found me so
it's smaller girls yeah
and I regularly cross them off too as
well with the cab business I had one
where I just wanted to buy a car and
sell it for double what I bought it for
you know it doesn't have to be but I've
never done that and we did that last
week so I wasn't even there so yeah
there's lots of girls that you can see
it and they they have to be ambitious
but I don't have to be big so yeah I
think last one
yeah I deliberately didn't put anything
about burning out into the slide bag
because it's almost a talking itself at
least like 2025 minutes in my opinion
burning out it's really quite a delicate
topic because it hits people in
different ways
I can be completely flat out for six
weeks and then have a week off
it's not because I'm burned out it's
just because I need a break but some
people might do that falutin and be
burned down right it's it's it's not I'm
not comfortable talking about it in -
you know - what do you call it - streak
- terms I guess but it is it is a
problem because the more you take on the
more you say yes the more you have to do
and you just don't have any time to take
care of yourself I should exercise more
for example right and I don't so there's
always something all right I think we're
kind of out of time because it's three
o'clock I can't take one more if you
want with people here because I know
though it's a few hands yep it's a very
good question if you have a two-year-old
for example how do you know that you're
progressing how do you work on all the
time you need to have as met as many
little milestones as you possibly can
right because it's kind of how do you
eat an elephant one bite at the time
right but you can see the progress and
that motivates you as well but if you
just have you know say in five years I
want to talk I'll be a keynote to be
good at ignore build so thanks go where
the steps you know it so you might have
the step Christa's I don't know you
didn't kind of but you need to have
that measurable again the SMART goals
you need to be able to measure where
you're at and it's not easy I'm not
saying any of this is easy if it was
easy everybody would be doing it yeah
all right that's but come up afterwards
if you want thanks guys appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
