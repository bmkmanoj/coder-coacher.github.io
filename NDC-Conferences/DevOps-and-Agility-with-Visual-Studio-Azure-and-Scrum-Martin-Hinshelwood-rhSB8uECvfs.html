oh jeez oh by the way when i say my
organization i mean just me you know you
like to kind of make yourself seem a
little bit bigger than you are it's just
me is me myself and my boss who approves
my expenses which is me just kind of
nice so I have a surface my goal is to
help organizations get better at
delivering software not just get better
at delving software but help them
deliver software that is of value to
their customers which is actually a
little bit more difficult in pursuit of
that I've been I guess along a few lines
one is I've been at TFS guy for many
years I was an engineer that's maybe
making it seem a little bit grander than
it is that's we put in your CV I called
eat for 10 years for banks and for all
kinds of all kinds of weird stuff you
wouldn't imagine what you probably do
because you guys could too yeah but I'm
also a professional scrum trainer with
scrum dark which is Kench waivers
organization their own since 3rd and 10
and I'm a visual studio alm MVP that's a
kinda is actually generally I can a
weird combination of being in both
process and tools because the tools guys
tend to hate the process guys and the
process guys tend to hit the tools guys
so i can have to fight with myself over
that and I just I know if enemies coming
to NBC Oslo you are awesome you're a
welcome to come and join us for tough
mudder afterwards on the sunday after
NDC oslo as a group of us doing tough
mando jacobs going to be there
conference organizer Adam cogans coming
for the second time I'm sure what's that
you're in awesome vehicles you just want
to watch that yeah it's pretty funny and
for those that don't know what tough
mudder is it's a 18 kilometer of stickel
course designed by the British special
forces so it's kind of fun running
through fire and getting hosed all kinds
of weird stuff it's it's it sounds
harder than it is because you get to
tell people you've done that
but it is a little bit easier but I
although I'm based I'm actually based in
Glasgow in case you figured out from the
accents but I don't spend much of my
time in Glasgow which you probably also
figured out from the accent because you
can understand me I spend most of my
time traveling around the world with
different customers sometimes the same
customer multiple places helping them
and it's interesting how different
cultures approach the problems of agile
of scrum of DevOps and how that impacts
on the way they do things and ultimately
the way the rest of us interact with
other cultures as well because we in the
West can be very critical of some of the
Eastern cultures and the way they do
things but it's just different yeah
they're very critical of us as well by
the way how we do things oh yeah I had
that that was supposed to move when i
clicked it one of the interesting things
that I've been talking about recently is
whether you want to be an amateur or
professional an amateur is not really a
good word not a good fit for what I
actually mean so I actually cool out
feed an african words I spoke at agilent
Africa two years ago I did the one last
year as well and it's a word Calla bula
some awesome words because it actually
means a bunch of things as lots of words
tend to do it could mean amateur but
it's a little bit more like cowboy but
maybe a little bit closer to con man so
maybe a dozen inauguration today isn't
there a little bit of caliber there
because I believe that a professional
software team is one that can deliver
working software on a regular cadence
that meets your customers needs how many
of your teams do that
yeah there are people that do that but
not all of us do and you go to a
different country country company and
you have a different experience and I've
actually caviar see this for me working
software means that there's no crashes
or unexpected behavior because people
can see we'll just call it working and
ship it anyway that's not the same thing
how many of you have software that meets
your customers expectations when you
ship it s I know you do do you ship at
least every 30 days awesome the working
software every 30 days in front of your
customers so you're pretty far down that
line many people are not that far out
there in that line many people try it
and they have a hard time doing it so I
trying rather than I know I said con man
i use the word Cal Abdullah but I try
and avoid putting down it all down time
11 we're not deliberately doing these
things most of the time yeah unless you
work for a Volkswagen I think maybe
maybe that was a little bit more
deliberate but I've also agile / scrum
they're really really the same thing
these days I know they're different I
know that fundamentally if you research
these thank you you find the differences
but when people say they're doing agile
most people are doing scrum the majority
of teams that are doing some form of
agile are doing some form of scrum and I
do use the term some form of scrum very
loosely because for most teams we're
doing scrum but we're only doing
stand-ups yeah we stand off and have our
two hour meeting
and that's that's I was figuring out how
to build our software and that's not
really what what we want we want to
figure out why this thing is not working
for us Phi has a jewel / scrum /
whatever you want to call it feel to
deliver so I'm going to explore i'm
going to use scrum as the example there
are lots of different ways of
approaching agility most people end up
in the same place some of you are
delivering well so maybe some of the
ideas i'm going to talk about don't
apply to you but i'm sure you'll have
met them before first off we came up
with some rules the rules to play the
game one of the problems with the rules
is most people haven't actually read the
rulebook and the other problem is they
think it comes with a strategy gate if
you go out and buy monopoly the board
game would you expected to come with a
rule book code of strategy gates a real
book not to figure out how to win at
that game and if he didn't read the
rules would you expect to understand how
to play the game now so why did so many
people not read the rules how many
people here are doing scrum I'm okay if
you're just calling it scrum that's okay
that's included in that yep feed more
people for their hands up okay how many
of you have read the scrum guides but
half the people that said everything
straight yeah and probably that doesn't
apply to the rest of your team because
of the reason you guys are at a
conference you're already in the upper
percentage of people doing particular
process he's practices understanding
your your craft because you're here to
improve it you're going to different
talks so you're all familiar with the
scrum framework yes okay what's the
what's the purpose of the sprint review
you want to
no okay yes to demonstrate what you've
delivered that's that part of that might
be something you do during that what
what's there we go it's an inspect and
adapt moment a Kazon moment whatever you
want to call it it's a place where we
can stop reflect on something and make
changes we're going to inspect the
product that we've just delivered how we
did it and update the backlog yeah it's
the updating part that's the important
part of that a demo might or might not
be part of that whatever scrum guide
doesn't really talk about demos you just
want to present your work for feedback
but most people treat it incorrectly
most people treat scrum I just picked
one event but they're all have the same
issue every event in scrum is there to
provide inspects in an adaption every
artifact and scrum is there to provide
transparency you guys have product
backlog yep is it visible to everybody
in your organization so on the wall
there you go transparency anybody a
stakeholder can walk past and see where
things that they care about are and
maybe they want to go and have a
conversation with the products on it
transparency and then we have three
roles people think of them as job titles
that they're not really they're just
rolls they're a hat we where we might
wear other hats in our organization but
the three storm rolls are there to
provide accountability each one is
specifically accountable for something
and if it's not that's where we're
falling down a little bit but what do
people do with scrum I had a
conversation with there was an agile
talk in here at nine o'clock I think and
like I coined this term I don't remember
his name but he said most people treat
scrum as a checklist scrum we have a
list of things
are we doing be difficult and enough
doing our daily stand-up check we're
doing it right forget the reason for
having the thing in the first place
we've got that thing we call it that do
we have somebody who's called a product
owner okay do we have a project manager
it's like scrum master scrum master
check yeah and it's not going to work we
need a product owner we need them to be
accountable for value in the product
that probably means they have profit and
loss account ability if you don't have
profit and loss accountability where's
the negative impact of building the
wrong thing are you really accountable
if you're not in charge of the money
many organizations I've got a few
anti-patterns here I want to talk about
but I want to talk about more than that
because many organizations use projects
instead of product and if you focus on
delivering projects and you care about
the delivery of project well your
customers don't use projects they use
products you need to make them the same
thing the money flows into the product
and you build different things in there
otherwise you end up with technical
decks you end up with fragmentation one
of the biggest anti-patterns is an
absentee product owner you might have
somebody who's called that but then
they're not there they're not available
they don't actually do the thing they
don't own the backlog if you don't get a
good bike lock from your product owner
who makes the decisions without my team
you guys just give all we got to do
something can't sit here and do nothing
all sprint so we're just going to pick
stuff to work on is that the right thing
for your business does that fulfill the
strategic direction of your organization
maybe in a small organization you guys
have that understanding but in a big
organization a big products I've got a
organization in Norway that I work with
that has 90 90 odds teams working on one
product
in 12 locations in nine countries that's
hard to all of them know what's going on
not even close so having an absentee
product owner is really bad my favorite
one is in the product owner says they're
too busy to turn up at the sprint review
my favorite one and I always say to them
well if you don't care about the product
enough to turn off at the sprint review
why should your development team yeah
absentee product or no that's one of the
big ones if you're looking at in your
organization it why you're not being
successful at agile the majority of the
time it's the product on a roll that is
lacking it's not having good backlog I
have an expression and I say if you walk
into your daily scrub and your
development team doesn't totally
understand everything you're going to
select from the backlog and it's already
got a value associated with it by the
business it's already got an effort
estimation by the team it's already been
broken down and actionable if that's not
true you're not doing refinement you
don't have a good backlog has the
product owners responsibility you need
to get there
over commitments of teams in their
sprints is a really hard on keep a turn
it's a really hard one to get out of
because people think they need stretch
goals the problem is we have this iron
triangle from traditional project
management that still hangs around even
though we see we're doing agile yeah
we've still still have people in our
organization that want to fix shared
your score and resources so the only
thing that can vary is the thing they
can't see at least the can see just snow
is quality what do we do in scrum to fix
quality to put a pin in it if a dash
nishant I've done here is our minimum
quality bar we're going to achieve at
the end of every iteration that's the
thing that I hold the development team
accountable to if you have a product
owner but they're not accountable for
delivering working software you probably
end up not delivering the right thing
maybe you build awesome product maybe
you get the best quarters in the world
but if they're not working on the right
thing you're still not going to make any
money or as much money as you could make
product owner is critical and they
should be looking at the market if
anybody here have sales teams that sell
features in your product that you don't
have yet okay they shouldn't be doing
that because you cannot make any
guarantees and software about when
something might be delivered you just
can't anytime you are relying we need to
stop doing that again we're back to Cali
bula
is the organization's like Microsoft who
recently made a large transition to
agility they tell you about stuff once
it's in the product so they have a bunch
of stuff that they turn off they hide
behind feature flags while they're still
kicking the tires but while they're
still kicking their tires they know that
we can ship it because it's in the
product is done might need some tweaking
but it's mostly there we can say we've
got that and if you don't have a product
owner that's looking forward in your
markets looking at what your customers
are going to ask for tomorrow not just
today you'll end up with the sales team
having to sell product features that
aren't in your product in order to get
ahead because your competitors have
those features so you have to that's
your product owners responsibility to go
and figure out what those things are and
get ahead of that curve and that's hard
I couldn't figure out what to call this
I know what I mean in my head if you're
British or anywhere in the Commonwealth
you are understanding Chinese whispers
it's a little bit non-pc though these
days in America they call it the
telephone game does everybody know what
I mean so it's a couple people shaking
their head so it's that a game that you
play in school where you line up hole
all the kids and you whisper something
in one person of the year and they
whisper it to each other all the way
down the chain and what comes out the
other side not the same so if you have a
large distance and many people between
you and your customer how would you
possibly expect to build the right
software because what the message is
going to get garbled get tighter
feedback loops more often just because a
development team needs left alone during
the Sprint they will build something
doesn't mean they're not involved in
refinement which also involves the
customer get right up close to the
customer
there's a lot of fallacies about scrum
and one of them is that you don't want
developers to speak to the customers
want to keep them as far away as
possible many people believe that that
that scrum says you have to do that just
like scrum says you have to stand up
during your daily stand-up scrum master
also a very important role I see most
teams most organizations that don't have
good scrum masters fail because people
get distracted they go off in different
directions that aren't necessarily
optical they have arguments in the team
which disrupt the behavior in the team
and there's nobody there to facilitate
solving those problems I'm not asking
the scrum master to physically solve
those problems but they need to be there
to facilitate it so things don't get out
of hand you heard the expression
invisibly present a scrum master should
kind of be in visibly present they've
done enough they understand enough about
the team the dynamics that they can cane
and not look like they're not doing
anything but just tweaked every known
again it's very powerful role but
they're responsible for the process
one of the biggest fan p patterns is
taking a project manager and calling
them a scrum master not going to work
for you generally I find project
managers make better product owners
because they usually care about the
software and delivery they don't care so
much about the process except when it
serves their damn chart yeah lots of
vanity metrics Komodo project management
because again we're thinking about
project rather than product I hate
vanity metrics do you guys have any
vanity metrics in your organization dude
what i mean by vanity metrics our vanity
metrics are awesome they make us look
good i used to work for merrill lynch
when I was a coder and we had this task
we had to do every week where you fill
out a spreadsheet with all the projects
you're working on because you know
you're working on more than one project
and you have to see how they are and
have a little color coding thing that
goes red amber and green and most of
mine would not only be read kind of
sucked at time management yeah because
five out of the six projects I was
working on was read all the quarters
handed that over to the the team leads
who got all of that data pulled it
together into his spreadsheet and all of
his projects will read she was a
hard-ass not good I need to show some
something needs to be green and
something needs to be amber so he goes
and tweaks the data until he gets it to
look like he once and then he gives it
to the project manager the project
manager has lots of projects and he does
the same thing tweaks it and all the way
up the organization and then somebody at
the top mates makes a strategic business
decision based on crap valency metrics
that's not the worst one I've seen that
one's kind of understandable or with an
insurance company in the US who had five
projects for the year every one of those
projects had a listed in this
spreadsheet that was like an executive
report and it had original estimate in
Aris actual estimate in our ass for each
project yeah because obviously you want
to try and get them as coarse as
possible and all of them were within ten
percent two of them were within five
percent that's pretty good going one of
them was dead-on I think it was 3600 in
something orders estimated exactly the
same delivered so I just turned it round
said that this is this is this is BS how
did this happen now while the figures
were so bad so much difference and
management beat up the project
management team for it that they decided
to create a system whereby the project
managers could submit change requests to
the original estimate and this this this
project manager just got their change
request in at the last minute business
is making decisions on it Calla bula
fiction
but it's also common okay so we tried
with with just process what else did we
pull into to this puzzle of software
delivery i get i could actually talk all
day on processed as functions but we
decided that no well maybe we need to
focus on engineering a little bit more
that makes sense yeah we need we need
some engineering standards continuous
everything is a good idea and I'm not
saying it's not just like I'm not thing
scrum as a bad idea engineering
standards are a good idea but they kinda
ended up a little bit weird because
people like Microsoft handy does slides
like this everything on that slide is a
good thing I'm not going to object to
code reviews fact I think they're a good
thing automated testing telemetry
release management there are things we
should be doing is met I'm sure if
you're delivering working software every
30 days you've got quite a lot of these
things in your software it's building
built into the software yeah if you want
to do it well and you want to do it fast
you can't go to build it in okay that's
sounds fair
compile deploy you heard of that one oh
I get a scary or story than the one
you're thinking of so I worked with a
bank very large international bank in
Europe I'll not say we're four you'll
guess the bank immediately SF everywhere
and they had five servers in their real
time banking transaction system this is
real time bank and I was working with
them helping them get their code into
TFS and I said well where's your source
control like oh we don't use source
control what do you mean you don't get
source control well it just seems to get
in our way and slow us down so we don't
do it that way Wow okay must have some
really clever solution built into the
software whatever it is what do you do I
said oh we log on to one of the servers
and we just run Visual Studio change the
code and recompile it all right oh okay
you sure there's not some risk in matts
they seem to think it was fine it's fine
they're the only ones that know how to
use configure and manage the system so
management can't tell them to do
anything different because they're like
fine work we're out of here and then
real-time Magna system doesn't work and
like so do you take those dll's that you
just created and then deploy them to the
other four servers and I like no we find
that doesn't work no we go and make
the changes again on the other servers
does that sound like a professional team
okay they're getting paid for it I I
don't let just because we're getting
paid for something doesn't in so we call
professional football players
professional football players because
they're getting paid for it rather than
amateurs but in a complex industry
that's not how we do that if you're if
you're a professional and you normally
are a member of a professional body you
probably adhere to standards rules maybe
you've signed up to some kind of I don't
know what would you call it I will do no
harm code of collapse the word I was
looking for I'm pretty sure there's one
for this conference for speakers that's
the one that stops me from swearing even
though I'm Scottish very difficult some
kind of code of conduct okay okay can we
agree that that's maybe a better
definition of professional for our
industry than just we get paid to do it
because I've seen some vb code out there
and i'm pretty sure people get paid for
it sure yeah you'd be a bad professional
or a good professional absolutely I'm
deciding professional is in the good
category yeah okay so those guys aren't
very professional kind of amateurs I
would just use amateur in that case very
amateur what about if we're not getting
feedback you get feedback at the moment
from your I assume you get picked up
from your customers yeah anybody use
telemetry on their application to
understand what's going on yes does
software product yeah if some kind of
telemetry in your application and you're
going to view that telemetry maybe you
get kalema tree on user usage maybe you
get telemetry on performance maybe you
add those two together and you can
understand whether your deployment you
just shipped is making your product suck
and then you're getting less users or
you change the way your homepage looks
and you get less users or more users
that's good feedback
only better feedback then hulking to
customers because customers lie so you
need feedback can we agree on that you
get feedback from your customers to get
customers in front of your product every
30 days at least every 30 days few
people nodding yeah we need to get our
product in front of customers so that we
can change direction so that we don't
build the wrong thing for too long fail
fast find out you didn't build the right
thing as quickly as humanly possible
starbucks in the u.s. define their
effective planning horizon which is a
clever word for how quickly you need to
deploy yeah as 48 hours they have to go
from an idea to deployed to every point
of sale in the world and 48 hours that
sounds dangerous and occasionally it is
have you ever vince's into Starbucks and
they can't take credit card payments or
they can't take your Starbucks card
because I have every now and again they
have a problem we're cash only today
it's because something's gone wrong but
the value they get from deploying more
frequently overwhelms the loss from
taking the system down occasionally
because something ruled out that was bad
it was hopefully that's the plan
hopefully they're using octopus deploy
and then they can roll it back really
quickly forward forward forward we're
gonna rule it forward forward is much
better than that well if you get data
involved
or if you've no call fer does everybody
here have a quality bar for the product
it compiled we've checked it in maybe
not take two dinners compiles no it's
good we can ship it you guys are out to
piss aren't you ok ok what company do
you work for sir I've seen lots of teams
that that's their standard for the code
works it's compiled I usually ask them
about testing that's the other teams
problem what you mean that's the other
teams problem do you have another team
for testers testing big fence you just
throw it over the top yeah throw some
dll's over that's the best whatever if
your ops team you have an ops team that
deploy it somewhere in the organization
but it's truer than you think lots of
organizations still have the
understanding that you need to have
separate test teams that organization I
was talking about with 90 teams in 12
locations they have QA teams that are
completely separate from the development
teams very rarely do they have testing
skills on the development team so how do
you think their quality is yeah
they're softwares $50,000 a license and
they make billions of dollars of the
year so just because you don't have high
quality doesn't mean you can't make
money and that's usually the biggest
argument for not caring about quality
well we're still making money so why
should we care about that stuff but if
you look if you have no quality bar
you're going to have undone work in your
product stuff that doesn't meet the
quality bar that should have been there
and that builds up over time even if
it's very small yeah even if it's one
percent you didn't do every sprint you
go to ship your product after 18 months
of sprinting because that's what these
teams generally do and they find oh
there's a whole bunch of stuff that
doesn't work do you have your your tests
first you had the expression test first
do you think it justifies the TDD many
people only apply it to TVD I play it to
acceptance criteria I applied to
requirements as well what are your
tester is going to go do on your
software if I don't have that up front
and I have a bunch of requirements that
I give to my quarters and I give to my
testers because you know they're
separate teams my tester is going right
test plans but don't give them to the
development team because they don't need
them to go write the software we should
be able to build the same thing what
happens when we go to run those tests
plans against our software well the
practically no chance of it being the
same time I just spent four days
teaching too strong classes for a
company and I get them to build software
in the class it's green fields so it's
super easy they have to build a website
but most of them weren't web developers
so that added a little bit of fun and
then the rest of them weren't actually
developers I had the CEO in the CFO in
the class as well but yeah I make
everybody books offering because you
have to have built software in order to
understand the complex
years of building software even if it's
simple so I only give them 30 minutes so
you know that's hard but it's difficult
that idea of this no ops Kenya has two
meanings I mean it as the wall between
we fix the wall between Devon tests but
we've still got a wall between arcs so
we throw it over the wall to some ops
team somewhere my favorite favorite
example is a company in insurance
company in the US and their software is
hugely complicated it shouldn't be
because it's not a complicated problem
that they're trying to solve but they
have 600 people working on it 400
testers because it takes nine and a half
thousand hours of QE to ship their
product manual QA because they've got no
automation either so why does it say and
they're not running their fill
regression nowhere near close to running
their fuel regression what they're doing
is picking and choosing based on what
they think might be the things that have
changed and why does he do that because
their software is full of technical
depth so DevOps was this thing I think
of DevOps is a set of practices that
we're going to pick from we're going to
decide which ones make sense for us yeah
some are going to make sense in your
organization some are going to make
sense elsewhere or you might do them
differently but management got word of
this DevOps words and makenna all have
to do it and they think of it as this
magical ice cream but we know it's
another unicorn but this unicorn is the
one could ping the ice cream and we
still have to feed it to our teeth
I'll tell you afterwards for the screen
shots come from it's quite funny but
what we end up with anyway is still a
rundown Shack that's software us the
reality of the software that most people
ship technical debt is an absolute
epidemic in our industry those of you
that are shipping awesome skyscrapers of
software that are beautiful and well
designed and well maintained and easy to
keep clean you're not very common that
is not what is happening everywhere in
the industry I know that you guys exist
as well though the people that build
those lovely terrors of Awesomeness
however you guys don't call me for help
so my picture of how people build
software is very jaded the other way
because people only call me when they're
in trouble same as all the the DevOps an
agile consulting folks so we do have a
very jaded picture so you guys do exist
but you're a very small percentage very
sparse percentage so even though we're
following the rules of scrum and we're
doing this DevOps thing we get
engineering practices we're moving
trying to move towards engineering
excellence we're kind of not doing that
well because our choices are bad so
we're still amateurs we want to be
protect professionals
we don't have values we're making
decisions every day our products are our
development team our scrum master are
making decisions every day about how we
build ourselves where what choices we
make and we perhaps make them because
that customers shouting locust and
that's not really the way we want to go
we need some kind of values to go back
I've got a list if you're interested we
need courage we need courage to say no
to our customer no you can't have that
by next Tuesday we need courage to say
to our product owner that things aren't
going so well this sprint so we get
transparency you can't have transparency
without courage you end up with vanity
metrics
we did focus we need to build stuff
building software is hard need to be
able to focus during a sprint focus on
one thing that doesn't mean we take the
top ten things off the backlog and our
mission for the Sprint is to deliver
these pen various things which means
everybody in your team goes off and
works on their own thing that's not
focus focus is coming up with a mission
for your sprint a goal what are we
trying to achieve this sprint so that we
can all work together to achieve it and
then selecting things from the backlog
that meet that goal so it might not be
the top ten things it may be the top two
things plus a bunch of other stuff helps
us get focused we're working on one
thing less distraction less context
switching what about commitment that's a
good thing to have but I don't want
teams committing to delivering work in
the sprint because commitment doesn't
mean what people thinks it means people
think commitment means a guarantee and
it's not if you look it up in the
dictionary it pretty far from I
guarantee it's kind of a try really hard
to do something so we commit to
delivering working software to meeting
our definition of done in that mean if
that means we deliver half the things
that we forecast we were going to
deliver in our backlog that's okay
because we've get working software will
work at a sustainable pace
I hope we're going to have respect we're
going to respect our customer to deliver
them high quality that doesn't have
hidden work there's nothing worse than
that little bit of undone work every
sprint and at some point your product
owner goes this looks amit this is just
perfect let's ship it and the
development team can it goes well we
can't quite ship it yet we've kind of
stubbed out this bit and we need to
finalize the tests for this other bits
and what happens you end up with more
work to do the products on a can ship to
take advantage of some market
opportunity they've gotta wait it's not
respect there for your customer for your
product owner but the product owner
needs to respect the development team as
well everybody everybody here on a
development team who's on a development
team okay you want your products owner
to respect your opinion as well that you
are a stakeholder to your product and if
you say that's a dumb order to do stuff
in because of this technical reason that
they should trust you and respect your
opinion to take that into account works
always the final one open this we need
to be open if we don't have openness and
courage we can't get transparency need
to be honest with our customers things
our forecasts the reason your customers
hold you to account for when things are
going to be delivered is because you've
proven time and time again that you
don't deliver on time it's not what the
features you want not when you want it
yeah
kill that by not making those promises
accept reality forecasts hopefully your
customer doesn't hold the weatherman
accountable for the weather is that it
was going to be next Tuesday especially
in this country may be sure in the
Bahamas is a little bit easier so open
this we need to be open does that sound
like a list of things that are bad that
we don't want in our company courage
focus commitment respect and open this
because I'm hoping that nobody said in
their flanking I don't want any of those
things but do you have all of those
things can you think about the decisions
that have been made within your
organization within your team the
interactions between your team and the
product owner and think about these are
you meeting them or is there something
not quite right most of the time is
something not quite right with the
values if we add the values to
engineering excellence so we're awesome
at building codes we have a set of rules
so that we're at least all going in the
same direction if you've got one man
team or a two-man team forget the rules
don't worry about the rules sit together
talk to each other and figure it out
yeah do you give 15 people or even nine
people in the team two teams you're
going to have to have some rules so
we're all going in the same direction
then we can be professional
we can make sure we're doing the right
thing at the right time and leading our
customers needs so we need all of those
things a name pecking scrum but you
could replace that with whatever your
favorite flavor of agile process as long
as it's not getting with a w common
sense you can put common sense up there
as well however since most people don't
have common sense sometimes we need to
write the common sense down a definition
of common sense yeah so then you've
created your own little rule book for
how you think things should go yeah
there's a super good information out
there on this the three most important
things I think to read about it none of
them come from me so I'm not making
money when you buy them however when
your company feels to implement and I
can come and help you that's one thing
but the scrum guides it's only 17 pages
it takes you about an hour to read and
it doesn't say anything about user
stories are planning poker or standing
up although I think modern thing is
daily plank keeps the meetings really
short that's the modern one if you're
going to talk you've got to be in plus
it's healthy we'd the scrum guys it's
super simple super straightforward the
values are in there the frameworks in
their engineering excellence isn't but
it says you have to have it you have to
have a definition of done working
software so it's not going to tell you
how to go do that because that's
technology organization people specifics
you guys took at that product super good
boot by Jeff Sutherlands he equates a
lot of the scrum practices to his
military background he was a fighter
pilot in Vietnam and it's interesting
the art of doing twice the features and
half the time if you have managers that
are unsure or executive teams buy one of
these books and leave it in their
bathroom it's awesome I want twice the
features and half the time that sounds
awesome and they go read it
and it's all about those fundamental
things we need to be doing the right
thing not just calling it those things
for those that don't know jess is one of
the founders of scrum he owns a venture
capitalists company he bides failing
software companies implement scrum and
then sells them for ten times what he
bought them for that's what he does for
a living it's an awful lot of money
doing it so scrums got to work for him
and then software in 30 days which is
both Jeff and Kent river I wrote that
one and it covers a lot of the aspects
of how do you go about doing this thing
in your organization so it has more
practices in there more other things
than just the core scrum piece how do
you change your organization because
change is hard and it's not going to be
just about your software teams your
organization will have to change in
order to move towards agility I think
we've got maybe a few minutes for
questions I probably covered a little
bit too much Zebedee have any questions
so I covered some dysfunctions around
implementing scrum there's many more in
there some defunct this functions around
DevOps and just some of the terminology
limitations I try and ignore the
terminology except when i'm selling
something yeah you can sell devops even
inside your organization you can sell
devops so words people who yeah we want
that because everybody says it's good
but that's nothing to do with the
implementation of the thing yes
if you get themes in different locations
good good communication is key so are
they working on multiple products or one
product if you get multiple teams
working on one product you probably want
to look at one of the scaling frameworks
for the operator read scrum I try and
avoid the ones that are really
complicated if you look at the diagram
for it that you usually have some kind
of diagram if it's get hundreds of
moving parts I wouldn't bother keep it
as simple as possible being that I'm a
scrum the org guy I prefer their
framework which is called Nexus which is
about using scrum to scale scrum ie we
don't need anything more per se but we
need more inspect and adapt loops so
just adding a few extra events to
enshrine communication that we have to
have when we get multiple people working
together and let the organization figure
out the rest a lot of the big frameworks
have worked somewhere in some company's
culture and they've created a blueprint
of here's how it can work and we try and
apply it it's our different company in a
different culture and it doesn't work so
well Nexus is about meet your own lips
at your culture of it here's again the
minimum rules to follow so I would look
there start there use whatever practices
make sense though yes what's my
definition of DevOps that's a really
hard I I defined it earlier as for me
it's just a set of practices that help
us deliver sell for a quicker yeah sorry
many many many practices I had a list of
things up on the wall uh let me bring
that back up whereas I could it there's
I still displayed from Microsoft so
obviously their product meets these
practices but wow I know there's some
wiggle room there but monitoring Kalama
tree continuous delivery I want
continuous delivery at least continuous
integration I want a minimum set of
branches lashed branches is better if
you're gonna have lots of branches their
temporary use get yeah did you have a
particular question I'm okay okay so
that's that's a super good question so
the question was how does Application
Lifecycle Management which is another
term that we hear relate to DevOps and
agile was actually a blog post by the LM
Rangers recently which had a little bit
of that I disagree with some of the
detail in the blog post but application
alm is application lifecycle management
so I've got an idea about building an
application all the way through to not
only have we built the application we've
deployed the application we've done
round our feedback loop but that
applications at the end of its life so
you know the term sdlc software
development lifecycle management that's
the bit where you're building software
inside of a LM and DevOps to me is just
a set of practices that helps us do ALM
but LM is not a good Tara many more yeah
ALM doesn't sell anymore because people
don't think it's awesome because it's LM
doesn't care whether you're doing
waterfall or agile or whatever it's just
you're managing the lifecycle of your
product and a bunch of practice is to
help with that and DevOps add speed to a
lab deliver quicker and agile adds a
little bit of organization to that
that's not waterfall does that gel with
your thinking as well another lmm League
yeah is that maybe everybody will give
you a different answer I think I've got
Donovan Browns answer who's there the
Microsoft's DevOps k union of people
processes and products to enable
continuous delivery of value to the end
users that's his definition that's a bit
wider than mine but more of a mouthful
and it helps them sell PFS but it is a
product a selfless make sense any other
questions cool thank you guys very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
