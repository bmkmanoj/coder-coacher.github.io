here so if you came for optimizing the
programmer you are in the right place
I'm Dave and really excited to be here
hello Oslo this is this is fun so yeah I
want to talk to you today about value I
want to talk about the not necessarily
the value that you deliver as a
programmer but I want to talk about the
things that you value you've probably
all heard this story right there's the
this bank that calls you up and says hey
I've got an account for you and this
account every day is going to have a
deposit of 86,400 units of some monetary
Curtis currency right and you have that
day to spend that currency at the end of
the day it is gone and there is no
saving of this thing on you know from
day to day and when when you go into the
next day you start with a fresh balance
of that same 86,400 units and of course
the punchline of this thing is that you
would do in fact have such account and
you know you're you're thinking about
you know what am I going to do with this
account that I that I lose every day
that I'm going to have to keep you know
keep on trying to spend this thing every
day and the punch line is that this is
your time right this is this is the
number of seconds that you have every
day 24 hours 1440 minutes 86,400 seconds
are you going to squander that time that
you have every day or are you going to
use it to your potential in utility of
things that you value and so that's a
very personal question and it really
gets into that question of what is
valuable to you and so there are a lot
of different answers on this so before
we dig too much into value and
optimization and all of those things let
me introduce myself as I mentioned my
name is Dave I am an American I live in
denver and i'm a geek right I love
software I like writing code I am a big
fan of Star Wars have watched all of the
clone wars with my kids and just having
a blast with that I like basketball
most of all I like children my kids I
have three kids two girls and a boy they
are ten nine and seven and they are the
light of my life they are my source of
joy they are everything that matters to
me well that's not true they are most of
everything that matters to me and so my
kids are what's what's really important
to me I some of you are probably at
least somewhat familiar with me might
have heard my voice before because i am
a podcaster i released two episodes
every week of the interviews that i do
with awesome developers developer on
fire comms are not familiar with that
and i've had a lot of interviews with
some amazing people and found out a lot
about what they value and a lot about
you know some stories about their their
successes and failures and all kinds of
things and something that's really
interesting and you know you may be
wondering why is this relevant to this
talk is that i asked each of the guests
about a source of pain and suffering for
them and all the time not all the time
there are a lot of different answers
that i get to that question but very
often write a majority of the answers
have been about not having the time to
do all of the things that I want to do
right I've got so much tech I want to
dig into I've got things i want to do
with my family all of these conflicting
things and we have a problem right it is
universal in the human condition that
the opportunity cost is real and anytime
that you say yes to one thing you are
saying no to an infinite array of other
things that you could have been doing
with that time time is of the utmost
importance and that's why i want to get
into a lot of this using your time
wisely so i'm not an authority right i
don't have all the answers i haven't
figured out a way to beat the finite
nature of time unfortunately right I
wish I could stand here and give you the
answer really I'm a fellow traveler on
the road right we're all together going
down this journey of trying out how to
do the best that we can make the best
use of our time each day to deliver on
the things
that are really important to us okay so
those things maybe software itself right
and that is important right we all want
to deliver business value to our
customers our clients our business or
you know what whoever it is we serve in
our jobs but we have bigger things to
write you need to serve yourself and you
need to give yourself those things that
matter to you to me that's my family
right so I want to talk about motivation
if we are going to dig into this thing
of optimizing and trying to do the best
that we can write just like in software
if you come to me and say hey I want
this widget on the web page in the top
right corner I'm going to ask you why
right I can't really deliver my best on
what you were trying to do if I don't
dig into your motivation and think about
that Pam cellie who was a guest on my
podcast she had this video it was a
night talk at at a user group in
philadelphia i think and i have a link
to that video i have a link on my blog
or that has links to all of the things
i'm referencing here so I it's that i'm
going to give you that at the end of
this and it's easy to get to and then
you can find this video if you want to
see this she had this talk basically
admonishing IT workers to go home and
she used some terms that were a little
more colorful than that and you know if
you're sensitive to those things you
might not want might not want to watch
that video but the gist the the point of
the thing was that if you need to put in
extra hours at the office that doesn't
mean you're awesome that doesn't mean
that you're dedicated and you're
delivering it means that you failed to
deliver on what you wanted to do during
the time that that you had a lot of to
that thing and now you're spending extra
time you are sacrificing of yourself for
free largely right depending on the type
of arrangement did you have with whoever
it is that you are working for so my
motivation is this right this picture my
wife snap to that this was this was
january first 2013 and it was right
after midnight she she posted this this
picture to facebook with a caption of
they
just couldn't quite make it to midnight
right this was the first year that my
daughter's decided that they were going
to stay up and they were going to see
the new year come in and so they were
really excited about that and a little
bit before midnight my oldest daughter
came and got close to me and then my
youngest daughter did and of course
those warm bodies right this is the
result and this to me I I do this this
meditation practice called the quick
coherence technique and part of that is
trying to bring your nervous system in
alignment with your emotions and one of
the things that that one of the pieces
of that is envisioning something that
brings you joy something really happy
and heartfelt and when i do that
meditation technique this is the image
that i see so i just wanted to really
drive home that there are things in life
that are bigger than doing software and
so I want you to be able to figure out
what those things are for yourself and
you probably have some idea of that
already right there's probably a lot of
the audience members that feel exactly
that I do that family is the thing
that's important or maybe you're working
on you know a particular product a
particular business in your day job and
some open source project is your is your
thing that keeps you going right
whatever it is you have something that
is your thing and I want you to be able
to dedicate yourself to that thing in
addition to delivering on your day job
so having addressed the question of why
right I don't want to jump right into
how okay let's think about the what what
is this thing that we are trying to eat
the most performance out of that we can
so we can get our stuff done so that we
can live our lives programmers right I I
really you know this definition is funny
but there's something to it too right
you're a device you are a machine right
you are a collection of hardware and
software working together right you are
a body you are a mind I like to think of
the mind as that thing that software
that's running that is you it's that
thing that is the thing that is your
being when you are doing so
for development work right the software
of the mind is you the programer the
developer has a lot of supporting
hardware to make sure that that software
runs right including all of your organs
right your brain is the decor the CPU
that that thing's running on and there's
a bunch of supporting hardware cooling
systems waste removal all kinds of
things to make sure that that system is
able to continue operating autonomously
so this is this is what I think we are
right we're we're a brain where a mind
running on that brain and we're a bunch
of other things to support that thing
now you are a general-purpose computer
so you're doing things besides software
development thought work isn't the only
thing that you do but in the context of
software developments right that's what
you are your mind and you know that mind
is connected to some fingers that are
connected to a keyboard but that's
inconsequential the mind is the thing
that's really doing the work so I wrote
a blog post a while back about what I
think are the five pillars of optimizing
the programmer and so I one of the
things right the first thing that I put
on that list is hardware we all know
that your software the thing that you
are delivering is not going to run
optimally if the hardware is inadequate
I say that right in adequate right so
you need to have good enough hardware to
run your software ideally you want to
have a big beefy machine that can do all
of these things for you hey and so to me
taking care of your body is the first
piece of optimizing the programmer so I
think there's a lot of pieces to that
and there are trade-offs involved in
every piece of this thing right so your
priorities may conflict with some pieces
of this in an ideal world you are going
to have that absolute nutrition that is
going to take care of your brain make
sure that you are operating on all
cylinders there are reasons that you
might not in fact I myself you know I
went down a path for close to two years
of being very religious about what I
would eat and it paid off and I was I
was in the best shape of my life and I I
could
measure that in the way that I performed
writing software I could measure that by
the way that I would block shots playing
basketball right there were some some
very clear things that do not happen as
much when I'm in the condition I am in
now versus the condition I was in when I
was taking care of myself at my utmost
so but you need to think about that you
need to live your life too now if that's
all about just taste of food well thats
decisions you got to make i found that
when i was eating my best it separated
me a little bit from my family because
my kids didn't want to eat the things
that i wanted to eat and so when I would
take them for ice cream and I would sit
there watching them eat that was fine
but it it drove a little bit of a wedge
I wasn't as close to them as I could
have been when I said okay guys you know
what i'm going to eat ice cream with you
they were ecstatic and we were so
connected so you know these things that
i'm saying here right need to be taken
with a grain of salt and fit in with
your own personal value system and i
don't want to harp on diets too much but
i do want to talk a little bit about
nutrition because it's important okay
now digging into diet and thinking about
the things that you eat and how it
serves you as a programmer well there is
a lot of things that are subjective
about that not necessarily subjective
but there are varying differing opinions
and it's such a complex system that
you're dealing with that it's almost
seeming to be non deterministic as far
as the output of what's going on so I'm
not going to harp on things I'm just
going to say here your brain is made of
cholesterol fat is essential for your
brain to operate so you know and so I
mean there are a lot of people that have
different types of diets vegan diets
things that might be lower in fat and
really you know much of the world has
professed that low fat diets are best
for you I think that's misguided I'm no
doctor so don't necessarily take my word
for it but think about these things and
come to your own conclusions do you guys
know who who this guy is here that I
have on the on the graphic who knows who
that is nobody that this is john harvey
kellogg the name ring a bell the
cornflake right so he was a
very religious man I believe seventh-day
adventists for at least a portion of his
of his religious life and he became a
disciple of another guy named Sylvester
Graham and these guys were very
puritanical in their beliefs about
sexuality Sylvester Graham the the
inventor of the graham cracker right so
you've got cornflakes and graham
crackers the original low-fat
high-carbohydrate foods right not
necessarily original but you know a a
strong case study in that particular
thing now these guys created these foods
designed them specifically to suppress
libido they were sabotaging the natural
workings of the body so I would just say
you know that doesn't necessarily relate
directly to software development but it
does relate to the condition of your
body and some of the things that your
body really needs think about that you
know deficiencies in some nutrients
can't have some very negative effects
both for your brain and other functions
of your body so I want to say two things
about diet before we move on one of
those that I just said is fat right the
other is vegetables you need the
micronutrients and vegetables I like to
say a lot that I'm a vegetarian just not
exclusively because I think it's very it
is essential that you get plenty of
vegetables so if you really want to be
at your best day in day out as you're
doing software vegetables is another
piece of that I think that is a lot less
controversial there's not going to be
too many of us to disagree with that
from from wherever you come you know be
it a mediator as you may be adding some
vegetables is probably not something
that can hurt so the condition of your
body right I want to still dig into this
idea of why right when you look at a
sculpted lean body like this what do you
think is that the kind of body that you
want or the equivalent the female
equivalent right who wants to look like
that there's a few few of us to do right
yeah and so bit there there are some
downsides to this right being extremely
lean means that they're you know that
there are some some
hazards to some of your organs right
there are some health detractions from
being two-lane obviously being obese
going in the other direction has some
health risks but being Tulane has some
health risks including some sexual side
effects right there there can be some
hormone dysregulation that happens if
you become too lean so looking like this
right I think it becomes pretty
superficial when you base the condition
that you desire on how you look and you
know they're there may be some
consequences to the way you look in
terms of being able to attract a mate or
some of those things you know it may
improve your confidence as you go into
certain things ideally I think we
software developers especially hopefully
have different sources of confidence
than really just how we look so I'm all
for being a tip top physical shape but i
think you know be clear on why you want
it and is it really just vanity you want
people to look at you well maybe that is
a valid reason it's not for me so you
know be cognizant of that in addition I
just wanted to share this this would
this was a quote that I found from a
book and I'm not going to read this to
you but I will say that basically the
gist of this from from an author that I
really like a lot tim ferriss he said
that if you eat and take care of
yourself for fertility you maximize that
part of your of your system then other
things are going to fall in line and I
think that that kind of falls behind it
with the the idea of harvey kellogg and
sylvester graham that john harvey
kellogg that this is really a sabotage
of your body if you want maximum
performance your fertility is a pretty
good proxy for that so you know that
that's that's one way to measure how
you're doing as far as your condition so
enough about the hardware right we we
all know that being in better shape
helps us do better this guy is the guy I
think I've going to think of software so
that's that's that's my software right
so you want your minds to be working
well you want your programmer skills to
be working well there's probably not a
whole lot to say about that I threw a
shot in here of a game that i've i've
heard some claims that
mind training types of games can
increase your working memory and your IQ
I think those claims should be taken
with some skepticism there have been
conflicting studies on these kinds of
things but I playing this particular
game dual n-back is something that I
have found is a pretty good way to
measure the impact of some things that
are going on right if I'm making some
dietary changes then I can kind of see
well how does that impact my performance
on some of these kind of these kind of
mind teaser games kind of things so this
is a resource that may be interesting
for you in may not I think the claims
that you will actually increase your
capacity by playing these games is
questionable maybe maybe not but it's
it's worth knowing that there are some
claims out there to that effect training
for your skills right you are here
because you want to listen to talks
because you want to interact with
awesome people because you want to get
better at your craft and so this is you
know you know what you're doing right
video training like pluralsight is
outstanding ways of being able to do
stuff instructor-led training there are
so many ways that you can get better at
your craft and you know about those I
probably don't need to go too much more
into that another thing to write in
order to work optimally you need to shut
down every now and then you need to do
some things to recharge your batteries
right this is maybe maybe more hardware
than software that it's got a software
component to write this was this was a
picture of my daughter on her ninth
birthday her 10th birthday is next week
so this this was but you know this is
one of those things to me that again
right right back to why we're doing
these things and really just getting out
of the office and doing some of those
things so that is kind of my start of
some of the things that you can do to
upgrade yourself and really make
yourself the best you that you can be
further we're going to talk about some
things about the way that you work but I
want to just take a moment here and do
you have any questions anything that you
want me to address before we get going
any further
what questions do you have anybody I
think I can see all right nothing
nothing popping in so I want this to be
interactive too so if you want to jump
in and ask me something at any point you
can try to get my attention I can mostly
see most of you if it's a little harder
up up at the top with it with the lights
in my eyes but so focus right getting in
the zone right finding that capability
where you do your best work I released a
podcast episode today an interview with
jb rains berger who is a really neat guy
in the test driven development community
world and in a psychology kind of
emphasis in a lot of the training and
consulting that he does and he has some
materials about the Pomodoro Technique
and about the idea that getting in the
zone is not about spending a lot of time
doing it it's about focusing in so you
know first and foremost right you don't
need notifications right you don't need
slack always telling you that somebody's
talking to you you don't need skype you
don't need your email telling you that
you have new email that thing drives me
nuts we're right why is Gmail's default
to do notifications right when you on
your on your phone it's crazy right
email is meant to be checked not to be
pushed to you right you shouldn't be
getting notifications so my advice to
you when you want to work is to disable
notifications now with things like slack
and chat with your team that you can't
do that all the time but when you really
want to do something serious you need to
be out of that stuff you can't be having
interruptions all the time I really
recommend the Pomodoro Technique who
uses the Pomodoro Technique here only a
few who knows what it is a lot more yeah
so without going into too much detail on
it and and the the real mechanics the
the simple premise of the pomodoro
technique is that you can't focus all
day right you're not going to be able to
go to the office and do your 825
and just be be a machine the whole day
right you have a limited capacity mark
seaman did a did a talk at NDC 2014 i
believe it was oslo and he he pointed
out that the attention span of a typical
human adult is ten seconds i'm not
really sure where he got that number
from but that that's that's even if
that's not accurate it's it you know so
it's if it's not that extreme well you
still are not going to be able to focus
all day the idea of the pomodoro
technique is take breaks right commit
yourself to a dedicated time period
right the canonical example is 25
minutes right if you can't stay focused
on one task for 25 minutes well maybe
you should try less but i think most of
us you know functioning adults can do 25
minutes of uninterruptedly you can
probably do more and I've experimented
with being a programmer more than that
is probably with the context involved in
software development and building that
up it's often better to do longer time
periods I saw some research somewhere
once and I don't know how they came to
this conclusion but the the conclusion
was that you should work for 52 minutes
and then take 17 minute breaks in
between and I it sounds contrived I'm
really not sure why that is but that's a
it's a fairly decent number right 50
minutes is is something that most of us
can handle and to each his own right so
the numbers the canonical number in in
Pomodoro is 25 minutes with five minute
breaks in between and then some some
more complications beyond that but that
that's you know you can read more about
the Pomodoro Technique if you want to if
you want to go further with that the
idea is work uninterruptedly
notifications dedicate yourself to this
time period and that's it so another
part of actually did want to go there
yet another part of avoiding
interruptions is this getting out of the
office mark seaman and his presentation
said work from home and I think that's a
really good productivity technique right
offices are interruption factories that
was exactly what David Hannum are Hansen
said on my pot
that that's that's one of the reasons
that base camp that they they work
remotely is that it's just a better way
to do it and I think there's there's
limitations to that right there is
nothing like face-to-face communication
to really get your message across but at
the same time being away from
interruptions being able to get up and
you know brew yourself some tea and walk
away that's another thing that JB rains
burger talks about with a pomodoro
technique is that those breaks in
between those focused periods should not
be just checking your email should not
be staying there at your desk and doing
something like that right get out of
your chair walk right move your body do
something and I think that's really
great advice the there's been some some
dogma coming out recently saying that
you know you people talking about
standing desks and all of those things
and I think there's something to that
right you know the saying that sitting
is the new smoking i think is hyperbolic
and probably beyond the reality but at
the same time right even if you don't go
all the way to a standing desk just
getting out of your seat every now and
then is is a pretty good way to to deal
with that so flow right i put a picture
of a book here that that really talks a
lot about this state of flow right and
who's familiar with the concept of flow
surprising i thought i thought that
would be more right so it's something
that um you know you hear about athletes
being in the zone right that's that's
something that is frequently said about
somebody who is really at their utmost
performance somebody who is in a state
of mind of focus so intense that
everything else seems to move away and
developers I think we've mostly had that
experience where you get so immersed in
trying to solve the problem that you're
dealing with that time just kind of
slips away and I've done that working in
an office where I know I my wife
expected me home at five o'clock and I
you know look at the clock and it's 730
and say you know I didn't realize that
the time had passed because i was just
so deep in that problem yeah this is
where we typically do our best work when
we are
focused so deep right it is a mental
state it was a psychologist who came up
with this term a professor of psychology
his name I have a terrible time trying
to pronounce it i believe it's
pronounced me high chicks in my cheeks
in me high that's something like that
right he he's a really interesting guy
he has a TED talk that's really worth
seeing and that that's that's in my list
of links as well and the the title of
his TED talk was about maximizing
happiness which I thought was was pretty
awesome he had a really neat graphic in
his slides in the TED talk which which
is what you're seeing here on the on the
on the right side of the slide and he
emphasized that you have challenges that
you're trying to face you have skills
that may or may not match those
challenges and when you have mismatches
of challenges and skills you have
varying degrees of things like boredom
and you can you'll get into stress
states where your challenges are beyond
your skills and this sweet spot where
the the flow is generated is where you
have challenges that are just beyond
your current potential where you're
really pushing yourself it forces you to
focus in on that task in order to be
able to accomplish it because without
that you're not going to be able to find
that extra that extra gear to be able to
find the way to get into that place that
you're able to accomplish that task if
you have a challenge that is easy for
you then focus is not required right so
he encourage you to watch that TED talk
because he really introduced this
concept of flow he's the guy that
applied the term flow to this state of
utmost focus of the ultimate in
productivity so neat guy mark siemens
talked to about flow was great i came
across that talk with mark seaman
because he was on a podcast right Don
net rocks had an episode with mark right
right you know that came out after in DC
I think they recorded it at NBC and it
was about flow and it was about that
talk and so yeah that rocks the sec
best developer podcast in the world
right so you know so I think those are
really good resources to listening to
mark seaman talk about flow both in the
video of that talk and I have that
linked as well as in that podcast
episode so mark talked to about
test-driven development as being a
really good source of flow not only a
way to to focus and get feedback cycles
then that's something that Steven Kotler
in his book the rise of Superman which
is which is very much about flow it's a
book that I sort of recommend it's a
book that has a lot of good information
in it about flow but it also is really
focused on stories of extreme athletes
and how the risk involved in extreme
athletes right you know people who are
jumping out of helicopters on skis to
you know to try to do some extreme
skiing down a mountain that if they mess
up they die right and that is really a
good trigger for focus and a good way to
get into flow right so he really told a
lot of stories of extreme athletes that
if you're into extreme athletes that
that's that's kind of fun but i think it
was really to me it was a lot of fluff
but there was still some really good you
know kind of neuro neuroscience stuff in
there so it's a book that i recommend
but you know there's a lot of the
signal-to-noise ratio is pretty low so
anyway neat stuff about this state of
flow mark seaman talked about
test-driven development as a way to to
get some of those feedback cycles that
are also cited by Steven Kotler as being
sources of flow so Steven Kotler I
emphasized feedback mark seaman said
test-driven development obviously that's
you know kind of to me the pinnacle of
what we've achieved in software
development as far as rapid feedback and
being able to understand quickly whether
the thing that you do actually did what
you intended it to do so that's worth
listening to as well I liked this quote
from chick semi hi if I'm saying that
right he really emphasized that you gain
joy right the greatest rewards in life
are not from kicking
back and enjoying it right you're not
going to get to some point where you've
made it in your life and now you're
going to enjoy it let's enjoy the
journey right these challenges these
times when we're trying something new
something difficult something just
beyond our current grasp and reaching
for that thing and achieving it those
are the times of greatest rewards so I
want to talk to well actually let's
pause for a moment to that was a lot of
stuff comments questions what do you
have to say about flow I know you have
some opinions on it also there's a hand
over there
don't dig too deep in the problem ok
that's a good comment yes so so yeah
don't dig too deep is the advice that we
have and you know Mark semen in his talk
as well talked about not dealing with
whole systems right that it's hard to
reason about whole systems and that you
you can't really gasp grasp for the
whole system and focus in on that
problem you can't keep the whole thing
in your mind at a time and so to deal
with portions of systems right deal with
parts and so I think that's really good
advice and very related to not digging
too deep right and of course related to
test driven development where you're
often testing units and whatever that
means right that could be a whole talk
to itself but rather than digging into
whole problems so what other thoughts
yeah go ahead that's true yeah yeah so
the comment was that in most workplaces
it's uh it's not necessarily possible to
work in a focused manner and I think
that's exactly what dhh said right
offices are interruption factories and
you are expected to be on slack right
you are expected to be to response to
everything and that your email should be
you know within minutes you should have
a response to to every email and and
yeah those those situations are not
conducive to being able to get into the
zone those those are not conducive to
being able to work optimally so I guess
that leads into a question well what do
you do about that right and i think you
know if you can negotiate some
flexibility and ability to work from
home some of the time that's a good
answer to that right that was something
that mark seaman definitely spelled out
there are you know end blocking off some
time on your calendar a fostering a
culture where headphones you know
mean that you have this uninterruptedly
and potentially from managers as well so
yes there are barriers in most places
and at some point you might come to the
come to the decision of well is this the
right place for me to work if you know
if I cannot move this culture towards
being able to have some uninterruptedly
all need to be flexible as well right
it's you are there to serve this
organization and if if they need to be
able to have you know some meetings and
I would say that you know ninety percent
of meetings are a waste of time but you
know they're there is that ten percent
that do make some sense and so you know
flexibility is necessary so I mean it's
always a balancing act right what else
go ahead so the comment was that you
know this this ideal of having a
challenging task is great if you have a
challenging task and yeah yeah we are
often put into situations where there's
a lot of grunt work right there's
there's a lot of things that need to be
done by somebody and of well you know
you drew the short straw or you're the
guy that's the newest to the team or
girl right is that is that okay gender
term so you you are you know the person
on the team that is newest and so you
you might get to this task that nobody
wants to do and well I think that some
of those things just need to be done and
it's not going to be optimal right and
boredom sets in and really try to get
those things done so that you can move
on and there are many different
situations right it could be that you
are the grunt work Iran the team and
that's all you have is boring task after
boring task and that might that's often
the case with with newer developers I
suspect most of us here are probably
more experienced and don't have that
kind of a situation and it's probably
more occasionally getting into
unchallenging tasks rather than all of
the time that might not necessarily be
the case if you are in a place where you
have boring tasks all of the time and
you are experienced
enough to find another job I think that
would probably be my advice there but
you know if you're if you're the newbie
and you still have some some some room
to grow well then you know you take on
those tasks you do them to your the best
of your ability and you try to prove
that you're worthy of some more
challenging tasks what other thoughts
yeah absolutely so the comment is that
flow and individual performance is only
a part of that thing and I really should
have given the disclaimer to this whole
thing right I'm talking about individual
performance which you know local
optimizations sometimes help the system
as a whole and sometimes don't right
there there can be situations where you
know a developer moving faster means
that all of a sudden there there's
there's a backlog for the QA
organization and it slows down
everything right and so depending on the
structure of your organization they're
probably shouldn't be a QA organization
but you get the point right that there
are times when local optimizations
aren't in the in the best the best
interests of the team as a whole so yes
it's probably a better topic to think
about how do you optimize teams and but
at the same time personal performance
matters too and if you aren't able to
get done the things that are assigned to
you then you know you're going to have a
bad time right lightly life suffers and
and things don't go as well for you so
being the best that you can be while not
necessarily an optimization to your team
it usually is beneficial in the long run
so upgrading how you work the next thing
that I think about is my admonition is
you should know how to use your tools
and at the risk of insulting a lot of
people in here you know I don't like
seeing you know somebody using visual
studio and clicking around and solution
Explorer with the mouse right you should
never have to use your mouse in visual
studio it has a fantastic keyboard story
especially with resharper and that's a
whole other religious debate
but you know this so I I don't mean to
insult you and say that you're doing it
wrong if you're using the mouse at one
point I had a presentation that a
graphic that was the the Cobra Kai from
The Karate Kid dojo says that using the
mouse is for the weak I'm not going to
go that far right that's that's too far
right but you can do better and all of
us can do better I can do better right I
am NOT the epitome of efficiency and
optimal performance so there's always
room to improve and I think that's one
of the cool things about pair
programming is that you can see how
somebody else does something and you can
say hey that's a pretty good way to do
that how did you do it right so know how
to use your tools is my general advice
and I think you know we could turn this
into you know let's share our keyboard
controls and visual studio all day but I
don't think that would be the most
productive use of our time so let's
let's talk a little bit about
productivity tools right obviously a
majority of us are you know lovers of
visual studio and things that that's a
great productivity tool but what do you
think is the best productivity tool
curious for thoughts on this coffee
machine I like that that's a good one
that you probably have mine beat there
that that's a good one I like it closing
down notifications yes yes getting rid
of interruptions that's that's probably
that's probably your best productivity
tool that's good that's that's going to
beat what i have is as best too so yeah
I think those are the really good ones
so I have a strange best productivity
tool this is going to surprise and shock
and alarm you email write emails the
opposite of a Productivity tool no I
love email i think it's it's really the
best the best way to deal with your
tasks to deal with your life and i'll
tell you what i mean by that so David
Allen getting things done right he has
the concept of an inbox and I don't want
to dig into getting things done it's
really not necessarily my preferred way
of approaching tasks but inbox
he's got the concept of an inbox things
are flowing in tasks are coming in and
my response to creating another inbox
whether it be on paper like David Allen
recommends or something else my response
is like the the French occupants of the
castle in monty python and the holy
grail right you've already got one right
you have an inbox your email is your
inbox that's where i go for my tasks
okay so let me show you my inbox okay
and I've got a couple things in here and
so I'm of a religious believer in the
concept of a zero item inbox so every
time that you visit your inbox you
should leave it with 0 items now
obviously when you come in it's not
going to be 0 items okay and let's say
that I have this this task that came to
me in my email and am I going to do that
now no right I use a tool i use a
service to be able to postpone my email
to a better time right so i can forward
this email to say and when am I going to
do this oh I'll do it in four hours okay
I forward this 24 hours at the service
that I use either my friend decided to
tweet about me and so I i can just
archive that right i don't I when I go
to Twitter I'm going to see that anyway
so so I'm back to zero item in box now
that doesn't mean that I did everything
in my inbox I didn't necessarily handle
it but there was something there that
required action I didn't do it right now
i deferred it to later and that's how I
handle my inbox and so anything that
comes into my email I get to make a
decision is this something I need to
read if it's not well you know archive
it right away if it is something I need
to read well is now the time to read it
if it is ok i read it if not then when
is the right time to read it forward it
to to my service that's going to send it
back to me at that time and just just to
to show you the so i use the service
called follow-up CC now they've changed
their pricing model and you're probably
not going to use that there's an
alternative called follow up then
which will which is linked in my in my
my notes on this thing if you think that
this is a good idea and you want to
handle things the way that i do then i
really recommend that service it's much
cheaper than follow if that CC I got
grandfathered in on this on some some
old pricing and so it's it's still
useful for me but you don't want to pay
the prices that they're charging now but
follow up then is a good alternative
with reasonable prices so you know if I
say one minute sending us a you know
hello in DC right I'm going to get an
email in my inbox in one minute so
that's that's the way these services
work and so it to me anything that's in
your inbox means it's something that you
you need to deal with in some way now it
could be that that way of dealing with
it is just archive it right and ideally
you're not stuck using outlook because
that look is just painful right gmail is
so much nicer but nonetheless these
services work it's it's pure smtp right
you are just sending out an email and
ultimately you're going to get an email
back so that is my recommendation for
for handling tasks and it's it's a super
easy way to do that and look at that I'm
back to zero item in box no sweat so
email great power productivity tool yeah
go ahead google inbox yes yeah right yes
google inbox is an alternative to and it
has a snooze feature that does the same
thing and and it's cool it's good i
don't like it because I can't do it
purely you know purely keyboard with all
of the flexibility that I can by just
typing you know a number of hours or a
specific day but but yes so if I did go
to inbox google com this is really just
an alternate view on the inbox from
gmail and you can you know if I had
something in my inbox which I don't but
I can I can look at hello I can look at
my I can look at a folder that I have
right a a label I should say and
I wanted to snooze some item and I'd
never used in box so I'm not as familiar
with it I expect that it should have the
same same keyboard controls as regular
gmail but I don't know so alt s does the
snooze feature and then you know I can
choose from some options here but if I
if I really want to pick a specific time
pick a specific date then you know I
have a little bit more cumbersome flow
to try to do that if I want to say you
know from from my so I got back my one
minute right if I say that I want to do
this on you know jun 27th I can just do
that very easily right here right
without having to do any kind of
touching my mouse and so to me this is
easier of course there is a price tag
with it and you know the the snooze
feature in google inbox is is free so
you know different different priorities
on this thing I think that having a
service like this is well worth the and
I think it's five or ten dollars a month
or something like that but if it keeps
your inbox clear and you know i think
it's it's easier than using then using
inbox you know make your own decisions
about that so email as my favorite
productivity tool that's that's kind of
a crazy thoughts right but so that
that's my my reasoning behind that I
think rather than having a to-do list
and I wrote a blog post at one point
about and I got a link to that about how
to do lists are just they're just
painful right having a giant list of all
of the things that you need to do just
sends me the message of I'm never going
to get all this done right it's
demoralizing to see a list that instead
of shrinking is growing right like you
keep adding things to that list I hate
it mean other people might have
different experiences of using a to-do
list I used to use remember the milk and
it just grew and grew and grew and grew
this is better for me right I have the
things that I need to deal with now and
if if I can't deal with them now I defer
them to a time that's better so that is
my productivity tip for
using email as your to-do list next best
productivity tool yeah I'll go ahead go
ahead yeah so the comment is that in an
email you don't really have any
prioritization you don't have a
differentiation of these this task is
more important and therefore I want to
get to it first with a to-do list you
can do that sorting and put your your
most important tasks at the top you can
eat the Frog first is the kind of the
brian tracy i think is the name of the
author they said that you should take on
that task that unpleasant thing that you
don't want to do first thing it to get
that done in your day so I think that's
a good point that yes you don't have
priority inside of your inbox I would
argue that the the to do list while it
does have priority it's not showing you
the size of tasks to write so you could
have in something enormous and so you
use yes this thing is high priority but
I can't get it done today so I'm just
going to pick the next thing and so you
start cherry picking your to-do list as
well with email at least you have this
this time component right with a service
like follow up then you hour or snooze
from from inbox you you have this time
component where you can say that this
thing is important enough that I wants
to deal with it you know on
such-and-such a date right I want to
deal with it next week I want to deal
with it this week and and follow up then
and follow-up CC have those kinds of
things right I can send an email to I
know next monday or i can send it to
january 27th or you know one year from
now
or you know 30 days from now so all of
those kinds of things so I think by
putting that time component on it you do
get an element of priority though when
things do come back to you yes there's
not any priority it's all one list and I
like to process my email as as a stack
right I just go to the most recent one
and just figure out if I'm going to deal
with that thing and just just go down
the list till eventually I'm at a point
where I've decided that this is the
thing that I'm going to work on now
other thoughts so if this if this
doesn't work for you then it was a
suggestion that that didn't necessarily
work for you but I found it to be a
better way and I suggest at least
thinking about it to me next best
productivity tool i grouped a bunch of
things here together to me this is
automation right that thing that you
don't have to do is the most efficient
thing that you can do I put some
services on here right ifttt and zapier
you guys familiar with these there's a
new new entrant in the market microsoft
flow have you seen that Microsoft has
created their own I haven't really dug
into it to see how useful it is these
things are awesome right who uses ifttt
not many okay if you're writing code to
make you know Google Drive do something
or gmail or Trello or you know a
multitude of services on the internet
that have api's you might not have to
write that code because these these
services are basically event-driven
orchestration workflow orchestration
that you can do without writing any code
you go to their user interface you owe
us authenticate your you know your
google account your you know your your
Trello account you know whatever
accounts it is and they support a ton of
things github right and bitbucket are
supported on these services as well I
have I have some some zapier zaps that
whenever I push commits into some
bitbucket repositories that it tracks
those into another service that I use to
keep track of things that I did today
right so I like having instead of a
to-do list a done list and so whenever I
do commits those commit messages become
Dunn's in my done list and I get emails
that say hey you know six months ago
here's what you did and it's kind of
like oh yeah that was kind of cool I I
did that so I you know I a lot of my
commits are getting automatically pushed
into I done this which i think is also
linked up in this thing so but ifttt and
zapier are cool and I always you know
share these things with non-programmers
because this is the way that they can be
programmers right you are instructing
machines what to do when you use these
things but you don't have to write any
code to do that which you know I know
you're saying well i can write code you
know so but you know the code that you
don't have to write is the code that
doesn't have bugs so you know if you if
you want to you know when something
happens in one place then something
happens in another place including
locations on your android phone right
I've got I've got in ifttt I've got a
recipe that logs every time I leave my
house just tonight it's not really that
useful but I've got I've got records of
it I've got a why things smart body
analyzer that's basically a glorified
scale that's Wi-Fi connected it also
measures body fat with an electrical
current that goes through your body
whenever I step on my scale and this
thing is you know it's got an ifttt
integration I I automatically log my way
to my body composition I'll ends of
things into a Google spreadsheet I've
also got one that if my weight goes
above a threshold it posts to facebook
telling everybody I know that I need
some help I need some shame to try to
you know to get back under control so
you know the just some examples of
something happens in one place you can
do it another you don't have to write
any code really cool stuff i also put
powershell on here right that's one of
my religions is that you should be
writing scripts to do a lot of stuff
right and so from things like you know
if I wants to start
project and I'm you know creating a
visual studio solution and in a
repository well I've got a script that
does a few commits that create me a new
solution and kind of get me started pops
open visual studio with the solution
open so that I don't have to go through
all of those nasty dialogues and you
know all of the things where I always
get the wrong options and don't add to
the existing solution and all of that
stuff right automate some things that
are painful for you so PowerShell is a
wonderful thing who uses PowerShell I
really wish that was more power shell is
awesome right you often you know when
you are talking to and we're mostly
windows people here right talking to
people who are not using window and I
i'm using windows you know ignore the
ignore the glowing apple on my computer
i'm running windows so you know when you
talk to people who don't use windows
right they it's not as bad as it used to
be but they used to look down their nose
at you right and say you know you're not
using the command line right you're not
scripting things out your your III there
was there was one guy that I worked with
that was this hard core java programmer
and he said that you know people who
were getting dotnet certifications are
certified dragon droppers and I I as
much as he's wrong about that he also
had a point right we should be using the
command line so so do that and
powershell is cool because it has
aliases for everything right you can use
bash commands against powershell you can
use you know the CMD commands and it
just knows it knows everything it's like
talking to your spouse right or like
having some intermediary that knows how
to talk to your spouse right it's it's
beautiful so it just know it understands
whatever whatever it is that you're
telling it so it's great and then beyond
that of course visual studio right we
all love visual studio keyboard driven
workflow live your life from the
keyboard inside of visual studio and you
will be happy so this this is by my page
that I have on my site that has the
links that i mentioned and i think we're
actually getting close to the edge of
our time here so that should be an easy
URL to go to and that will have the
things that you
that you're seeking if you want to see
that Pam celly video if you want to see
chicks and me high and his TED talk if
you want to see mark semen all of those
things are linked up there oh and links
to two ifttt zapier and you know a bunch
of the the services and follow up then
all of those things so with that what
other questions are there nothing else
okay I think I think do you guys want to
well so yeah I'm Dave of course right
yeah so remember that listen to
developer on fire it's awesome you're
really going to enjoy it and as I hope
you enjoyed as much as I do I I have
been considering that some of this stuff
about you know workflows managing tasks
being awesome in visual studio and
powershell if there is interest I could
maybe put together some kind of course
related to that stuff if people are
interested in that so I don't have it up
yet on the on this page but I could put
kind of a mailing list kind of a thing
there if you're interested so I'll put
that up sometime today that if you if
you want to you know express interest in
something like that if enough people are
interested then maybe something like
that might go forward so but with that I
I did have some plans to try to to share
some some power shell and do some things
but I think we don't have time for any
of that so I think let's just go ahead
and conclude her
oh and stickers i have i have developer
on fire stickers if you want some of
those so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
