have a lot of aspiring billionaires in
the room I see
I am Vinny and together with my friend
and colleague hands we've been looking
at blockchain technology for the past
year or so and we wanted to share with
you everything we've learned so far the
talk is divided in two distinctive parts
the first one will focus on Bitcoin and
how it operates where does it get its
value from so we're going to dive
immediately really deep then we're going
to zoom out again and look at blockchain
in general because I'm already
mentioning two different terms here and
what it can do in our day-to-day lives
and then we're going to look at etherium
which is another blockchain and how you
can develop applications with that but
first Pence is going to tell you about
Bitcoin
so as anybody heard about Bitcoin at
least so yes okay most people as someone
already owns any Bitcoin button okay few
people perhaps some miners who might
their own okay very nice
so a lot of people have at least heard
about Bitcoin but at least in Belgium
when it's in the news it's a lot of
times in a negative sense for example
this is the logo of the Silk Road which
was a web site on the dark web anybody
use that
to answer that but what it is is it
it was a marketplace where I can buy and
sell drugs but you don't use PayPal to
buy your drugs you use Bitcoin because
it has some anonymity features so could
hide your illegal activity another
example is this thing I think we saw it
in a few slide decks over the conference
already it's the wanna cry virus so a
lot of computers got infected
anybody affected just nice if you did
get infected the hackers were very
friendly they could decrypt your files
again if you pay them some Bitcoin on
address they provided and a lot of
people actually did so it's not a thing
another example of Bitcoin coming in
negative news but there also some more
positive use cases for example in the
remittance industry so a lot of people a
lot of times of poor countries go to
work abroad and where they can earn more
money than at home and what they do is
they send part of their earnings back
home but all the time the people back
home maybe don't have a bank account so
what they do is they use Western Union
so they go to the western union office
give them some of their money that they
earned that month and what best immunity
does is it makes sure that it transfers
it over internationally around the world
back to your family and then your family
can visit the distant union office and
withdraw the money but actually this is
quite expensive and the average is rate
of 8% on the amount you want to send
and it takes a lot of time as well so a
couple of days at least sometimes weeks
depending on where you want to spend it
but you could also use Bitcoin so we
could buy some Bitcoin with your money
send it to your address your family
homes and then your family can use the
Bitcoin back at home or exchange it for
their local currency and this costs a
lot less money and it's a lot faster so
it's not not all use cases of Bitcoin
are negative points quite some potential
here so let's take a look at how it
actually works because if you want to
create a global money Network let's say
you need to solve a few things to be
able to make this work digitally so
we're going to compare it with a ledger
like this one it's a book so block the
blockchain kind of like a ledger which
holds all transactions that happen
within the network so let's say for
example this old book is a ledger that
holds all transactions of some medieval
town and yeah when they need some money
the they go collect some back taxes from
the citizens and then they write down
okay at this day I collected this amount
of money from this person and they write
it down in their book and when they
collected a lot of taxes perhaps they
want to buy some horseshoes from the
local blacksmith so they write down the
amount of money they paid to the
blacksmith at what time etc so this book
this ledger holds all transactions that
happened with the money of the little
town and anyone can check the ledger and
find out the complete truth in this book
and one person can write in it and it
holds all transactions
so we need a few things to make this
work digitally because the book is easy
there's one book that you can you want
to distribute it over a global network
you need to solve some problems so let's
go over them first off you need to
identify yourself so and the person you
want to send money to so you need
something to keep track of addresses and
be able to pass right yourself and what
is used in Bitcoin is public key
cryptography just like in HTTP so you
don't go to some website Bitcoin dot org
and register for an account you just
generate a random key private key and
then public key is derived from that and
now you have public/private key pair and
you can take part in the Bitcoin network
so it's no central registry you just
generate your own key you might think
well if I generate monkey isn't there a
chance that I generate the same key as
someone else and when I have their
private key I can access their money but
the chance of that happening actually is
quite low the amount of possible
combinations in a private key is ten to
the power of 48 which are a lot of zeros
and to give you an idea the count of all
atoms in the earth is 10 to the power of
50 so it just means there's a lot of
possible combinations and in practice
that means that you're generating the
same key the chance of that is zero so
again Janet's in key important to note
here is you generate your own key and
using that key you can access your funds
so you need to keep key safe
obviously when you lose it you can't go
to the central Bitcoin office and ask
for a new key if it gets stolen then
it's simply not your money anymore the
other person now has your money so then
you need to keep
your private key safe so what you don't
do is something like this there's there
are these machines where you can pay
with regular old credit card and you can
buy some bitcoins and what you get is a
piece of paper with a public/private key
pair which can then use to add to your
wallet so you probably don't post on
Twitter how happy you are with your
first date going because if you post
your private key then yeah but it's not
your Bitcoin anymore simple like that
what if essentially it's just like the
regular wallet if I leave this here on
stage and move away anybody can come in
here and take my money so it's essential
that you keep whatever in this case just
my paper wallet that I keep it in my
back pocket safely and secure so we now
have a way to play along in this global
network and how can we how can we be
sure that whenever we're making a
transaction that nobody is tampering
with the data with like until a few
years ago in Belgium at least you could
use a paper checks which is just a piece
of paper
my name is printed on it I can enter an
amount somebody can I can enter the name
or the bank account of somebody where I
want to send some money to and then this
piece of paper with together with a
pencil i scribble on it or like two
dashes enhance that somehow means the
paper was secure but it which is great
in a paper world but as we move to the
digital world we still we need a better
way to secure our transactions and again
the public key click crypt
cryptography can help us secure this
transaction so let's take a transaction
which has an amount of Bitcoin I want to
send and the address of hands in this
case I want to send a bit going to how
can we make this secure well I I take a
hash of the all of the data in the
transaction so the amount of bitcoins
and the address for instance and then
encrypt that hash with my private key I
didn't get a signal
sure this signature is then added to the
transaction and sent to the network
anyone who wants to validate the
transaction can then use my public key
to decrypt the signature then they get a
hash again all of the other data is
present in the transaction as well so
they can locally hash that as well and
when those two match they can be sure
that nobody has tampered with the data
and that it I was indeed the originator
of the transaction so nobody has
tampered with it and it can be
successfully transferred across the
network so now we now we can identify
ourselves and create transactions and
sign them and now we can start sending
into the network but the network also
has to have a way to make sure that the
amount of Bitcoin I want the same that I
actually have that amount of Bitcoin and
there's no such thing like a Bitcoin
balance it works bit differently so
let's say I want to send a transaction
to Benny I want send ten bitcoins then I
create transaction with output Benny's
address and the amount is ten Bitcoin
and what I need to do is provide one or
more transactions that happen in the
past that amount up to the amount I want
to send so there's this list of unspent
transactions that every the whole
network keeps track of so that those are
transactions that happen in the past and
this having been used in another
transaction as input so in this example
I have transaction one where in the past
I received five Bitcoin from someone
else and I have another one transaction
2 where I received six Bitcoin and I
haven't spent those transactions yet so
I provide them as input for my new
transaction and for the people who can
count five to six is eleven so it's one
too much to be to make them so what you
can do is also
let's find multiple output addresses so
you can I'm going to provide Denny's
address and send 10-bit going to that
one and I'm going to provide one of my
own addresses to send the one bit
Bitcoin as changed to and then the
amounts add up and when this is sent to
the network and validated there's
actually one and two are then removed
from the unspent transaction list so I
can't use transaction one anymore to
send five Bitcoin to someone else so I
can total spend my money which is
probably something you like payment
system so we now have a way to validate
somebody who takes part in the network
we have a way to validate transactions
and we have a way to make sure money
isn't being sent twice but who does the
bookkeeping who is the one if we take
the analogy of the great medieval book
who has the feather who writes every
line in the in the big book that's the
job of them of the miners and the
bookkeepers so they receive transactions
and they are constantly validating them
and trying to add another page in our
big book since it's a distributed
network
nobody really they all have a part of
truth in part is actually wrong they
have all the all of the truth if you
want to spin up a machine you can just
download so a piece of software you can
have your computer take part in the
Bitcoin network well the first thing it
will have to do is download all of the
history every transaction every block
since the inception of Bitcoin which was
from around 2008 will be stored on your
on your machine and then that's finally
completed which is a few gigabytes it
has to download it will then be able to
process transactions transactions are
grouped together to form a block
hence blockchain we're getting there but
that's not all they do
since all of those computers are
constantly competing to find the next
block of trans
elections then you they need to solve a
puzzle they are they combine the hash of
the previous group transactions combine
that with the hash of the current
transactions and the Bitcoin network a
dictate that I have to solve the puzzle
which means when you combine those two
hashes it needs to be below a certain
amount so they need to find a random
number so the puzzle can be solved in
the keynote there was a mention of a
there was mention of the trapdoor
functions now this is one of those
because if you install it on your PC
you'll see that your CPU or your GPU
will be at 100% immersing your machine
won't be able to do anything else it
constantly trying to find that number
that will solve this puzzle and why do
they do this well they get rewarded when
they find this the solution one computer
will find a solution see it's very hard
to find that random number but very fast
to validate it so if one computer finds
the solution it will broadcast hey I
found the next page in our book this is
the hash that I found this is the random
number and the other notes you will then
validate that so they can immediately oh
yeah note X found let's say number five
and that does solve the hash so we will
be using his hash as the next we will
use his hash for the next block so the
entire process starts all over again
they will take the new hash as input
start mining the other transactions and
try to solve the puzzle again it gets 12
Bitcoin for doing this 12 Bitcoin I
checked when I when we started the talk
it's a little more than 2,000 euros so
if you want to reach your kronor it's
time stem so it's very lucrative to do
mine Bitcoin does that mean all great I
have some extra credits I can spend
let's just spin up some machines and
install the software well you you
chances are very slim of you actually be
able to mine Bitcoin although it's
completely random there's specialized
hardware to do this so since it's so
hard people are combining or combining
their computing power
two groups so it's one note in that
group finds the solution they distribute
the money between all of them but if you
want you can take part of it that the
the - get money from from finding the
blocks which are by the way the only
transactions which don't need inputs
since like we mentioned every if I just
want to send a bit going to hands I
always have to special specify other
transactions only when the - fine find
the solution they don't of course they
don't have input transactions they also
get rewarded by processing transactions
there's a free you have to pay in order
to get the transaction process but the
fee of that is negligible and in a
certain point in time there will the
mining of books that will the reward for
that will become zero it's not like the
central bank in Europe when they say all
the economy has some issues legit
reprints let's print some extra money
that's not something that's possible in
Bitcoin there's a set amount of Bitcoin
currently you they are rewarded when
they find a new block but somewhere in
the future that will stop that's built
in the network so that's the house so
it's very compute intensive at the
moment that I write 1 quintillion hashes
per second in the Bitcoin network and
all of the computing power of the
Bitcoin network combined is bigger than
what Google has to offer so it's very
big
but why do all this hard work why do
they have to find those hashes can
combine them well then we really are at
the nature of a blockchain so here you
have blocks which are linked together
with arrows what does do what is
combining all those hashes hashes
actually provide so let's say we have
block 3 which builds upon block 2 it
uses the hash of B 2 to create itself
with the transactions which are part of
the block and block 2 same thing block 1
etc if I want to manipulate transaction
1 let's say I've sent then bit going to
hands but I want to be fraud Alice and I
want to change that amount to 5 or I
just want to discard the entire
transaction that would mean that
block number two would have to be
recalculated because if anyone who has
worked with hashes before changing just
a little bit of the data creates an
entire new hash and since the hash of
block 1 is contained in block - you need
to recalculate block to its entirety and
since block 3 builds on block - you have
to recalculate block 3 in its entirety
again and so on and so on and so on and
by the time I've recalculated all those
books the Bitcoin network is already
much further ahead so I won't be able to
complete to change all of those of the
blocks together right so we've listed
some key features or principles of a
block chain of a boxing bead so we have
this single distributed ledger and
Bitcoin obviously has that one too so
you have a single ledger as in there's
one version of the truth it's just all
transactions that happened in history
but it's distributed so everyone has a
copy and everyone can check if
everything in it is correct it's
immutable due to the block the chain of
blocks and the hashing so that makes it
effectively impossible to mutate a
theory it's possible if you have a lot
of computing power but that probably
costs more money than just not changing
the history and it's Stressless so you
don't need to trust the person you send
money to or get money from you don't
need to trust a single computer in the
network you just trust the system as a
whole and the hashes etc the hashes are
actually the coping abilities if you
think about it and it's automated so you
can build stuff on top of that you can
make some cool applications that
automatically sent money
cetera so that's enough talking so now
let's take a look at the Bitcoin network
in action it's the better for the team
in the way and here you see a live view
of all transactions across the globe so
you see them popping up you see here a
lot of list of transactions so never
somebody who makes a transaction it'll
appear here on the map so we have some
in Sweden command somebody sent from
Bitcoin and you'll see Norway pop up
here you can see if i zoom perhaps that
somebody is sending Bitcoin in the
Twinner
in Germany and I can here click on the
link and then you see the transaction so
somebody is sending 390 or even more
2500 dollars almost there's one
transaction as input and two
transactions transactions as output
which is again like the story we
mentioned earlier this person had one
transaction with a lot of Bitcoin behind
it and wanted to send it to somewhere
else he probably wanted to send this
amount 2055 to somewhere else and
exchange it being sent to another error
City Gomes we also see here that's an
unconfirmed transaction what does that
mean well this the work of finding the
hashes and finding a next block it takes
some time if I send for this amount of
dollars to somebody else I and I would I
want to make sure that the transaction
has been processed I knew to wait for
like 20 minutes because you need to the
entire process of finding a block and
the next one and the next one and make
sure that the transact that the
transaction that's sent to me has been
validated to enough time and I'm part of
the network you need to wait 20 minutes
to be sure that the money you receive is
really in your account
dicker also has here we have the amount
by which I open this when we start to
talk which was 23 minutes ago and
there's like almost 9,000 Bitcoin have
been transfers times 2000 euros you have
a large number anyone a lot of money so
those are the transactions over here
here I can see the blocks that have been
mined so during the talk 25 blocks have
been mined so 25 new blocks mccarran's
actions have been added since half past
eight
yeah but it's not the local time I think
it's UTC or something here we see that
the block has a name I mentioned earlier
that a bunch of people are working
together in a group they combine their
computing power well one of those is the
BTCC pool and if a block has been found
and we know exactly where the IP etc
lives we can give it a name again I can
click on it and I can see here the hash
that was found the hash of the previous
block the they got thirty thousand eight
hundred dollars for finding the block
and I can see all of the transactions
that are part in this block so again we
mentioned earlier using Bitcoin gives
some unknown anonymity but I can just
see whatever is happening in the network
yeah I can't say whatever whoever owns
this I can't find his name and that's
the unknown anonymity but let's say if I
want to exchange this for something to
something else and for that let's take a
look at this
this one the one Hager I authors you
have they specify the Bitcoin address
where you have to send money to well
they have like six different Bitcoin
addresses this is one of them so what
did I receive in this address
forty-eight thousand or ohms forty nine
thousand dollars so these are all people
percent Bitcoin to
to the virus otters sometimes it's most
of time like 200-400
adores but sometimes there are very
small amounts I guess it's sympathizer
or whatever if I was one of the authors
what do I have to do well I
if there wasn't as a marketplace I can
which I can use Bitcoin then I might be
able to buy something with it but if I
want to create dollars or Euros or
whatever from it I have to send this
money to an exchange there are a bunch
of exchanges out there and they allow
you to transfer or convert bit going
into other cryptocurrencies or in
dollars or Euros or whatever and then
there is a central place so if law
enforcement is tries hard enough and the
or the author's aren't so smart then
they can be found so actually this money
is currently a bit locked in here you
can do a lot of complicated stuff like
sending the money around to several
addresses and splitting it and combining
it so you can make it very hard very
hard but we - it's not that anonymous as
you think because we just I could show
you all of the transactions in the
network and what's located everywhere
there's one point which you might have
seen on this map which is like over here
which is zero longitude to zero latitude
that just transactions which have
instant where they've we can't really
know where they happened so they get
some they get located over there
any questions about Bitcoin yes yeah we
can hardly see anything with light so
yeah
so men here asked is there a limit to
the amount of transactions and how big
does it grow
well one block by way is currently about
one megabyte and there is an entire
debate about scaling Bitcoin by the way
if you currently I don't want to lie how
big is the entire history its gigabytes
now it's not that more than a 100 but
not 200 and that's all of the
transactions since 2008 so that's still
ok ish but there since it's open source
it's you can't
there are Bitcoin input improvement
proposals and there's currently an
active debate on how can we change it
how should we have bigger blocks should
we store our information or should we
solve this information in block maybe
there's something that should be a leave
behind next to it do we really need all
of the information of the previous
blocks so that's an ongoing debate
actually yes alas is but the current
hash and binary and how big do you mean
- the the puzzle they need to find out
is yet there's actually a mechanism that
makes it harder if more computing power
is added to the network so it makes sure
that the average time that you can guess
a block is like 10 minutes so if a lot
of computing power is trying a lot of
different hashes then the block is found
faster than 10 minutes but then they
increase the difficulty and then
expecting it so so long
you know what we want to answer all of
your questions but since we're time
limited just come to us after the talk
and then we'll try to answer all of them
because we want to look at something
else as well the sample we which we
mentioned earlier the Western Union
example that's like textbook example you
want to have an example where can I use
Bitcoin or blockchain technology yeah
it's always FinTech which is mentioned
but for this talk we wanted to give you
a broader vision just let's not focus on
all the financial the financial world
certainly there are benefits but can't
we think of another way that we can use
this technology and back in December
hands and I were sitting down and we
were talking about a process in Belgium
and in Belgium and that's how we can buy
a house I don't know if it's like this
in the rest of the world but this is how
it works in Belgium
well first you siphon is that I want to
buy a house so you go in the housing
market search around and then you
finally find something which kind of
fits the bill says there's always work
and settle things you have to do but
this is the house I want to buy so I
meet the owner it guides me around and
theoretically if I had enough money to
pay him upfront law forbids me from
doing that there are some legal steps I
need to take so we need to introduce
some notaries in the system at least one
but most the time it will be two of them
one of them does actual do something the
other one is there just to make sure the
other guy isn't fooling around what's
the first thing he does well he collects
my identity cards every Belgian has an
identity card and although there's a
chip on it most notaries just asked for
a guard and then write your name first
name my address my place of birth my
birth date and my registry number every
Belgian has a unique number he writes
that down and you will contact the
federal government could you please give
me the details of vetting and could it
be please give me the details of hands
and then they compared
is indeed the one who wants to buy this
house Benny and is indeed the one who is
selling yourself hams
so when those match up you will then
contact the Flemish government the local
government we have a lot of governments
in Belgium to get more information about
the house when was it built when was it
rebuilt
are there any building violations isn't
the house part of an existing loan etc
etc all of that information is gathered
to draft a document a piece of paper
then there are also these guys the bank
most of the time or at least admin I
wanted to buy a house I don't didn't
have all the money in my wallet
so I go to the bank they also repeat
this process
are you really Benny who is coming here
even if I am a customer with them for a
very long time and they don't just give
me the money no they give it to the
notary strange
I've been customer for years I just you
don't give them all to me so I can buy
this house
so they give it to the notary when all
of that is completed and the day is
finally there to sign the official
documents we read the document and what
will we see that's not how you spell
mining an error on this page narrowing
that page etc so we correct it and then
finally we get to buy the house how does
long does this process take any ideas I
a month I hear here six months well at
by average it's 3 months now let's say
if I sell this house again I have all of
the documents it'll go faster right no
they repeat all of it again and again so
can't we use a blockchain in this
example and what would it improve well
instead of having the housing
information for instance spread across
multiple agencies let's put that in a
box chain so we know when was a house
built when was it rebuilt let's store
that information together what does that
provide us well again at the moment
contact my government to get like the
basic
properties of the land sighs like how
when was it built that's information I
can I can query but then I get a piece
of paper anyone with a scanner and the
printer can create a piece of paper so
if you would store it in the blockchain
we would be certain that the information
is correct we would introduce a lot of
trust in the system currently you have
to introduce the notary's which have to
get paid the government apart from the
taxes which I always have to pay every
year takes 10% of the total amount just
to make the transaction the bank apart
from the loan I have to pay every month
I also want a fee because I want alone
introducing the blockchain to automate
the entire process would eliminate a lot
of needs a little a lot of need for the
intermediary the notary and I wouldn't
have to spell my name again when we sign
the document so it's just an example of
how the blockchain could be used in some
another way but we can't build that with
Bitcoin Bitcoin offers some programming
capabilities let's say we want to build
an eBay and eBay takes a fee for every
transaction
we've even if everything goes fine
but if you can model that that construct
with the middleman we'll just gives you
the money when the other one agrees
something like that can be modeled on
Bitcoin does that mean that if you may
leave this talk I'm not going to build
up eBay on the blockchain somebody was
first so that exists something Bitcoin
is really centered about sending money
to somewhere else it's a cryptocurrency
but how can we create something as
complicated not complicated as buying a
house on a blockchain something like
that exists and that's the etherium
watch-chain a theorem is essentially you
write a piece of code you compile it and
you then send it to the blockchain and
instead of just sending money to left
and right we call function
on the blockchain on the application
which we deployed and we have to pay a
free every time we call a function a
piece of software deployed on the
etherium network is called a smart
contract there are two networks a
production atiim network which you can
use for production and at this network
so if you want to fool around you can I
create a contract and deploy that from
the test network but you can also just
deploy your own ATM network in the
sample we'll show you in a bit
ever actually offers that you can I mean
in a few clicks create your own private
aterial network to create applications
on so when we we wanted to play rapidly
so we thought of an example that we
could model in a smart contract we came
up with a game like rock-paper-scissors
lizard-spock because five options are
better than one three so what it made is
in general so there are two users they
just want to play rock-paper-scissors
it's Bach but one of them like Denny's
in Australia and you don't get meet in
person so but you want to make sure that
no one is cheating you don't trust Benny
don't trust a central game server you
don't trust anyone so we want to use a
smart contract so I'll send my hand
Benny senses and and then the smart
contact will determine the winner and
everything is transparent because you
can just check the code in smart contact
see if cheating is indeed impossible and
that's what we made so let's take a look
then sweet thang khuu rollers
so I can visit this website which hosts
the game and then out to the first one
which is an archetype I'm going to play
against myself and let's say I'll choose
rock okay I'll send my hand and then
there's the other tab where to you're
met make magic
yeah yeah right
oh my god this is in Australia so I got
a challenge from me and I want to win so
I'll play paper and now what happens is
we need to wait because things are
happening in the blockchain and well
transactions and stuff so we'll come
back to this later and let's take a look
at how this works so this is a broad
architectural image we have a web server
which just holds two UI you just saw it
as a sequel database which contains non
critical data like a friendly name don't
need that in smart contact and then we
have a blockchain network we deployed
our own in Azure because it's easy you
just click few buttons as your spins up
some virtual machines creates unity via
Network and gives us like the all the
eater we need to test out a smart
contact eater is by the way the currency
of theorem just like we have a Bitcoin
in a Bitcoin network if you want to pay
for something in an interior network you
need to pay eater right so that's
cheaper and then the web server can
access the network to ask about stuff
and the client can as well so let's take
a look at the flow we implemented
because when we built this we wanted to
limit the amount of calls to the smart
contact because
like we saw whenever you call a small
comb a smart contact and you want to
change the state for example you want to
store a hand it takes time and it takes
money so especially the time is annoying
because you know you want to know
immediately if you want or not so we
came up with something more complicated
let's say I want to play rock and I say
okay I select log rock and I generate a
random salt on my clients I hash those
two together and then I send dose I sent
that hash to the web server and you can
store it and then we wait until player 2
selects his hand let's say paper
generates his own random salt on his
client and hashes that and sends that
hash and now the web server has both
hashes it doesn't know which hands were
played and you can create a contract on
the network on the blockchain network
using those two hashes and that starts
the smart contract and that's the
operation we were waiting for so it
needs to create transaction wait for it
to be mined etc before you can actually
call stuff on it and when that happens
an event is relayed and then the clients
the clients can reveal their hands so
they just send the hand they selected
the random generated salt they stored
and send it to the smart contact and the
smart contract can check okay if I hash
the hand and the salt together is the
same hash that was used to create the
smart contact if so then I really played
rock so I can't change my mind and then
the other players does the same thing
the same thing gets checked and when the
smart contact command received both
hands it can calculate the winner so
Rock loses again
paper and so then the winner is
determined and so a participant notice
is that you didn't need to trust anyone
you didn't need to trust the web server
for it couldn't change your hand because
didn't know you had just had a hash you
didn't need to trust the other player
you couldn't know your hand before you
if you if you send your hands you
couldn't make out what it was because it
was hash cetera so you didn't need to
trust anyone so what does that actually
look like let's first go to the smart
contract because that's probably
something you didn't see before this is
a smart contract I've registered your
code open which has an expansion for
solidity if you want to create an
application for aetherium
you need to learn the solidity
programming language there's also an
extension for visual studio but that
doesn't have color coding so I preferred
this one the first line here specifies
the compiler I'm using so that's prevent
when the contract is deployed I don't
want to have a different behavior when
there are new features available so
that's what I specify over there and
then there's the name the contract
binding you can see most programming
constructs which you are familiar with I
can have a glorified teacher over here
the state rock paper and so on I can
declare events that the contact will be
outputting I can create struct types for
my data structure which I'm using and
then here you can see public members of
the the contract nothing special over
here but then we come to the constructor
function bind game and we see here
address player 1 player 2 and then by 32
and the two House hashes which the
server has which were sent to the server
or then transmitted to this contract and
I signed them to the different variables
I add them to this array and I also have
this special special contract method
that message isn't defined over here
there's no parameter message but that's
just who is calling this function
because everybody has to pay when
calling functions that's all metadata
which is combined when you call a
function so I can get the address of the
person who is calling this in this case
it will always be the server address if
I want to send either when it I can
expect that as well then there is
something like this which is another
function but here I specified constant
it just reads from the blockchain
reading is for free you can read as many
times as you want from the blockchain
writing data changing the states that's
where you need to pay your fee for the
free which you use in etherium is called
gas then there's this little helper
function I wrote there are no no there's
no concept of null or whatever in
etherium which is great we won't have no
reference exceptions but it's not so
great if you want to check if something
has been initialized so you need to
write some helper functions to do that
then the rest of it is just plain code
there's nothing really complicated here
just like the reveal hands when the two
hashes have been sent to the server to
the ethereal Network and the contact has
been mined then the clients will call a
reveal hands they will send their and
encrypted and hashed whatever anti fate
like rock or scissors and the hash they
used and then make sure that if player
one is sending this and we need to check
whatever player one played before the
blind hand contains the hash we hash
whatever comes in and if those if that
matches then we can be sure that player
one is really sending rock or paper or
whatever we do the same for player
number two and when that's all completes
we can find the winner so declare winner
let's scroll there let's see if there
was a draw and keeping track of whatever
loss plate and then calling the event is
just calling the name draw with all the
attributes I wanted to go so it's not
that complicated certainly it can get
more complicated or many more
programming constructs in the language
but just to get this little demo going
we don't need to learn
a lot so we compile this and I'm using
truffle which is a framework that can
help me and that it outputs this JSON
file
it's a JSON file contains two important
things the ABI or application binary
interface which is like the Wizzle of
wucf or the swagger from Aris service it
describes what functions are present on
the contract and how can I call them
with parameters we have to pay when I
call them etc etc which is very long and
then there's the funding binary if you
want to call contracts on on the
watching unique just need the ABI if you
want to deploy contracts you also need
the binary what the truffle provides us
as well well I can write tests for it
you see with mocha I can simulate an
entire game on the blockchain I'm
connecting to a test blockchain on my
local computer and then write the tests
just like you with for your other web
development teas nothing special over
there
so we have the contract now written
let's interact with it well let's take a
look at our server here you have the
play hand functions so they this one is
called with with salted version for the
two players and when we've collected
both of the hands
we then can call and qts here we can
then create the address I'm using
another framework for that in the
theorem which you can find on github so
I'm deploying the contract over here
with the ABI and the binary and then
pass in all of the constructor arguments
so I just sharp a way of interacting
with the smart contracts you need to
wait for it to get mines etc and then I
update some more information I get I
think that our reference to the events
so so I can start falling for the events
whenever they occur at occur etc and
then let's say there's the API is a web
application we wrote a web application
angular if you want to interact with
it's from ouch yeah JavaScript that's
also possible you can do it need
natively with a web provider of the ATM
network that I'm using truffle again
so I import truffle I I give it the ABI
in the binaries and I can then call
methods on it as if it was just a
JavaScript object and here I'm saying
give me a reference to the contract that
was deployed at a certain location and
then call this method on it so it is
possible to interact to create
applications that run on a blockchain
and interact with it from JavaScript or
from from.net did we win already
yes you lost or you won depending which
game or both alright so this code is on
github will share the link later so you
can check it out
yes some lessons learned using
etherium and all technology around it so
it did actually succeed in our mission
to play rock-paper-scissors lizard-spock
without any trust between us and any
server so that worked but it came at a
price
what you saw the speed it whenever you
do something on the blockchain because
of everybody is mining and checking yeah
it just takes longer so that's something
to keep in mind and yeah the cost as
well we rolled our own yttrium Network
which one and you want to use the actual
ATM network there are a lot of more
users there so the amount supply they
either just costs more to stop it costs
more money a centralized system is
obviously even more efficient it's also
cutting edge which means it's code speak
for yeah not so easy to work with it if
there's documentation then
a lot of time it is deprecated when you
read it I we tried the example the hello
world example some time ago and wouldn't
even compile okay so you just copy-paste
it from their website into the bra in
the procedure code or their own
development environment and we press run
or compile and already crashes and write
also and sometimes you need to call this
undocumented API to be able to do what
you want to do serve it yeah it needs
some work
but it has a lot of potential when you
do want to be do things without trust it
works so there's that
well you might think oh cool I want to
build a bocce nap but just make sure
that yeah the use case you're thinking
of really needs a blockchain because as
I mentioned there are more centralized
system is more efficient but now there's
a lot of hype right now and a lot of
companies especially in tech are now
jumping on it but there are not a lot of
really useful use cases if you think
about it for example you have this thing
it's called dogecoin and started out as
a joke is actually just does the same
thing as Bitcoin so you can send money
and everybody was really height and
bought a lot of dogecoin and then the
developer stole all the money so oh
project is dead no if you check it out
you can find a list of all crypto
currencies and when you look it up it's
actually number 20 of most market cap
going's it has like 300 million dollars
worth
but it's nothing then again the example
we mentioned earlier of buying a house
we thought of that around December
November last year and then you see here
two articles from a May in April where
Sweden the UK are actively developing
something like that
you can and even on the UK on that
article there's a link for top
applications so you they are trying to
experiment with this and put that
information in the blockchain because
you might say certainly I trust the
government to store my data but that's
today perhaps and tomorrow there's
somebody else who says well that all
that lent you information we have that
doesn't exist that archive we have to
just burn you down so we can use
blockchain for certain official
documents etc like in in the Antwerp
where I live is now looking at storing
my driver license etc in the blockchain
all of the legal all of the documents
that they have to give like if you want
to work for a scold if you're going to
work for the government I need to
provide that I need to provide the
documents which is I'm I'm a very nice
person I didn't go to jail etc well
anyone with a printer can create the
documents but if they can contact the
blockchain to get that information
knowing they can be certain that nobody
as a as a fraud loss document another
example of a blockchain out there is the
ever ledger one of its use cases is your
diamonds normally every diamonds gets
engraved for it to be identified but
again in enter the machine was developed
to remove that so you can't be sure
certain where the diamond came from so
what does the ever letters do well
they've combined a lot of
characteristics of the diamonds and the
documents and put that on on the
blockchain
so whenever diamonds or traded say they
can look at the ever ledger and verify
doesn't isn't this diamond being stolen
or ready to come from those does it come
from a conflict area so we shouldn't
trade it etc so that's a gap bridging
the gap between the digital and the
physical world there are more proof
concepts out there like we mentioned
earlier a lot of financial industries
are looking at it they don't they are
not so hyped about the public blockchain
but there are a lot of banks who
actually want to create your own private
boxing so they can reduce costs and the
our transactions would be handled by
that blockchain because banks don't
trust each other either and then they
need to create other organizations on
top of that to validate transactions etc
all of that past could be deleted by
using poaching technology so that was
our talk we hope you learned something
and will be here to answer some more
questions we'll put the slides and etc
out there on Twitter so you can read up
the code and find the reference material
and I hope you enjoy your day
