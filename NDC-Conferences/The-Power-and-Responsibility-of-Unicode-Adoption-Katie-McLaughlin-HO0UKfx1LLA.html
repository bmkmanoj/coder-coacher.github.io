feedback yes so if I just like not move
I'm good okay cool great so I love emoji
I love how broken they are so even
though I have an hour I do need to skip
over some bits here so TL DR because
computers we have this thing called
Unicode Unicode is cool you should be
using Unicode everywhere you'll probably
be using it in the utf-8 format which is
a flexible flexible encoding format dari
the puns get worse so in utf-8 if you
want to encode the character a you have
eight bits if you want to encode the
Japanese ah
you have three by eight bits because
this is really hard to fit on the screen
all the time
I'll be using this sort of short code so
slush you means Unicode and this is a
and then this is ah Unicode can go a
whole lot further than this because with
this encoding standard you can have up
to a million characters which means you
can do things like this here is an e
here is a combining macro which means if
you put the two together you get an e in
a macro that's cool you extend this out
you have your accents and your all your
different dots and all that and it means
that with utf-8 you can cover nearly
every language like you got all your
accents for friends you got Cyrillic in
there with the Han unification you have
all the Chinese Japanese and Korean
characters so everyone can use Unicode
to write in their language and that's
great because it means that people can
write in their language and send it to
your computer and you can read it in
their language as long as you know how
to actually read their language but it
means the codes not going to get doubled
and this works for everyone except the
Japanese because the Japanese they have
katakana they
hiragana they have kanji but what they
also have is mobile phones back in the
late 90s Japanese is a pictographic
language and because computers there
happen to be some space left over when
they were encoding their character sets
onto their cellular networks which means
there was space left over which means
they had little pictures and they called
them emerging e4 character and woody for
picture so emoji so you had these
wonderfully twelve by twelve characters
so there's like there's a penguin and
there's a horse and there's a pig face
and of course because everything was
great there were three different
Japanese cellular networks with these
things and none of their emoji matched
but this was ingrained into the mobile
texting culture of the day so Unicode
comes along and the Japanese are like
okay can you add a motif and Unicode
went no and so they asked again can we
have a merging in there because we
really really need emoji and the Unicode
consortium said no and then combined
with the efforts of Google when they
were first doing Gmail and Apple
we got emoji in the Unicode standard
back in 2007 and then nothing happened
because it wasn't until the iPhone was
released for the Japanese market that
there was his little tiny setting hidden
in the i io s3 settings that had the
first Apple emoji and this was great
because then the Japanese market it's
like yes we can do all our pictures and
stuff but no one in any other part of
the world knew about it until a couple
of versions of iOS later they like I
will just bundle this in and hide it in
the settings somewhere and we'll release
it to America and it'll just be there
and I'll just be a hidden setting
allegedly one day someone who's playing
around on their new shiny phone in like
Seattle or something looking around
looking around and went huh I can send a
picture of coop to my friends
so they sent the picture group and then
somebody else with the iPhone picks up
and goes hey how'd you do that and so it
spread um who spread come on you're a
great audience tip your waitress all
right so this is 2010 and emoji starts
exploding but since then the Unicode
standard has kept on adding new emoji so
in 2014 we had new emoji including the
chipmunk emoji the satellite emoji the
Vulcan salute emoji and the one in the
bottom corner here is really special and
that is because that character is in
wingdings the businessmen levitating is
a character in wingdings and because
backwards-compatibility they had to add
into Unicode so that's cool um 2015 a
whole lot of new emoji including my
favorite the Australian smiley and tacos
and burritos because tacos and burritos
also unicorn which is great and more
emoji again in 2016 including the egg
chicken has been in since 2010 see now
you know officially which came first
there's also kiwi fruit spoon emoji and
the one in the bottom corner here is
really important because it was in 2016
when we had the first ligatures come out
which means that that is actually two
characters that is a facepalm and then a
fitzpatrick color modifier based on the
fitzpatricks scale of human skin colors
from caucasian light all the way through
which means that you can have emoji that
look like you which is really good
because representation here also last
year we have a whole bunch of fun to do
with gender modifiers now so depending
on which platform your own the haircut
is normally female
what you should be doing is explicitly
defining it as female which in your
mobile phones it'll do automatically but
if you change it to the male modifier
and put them together it changes to
mouth so it means that you can make sure
that the emoji you're sending is what
you intend which is great because I have
an entire thing coming up about how this
has fixed a whole lot of problems and
also you can have our combining sets so
families and couples where if you split
them out its man heart man and then it
goes together into one and you can also
have flanks which is great because I
guess how many emoji this is how many
modes are on the screen right now no
this is two because it is a you and a
cake and you put it together and you get
the UK flag that's cool you know what's
also cool you can use emoji natively and
a whole lot of programming languages now
which is great um in Python you can use
unicode data so I'm a Python programmer
you can import unicode data and you can
get it to tell you what the unicode
character is so here it is a snake and
then using an escape sequence you can
explicitly spell out the character and
it'll return snake and you can also go
to the utf-8 utf-16 emoji package and
then you can have gemstone and you can
go back to the actual gem you can also
do this in PHP if anyone here's a PHP
dev using the International character
package you can get it to tell you
elephant but I'm a Python dev so I'm a
little bit jealous because Ruby and
PHP cooler then Python just because you
can use just the emoji as variable names
so in Ruby you can have just the emoji
equals whatever string you want in PHP
you still need to prepend a dollar sign
but that's cool but you know not
everyone uses Ruby or PHP but that's
okay
there is an entire programming language
with just emoji it is called a Moche
code that is the Fibonacci sequence for
the first 15 characters that's that's a
frozen variable and that's a variable
variable and then and then it loops
around and there's a start and there's
watermelon because watermelon and
mochiko org has all the information if
you want to start coding with this but
there is a very very explicit explicit
caution if you want to use emoji code
never use winking tongue and face to
compare strings always use just tongue
out because there is an explicit
difference between these two comparators
for some reason I just love that that is
literal documentation on this page so
yes we can use emoji in place as
yesterday G but this is where it gets
complicated um if you remember earlier
Apple were the ones to really bring a
merger into the West there are other
mobile phones other than Apple namely
Android and Android played catch-up and
they were very very rushed because they
were trying to jump on the emoji
trainers that blasted out underground
local reference here um so in the very
first version of emoji on Android you
get some interesting little things so
this is a yellow Hut the picture on the
left is from the Unicode standard
that's speckling is the same sort of
color pattern that you get when you want
to describe British Harold DeShields but
you already have black and white so that
particular pattern means gold so it's a
golden heart it's a yellow heart you
check the data
it says yellow yeah yellow this is
yellow yeah okay yellow right this is
what Android went with as their yellow
heart that is not a yellow heart that is
a strawberry that has gone too far
so allegedly someone took the standard
literally and thought it was a stubbled
heart the other hearts of the first
Android standard included are instead of
blue it was frozen instead of purple
it was sweaty weeping they fixed it
since but when you want to send someone
a yellow heart and they get this and you
can't see that yeah and you thought the
eggplant emoji was wrong depending on
which phone you are using or which
computer you're using the emoji look
very different so this is the flushed
face emoji the first three looked like
the face someone would say where it's
like I I just missed the train or
something and the last one looks like
it's like oh you got me flowers but
that's the same character just those
little subtle variations in how it's
depicted can make the meaning change so
much this emerging this is hugging
everything apart from the one at the end
looks like microservices
that is hugging that is wanting to dance
alone but it gets worse these are all
revolving hearts one of those things
does not look like the others this isn't
fun so you've been to a couple of talks
already today when you clap you normally
put your two palms together and bash
them against each other appeared ly to
make a noise the one on the end here is
the original windows clapping emoji I'm
not sure with any ones actually tried to
make a noise like that I mean it works
it's just if you've got rings or
whatever just be careful Oh a new one
that I just saw pointed out on Twitter
in the last couple of days this is a
horse the one on the end of Samsung it
looks like a cow very happy cow but
still not a horse Oh
anyone want to take a guess of what this
movie is blonde yeah at least what are
those is a ginger but it's not just the
differences in between the different
platforms here you did stuff like this
one of these is grinning with smiling
eyes the other is grimace the only
difference is literally the eyes now I
grew up in Western culture so I don't
understand the manga Japanese relevance
of having the eyes open or closed
because the one on the left is grinning
the one on the right is grimace and the
only difference is those eyes so if I
see this it's just like what did I do as
opposed to really happy so all these
kind of differences it's all fun
so you know what you need to be able to
do you need to have explicit
documentation of how to add more of
these into the Unicode standard and
luckily there is a wonderful page
you can fill in to submit a proposal for
new emoji these are the things that will
get you into the Unicode standard if you
are adding a symbol for backwards
compatibility the top row here is from
yahoo messenger who remembers yahoo
messenger the cowboy emoji and yahoo
messenger wasn't in the Unicode standard
until someone said hey we need backwards
compatibility so now we have a cowboy
emoji pretty sure that's also why we
have a clown sorry um
completeness is another standard another
reason why you need to have in the
standard until Unicode eight there
wasn't the full zodiac set of animals to
go with the zodiac symbols so that's how
we got the Scorpion for Scorpio also if
it's frequently requested allegedly a
taco distribution chain or had marketing
because they wanted tacos to be in the
Unicode standard and it was added not
because of that particular distribution
chain with the bells and the tacos but
because so many people wanted tacos and
you know unicorns because unicorns and
things that don't count so these are the
things that you can't get in Unicode
ever sorry um it can't be overly
specific so we already have a snow cone
and ice cream and ice cream sundae we
can't have a banana split I'm sorry you
also cannot have any logos or brands
even though Apple's personal computer
watch headphone and laptop just happened
to look like Apple products oh and
there's no way that ever be like a
Vulcan sign or anything in the Unicode
standard right and also there can't be
any means sorry but you can't have at
least four different types of
timekeeping devices and yet there's no
Big Ben emoji as all these new emoji are
coming in though you have to think about
backwards compatibility because
depending on whether you have a new
system or an old system
all the new emoji can just show up as a
replacement character this is also a
concept that has a Japanese name that
I'm going to butcher the pronunciation
of it's called maji baka
but I call it mochi Baek because I'm a
westerner and I have a weird accent
anyway if you have an older mobile
device or an older laptop you end up
getting the replacement character or
rectangles or nothing when you try to
view the newer emoji and this is where
it comes to the hey I did original
research here so I do some public
speaking a little bit this is the 14th
time I've given this talk but I
introduced my talk as the power and
responsibility of Unicode adoption that
is not my talk title this is my talk
title the power lightning bolt and
responsibility cold sweat dripping from
face of Unicode adoption sparkles this
has given me into all sorts of fun
trying to submit this talk to
conferences and then seeing how it turns
up on agendas first time I ever got
accepted
it's like congratulations you've been
accepted and here's the title of your
talk the power lightning Baltimore
responsibility where's the rest of my
talk title it disappeared as soon as the
sweat face emoji came up and I tried to
submit this for Yale Perth in Australia
and it told me that I could not have a
mathematical symbol of cold sweat
dripping from the face sometimes it just
works though like this is from plaque on
Australia 2016 and it works there's the
immersion in there except when they
tried to print out the agenda and there
were just gaps but they also printed out
an AV helper schedule which had boxes
instead and this is what the emcee got
when I was being introduced so I was
introduced as the power square square
upon certain responsibilities square of
Unicode adoption square yeah
Apple conference that I spoke out devil
world it just worked because they happen
to be using an Apple machine to spec up
the agenda that they printed out and the
thinking face emoji had just been added
and it worked
except for another conference where it
didn't work and so I had a mochi bucket
in the middle of the printed agenda
sometimes they just ignore it completely
though like when they haven't printed
out on the wall but for this particular
conference it was okay because I had
with me some emoji stickers so I just
fixed it and this particular conference
if you've looked it up on the website
you would have seen that there's this
wonderful two-tone gradient of the
purple through to the pink with my talk
title but there's also missing
characters in the middle of my
description because that's what I
submitted to session eyes where it's got
all the characters in there and in the
middle of the thing and they just didn't
appear but if you were to have
downloaded the app for iPhone or Android
it would have all been there except you
can see that the one on the left is from
Apple and the one on the right is from
Android so would have shown up for that
platform-specific but it would have
shown up thing is I didn't email the
conference organizers and said hey it's
not showing up properly you know that
wonderful color gradient for the CSS
that I mentioned that's what my talk
title would have looked like so there's
some sort of game of like guess the
Pokemon Jigglypuff but from above thing
happening there yeah this thing says to
actually make this is really cool
because I just make it transparent and
then have a background but it means that
every single bit of information encoded
into the emoji faces is lost
so good job changing that because it
works um sometimes a conference menu
display boards that has turned up once
that has turned up as part of my talk
title Watty man
yeah thing is this is cold sweat
dripping from face on windows 8 so I can
tell you that this display system for
this particular conference venue I can
tell you exactly what operating system
they're using to display that it's
Windows 8.0 and with all the different
variations you can drill down to the
exact minor version on some platforms
depending on how the emoji displays
which is really great when you have your
emoji tweets popping up on say people's
fitbit's and you can tell that they're
running a custom version of Android 4.3
or when you can tell that people are
still running Windows 8 when they really
shouldn't be running Windows 8 that sort
of thing um I don't always try to break
or at least interrogate conference
display systems sometimes people try to
do data sanitization of my content
without me knowing trying to clean it
clean Mooji so I went to a conference
and it was a really conference and they
had this wonderful little Twitter ticker
of all the people that were tweeting and
this showed up unexpectedly delightful
speaker gifts are unexpectedly
delightful da-dew did man named thanks
hashtag that I did not tweet that that
is the string that this particular
display came up with but if you notice
there's a whole lot of use in there and
if we remember our Unicode encoding the
we were using earlier if we were to
split that out and convert it into a
character I actually tweeted that
because that's the tweet that was coming
up on this display but it decided to
take that unicode character decode it
strip out any of the special characters
competent together and the ends at the
end they're just the new lines so
yeah I mean you could do that if you
wanted to clean up your input or
whatever but what you should be doing is
you should be using Unicode and you
should be using databases and systems
and programming languages that support
Unicode because otherwise you get things
like this this is a security
vulnerability which meant that until
they patched it in WordPress 4.2 I could
inject a cross-site scripting attack
into your website using only one emoji
would you like to know more this emoji
is the thinking face this emoji has a
code this emoji happens to be a full
byte character if you ran a wordpress
site with mysql without such strict
tables turned on and with its utf-8 kind
of not really encoding system if i added
this as a comment mysql would drop much
like we were seeing earlier with those
submissions systems
it was literally truncating my input
which means that if you were to craft
something like this submitted the page
comes back and then you would say to
submit another comment that completed
the rest of the tag then you could have
your own click thing in there and that
wouldn't be captured by any client-side
validation that's completely valid in
the database side because it's just text
right no so that was fun
from WordPress 4.2 emoji works because
they fixed it so you could no longer do
cross-site scripting attacks using emoji
in WordPress blogs if you are using ways
to although please use strict tables and
please use utf-8 and before which will
accept for bite the characters and not
just drop them this has been your public
service security announcement because
Troy is not here and every talk needs to
mention security and one
that emoji will work though and has
worked for longer than emoji have been
in Unicode is URL links this is a
website this is a valid website URL
spoon emoji ws is a valid website if you
enter in a spoon emoji ws it'll go to a
valid website there is an entire RFC
that predates emoji to make non-latin
characters work in URLs because if you
didn't already know there are some
languages that use characters other than
latin 1 but because the internet you
cannot have non Latin one characters and
URLs so they have this RFC which means
that you can convert non-latin
characters into Punic code so the X in
double dash and a whole bunch of
interesting strings interesting
characters afterwards if you see X n
domains there normally say Han
unification showing a Chinese Japanese
Korean URLs there the entire RFC tells
you how to encode backwards and forwards
and it means that people that don't
speak English or languages with Latin
characters can actually use the internet
which is helpful I hear it helps um oh
yes this one this is a fun one so with
the accents and all the other weird
things that come up when you use
languages that have like kind of English
characters but not really some
developers think that they can do stuff
like just normalize their input
stripping all the accents off because
you know it makes things like sorting
easier right don't ever do this do not
ever strip your input use languages and
systems and databases that support utf-8
and Unicode by default because otherwise
you get interesting things like this
that may or may not have happened at a
particular New Zealand website recently
where somebody tried to enter some data
and it stripped all their content so all
of a sudden is post four they were
talking about was getting them to talk
about kicking
kicker in Maori is cake what they
actually entered was Kiki which is
armpit they were talking about armpits
and it changed it to cake which means it
made it all weird and this is not the
only example that has ever happened
there's another example that you may
have read about where a Turkish eye
without a dot versus an eye with the dot
was allegedly the catalyst that resulted
in the death of two people so just just
use systems that support Unicode
natively all the way from your
application all the way down to your
database into your operating system okay
okay good because if you happen to be
using systems that allow Unicode by
default it means that you can have some
wonderful system settings which means
that you can have stuff like this where
you can have sunset and sunrises your AM
and PM in your Mac systems and you can
have some very interesting changes in
your Mac OS settings including you can
change your system password to emoji but
as soon as you reboot your machine you
can't actually input emoji again and
then you break your device so don't do
that
but still you can have a mankeum is
emoji you can also do this on Windows so
if you can see there's an OK symbol over
here and there's a few other bits all
these resources I'll be tweeting out
later and there's links to exactly how
they managed to do this but you know who
doesn't like a performance graph that's
just ok um depending on your operating
system though there are some places
where emoji by design will explicitly
not work such as in Safari Browser tags
there is a website called emoji PDA org
which is wonderful
it's an encyclopedia of emoji do check
it out this is the page for the locked
emoji if you see up there
there is no emoji there and yet every
tree and unicorn habit but you see the
URL that is HTTP and a lock
Safari explicitly do not allow any of
the padlock emojis in their tab titles
so that websites can't make it look like
they're running HTTPS when they're not
Firefox and Chrome still allow this but
Safari doesn't that's cool speaking of
inputting emoji you kind of need a way
to input emoji like in your keyboard and
such if you're using Android you may be
familiar with the smiley face under the
Enter key which allows you to bring up
all the wonderful blob emoji and you can
span through all the different panels of
that if you're running a Mac you can run
command control space and it brings up a
wonderful little picker with the ability
to search for emoji as well and as of
recently in the fall or the creator's
update of Windows 10 you can have
Windows key dot and it brings up this
same emoji picker for Windows and you
can search for the things and everything
else but these are just soft keyboards
right what we really need is a hardware
keyboard where you can have all the
emoji which a London local called Tom
Scott made he had 14 mechanical
keyboards all laid out and had every
emoji that was valid at the time and it
was big and unruly but it worked here
the code is like autohotkey and some
Lewis script to make all the keyboards
think they're different keyboards and
the the video he's got for how he
describes how he made all this work is
delightfully hacky and sizzles in the
same person that's responsible for the
emoji only network you can imagine how
long that ran for about a year and then
it stopped but it meant that you could
only send emoji and they thought this
would be great because it means that you
couldn't swear people you
couldn't offend yes you could you can
offend people using just emoji don't do
that be nice with emerging um but in the
web space so I'm the site reliability
engineer so I deal with the web a lot so
I know a lot about the web in the web
there are some websites that will have
soft keyboards within their system so on
Twitter there's a little smiley face and
then you can do the search ething and
you can get all the different emoji but
on Twitter until recently
you couldn't search for emoji now you
can but Instagram is better because you
can also search for emoji but you can
also have emoji hashtags the regex to be
able to search whether something is a
hashtag if it has a merging unit is so
very long but depending on what you're
searching on Instagram there are some
emerging that you can't search for the
hash tag off such as eggplant emoji for
obvious reasons but if you don't have
soft keyboard in your web app and you
want to make it ridiculously easy for
your users to be able to input
emoji you can use short codes so this is
pick if I want to enter in cake and I'm
on github or I'm on slack I can add :
cake :
and once I submit my message it'll come
back as cake this is great right no this
is terrible you shouldn't do this and
I'll tell you why this works for Unicode
emoji up to a certain point in slack and
it does not go any further it also has
to be explicitly defined which means
that if you are cool and hip and happen
to be in Australian startup called
Atlassian and have your own chat thing
called hip chat and you don't want to
use the colons instead you use brackets
if you go Open bracket cake closed
bracket on HipChat you get a different
cake this is terrible
I want just a slice of shortcake I don't
want an entire birthday
I can't eat an entire cake yes okay this
is a contrived example but this is one
of those things where it's the
differences that really get annoying
because slack ha as well as not updating
their emoji slack calls this an emoji
this is party parrot normally it's
animated with the head bobbing this is a
cockapoo from it's a mountain bird from
New Zealand and it's animated and it is
not an emoji that is a emoticon this is
the ship it's squirrel which is a
squirrel that I had on it from github
this is not an emoji this is an emoticon
emoji are specific characters in Unicode
and that is not an emerging and okay yes
I get frustrated about this but if
you're a website and you happen to have
the colons and such just so you can have
Unicode entered and emojis entered but
that's fine but just don't allow me to
disable your autocorrect autocorrect
there are puns and emoji people come on
haha okay if I enter in a : smile into
your website and it comes back with a
smiling liars grinning emoji which just
escalates my happiness I'm not gonna be
very happy about that or if I take an
emoticon that I perceive to be
embarrassed and blushing and it turns
into me vomiting out money I'll be
extremely upset because that's American
money and I'm Australian and my and my
money isn't green this can go even
further where say you have git commits
and in the middle of you get commit you
have : de colon and it changes it to a
German flag or if you're trying to enter
in ipv6 addresses and all of a sudden
your colon 100 : turns into
100 in the middle of your IP yeah but
slack
it's like we have ducks now we have eggs
we have spoon emoji these do not work on
slack they just stop
they've stopped their compatibility
they're now two years out of date and
you cannot by default have a duck emoji
in your slack and this annoys me because
I like ducks coming down
once you enter in your mode you've got
to read it back again right on the web
you have absolutely complete control
about how you display your content to
your users if there is one thing I can
make you do if there's one thing one
suggestion I can make an able fallback
do not allow in your web application
system emoji to be displayed because
every slide so far in this talk has been
a picture I'm running hi Sierra on a Mac
I could not show you the windows
emerging in the Firefox emoji and the
Twitter emoji unless I had pictures
because this is how emojis look for me
natively I think giving this talk for
two years
those last two would have been boxes
until I did my recent operating system
upgrade there are emoji here that are
actually emoji but they're turning up
his text by default I have an entire
website which shows you exactly how
these things will show up differently
that you can test your various mobile
browsers and laptops and the rest so you
can see exactly how your emoji are
turning up or not turning up for your
system because if you will now the
system emoji to come through you are
literally perpetrating the differences
that I was showing before like from the
flushed face being embarrassed or
shocked for the the grinning and
grimacing you're perpetrating that
implicit misinterpretation and your
users are gonna get confused what you
should be doing is you should be falling
back to something such as Twitter's
emoji
twee emoji Jes will automatically
take Unicode characters and substitute
them in for the pictures which means
that everyone's input add display
regardless of whether they're on Android
Windows Linux they will all display the
same and that means you get a consistent
export and and view for your website no
matter what your user is using that's
great right
sadly tween emoji doesn't do the full
shebang on Twitter if you mouse over
your emoji it displays the text this
doesn't do that so I suggest you raise
the bar come on okay if you want to do
full compatibility for your emoji
display to make sure that everyone can
see your emojis and everyone sees your
emojis the same you should enable alt
highlights highlight have tooltip now
servers and think of it in terms of web
accessibility because if you remember
the Japanese emoji from way way back at
the start of the talk they were 12 by 12
pixels depending on how you see if you
need glasses or if you've got a screen
reader you're not going to be able to
see what's going on so this is the sort
of thing you should be generating when
you export what this is is it's a PNG
image with the explicit code for the
emoji the alt is the actual unicode
character when you select a picture
which has an old and you copy it you you
get the alt text in your clipboard
normally like you're not selecting and
copying pictures but when they in line
in the middle of a span in the middle of
text you're copying the old text which
means you can copy out exactly what was
meant to be inputted the old text and
the title in HTML are not the same
because the title is what gets the mouse
over so if I have a title equals owl
then when I mouse over it
it's an owl and for extra bonus points
if you use your re labels a screen
reader will output that as emoji owl now
granted you cannot do this client-side
the amount of data you would need to be
able to have the title of the emoji for
every emoji is several megabytes so you
do it server-side Twitter doesn't have a
server-side one but that's okay I made
it for you in Python if you pip install
a motive the gate it will a motive for
fire your emoji so you can imagine while
your emoji if you are using our ginger
templates such as in Django you can load
a notification and then you just filter
your content through and it will you
substitute any emoji character for the
Twitter picture people add the alt text
it will add the title and we'll add the
Aria label you can load it in this way
and pipe it through or you can just wrap
your entire text that you're writing
directly into your template and it will
convert it all for you
you should definitely link read for a
great big blog ranting post that I've
made about all this a little bit out of
date now but it still explains the
entire scope for all the different
systems and how everything is terrible
and how this will fix some of it but as
a reminder in case I haven't said it
enough yet make sure you're using utf-8
on all your systems in HTML you enable
that by explicitly declaring your child
said as utf-8 because then you get emoji
and who doesn't like emoji it's okay
this is the homestretch now
the future the future of emoji guess
what we're getting every year for from
now until forever every year we're gonna
be getting new emoji and it's gonna be
wonderful so late last year we got some
really cool new emoji like the broccoli
emoji
who doesn't love broccoli also Hedgehog
emoji how cute is that
also the Colbert emoji oh my goodness
Stephen Colbert no babies Wow tough
crowd um also just in time for Halloween
last year we got a zombie emoji
elf emoji wizard emoji there's also a I
love you
emoji so there's already devil horns and
that and now you have all the different
symbols there's now a sandwich because
you know there's Everest and there's
aliens and there's pies and there's like
there were 57 new emoji last year and
it's just like right because that's also
a new emoji that we got last year
mind-blown emoji we also got of
particular relevance for people that are
from this particular country English
Scottish and Welsh flags
so instead of just having the UK you can
now have your particular country and
this came in last year because the Isle
of Man flag has already been in there
since 2015 no no um I'm very much a
Unicode nerd so I went through the
Unicode 10 spec and the difference
between the sweat dropping from face the
recommended display option for that has
changed from something that could
actually be a bit of sweat on the side
of a face to an anthropomorphic blob of
water so expect to see some slight
changes in the Android emoji going
forward Oh another really really
important thing
they came in last year previously we've
had male and female so child adult all
the person as of last year we now have
gender neutral which means that we're
getting even more ways for people to be
able to show themselves and express
themselves with emoji that look like
them which is really really useful
sadly vendors a terrible though so the
new rock-climbing emoji on the left we
have rock climbing
man rock climbing emoji explicitly with
the gender modifier that I mentioned
earlier
on the right is female rock climbing
emoji if you do not have the gender
identifier in there the top is Twitter
the bottom is Facebook Twitter will turn
up by default is and then Facebook will
turn out by default as a one extend that
out to the fact that doctors are default
men and secretaries of default women and
teachers a default women and blah oh one
thing we might be getting this year
which is really cool
directional modifiers so we already have
color modifiers and gender modifiers
directional modifiers which means that
you can define which way the gun or the
kick scooter kick scooter is an emoji
come on that's cool
possibly this year will be getting
directional modifiers which means that
you can make your kick scooters go the
other way yeah that's cool um there is
the draft standard that has just closed
for public commenters of a couple of
days ago because next week in the US the
Unicode consortium is meeting to decide
whether there's going to be directional
emoji
I'll be watching Twitter with gleeful
her nerdiness not only I would probably
going to get have we gotten new emoji
sorry there have also been a whole lot
of updates to emoji in the last year
including the fact that they fixed the
grinning and grimace emoji so it
actually looks like a
miling face now with with the smiles and
everything if you run a Mac and you've
updated to High Sierra they've redone a
whole bunch of the animals so now the B
actually looks like a B instead of a
blob with sticks coming out of the butt
the flushed face that I mentioned
earlier from Android has gone from oh
you shouldn't have to actually shocked
to duck I think yeah sadly the blobs
have now been superseded by what I can
only describe as an intern finding the
gradient feature and okay so apparently
this is more accessible to people but
there's a certain amount of I could have
knocked that up in ms paint from windows
95 and had a better result plus I really
like the blobs the blobs were cool I
liked the blobs and vendors still like
to have different interpretations about
the new emoji are this is the face hand
covering face emoji which for everything
apart from Apple makes it look like a on
Apple it looks like a so have fun with
that um yeah all these wonderful not
wonderful terrible blues yellow gradient
emoji from Google it's just like God and
if you follow particular people who like
Unicode and emerging on the internet you
would have heard of hamburger gate where
the original hamburger emoji from the
Android redo had the cheese on the
bottom and there was a petition and they
changed it not before serving cheese on
the bottom hamburgers at the Google
kitchens so yes one good thing that
Android is doing though with all the
different versions of Android that have
come through mode you keep on changing
now they are going to be
adding a subsystem within Android that
you can pass through the emojis the new
emojis coming forward into older
platforms which will be good except for
the fact that there are all the terrible
gradient emoji and not the cool blobs
but it does mean that a mobile phone
from Android bought today with Android 8
will have continued emoji support going
forward it's that cool umm the Windows
emoji oh my gosh the Windows emoji now
look amazing I look like weird like
segments of banana before but now they
look really cool really well-defined I
think they look kind of awesome oh and
they did fix the clapping hand emoji
which is great so now it actually looks
like you're clapping one thing that
Windows does that not anyone else does
is have mix gendered mix color modifier
couples so you can now have a ligature
that looks like your relationship which
is really super important I guess
emergent one is a open source now
freemium emoji said and they've changed
their Logie so now they look all kind of
shiny and cool they were the first open
emoji set they were funded by
Kickstarter and before Twitter came
along and they kind of look cool now
except they got rid of the really cool
al from earlier and now it actually
looks like an owl instead of a argyle
hedwig or something Twitter have also
reasonably updated their emoji so now
the thumbs up actually has a wrist which
is helpful but one thing Twitter just
did is they removed the colors from the
sparkle so now it just looks like a
golden Sparkle and I really like the old
Sparkle I'm still upset about this what
else we got I guess gender
professional OG you can now have
teachers and farmers and bacons and all
this kind of stuff which I mentioned
explicitly because there is now an emoji
that looks like me well just apart from
the hair thing but it's like it's like I
have a Mac and it's just like ok new
emoji so I mentioned that the Unicode
consortium a meeting next week there's a
whole bunch of emoji that could be
coming this year including cupcake
hiking shoe teddy bear behead your face
hippo kangaroo kangaroo and llama the
Badger face is explicitly important
because it means that we can finally
have Unicode only encodings of the
Badger song yeah old-school flash
animations you other emoji that could be
happening are some of the emotion
reactions from Facebook including
delighted party freezing hot face also
ginger emerging in bald emoji might be
coming which is cool sadly no green hair
emoji just the hair color there's a
proposal to have any of the official
hair colors that you can have on
I think it's United Nations driving
licenses where it actually says what
your natural hair color is they're going
to be modified so you can now have
gingers and balls which is cool but you
know you don't have to wait for the
Unicode consortium to add your favorite
thing what do you can do if you really
want to is just use CSS to put your
sunglasses on the Koala and your crayons
on your candor and stuff this is really
cool code pen from Mandy who gets to
smoosh together all the emojis so you
can have half winking face and you can
have different colors on your butterfly
and that's cool and depending on whether
you want to go to Google and petition
things instead of having just your
banana and your ice cream if you smush
them together and
the motive a a recognized ligature you
could have your Sunday after all that
you couldn't have earlier you could
extend this by actually having an
official ligature which is the chipmunk
in the Hat which could make your
tschappat squirrel which means the
github could have an official ligature
for their ship at squirrel I couldn't
think of anything that the party parrot
could get ligature din to unless you had
say one of the birds and the confetti or
something but that's okay
because what I did in a fit of water on
earth am I thinking I proposed that the
tropical bird emoji be added into
Unicode it hasn't been rejected it will
either be confirmed or denied next week
whether it's coming this year you're
welcome all the way yeah I can't confirm
this particular thing is true but all
I'm saying is the list of exclusions and
exclusions when you submit an emoji I
submitted this in November in 2016
since then there is now a new exclusion
factor which says exclusion factor K
faulty comparison the emoji dog in
poodle and two types of camel do not
justify adding different varieties of
the same kind of animal there is already
duck Eagle chicken baby chick all these
other kind of birds so now they're like
no more birds and I'm sorry but it's
okay because as the next week we'll know
whether we get party parrot as an
official emoji so then slack can
actually maybe update their bloody emoji
and then I can use the duck in the
pattern now yay I have like three
minutes left this is great so if you are
after more information about emerging
emerging pedia org is the wonderful
website that I've gotten a bunch of this
information from they are also on
twitter at emoji pedia there is also the
fake Unicode consortium on Twitter which
retweets a whole bunch of interest
ding errors with Unicode and such and
you should definitely tweet at them
because they hate it every time that I
mentioned that they're cool because they
don't like publicity so you should
definitely take pictures and tweet them
the Unicode consortium does have an
official Twitter where they do a bunch
of promotions about the fact that they
are a non-for-profit and they do a whole
bunch of work that's not just emerging
but what you can do is you can sponsor
an emoji so bronze silver gold
sponsorship you can give them money to
help them continue their efforts to do
things like make sure that tribal
languages with written dialects get
codified into Unicode and you know
important work that they do that's not
just emerging sorry some takeaways it's
nearly done I'm sorry um there is a lot
of power in communication and emoji are
a really important tool to help further
written communication but never assume
that people will know what you're
talking about in any form of
communication without explicitly telling
them what you mean because there is a
whole bunch of possibility for
misinterpretation there is a possibility
of misinterpretation if you don't
implement emoji responsibly and please
if you're doing emoji stuff on your
websites think about accessibility so
everyone can have fun with emoji thank
you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
