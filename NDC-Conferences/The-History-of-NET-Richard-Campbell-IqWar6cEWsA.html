history my name is Richard Campbell and
I was actually born in New Zealand but
so I'm not too far away from home I
granted I left when I was three years
old I live in I was born raised in
British Columbia this is my home on the
left my neighbor's home on the right
it's about six o'clock in the morning on
a Wednesday which is garbage day in my
neighborhood so this guy's not here by
accident he drops by every Wednesday to
see if I put out my garbage cans early
most folks find this a bit disturbing
but these are garbage eaters you don't
have to shake them out of your shoes so
they have their redeeming features and
fairly amusing so my I have a small
that's about 100 150 kilos worth of bear
I have a 10 kilo dog who trees them on a
regular basis because he's parked
cling-on like today's a good day to die
he just goes for it and the bear always
has that moment he's like I could take
up not worth it goes up the tree so and
that's why how Terriers work of course
I've left the summer of British Columbia
to come to the winter of Sydney although
you guys do winter pretty well and we're
actually having a pretty rough summer
this is a sunrise right now we've had a
very big forest fire season this year
and the smoke is basically covering the
city so it's a very orange right now and
not good air quality it's almost a Los
Angeles Ian another thing that we don't
have in British Columbia that I love are
these things these are awesome yeah I
can think of a couple other than the
steering wheels on the wrong side I
think the Ute is awesome although in the
snow this is probably a deathtrap it's
not a lot of weight over those rear
tires there I think you just go around
and around and around but should look
good doing it I wrote my first line of
code in 1977 now that is not the most
important thing to happen in 1977 the
most important thing to have in the 1977
with Star Wars let's have our priorities
straight and I wrote that line of code
on a trs-80 model one
for K Aram cassette tape player it's a
hundred and twenty seven by forty seven
resolution I believe that's a game of
Star Trek being played at that moment on
that machine and it had a version of
basic on it not written by Microsoft
this was a tiny basic it it only had
three error messages what how and sorry
the most Canadian of error messages
really and kind of a non in fact I love
this error message because it's honest
what is object not found but sorry you
know the difference is back then it was
all command line you said print divide
one by zero it goes sorry
today today Windows makes you agree that
you're wrong object not found okay
there's no not okay button I once had a
neighbor come over says my computer says
registry is corrupt okay I don't want to
push that because I don't think it's
okay but you don't have a choice so
sorry obviously you've run across before
you know I make a bunch of podcast I
make conferences as well if you care let
go to go to the northern hemisphere I'm
doing one in Stockholm as part of the
core to launch with Mads targets and
Scott hunter and a bunch of other
troublemakers my big show will be in
Vegas at the end of October and that's
where you'll see mister guy got three
mister Hanselman and so forth about
three thousand people come to that show
and I make a few podcasts any podcast
listeners oh my goodness okay well I
don't have to convince you anything do I
it's Carl started Donna rocks back in
2002 is roughly three years before the
word podcast actually existed which is
why we call it the internet audio talk
show for dotnet developers that was the
best name he could come up with I came
on board as a co-host on episode 100 and
we're at 1476 as of yesterday I also
make an ID based podcast once a week
every Wednesday since April of 2007 so
545 of those and although particularly
relevant to this talk
there's the tablet show which we started
in 2011 I've made a hundred thirty
episodes on and then I shall talk more
about that when we get to that point in
the story about the history of dotnet
another thing that near and dear to my
heart is humanitarian toolbox we build
open source software for disaster relief
organizations we did a codeathon this
week here in in Sydney with a group of
folks on Monday and Tuesday I do
codeathon is to get people hooked on my
projects one of the projects working on
it's called already roots now we're
moving over to core two I asked him to
move over to core two after he finished
the codeathon because what could go
wrong but everybody got a pull request
in over the couple of days that we were
working and I'm hoping to see more pull
requests from them from the from there
we got about 150 people contribute to
that project now a little over three
thousand check-ins alright
let's tell a story about Microsoft and
don't you love this logo this is the
original Microsoft from the very
beginning of Microsoft when Bill quits
our Harvard and he and Paul Allen get
together in Albuquerque and they write a
version of basic and that's actually a
copy of it in the computer museum in in
Northern California and the it's written
for the Altair now any reason this
computer looks like this is this is
before ROM existed when you wanted to
boot an Altair 1888 hundred you had to
enter the boot instructions with the
switches it was about a hundred and
fifteen of them after set of the
switches and load them to the
accumulator and that would start the
tape pull reader to be able to run that
tape to be able to have a version of
basic to program on and I think it's
important in the context that Microsoft
started out as a languages company as a
company for developers but things
happened along the way
logos changed and focus changed in the
night this is the 1980s Microsoft and
this is the era of das all right where I
be M because they've been declared a
monopoly in the computing industry
because of cobalt in a 360 they were
completely dominant in the space had a
consent decree with the United States
government they said they would
outsource technology that was not
central to their business so when they
were made
King a PC which was a sort of a
peripheral business they outsource the
operating system and that was PC Das and
one of the reasons Microsoft would grow
to be what it was was it became this
operating system company now it's
different things have changed if you
fast-forward into the 90s the company's
bigger it's gone from das to Windows
we've had the great windows 95 moment
and they're making many different
development tools and in 97 they hit an
interesting point where they they
literally had too many different dev
products now the big dev products of the
time were C++ first and foremost
Microsoft is a C++ company most of the
developers program in C++ they make one
of the definitive C++ compilers even
then and today but they also had a very
successful product for Windows called
Visual Basic and they had acquired
foxpro and they were making more
products including j plus plus a version
of java for windows written by anders
house Berg and his house Berg we
recruited from Borland
to write Java for the window stack and
he'd done a great job of it so great
he'd scared the snot out of Sun
Microsystems and there would soon be a
lawsuit and then of course visual enter
dev so I don't have to talk about visual
tentative anymore I'm gonna leave it
right there
so Visual Studio 97 was the first
attempt to bring all these products
together because multiple IDE s cost a
lot of money multiple run times cost a
lot of money many different products
going all trying to do the same thing so
consolidation made a lot of sense and
they did not pull it off in studio 97 in
studio 97
only two products j+ plus an inter dev
use a common ide vb c plus plus and
FoxPro all have their own ideas which
are separately installed so not really a
consolidated product at all and of
course Microsoft being Microsoft at that
time which eight plus plus they start
making extensions to Java to make it run
more effectively in Windows and this is
where the root
that son lawsuit cams in but we also
have to remember that at this time
windows on the desktop is utterly
dominant in excess of 90% of
workstations are running Windows and so
Sun quite rightly is concerned that
Microsoft makes this great version of
Java and extends it to only work on
Windows to make it even more effective
that's pretty much going to be all the
Java would ever be and so they sue
Microsoft and make them stop working on
J plus plus to make it go away and a
year later in 98 we get the first of the
great renumber ins in studio 6 so
instead of calling it 98 because it came
out 98 oh no they call it 6 this time
they've actually consolidated all the
IDE s but they've also remembered all
the products so C++ is legitimately 6
and VB is legitimately 6 and the second
version of inter dev is now called 6 but
that's not going to help it
it's the third version of j plus plus
which is actually called version 2
because they made a 1.1 and also the
last version because of the sunsuit so
that thing will go away and another very
important product in that box is the mt4
option pack and I'll talk about why in a
few moments because it's the beginning
of new things this is the end of the
road of this particular development
model but it does do its main task of
pulling all the ID E's together now I
got to jump back a little bit and set
some context and I'm going to show you
this Getty picture this is from July of
1998 and don't these two look happy and
there's a good reason for that
they don't know what's about to happen
to them this is July of 98 in October of
98 things are going to change and I'm
still well ahead of dotnet but this is
the beginning of the gestation of dotnet
with Studio 6 at that moment it was time
to start rethinking things and in
parallel there were other forces at work
and that's why I really like this
picture because by the fall of 98 these
guys will look a little different now
you have to understand jumping all the
way back to June of 1995
Bill Gates is a master of the universe
this is the man that has achieved the
unachievable goal of a PC on every
desktop and he is a hero effectively to
the world and then shortly after that
previous photo was taken in August of 98
he goes to the United States Senate and
is deposed talking about
anti-competitive practices and you can
find this video on YouTube if you care
to watch it bill being a master of the
universe is a bit dismissive of the
Senators which in hindsight was quite
unwise and they vilify him all right
this now there is a case to be had for
the anti-competitive practices at
Microsoft engaged in at the time but the
complaint came down really to this whole
interaction between ie and Netscape
and the fact that third-party software
never seemed as well as run as well on
Windows as the first party stuff that
Microsoft made and because there was no
way to see what was going on they were
accused of doing monopolistic practices
of limiting other people's software it
turned out not to be true but you can
see the results in the Time magazine
cover that came after so that covers
from November of 1999 and in fact in
January of 2000 or in November of 1999
Microsoft will be declared a monopoly
and be ordered to break up into two
companies one that makes operating
systems and one that makes everything
else and within a month bill will step
down as CEO and his friend Steve who
he's known for many many years will take
over CEO bill will become chief
architect he still chairman of the board
still heavily involved in the company
but now Steve's running the company and
I talked to a lot of software people who
thought this was a mistake and I can see
that point of view but the more I've
studied this more I've realized this was
the right guy at the time it was Steve
Ballmer that fought tooth and nail to
keep
Microsoft together and to develop this
agreement with the US government that
they called the consent decree and part
of that consent decree was that they
would never exclude competitors from
working with Windows in any way and that
they would actually have a shared source
version of Windows essentially for
people that wanted to build things on
Windows you could see the source code
for Windows
he couldn't compile it but it was
basically proof that they weren't doing
anything inappropriate under the hood
and to help you know how to interact
more effectively with Windows now this
original agreement was started in
January of 2001 was supposed to last
five years it would end up running for
ten and it is in the umbrella of this
time of this battle that Microsoft is
starting to develop dotnet and in the
early stages Steve Ballmer talked about
it as next-generation Windows services
although shortly after that you'll hear
it called next-generation web services
which is convenient is the same acronym
but do you really want to talk about
Windows are you really gonna talk about
dotnet there are three core groups that
represent what became dotnet each
solving a different problem and I'm
gonna put a face to each of the groups
but I want you to understand there's
hundreds even thousands of people behind
each of these faces so let's start with
the runtime problem and a gentleman by
the name of Jason Zander who today is a
VP but back then was a PM and was
working on the problem of how to bring
together the disparate runtimes the
Visual Basic runtime guys which in the
end was a set of tools that wrote to
wind that worked with Windows believe
their runtime was the best the C++ folks
had MFC again a set of tools that worked
against Windows that they thought was
the right thing why make both why could
they make one and I'm pretty sure each
team was convinced the other team should
just use theirs and everything would be
fine and I think Jason was trying to
find the center line on that he worked
as part of the complex group so they
were trying to evolve calm at the same
time and he would ultimately own the
problem of the runtime and the concept
of managed memory as well second
representative on the languages side
Evander's Howl's bargain Anders as we've
already mentioned came on board to
implement Java for Microsoft ative great
job
then through political need was no
longer able to work on Java anymore and
one would argue if that hadn't happened
we'd probably all be to hava programmers
because what he did next was write a new
language one that we all pretty much
know and love and has gone through many
twists and turns along the way as well
and became the father of c-sharp he also
built another tool in that same time
called J sharp which was a bridge to
allow J plus plus developers to move
their code over to c-sharp relatively
painlessly anders puts developers first
and every time i've had an opportunity
interact with him i've see that mindset
of how he takes care of folks that use
his tools and what happens next to them
third and certainly not least Scott
Guthrie Scott Guthrie joined Microsoft
from Duke University as soon as he
graduated the only job he's ever had and
he went to work for a guy named Mark
Anders on the NT option pack team that
would ultimately ship with studio six
and inside of that NT option pack was a
is for an active server pages and God
did not like active server pages now
Studio 298 or studio 6 shipped at the
end of November of 98 and it is is
normal when a product team ships a
product they take a couple of weeks off
before they get cranking on them on what
happens next in the service packs and
all the things that happen there because
that was December for the most part the
team took all of December off because it
fell into Christmas and Scott being a
young man freshly graduated from
University only a few months before and
this is being his first project he
didn't really take the time off what he
did was work on something better than
ASP called it ASP plus at the time and
over the course of December he prototype
together a version of ASP plus his
vision of better web development and he
showed it off in January when everybody
came back to work and they loved it and
what it was was a runtime environment
that tied to is that it allows you to
program in an object-oriented
language to be able to draw a webpage in
the language he programmed it with is
Java first version of ASP + ran against
Java it's what they had see sharp
wouldn't exist for a couple more years
so that particular point ran against
Java and so the show that they said
that's really cool stop using Java and
they went on from there and the name
would change a few more times ASP plus
would become aspx would eventually
become asp net now Microsoft had been
shipping dev tools on a regular basis
almost a yearly cadence for many years
and operating systems - from 95 to 2000
there were OS is non-stop and there were
PDC conferences on a regular basis and
in 2000 at the Orlando conference in
July which is a terrible time to be in
Orlando they announced dotnet and kind
of blinded people they didn't see it
coming it had been two years since
anything had shipped and they'd gone
through that battle with the DOJ you
know Microsoft was kind of a dirty word
at this particular Morman in the van and
the vernacular everybody was a bit
anxious Steve was now in charge of the
company nobody really knew it was going
on and in the midst of all this they
talk about dotnet but they talk about it
very much with an eye to the consent
decree that won't be signed for almost
another year so one of the things they
talked about was that they're gonna have
a new platform
based on internet standards that's why
it's called dotnet and they're gonna
publish specifications for the CLR and
for SIA sharp they're eka standards
three three four and three three five
very strange thing for a commercial
development company to say hey these
cool new technologies that we're
building yet we're going to publish them
out as as ECMO specification so that
anybody can implement them and some
people will at that same time Windows
2000 comes out and Windows 2000 is an
important version of Windows because it
consolidates the two lines the NT line
the 9x line are going to come together
into one version of Windows this is also
where Microsoft gives up on multi on
different processors for Windows up
until now in the NT line you could also
use an alpha or
MIPS or a PowerPC chip now it's going to
be only Intel the first Pentiums appear
at this time as well and we break the
one gigahertz barriers so when people
talk about the wind tell hegemon
logically it only starts now where
Windows is only running on Intel Intel's
got the Pentium I mean weird al yankovic
we're like a song about the Pentium and
we only have one version of Windows
going forward and it was a pretty good
version of Windows it's also the version
of Windows where they actually decided
tcp/ip would be the primary networking
protocol before that there was net
boolean IP acts and and GCP was just one
of the players so I bring up Windows in
this case because in 2000 we made a lot
of core decisions around what our
platforms are going to look like going
forward and the problems of that had the
following year at PDC 2001 well actually
before october 2000 when in July of 2001
at our Riley conference a
twenty-something Miguel de Icaza will
announce that he is going to implement
those ECMO specifications that Microsoft
published last year as a Linux based
version he will eventually call Moe know
the specs word for monkey also in 2001
ie6 will ship separately from XP it'll
come out a couple of months before then
and that's a problem because it comes
out actually ahead of the CSS one
standard being ratified so it's an odd
version of CSS so in October of 2001 we
get we have ie6 we have Windows XP and
we get the release candidates of the.net
framework and what they calling
studio.net which by the way alongside XP
was bundled with a tablet edition with
Penn support a tool called passport for
the universal sign-on and a set of tools
called my services codenamed hailstorm
that would allow you to have integrated
services served up by central servers
very cloud like in 2001 these two things
would not go well and part of it I think
has a lot to do with that consent decree
which will be signed in November of 2001
and set the stage for certain conditions
at Microsoft's gonna operate in going
forward from there it's a lot of great
ideas that came out of PDC 2001 just not
all of them went particularly well and I
have nothing bad to say about XP well at
the time I did because I liked Windows
2000 I called XP Windows 2000 with the
fisher-price interface because it had
all the nice rounded colorful buttons
and things it was a very good looking
very cute version of XP it also didn't
support USB that would come later our
memories of XP are sort of twisted by
how long XP was our operating system it
went through so many twists and turns
but another major event that happened in
this time frame was the explosion in
malware so in February 2001 was when the
Anna Kournikova virus went for a ride in
July the code red worm in August code
red worm 2 in September the nimda worm
it was non-stop breaches and attacks one
after the neck so that by January of
2002 Bill Gates puts out one of his
famous letters the same way back in 95
he put out the internet tidal wave
letter that got Microsoft focused on
internet technology in 2002 he puts out
the trustworthy computing letter and
what it really says under the hood
everybody needs to focus on security
it's time to fix this once and for all
and he'll do it it's not a small task
it's gonna take years but you know
really we've never had that level of
exploit since now in the context of XP
XP had just shipped when this letter
comes out XP service pack 1 is already
in the works it's all the stuff that got
pushed out from the initial deployment
and it's bug fixes so the security
version is going to be XP service pack 2
and they put a special team together
that's focused on that security problem
and it effectively splits the windows
team they have all those best and
brightest solving the security problem
while they're well to deal with SPT XP 2
and continue on and is a real
interesting debate to have around
whether it should have been service pack
2 or not and so by February of 2002
shortly after letter we get the first
version of visuals
and the first full version of.net so
that's the first version of c-sharp of
the which is really the first time
Microsoft made a fully object-oriented
language
I mean C++ you can argue about but from
scratch a brand new language it was kind
of a big deal for Microsoft as much as
it was for all of us the marketing
campaign around studio.net was awesome
it was 22 languages one platform it was
kind of the opposite of the way Java was
presented right because Chava was
presented as any platform one language
and I was trying to think of 22
languages that they actually had 22
languages in the box because that's a
lot I mean the obvious ones are there c
sharp c plus plus vb j sharp but unless
obvious ones like component pascal
fortran i full haskell mercury over on
AWS perl python RPG scheme small talk
standard ml and of course Fortran or no
COBOL don't forget for a while all
dotnet versions many of them don't
particularly go anywhere ma foxpro
leaves the box at this point and goes on
its merry way we'll put out a couple of
versions on its own because it's not a
dotnet language and never will be in
this same time frame in March of 2002
Microsoft releases the rotor project and
the rotor project is a academic shared
source version of.net so the CLR c-sharp
base class libraries all of that stuff
is put out in an academic license so you
can't really use it for a product but
the source was published so that was
available as well call it pseudo
open-source but Microsoft has open
source e things several times around the
dotnet space and a year later we get 1.1
version 2 really this is all the bug
fixes for both the framework at the CLR
some new features into the language we
start stratifying the versions so we get
a professional version and we get an
architect's version which makes you
wonder our architects professionals be
that as it may
talk about PDC 2003 so in 2000 2001 they
put a lot of energy to talking about
dotnet before dotnet was released and I
think it got the PDC's on a bandwagon
now of talking about future future stuff
at the same time Microsoft has an image
problem this battle with the DOJ has
sort of shaken their confidence
certainly shaking their customers
confidence and they start to be a little
more publicly visible a guy named Robert
Scoble joins the company and creates
channel 9 named after United Airways
ability for you to listen in on the
pilots from channel 9 that's where the
name comes from and he runs around with
a video camera inside of Microsoft
putting human faces on the product so
that people could sort of see what's
going on and I think that's what sets
the tone for PDC 2003 because of PDC
2003 we start talking about the new
version of Windows now there was more
than one new version of Windows because
Microsoft had a problem they'd been so
successful with Windows it was kind of
dominant the market they could do
whatever they wanted pretty much and so
they'd come up some wild ideas he the
the XP version of Windows the code name
was Whistler Whistler named after a
mountain not far from where I live and
so the next version was going to be
named Blackcomb which is literally the
next Mountain over and it was
object-oriented everything they were
gonna do this awesome object-oriented
operating system that nobody could get
their head around so they dialed it back
and right between the mountains of
Whistler and Blackcomb there's a bar
called the long horn bar so they named
the dialed back version Longhorn that's
where the name comes from and at the PDC
2003 they talked about Windows Longhorn
built on the three pillars Avalon Indigo
and Wynn FS Avalon is a completely
object-oriented way to render to the
screen now under the hood this was a
very important thing because we wanted
to be able to use the GPU inside of
windows we've just been bit bleeding
inside of windows up to now just using
the video card as if it was memory and
so you had DirectX whenever you wanted
to play a game that would actually use a
GPU properly they want to do in Corp
rate that into the OS as a whole in
Avalon was their way forward on that and
indigo was the tooling for
communications between processes between
machines across the internet any
protocol any packaging anyway that was
the intent of indigo and when FS one of
the callbacks to the black comb project
was completely object-oriented file
system so that a file is now an object
and executing it like opening it in word
is effectively a method it was ambitious
let us say and they had a tough time
getting it done they were had a lot to
build there and member the team was
split in half because they were working
on sp2 and SP two dropped in August of
2004 now I would argue that Microsoft
probably should have called this Windows
XP version two because calling it that
would have reset the clock see buried
inside of every Enterprise Agreement
when you buy Microsoft product is this
guarantee because you don't buy
individual products per se when you're a
big corporation they counted the number
of users give you a price per user and
you get everything and inside that
contracts is you get a new OS every five
years no matter what and so XP was
shipped in November of 2001 five years
is November of 2006 and is now August of
2004 and Windows has a long way to go
and the guy running XP sp2 is a guy
named Jim Allchin now he's finished he
takes over the Windows project and he
start he kicks out the three pillars to
get focused on building a version of
Windows that's gonna make that deadline
now that we know is going to turn into a
crisis in the meantime over the dotnet
world we have one of the very best
versions of.net come coming out this is
November of 2005 this is the third
version of.net called version two
because numbering is fun so this is CLR
to framework to one of the reasons CLR 2
was so good is that the sequel server
2005 guys one of the version of.net that
would run inside of sequel server now
this isn't a good idea but it was useful
for certain classes of customer
that microsoft had the folks that were
doing big data before big data was a
thing had these huge computational
requirements across massive amounts of
data that were storing a sequel server
and T Seagle wasn't cutting it so they
wanted a lightweight version of.net that
they could run inside and sequel server
do this hard computation like I said
it's still not a good idea and if you
want to mess up your sequel server
turning this feature on because it's off
by default is a good way to do that now
you can embed a web request into a where
statement or into a group by statement
and have it happen every iteration
that's a long-running query but the size
of effective sequel 2005's need was a
much tighter version of the CLR it
benefited the CLR every time you could
take something out of its context and
press again it you get a stronger
version another thing that came out in
2005 was 64-bit support so AMD came up
with the original extensions they the
amd64 extensions that allowed us to run
64-bit Intel abhi building a whole new
processor called titanium that both guys
that bought it really loved and
Microsoft was gonna be able to program
against it but when AMD came up these
extensions Intel realized that was a
better way they came up with our Intel
extensions and boom we had 64-bit
everywhere this is also when we get
generics and partial types for c-sharp
a very good version of.net in 2006 we
get the first mix conference this is
where Microsoft really starts exploring
against the open web world and
connecting with folks here this is where
they finally put out a new version of ie
IE 7 comes out in October of 2006 and
people say why 5 years why did it take 5
years ago for my sixth - ie 7 and it was
a good reason the team behind the
rendering engine for the browser was the
team behind WPF behind Avalon they were
busy and so took him a while to get to
the new version of ie and ie6 gets to
eventually start going away at this
point eventually and of course in
November of 2006 we get Vista and all of
the problems therein and a long I mean
it's interesting to think about in
November of 2006 right on that five-year
deadline they ship the enterprise
edition of Vista no other versions only
the enterprise
only for enterprises to comply with the
volume license agreements requirements
because they know no enterprise company
is going to install it because
enterprises only install after the first
service pack that's how enterprises work
and we as regular consumers we're going
to get the normal versions the following
year in March of 2007 with all the stuff
that's broken fixed the only people who
installed that version reviewers because
that's their job and so they reviewed a
very very troubled version of the
operating system and I had my mother
call me and say oh I don't want Windows
Vista and I said you're not qualified
for an opinion because she wasn't but I
didn't install it on there anyway and of
course the breakup of Longhorn put
Avalon and indigo and all those bits on
to the dotnet team so they suddenly have
to produce a special version of.net the
3oh version that incorporates what we
become windows presentation foundation
windows communication foundation windows
workflow and card space these are all
bits that ultimately we're supposed to
be part of vista and now we had to have
a programming model against them very
quickly interesting to also note this is
when Intel ships core to not the core -
we know and love from net but core - the
dual core processor and every processor
after that will be multi-core so we're
multi-core as of July 2006 and
thereafter and I couldn't I would be
remiss if I didn't mention this little
bugger in June of 2007
so while Microsoft's dealing with the
vista problems and trying to straighten
out net from receiving all of that code
iPhone comes out and you know the sad
part is it was kind of the end of the
phone at this moment because before this
phone phones were kind of cool they had
keyboards somewhere slide-out somewhere
up ride some had antennas there was all
kinds of things at atma phone
but after iPhone they're all slabs of
flat glass it's boring but that's what
happens and so out comes the phone and
at the same time Microsoft comes up with
a really interesting tool now the first
verdict now it was originally the
codename was WPF /e for
windows presentation foundation /
extensions and Brad Abrams who was
running a team at the time we did an
interview with him on dr. rock said I've
learned something if you give a product
a cool codename you get a bad product
name Avalon becomes Windows presentation
foundation but if you give the product
code name make it a bad code name like
WPF II you get a cool product name
Silverlight now the first version is
Silverlight you programming in
JavaScript right zamel barely exists at
this particular point but they have a
runtime for the Mac it's really about
media play and one of the things they do
is Silverlight it's important inside of
Microsoft as a whole it's they start
iterating it independent of the rest of
the products this is one of the first
things you can download separately from
Microsoft and they put out a bunch of
versions very quickly and in this same
time frame this is in 2007 Scott Guthrie
starts hiring his ninja army he hired
Scott Hanselman Rob Connery and Phil
hack in the same month that's a lot of
open source guys all at once also in
October of 2007 is when he first shows
off MVC at the all tech conference in
Austin and blows everybody's mind with
you know it is not just about web forms
but it's the beginning of all of those
things is in 2007 well before most
people were thinking about it by
November of 2007 we get dotnet 3.5 and
studio 2008 so now Jay sharp goes away
we've integrated all those WPF products
this is the beginning of the designer
movement so you're supposed to have a
designer working with you as a developer
to handle the WPF things they put out
expression blend
we interviewed like the three teams that
actually had a designer dev working
together at Donna rocks most people just
faked it or used wind forms and we're
happy and Silverlight continue to
iterate through many versions in 2008 a
lot happens this is where we get silver
like to and we start seeing a lot more
capability in terms of actually being
able to employ to the Mac and it becomes
a really good deployment vehicle the
first version of Chrome comes out in
September of 2008 and Bill Gates has now
stepped down he's gone off to do his
curing of malaria and the Bill and
Melinda foundation the amazing Miguel de
Icaza puts out moonlight a open source
Linux version of silverlight that's got
a lot of the similar bits in it and at
the PDC in Oh 8 we hear the first words
about asher from a guy named ray Ozzie
he's taken over as chief architect and
he talks about a story about how
Microsoft has so many different
platforms that they use right the MSDN
side the MSN side all these different
huge suites and they all have separate
hardware and doesn't it make sense for
us to have a consistent framework for
all of them run together hey you can run
it too all you have to do is live in a
web role in an app role I think Ray
Ozzie had a tough time being at
Microsoft the guy built great products
over the year this is one of the guys
behind Lotus Notes
he built groove which Microsoft acquired
very I think it was a mistake to call to
take the title chief architect his bill
had it and you're never going to be bill
that's ok you should be Ray and he was
very a very smart man but very
challenging take his on but he wrote a
letter that really defined the concept
of cloud inside of Microsoft that became
a sure so he served well it's just a
very very tough role to jump into the
clean up of Windows finally takes place
with Windows 7
a beloved version of Windows led by a
guy by the name of Steven Sinofsky and
definitely gets windows back on the
track in a way that folks are much
happier where it's now 2009 and Windows
Azure ship shortly after that in
February of 2010 in some respects
Microsoft has its feet under it now we
have a sure seat garage sequel Azure
can-do php.net and Java on it so this
this is the beginning of a cloud
environment AWS is a couple of years
ahead we have a good version of Windows
and silver lights maturing nicely so
we're actually able to play with all the
environments and then in March of 2010
the big iPhone comes along and it's not
so much that this device comes out per
se but a month later in April of 22
and Steve Jobs will put out 11 letter
via The Wall Street Journal called
thoughts on flash
now what Steve had actually learned is
if you ran flash on this thing it wiped
the battery out in a few hours because
flash is evil but his answer was no
plugins are gonna run in Safari on iOS
devices anymore
which effectively lynches Silverlight by
proxy on the iPad and ultimately on the
iPhone as well if flash will give in by
the end of this year they'll say we're
not gonna make flash for mobile browsers
anymore so they weren't wrong if flash
hadn't been as bad as it was they may
not have had to go here there are then
be third-party tools you can install on
the iPad so you can still run flash you
can drain your battery in a couple hours
if you want to but you know that's what
Steve was trying to protect us against
and it just had a big impact on the
product as a whole this is also roughly
the time when Phone 7 comes out and
while I loved it apparently was only me
studio 2010 another great version studio
because this is when we finally rev
everything so we get a new version the
framework we get a new version of the
CLR we get parallel extensions we get
Silverlight for it now works with Chrome
it goes fully out of the browser we
start seeing some really cool stuff
being done with Silverlight like the
2010 Olympics also things that amazing
in studio 2010 that we may have
forgotten about this is of the first
version of studio ships with an open
source library jquery's in the box and
Microsoft will support jQuery the point
with the create the jQuery foundation
that today is the JavaScript foundation
so while we could still look at
Microsoft as an team open-source kinda
in 2010 we start seeing them making
serious moves towards open-source in a
big way but that is April of 2010 by
October of 2010 at the last PD see
things are getting a little tougher this
is at the Redmond campus only about a
thousand people be there it was all
streamed so that everyone could see it
in action and somebody notices and that
somebody is a lady by the name of Mary
Jo Foley but a lot of us noticed that we
went to a professional Developers
Conference they didn't talk about
silverlight at all and so Maryjo
interviews the vp of server and tools
guy named bob mug lea and asked him why
aren't you talking about silverlight at
the professional Developers Conference
and Bob Moglia said our strategy has
changed that's all really he said other
people grabbed that said silverlight is
dead like it burst into flames or
something but the reality of course is
goes back to the spring with the fact
that the iPad and iOS was not going to
run Silverlight and so if you really had
to be across all of those platforms
Silverlight wasn't gonna do it for all
of them that we do it for the Mac it
would do it for Windows but it wouldn't
do it for everywhere silver life
continues to ship five will come out in
December of 2011 but we are up against
that particular issue and it creates a
crisis Bob bug Lea leaves the company by
the end of the year giving up a VP role
and the guy who will take over his job
is named Satya Nadella now in that same
time frame in the March 2009 time frame
we had an interesting dynamic going on
between the major browsers ie9 is going
through its beta Reds very rapidly
chrome is updating constantly and
Firefox is deputy constantly and they're
making JavaScript better there's no
other way to describe it
javascript got dramatically faster over
the late 2010 through 2011 into early
2012 many many iterations over and over
again the chakra engine in IE the v8
engine inside of chrome and the
javascript nitro engine inside of fox
these were all ways for us to lean out
and make JavaScript smarter that led to
tools like node node only made sense
when the v8 engine was as fast and as
efficient as it was he's like hey let's
you know what javascript doesn't suck
near as much when you get the browser
Dom out of the equation let's go write
JavaScript by itself and that's the way
you know what node became so Java
scripts having a really good time the
same time that dotnet is struggling over
this fragmentation that affects
Silverlight and in 2011 we have the
first build conference
so this is where wind
Zaid and Server 2012 and studio 2012 are
announced but also wind Jas JavaScript
for Windows a set of extensions to allow
JavaScript developers to interact with
Windows which was an interesting
statement to make at that point that
we're gonna let javascript go everywhere
inside of the window space because
javascript was pretty strong and so you
have to wonder where ie was I went to
this show I make a podcast called dotnet
rocks and we walked out of the show
having not talked about da net at all
and Karla I kind of look at each other
was what it's thought net dozen rock so
we made a new show that's where the
tablet show came from we let that show
up as a hedge just in case JavaScript
was really gonna rule the world we're
gonna have to do quit and that show
would focus on cross-platform
development iOS and Android we'd do all
those things now we eventually would
roll it back into dotnet rocks so that's
why it went away but at this particular
moment it's a hard question but there's
another player Microsoft made out there
focused on dotnet Aquila moment they
were pretty focused on the tablet
problem and JavaScript problem and so
forth but there was this guy there was
Miguel de Icaza who had been building
mono for many years and he started
building mobile tools around it a couple
of years before mobile mono touch is
really mono for iOS and in 2211 at the
same time that this was going on he put
up mono for Android also Novell runs out
of money and gets acquired by attachmate
an attachmate says we don't care about
mono anymore you people can all go home
and Miguel with his Fred nap Friedman
get together form a new company and pull
the rights out of attachmate for all the
mono stuff in the new company we know as
xamarin so if you think about it at this
dark moment on the Microsoft side for
the dotnet world this team was putting
c-sharp front and center for iOS and
Android showing there's more than one
way to do this we have solutions here
and so we have Studio 2012 get developed
it supports the ARM processors the will
win RT line again showing a strength of
studio in the.net library as a whole
that we can switch platforms pretty much
on demand most people remember the 2012
version as the version where your menus
went all caps and that's what everybody
cared about but also Microsoft lit up a
team called Microsoft open tech actually
a separate entity and its job was to
make sure that all open-source libraries
worked well with dotnet stuff so while
one hand you could say we were having a
tough time for dotnet there were very
positive open source movements going on
inside of Microsoft related to this and
so when we get to build 2012 we're win8
actually ships and when jf comes out at
version 1 the interceding year most of
the apps that can were available at this
build in the App Store for Windows 8
written in C sharp and zamel hint done
that's not dead
actually dot nets just doing fine with
or without you in 2013 we got the very
important version of studio for two
reasons one is no longer all caps menus
second is you can buy the box but there
are no discs in it it says go to the
Internet are you a crazy just download
it and NBC is at version 5 mature
running well and we get another big hint
when they renamed manager from Windows
Azure to Microsoft Azure because the
other aspect you have to look at if
we're solving this problem of how do we
do cross-platform and development all
right which this is what propagate this
going all the way back to 2010 the
crisis was around running on all the
platforms that matter you could do in a
JavaScript or you could just make dotnet
cross-platform which had to do was
change the core mantra of net dotnet
used to be all these languages one
platform what if it wasn't one platform
anymore so one would argue that dotnet
helped drive the idea this is not a
Windows centric company anymore and this
is when Steve Ballmer steps down Satya
Nadella becomes CEO Bill Gates comes
back wasn't largely advertised but part
of Sacha's deal was the bill does half
time at Microsoft he's reviewing all the
products again
and he does a good job of that he's not
the face of Microsoft but in a lot of
ways he's dad and dad only let one
particular product do a particular thing
we won't have three doing the same thing
anymore and so with the Microsoft Azure
Sacheon charge we have the April build
April 2014 build the dotnet foundation
Microsoft now supporting an open-source
foundation zamarons in it
identity servers in a lot of sessions
you seen here represent products that
become part of the.net foundation Rozlyn
the open source version to c-sharp
didn't start out as open source it was
just c-sharp written with c-sharp but it
becomes open source oh and
cross-platform
we can make it run on Mac and Linux as
well and my Microsoft also announces
that any device with a Stein inch screen
or smaller windows is free that's kind
of crazy when you think a couple of
years before
pretty much everything Microsoft did
made money from Windows that was what
they drove on all of their billion
dollar businesses were Windows
businesses I mean it's not just Windows
and Windows Server but it was also
office and system Center and sequel
server and Exchange server and dynamics
all of those products depended on
Windows then here they were giving away
Windows for free if the screen size was
small enough and if you were on a run
System Center on a nine inch screen more
power to you and this is the point
actually where html5 gets ratified so we
we're all these parts we're moving at
the same time and we get to 2015 with I
would say my current version of a
favorite version of Visual Studio the
2015 edition this is when when 10 comes
along we get the edge browser let's
leave that alone
MS open tech which they started a couple
years before to make sure that all
dotnet stuff worked well with with open
source libraries actually gets rolled
back into Microsoft they didn't need to
make it a separate entity because their
open source focus now and we also get
Visual Studio code right built on the
elektron edge it's like Microsoft's now
building cool powerful open source
software so suddenly we are an open
source company we've managed to get away
from being completely focused on Windows
where you don't care
about the platform we care about you
doing development and obviously the
cloud has an important role in all of
this and in the background they rewrite
dotnet this is dotnet core not a small
effort to actually essentially rewrite
it and bumpy it's not easy to rewrite
stuff that's 15 years old people they
didn't that they had to relearn a lot of
different things so by June of 2016 we
get the first version of.net core by
March this year we got 1.1 and this week
we got 2 and the same way I feel about
the old dotnet framework - in 2005 I'm
starting to feel about core - I mean
it's early days yet but we're finally
getting mature enough now that we start
to think in terms of the Plumbing's all
there the bits are all there this is a
great way to build software so you have
to question what comes next
in this path I've raced along through a
long story of 20 years or so but I hope
you get a sense that we've gone through
a bunch of ways and we're kind of at a
high point right now the core a lot the
existing framework four point seven one
soon we'll have a four seven - is never
been better right windows works well
against it it's easy to develop against
and core is starting to mature the third
version number two as usual finally has
a feature set complete enough that we
could explore it makes me wonder how
many project how I should be able to
open up in four seven switch over to two
and recompile and start to look at
across platform world anything is a
challenge for us who've been in this
world in this place for a long time to
actually think in terms of can you think
about the this company as a development
company that developers come first
development tools come first operating
systems come second
we hope you'll run your stuff on the
cloud otherwise we're not going to be in
business
good news this is a lot of good stuff
going on inside of the cloud but that's
what I see is coming next is thing if
we're a development centric company and
I don't work for the company but we are
actually developer centric than their
message their goal their motion is about
making developers more productive the
more stuff we can build for people
deliver for people will be effective for
people the more they could use the
platform that we provide them in that
rebirth of Halestorm that they're now
calling asher the more results we can
deliver for our customers the more
successful they'll all be that's where I
think our history is right now and I
hope it's going to keep coming true
