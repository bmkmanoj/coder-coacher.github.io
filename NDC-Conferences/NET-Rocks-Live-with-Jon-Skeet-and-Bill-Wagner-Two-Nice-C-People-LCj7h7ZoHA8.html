the miming of beating people with chairs
is very effective it works well get some
all around e yeah
Londoners don't need encouragement
though pretty rowdy bunch absolutely you
guys are awesome rowdy yeah okay little
late we've said man city rocks what
would happen so welcome to dotnet rocks
I'm Carl Franklin says Richard Campbell
our guest bill Wagner and John skeet you
probably know who they are so I don't
need to introduce them but we do have
this thing that we do at the beginning
of the show it's called better Noah
framework so roll that music everybody
want to sing it yeah we'll pretend we're
listening to that stupid man yeah and of
course you're seeing the sausage being
made right now every time we talk about
how goofy that music sounds that's a lie
we don't I don't hear it added later now
you know and all this gets fixed in
post-production we have editors they're
so good they even make us sound smart I
love editors everybody should have
editors so I'm gonna say again go ahead
alright buddy what do you got well
earlier in the week as in yesterday when
I'm talking about for the listener
there's probably a couple of weeks ago
yep we were talking about blockchain and
Bitcoin and all of these different word
elahh was talking about wanting to to
buy some Bitcoin processors right and
there seems to be a consensus that
nobody really needs blockchain
developers you don't need any blockchain
in your application that would be a bad
idea however Business Insider seems to
think that there's a growing list of
applications and use cases of blockchain
technology in business and life and I'll
read what they you know you can read on
the details
this link here sure so in banking and
finance international payments capital
markets a trade finance regulatory
compliance and audit because of the
secure nature of blockchain be rather
useful for accounting and audit money
laundering protection not one that
really sees you work out well right
seems to be the opposite that the money
laundering but so I'm not really sure
how they're coming up with these things
but insurance peer-to-peer transactions
in business supply chain management
healthcare real estate media energy in
government record management record
management in government you mean they
manage records talk about the United
States and that said yeah I mean I can
only speak for my big country hey hey
hey hey hey easy ID Identity Management
voting taxes nonprofit agencies
legislation compliance regulatory
oversight and in other industries
financial management and accounting
shareholder voting record management
cybersecurity big data data storage
Internet of Things voting did I say
voting yes voting yes so they really
think that that this stuff is going to
explode and apparently there's a bit of
been a lot of hiring of quote unquote
blockchain developers people that can
actually write code against blockchain
not necessarily for Bitcoin but just to
to you know do the computation driven of
publicly visible if anonymized
transactional records that's right all
right yeah so you know it's interesting
read well I certainly on my radar for
doing shows around but I really want to
wake you filled with some better dev
kits Emes the keys and stuff around it
so we I really have some place for
people to help pretty smart that's what
I'm thinking
so who's talking to us buddy I grabbed a
Commodore show 1479 the one we did with
mister skeet back in September of 2017
we were talking about dotnet Diagnostics
I think that was at the skills matter
show yeah had a lot of fun in that
conversation but John being John we
ended up talking actually a lot about
inclusion
yeah and diversity and that's why I read
better than I feel I'm gonna make funny
later first I'm gonna see something nice
to you get you off your guard then I'm
gonna beat you like there's a pattern
here but this comment comes from kudos
and I don't know that I'm pronouncing
her name correctly but she's from
Pakistan and she says as always great
episode and loved listening to John
Skeet in the mid 90s in Pakistan I was
trying to figure out what to do with my
life and somehow totally coincidentally
I ended up in the computer science
degree program I had never owned a
computer or a gaming computer before
that I was anything but a geek huh
somehow I still fell in love with
programming and the field as a whole
today I still spend most of my time
coding that last bit about empathy and
respect and inclusiveness this is your
words my friend really hit home with me
on a totally different angle everywhere
I went this is I think after she's
involved in software development
everywhere I went
geeks loves Star Wars Star Trek and Lego
look you can't love Star Wars and Star
Trek at the same time there's basic
rules actually you can I think all the
references seemed like inside jokes to
me
I understood tech but I felt like an
outsider until only a few years ago I
felt very insecure about this and would
not write a comment like I am writing
here today now which I'm flattered by
that you would write on our website did
she use the force or teleport don't
think she did either one actually okay
the point raised by skeet about women in
tech is much bigger than what I have
experienced but it's all the little
things that we do the little assumptions
that we make that can push others away
and that we all need do a better job of
observing thank you for being vocal
about it mr. ski cool on that Star Wars
and Star Trek front I know there are
studies around workplace and what you do
in your workplace and if if your
workplace is covered in posters or
models and things that you think are
just kind of fun and all about Star Trek
for example great and if someone comes
in and they're not a Star Trek fan they
don't think oh this person like Star
Trek they think this isn't a space where
I'm welcome right exactly yeah so it's
all unconscious it's not
it's not that someone saying we only
want Star Trek fans in our team right
it's just that's the message that is
unconsciously and you entirely
accidentally you no one wants to give
that I doubt that anyone hands up if you
want your team to only be Star Trek fans
or what if you're actually that kind of
we're a Star Trek the row of issues I'm
saying now I'm coming at this from a
team management perspective and I would
never suppress anybody's desire to
decorate their workspace the way they
want to but I think what you're
describing also is at a point where we
simply say this is the room that I would
argue I want each person's space to be
decorated a little bit differently so
that it showed a diversity rather than a
homogeny right which is good if you've
got a diversity if you have a team that
all like the same thing then you end up
with don't be surprised that you have a
hard time finding anything else yeah and
this is one of the good things about
working from home you can decorate your
home office however you like and no one
will ever know this what you wear hey no
inside jokes over here so yeah I have I
work from home in my shed and my shed
has a surround sound system an ice-cream
maker a Miro print and these are
probably not things that you get in the
everyday when you say shared exactly are
you talking about like a tin shed so
it's it's a garden building yeah is
separated into two halves there's one
thing half has like the lawnmower and
stuff in the corner is really a home
office it's a tiny house so me let me
close this up by saying kudos thank you
so much for your comment it was a
pleasure to read it and I'd love to say
you dot that rock smug and if you'd like
it dot that rocks mug right accompany me
say it again
see these you'll never sign it you'll
never hear now you know the bet it's
gonna be perfect on the show yeah let me
do it again
and if you'd like it on that rock smug
right a comment on the website at rocks
caller via any of our social media cuz
we public treasure show to Google+ and
Facebook and if you comment there we
redoing the show we'll send you a much
and definitely follow us on Twitter I'm
at Carl Franklin he's at rich Campbell
sent us a tweet we power our work drives
with him nice they look like crystal
sorry very sorry
alright guys should we have a talk about
something do you need to introduce these
two I don't think we don't really think
of is anybody not know who either of
these guys are bill why did I title the
current session correctly two nice C
sharp people yeah we'll find so often
when you have a two-person panel it's
supposed to be confrontational but I
can't imagine squeezing a confrontation
out of you unless you put John in the
front row I mean I suppose we should
just say John works for Google and in
the C sharp on the Google cloud platform
area he's been a c-sharp fan he's
probably the number one contributor to
stack over not probably he's the first
person in the history of man to exceed
one me reputation points and the next
one downs not even close like you now
have the billionaires problem you're
gonna make money faster than anybody can
L speak money there's nothing you do not
sure we can kill you now so I I do hit
the rep cap so I now answer only one or
two questions a day generally I spent
much more of my time I spend loads of
time on Stack Overflow
but mostly adding comments saying could
you clarify your question and you know
here's the ways to do it right but in
fact just before coming up to this level
I was on metal Stack Overflow where
someone had said who's who's the person
who in the blog post graph that psych
over flow posted it showed someone else
Gordon enough has a very small question
why yeah yeah well very linear yeah no
still basically answering the same
number of questions every day as he did
a few years ago mostly on sequel I think
yeah and the question was when will they
overtake John and the answer is they're
about three hundred thousand three
hundred fifty thousand behind at the
moment amir and they're gaining at about
fifty thousand a year which is very
significant because basically we both
hit the red cap every day or I'm not
sure that Gordon actually hits the red
cut from votes every day but gets loads
of accepted answers okay right whereas I
hit the rep cap
I've hit cup every day since June 2010
okay you know as you do they put the
ramp to the rep cattle inside the
documentation was for John skeet well it
really isn't the state if you we had I
asked a question on the met Stack
Overflow saying it isn't a bit
coincidental that before we knew what
rep would be like you know in the first
months of Stack Overflow the rep cap was
set to 200 a day you know sounds a nice
round number
what are the chances that we got that
right yeah and that all the rules were
right shouldn't we have a look at
various tweaks maybe you should stop
getting rep after a certain number of
votes or after a certain amount of time
and various people played with various
ways of tweaking the rep cap and pretty
much whatever you did helped me and hurt
everybody else oh yeah
Jeff AdWords called it the John skeet
tax okay let's talk about Bill Wagner
for a minute Bill's been a C sharp
author and developer for many many years
effective C sharp consultancy
best-selling book I was a regional
director and then joined the Borg I'm
sorry did I'd make another Star Trek
reference so he now works on the.net
core content team right yeah doing the
best documentation ever done in the
history of software I think we try no
it's you succeed yeah it's amazing yeah
it's amazing so we thought we'd kick out
on a little C sharp he says C sharp done
yeah get it can can I lead off there
with after Raza and where do you go yeah
okay so no it's not otherwise you're out
of a job oh you have no idea how big the
backlog so a lot of the things that
we're seeing that we're putting into
c-sharp and the team is looking at come
from a couple of different places and
you've had Madison here talking about
language design and looking at
absolutely and if you look at C sharp
it was first being designed late 90s or
mm first shipped in 2002 we built
programs using objects you know that
that was the way it was have a choice
the things objects all the way down yeah
yeah so its objects all the way down
there that object orientation is in its
DNA and that's not really how we build
programs I don't disagree and I think
it's a really interesting point that and
kind of stepped away from these
different rules of object or still a lot
of areas where object orientation makes
sense but there are a lot of places
where it doesn't so with a lot of the
features that we're adding in c-sharp
its how does C C sharp stay really
relevant in this world where now we're
separating data and the functions that
act on that data instead of putting them
together in an object and yet still it
has that object-oriented DNA we can't
just get rid of it and throw it away
right so how do we we live in this world
where things are now very different you
know data stored over here we manipulate
it over there we send it to another
machine we hydrated send it off rest
calls and so on and we work with
different languages in different parts
of the program which also I don't find
particularly anonymous yeah nama lists
no he says we've always had sequel in
the backend right and some other
front-end lines so we're looking at a
lot of features into how does it stay
relevant and stay a first-class language
in in today's world yeah in my deck and
in in Mads we have these two slides that
show most popular technologies most love
technologies and c-sharp is one of three
things that are on both slides right
the other two are type script in Python
mm-hmm you know and how do we stay on
both slides I really want to do that the
other thing you're seeing a lot of good
ideas come from is the C sharp team now
in a post Roselyn world they're now
working in c-sharp every day you know in
the pre Rozlyn world they're writing c++
in their day jobs coming up with what
would be cool for c-sharp but they
weren't using it every day all day or at
a time now the c-sharp team is writing
in c-sharp they're using it all the time
they go wouldn't it be cool if yeah and
then they just make it happen and we
start prototyping and looking at it
going through common it's currents that
you're you guys are sitting around you
know looking through the backlog and
just some random comment and github or
something about a suggestion that nobody
had thought of like nobody or the good
ideas
typically popular by the time you get
around to I've usually blogged a request
ages ago
[Laughter]
anything like that you oh wow I didn't
think of that
I mean being John skeet and you would
not considered something so one of my
great experiences but a nd seals though
many years ago Eric Lippert was there
Neil CAFTA was there relatively new to
the C sharp team at the time and Matt
saw Gerson was there and Mads did a talk
on c-sharp 4 followed by me during a
talk on if I ruled the world c-sharp 5
according to John in front of the actual
c-sharp team is like wow followed by a
panel discussion like this with you know
the three of them and me feeling sort of
out of my depth mm-hmm by a long way and
none of what I asked for was in c-sharp
5 when I saw C sharp 5 it's like thank
goodness they did that instead because I
would never afford I think it's sort of
paradox yeah you don't see your own
restrictions and it takes real genius to
see ah there is this thing that no-one's
done before
I know async kind of things have been
done in a shop before but other other
aspects that no-one's done before
someone's got to think of it first
yeah and I'm definitely not nowhere near
there but I can think of little ideas so
yeah I have one feature request which is
we have various things that end in a
question mark now why can't we have
returned question mark so a binary
operator or statement so return quest
remark condition : expression which
means if this condition is true return
the value of that expression otherwise
just go on to the next line so that we
don't have one of the most common forms
of if statement is if this condition
return a value yes this condition return
of
yeah and just like I've always idolized
joked that it would be nice to have an
as if expression if X as int I and now
of course we have that with pattern
matching yeah so I'm hoping that you
know maybe the return question mark you
know maybe return will get some traction
who knows interesting you could
implement it I mean the whole thing's
open-source now you could just stop
answering all those Stack Overflow
questions John and would you actually
get that one of the ones in c-sharp
seven I think is when it came out is was
implemented entirely by the community
and implemented by the community in
c-sharp CIPS six we had expression
bodied members but there were some
places they weren't allowed like
constructors I think was one property
centered any property that had both get
sunset you hadn't have liked and that
people in the community said why not and
then went and implemented it mm-hmm
expression body members finalized errs
constructors property getters and
setters proposed by the community
approved by the language design team PR
written boom nice that's gonna be a day
that that the team opened a bottle of
champagne or something to when it would
a significant feature gets implemented
by yes right somebody's not on the team
yeah but in terms of how far see shop
can still go this is a question that
worries me quite a bit for us to stop
you much as I enjoy writing about
c-sharp
I would quite like to have the final
edition of c-sharp in depth and then
maybe get around to writing something
else moment every couple of years I'm
gonna have to spend a year writing
and at the moment I can't even know what
I'm gonna be done with the current
edition because I'm trying to cover all
of seven point star and they keep
bringing out new versions sure yeah
you'll only know for sure when you start
working on eight but they're working on
eight but they're not gonna release
eight for quite a while right yeah and
in the meantime just just seven point
three but I have serious concerns around
how large the language
language can grow right because if you
are starting c-sharp today you've got a
big big Hill tonight shirt right it will
only get bigger and at what point what
interest me as much as what would the
team like to go back and change is if
you were starting from a blank slate now
yeah well both with language and you
know if you really had magic dust and
could say and we'll have a new VM at
this point as well right that could do
we blank slate I'm how different would
it be and how much will that perfect
language well you know as perfect as we
could imagine now diverge from where C
shop goes anything cause illiteracy some
would say you'd end up at F sharp will
there ever be a C sharp light like a
core that would be hard there's billions
of lines of c-sharp code in the world
right yeah I'm sorry it's broke now no
ii but i might say for example of
something that the team decided not to
break is effectively a bug in the c shop
compiler in that it violates the spec
that you can have constable zero equals
zero point zero and then you can have
enum foo with some enum values and then
you can do foo x equals and then your
double constant you know we made a
promise on the show we would never read
code on the air that was 14 years ago
guys hold that thought just for a minute
while we pause for this very important
message and we're back you're listening
in.net rocks we're live in london carl
franklin richard campbell a bill wagner
and john skeet we're talking is is it
possible that let's see sharp could ever
get too big yes so here's one of the
things that i do so my job is basically
explaining what the team comes up with
writing all the docs for that and one of
the things that do with new features and
i sit down with the team it's usually
julienne cove air and we go over the
features and one of the things that i
want to be able to say about any new
feature is
okay so here's what it does and it works
pretty much the way you'd think it would
and then I can go into all the details
about how that works and then at the end
I can go see it's pretty much what you
think it would yeah and the more those
details are something different than
pretty much how you think it would you
know those those are warning signs that
you know now we're getting complicated
but who is that you that you think it
would and is it someone with decades of
experience right and of other languages
and stuff or is it someone who's
learning c-sharp maybe as their first
language a little bit of both right
because you're seeing these tokens
you're seeing these things that look
like symbols you know it's no surprise
that the symbols we use in any
programming language are somewhat
similar or now it is two mathematical
symbols because people are familiar with
those so we have this this thing that's
already there and you kind of squint and
it looks about right and a couple of the
ones that are really interesting that
our historical if when we added discards
to tuples so you can declare an
underscore where tuple goes and we throw
that away and we don't even assign it to
anything and it's not a variable you
can't look at it and you have to discard
some of the schools where come assign
thousands to the same other sweethearts
then you should have folded so
effectively what it means is this
routine returns three or four things and
I only want one or two of them minutes
are on the rest away and when designing
the feature and getting feedback there
were people who were who were saying
that underscores too small I can't see
it I I want something bigger and more
expressive more obvious and Neil CAFTA
had this absolutely perfect answer to
this he goes you want that right now
because of what you're thinking
it's a new feature and you want it to
stand out right a year from now after
you use it for a week or two you don't
want to see it yeah so it's this it's
this trick with amateur language of
getting something that looks different
enough that you see it differently but
then right into the vocabulary that you
already and that's a sign of Neil's
experience he's been there just a few
times yes another great example of that
about how things change when I wrote the
I think first edition of c-sharp in
depth um I was saying about var here use
it really carefully and be very
deliberate about where you use var I
hardly ever use var apart from for rare
expressions or whatever there's anyone
else in that you were really tentative
about using far I use it everywhere have
you just got reckless in your old age
now so it is it
there's a million rep points make you
crazy it's also reminds me of Java and
checked exceptions I felt very nervous
when I came to C sharp sir there are no
checked exceptions my code is gonna be
awful everywhere and break everywhere
what a checked exception John so checks
exception is where the compiler there
are some exceptions in Java that checked
and some that are unchecked and if
you've got to declare that your method
might throw a checked exception
otherwise you can't throw it and if
someone is calling your method then
they've got to either catch that
exception or declare that they might
throw it as well so otherwise it won't
compile yeah so it's it's not just a
comment saying this method can through
these exceptions yeah it's enforced by
the compiler it's an assertion
essentially but anyway I I felt safe in
this the seatbelt lies told to children
[Laughter]
fun and profit and it's still a raging
argument in in the java community
whether it was a mistake or not right
and various certainly last time I used
hibernate which must have been ten years
or more ago most hibernate exceptions
were unchecked ones so they extended
runtime exception and that was deemed
fine and it turned out that worked okay
but I was really nervous to start with
and now it feels like not having checked
exceptions not having checked exceptions
in the java style was fine and i think
we need better error handling but i
don't know what it is rain tomorrow docs
again yeah but i feel very much the same
way about VAR i felt uncomfortable
so I was quite nervous about using it
and it turns out that the things I was
nervous about on problems yeah yeah I'm
still somewhat cautious if I think it
aids the readability particularly if
I've got a method that's longer than I
would like it to be yeah or an
expression that's not as obvious as I'd
like it to be then sure you use an
explicit type but yeah I don't know the
time yeah yeah what do you guys think of
poly for handling transient airs I like
it
there's there are a lot of really really
good patterns for handling errors
especially in distributed systems
implemented in poly so Polly's a open
source project no Carl's companies
involved into Eisenberger and a number
of people there
it's got circuit breakers yeah circuit
breakers that reset that's right try and
wait wait and retry wait retry forever
with it I think it's it implements a lot
of really good patterns especially for
distributed micro service systems I
think it's awesome yeah it's good
there's a rumor that it the guys in the
dinette core team are thinking of
rolling it in somehow I I don't talking
about it yeah I know that yeah and I
don't think I'm breaking any rules by
saying I think they're talking about it
we'll find out there's probably a github
issue that would track it so it's a sort
of interesting reality that doesn't seem
like is actually any secrets left
because in reality if you go three-d--
through the notes yeah on github every
idea every conversation every debate
it's actually public it's just that most
people don't read them this that's been
fun and and there's some really
interesting things there is that Mads is
officially keeper of the language design
meeting notes and it's very careful to
put those out publicly but without any
names attached interesting so so all the
opinions are there but it doesn't say
who said what I just the room great than
the opinion or several opinions of the
room the discussions more in person more
important than the identities yes yeah
and it's not all the discussion either
so we have the same sort of how public
do we want to be for the ACMA
standardization you will use github
issues for that we have hundreds of
issues and currently that's private even
though the Sun that is public and we
have talked about well we could open it
up we could open it up read only etc and
we thought that to avoid chilling
effects of someone I've written a bunch
of stupid things in there it's like well
why doesn't this work oh because of its
usually Neil Neil is fantastic I will
say something stupid and Neil will come
back very Pilate I think it's like well
here is the the counter example to your
suggestion
Jory so we don't want a chilling effect
and Mads taking a time he doesn't
publish the notes immediately I don't
it's not like he drafts them during the
meeting anonymously and then immediately
publishes them takes a little while so
that they can so that the important
things race the surface of his mind
right right
apologies Mads if I miss misrepresenting
you here but I think this is what I
remember him saying when we discussed
this yeah for a little while because I
found it very interesting process to get
all the good things of public debate and
public awareness of reasons behind the
decisions that are made without any
stifling of discussion debate yeah
that's great yeah sort of avoiding the
political pressures around that yep in
certain names and weights and things
cause it's very powerful
yeah it's much of course very thoughtful
yeah yeah well uh Richard yeah buddy it
gets what time it is now I must be that
happy time again yeah it's time to
suggest a new language a dumbed down
version of c-sharp as we were talking
about with all just the the features
that John skeet wants it's called C dull

sign up to win all right guys it's been
a while since we asked you this at least
a month September I think yeah so if you
had $5,000 to spend on technology what
would you buy
after you bill oh gee thanks about the
same time nice
you know I really want to get a drone to
like kind of fly oh yeah I fan him yes
on a river water far from you know this
is about a quarter-mile we don't have
sight lines there so getting out to the
ocean would be hard no you get the
toggles so you got five grand to spend
we can get the full remote Rico yeah
I'll tell you I've been flying I've got
the coast place now I've been flying my
Mavic Pro and looking down on the sea
life is dramatically different you can
see a lot more information and if you
screw up you get to buy a new drone
that's right be enough the man you could
torture the tourists with something like
a how about you John so I didn't get to
go to Scott Huntsman's talk this morning
about building a kubernetes cluster of
raspberry PI's but we were talking
afterwards about you know that sounds
quite fun but I quite like a slightly
bigger kubernetes cluster of Intel looks
I have a couple of Intel knocks at home
for benchmarking no design because at
the moment I'm not quite convinced that
I need to actually test this I'm sort of
paranoid at the moment if I do
benchmarking in the cloud will that
provide stable results or will there be
noisy neighbor issues and oh we've
upgraded all the CPUs Oh none of your
benchmarks are worth in Israel right um
it must be hard if you have a bunch of
nooks to test no to time that you
actually have to fly them to different
time zones I mean it but next run I mean
500 to 700 bucks of shots right bill
kubernetes cluster of sort of six or
seven of them yeah yes I can start
sucking up things well it's quite handy
that my shed being a shed
yeah I have a couple of nooks and Mac
Mini and old laptops that aren't
actually on but certainly you can notice
um I'm sure it doesn't get as cold as it
would if those weren't running yes and
definitely if I've got two laptops so
work laptop and personal laptop running
all day I'm pretty sure that pumps out a
sequin if it's never if it's not warm
enough you get around some SETI at home
work units yeah
if the CPUs pin for 15-20 minutes warm
that place right up yeah or just pull up
[Laughter]
that's not right so let's talk c-sharp
s'more what do you guys at Google doing
with c-sharp it's so we're still making
Google cloud platform Roxie sharp
developers mhm so at the moment focusing
on asp.net core applications making them
run beautifully on App Engine flexible
environment and the kubernetes engine
yeah what used to be called container
engine yeah and I work on the API client
libraries so we have a vision API s and
speech api's and there's firestore
coming and all kinds of things and I try
try to make that as pleasant an
experience as it possibly can be the
idea is to give the illusion that I have
hand written all the libraries for all
the api's in reality there's a lot of
generated code behind the scenes that we
thought very carefully about yeah how we
can generate things and then we've
designed it so that we can tweak things
only additively you know partial classes
are fantastic for this but if we've got
so if I've got a protocol buffer class
generator class for an image for the
vision API I can just add some static
methods to that say Oh create me an
image that represents this URI or fetch
it from a URI and get the actual bytes
yeah and it can be just much much nicer
to the use than if we only have the
generated code right yeah well it's good
stuff I've used it myself and loved it I
mean you guys are doing great things
with it yeah what is the underlying
language are a lot of those api is it
more very it's protobuf is described as
a protobuf G RPC service right
so we then it goes through an extra
level of configuration saying hey this
this RPC over here even though it's just
an RPC and it has a request and a
response is actually listing resources
and it's got page tokens and you can get
the first ten and then ask for the next
ten etc and we say okay well now that
you've told us that's a list of
resources will just generate
so that you can iterate over it
transparently or you can get a page at a
time with a certain size or whatever you
want to do with with that but the idea
is it should be easier to use than if
you're using the R or R PCs sure and and
friendly to the C sharp type said and
yeah well I was like I said I was blown
away when I got this chrome plug-in app
or a chrome app I guess called voice
note voice memo something like that and
it's essentially you just turn on start
talking to it and it did the best job of
recognizing speech without any training
that of any technology that ever used
that's really great you know I did get
results yeah okay clap I did get similar
results after with Microsoft speech
recognition just on the client you know
because you're sending stuff up to the
cloud using the power of Google to
translate that stuff in real time but
but I had to train it you know I had to
Train Microsoft's thing and after I
trained it for a while and did went you
know through the speaking exercises the
accuracy really improved but it was just
great to just pull this thing up right
out of the box of writing me a
battlestar galactica which the first
time I ever saw you know commander adama
talking to the thing and it was typing
away and I thought oh my god that's so
cool right wouldn't it be great that's
the old battle story yeah the first one
when Dirk Benedict had hair that's right
have you seen the Starbuck and Starbuck
in Starbucks it's awesome I have it but
I know what it is now makes me happy
they're more inside jokes sorry for not
being inclusive
Katee Sackhoff is awesome well that
brought the conversation and I ran with
it I blame myself all right what are the
thoughts I've had around c-sharp being
open sources that we could get to a
place where the bulk of the community
just doesn't want anymore features that
we could declare done something I felt
like Microsoft would never do as long as
it was closed source internal if you
didn't ship a new version the product is
dead but if you put it out in the wild
you put it out in in
world and we agree that this is where we
want it to be then it's not dead it's
right hmm that's that's an interesting
question
interesting encouraging and scary all at
the same time so I'm not sure whether
being open source is necessary for that
is it just like a logically I think it's
completely psychological so there's two
or three different points that really
want to address there mm-hmm
the first one is with any of the
projects that go into the dotnet
foundation you know from inside
Microsoft or from community that wants
to put it into the dotnet Foundation
sure it goes through the Advisory
Council on the board and we talk about
it and we decide you were involved in I
am on the Advisory Council mm-hmm along
with Sean Walker is colita that John
Galloway and it's flow director you know
you can read the whole bylaws but it's
split between community members and
Microsoft people and so I had to sit on
the other side of the table when I
joined Microsoft but one of the one of
the things that we are very adamant
about both from inside and outside
Microsoft is anything that goes into the
foundation that's not a way to make
abandonware right right oh we prototyped
this it was kind of cool but we're not
supporting it open source there you go
yeah that will not happen yeah so some
of our gates are you know Karl knows
this working through every next who's
leading this who are your active
maintainer yes
what is your plan in your roadmap and so
on it has to have a life right now but
it can have a life without C shop could
continue to have a life even if
everybody agreed right it's done now
yeah and people can continue to write
great apps in c-sharp sure even it could
be done as a language and there can
still be improvements to Rosslyn major
making it faster oh yeah security
constraints I mean that the idea that
there wouldn't be a flow of new writers
right so there's that first part that
says that how do we contend with that
issue around the foundation feeling that
it's healthy even if we don't have a
huge backlog of you know that's actually
one of the other things we talked about
there are things that are you know what
new features do you add so there are so
we thought about this pretty carefully
and that one of the things that was
originally in the list of well are you
going to take this in was well there's
active pr's over the last six months
that some some rate will come up with
and we decided that was a really bad
idea because some projects just armature
you'll get a few bug fixes and so on
right there's no need to go if you're
not turning out 12 of these a quarter
right we might you don't City but they
should be spikes of activity I never
notice for him which is you largely just
me not entirely but largely just me
there will be spikes of activity when
I'm not writing suit up in depth right
with your work schedule anything else
where I could also see on other projects
is when when a major security build
comes out there is a flurry of the work
to make sure you're protected from those
teeny little problems yeah and their
spikes to react to other things we've
been really happy with people adding
dotnet core support moving your dotnet
standard and so and so forth but you
know and that's so we want things alive
enough that those things are gonna
happen maybe there could be other
platforms blood that kind of thing so
that's the first part now the second
part then is we want c-sharp to stay
relevant so does that mean no and it is
a balance yeah I think it's very
interesting I think Matz is often said
you know every new feature starts with
minus a thousand points because it's
work it's changing the language
additional potential future complexity
okay one of the things one of the points
I wanted to make in my talk yesterday
I'm ran out of time with in terms of
designing your understanding the impact
of decisions is when you're designing a
language you need to understand that
every new feature you are is potentially
going to conflict or interact with every
feature you haven't yet imagined right
so you know designing a language to
start with is playing two dimensional
chess and then adding another feature is
three dimensional chess and then adding
another feature is four dimensional
chess and if you look at overload
resolution I've mentioned before that
that the spec is currently inaccurate
the standard is differently inaccurate
and we have tried to fix it it's around
that there are bits of the spec
says if the number of arguments you've
passed isn't the same as the number of
parameters then overload resolution
fails
well optional parameters yeah yeah oh
yeah okay looks like we forgot to fix
that up okay this should be a oh no but
then but then but then yeah and it's
really over low resolution seems to be
the nexus of all possible problems this
stuff exists oh yeah you just need to do
a bunch of empirical research to
actually figure out how it functions we
have their own way of extracting Erik
lipids Commons there's a search there if
you look for I think it's spec it's
either spec deviation there's there's
something like that where every time he
implemented something that was in
rosslyn that had to be compatible with
the pre Rosalind compiler but right
match the spec you put a comment there
right so they are findable I can't do
this isn't quite right no explaining is
that you might get open source trying to
be really thorough and all those things
just aware of those aspects yeah I just
sort of recognized I said you know my
concern always if somebody's been
involved in software for several decades
it's like you keep adding features
because that's how you made money right
until you run out of good ideas and the
bad ideas cuz bad ideas give you two
versions well noted in and when will you
take it out that's actually very
profitable but we're now in an
open-source world I'm talking about
people who've been around for a long
time and we know that we need to keep
learning so you're keeping the language
relevant how about keeping people
relevant we know that people will have
to keep learning all kinds of other
things maybe we could take the burden
off learning new language features right
and there's other places to go right we
certainly could be going across more
platforms we certainly could be building
better test harnesses we certainly could
be building abstractions for
simplification like there's there's many
possibilities there
if the underpinning pieces weren't
shifting
don't do the bar is ready and and I
think I just questioned the ongoing
value proposition well so let's put the
features in a couple different buckets
okay and so the the point releases now
are getting these small little fixes to
things which they have a few interesting
nice properties in general and ref ref
stuff is a little bit different in
general they're they're pretty small in
scope they don't affect major parts of
the language like touching overload
resolution or so on right you know type
in you know in inferring tuple member
names doesn't hit a lot of places
there's only a couple different write
declarations where that'll happen and
it's scoped to when they are tuples and
when the names are sorry that's pretty
focused async main really focused
there's one spot where that's gonna hit
now if you look at the major number
releases Anders has often said you know
my team builds your productivity right
that's our product so if you look at the
the one feature that's been demoed for a
c-sharp 8e is the idea of non nullable
reference types and adding that you know
there are languages that already have
that feature but it was baked in from
day one right adding non malleable
reference types to c-sharp with all the
body of code that's out there and really
thinking about where is that right spot
between this is so benign that you don't
really see the warnings that we really
want you to see or so hits you in the
head yeah those are runtime errors yeah
well or if let's say we just turned
everything on and now every reference is
not null about you're gonna get both
screens full of error messages the first
time you try the compiler nobody uses it
so how do you design the language
feature and the intelligent static
analysis to look at where you were using
these variables to go this is or isn't
null and get it close enough that the
actual warnings you get are small enough
in number that you go I'm gonna turn
this on because this is fixing bugs sure
right and where it's telling me stuff
yeah those are real they're worth
looking at
ha no just overwhelming yeah and that's
a you know and and those Mads has put in
his design notes there are billions of
lines of code out there they're already
tested against null we don't want to
warn you about those you've got guard
clauses around him yep we want to find
the ones he did yeah so in big language
features I think what we're gonna see is
is to continue to work for something
that's a really big win that really
changes the way you write code everyday
and I'm fairly satisfied that the team
is really working hard to make sure that
it is a big win and it's done right
right so one of the features that might
be in c-sharp eight we have seen before
because it was slated to be in C sharp
six and then maybe c-sharp seven of
recalled types but because the team
weren't happy enough it's clearly a
potentially big win feature but I have
to be good enough right then it's gonna
cause more problems well briefly record
record types this actually was one of
the features that I requested in my
c-sharp five talk was I love anonymous
types here they give me immutability
equals two string they're great but
they're anonymous
I want named anonymous types and the
record type is basically that so you say
I want a record type of person with
first name last name and strings oh I
see and then okay it generates all the
boilerplate
so the proposed syntax would you would
say class person open paren string first
name comma string last name closed paren
semicolon and that generates the whole
class with all the stuff you think is
good okay okay so cool and this gets to
we were talking about where these larger
features touch more parts of the
language now just from that description
people are immediately going this is
cool yeah I love it a lot of stuff
that's tight
alright now what happens if I derive
from person yeah right right
what happens if I want to make persons
sealed yeah what happens if I want to
derive a type with behavior from person
whatever the fund suddenly now have a
lot of behavior I want to add
how do i how do i personally right into
a class so i can add new methods in it
so all of these things get into a very
hard question of is this the right
syntax what if person should implement
an interface what if it's derived from
something else what if you just don't
let people do that and you can't kind of
write well and then it gets to is
justice well now that's a nice feature
except it's really not that useful so if
we're gonna do it make it so it's really
as big I don't want to leave tonight
without talking about the humanitarian
tool box because we have you know two
big guys who actually are very involved
in it Richard and Bill some of us are
bigger than others some bigger than I
used to be huge bill tell us Tulsa
briefly what tell really what it is and
then what you guys are doing alright so
humanitarian tool box is a charity
registered in the United States that
enlists developers to help us build
software to support disaster relief and
disaster preparedness organizations
Steve Gordon one of the people who
really helps us with already projects in
the front row thank you Steve for all
your hard work on already along with
James chambers who's in Canada probably
you know doing his Canadian things now
and other continents Canadian things
okay but curling and behold yes so we're
doing a lot of things there the
application that's had the most work is
already which helps any charity prepare
run a preparedness campaign so find
everybody in a certain zip code make
sure they have smoke detectors or make
sure they're prepared for a power outage
or whatever it may be and the Red Cross
in Chicago has used it and piloted it a
couple times we're gonna be adding other
charities we're actively looking for
other charities that run those kind of
campaigns so instead of just asking
developers in the audience do you want
to help write code if there's a charity
that you are really passionate about
that runs campaigns where you need to
know geography and you need to know to
reach people in a certain area
to make something happen shoot us an
email and we'll try to link up the
charity with the software and make them
more efficient that's really what we
want to do yeah and what was your role
mr. camel in getting this thing off the
ground well you were there my friend
when we were planning the 2012 road trip
in the summer of 2012 the organizer
group we were working with asked us to
make sure there was a charitable
component to her tour right and if I had
had any sense at all I would have said
hey matches dollar for dollar for Hulme
out United Way ha ha but instead I rant
on a rant as I am prone to doing a ton
of time about how difficult it was for
software developers to contribute their
skills to charity and I knew great
developers that had picked a charity
that mattered a lot to them and had
committed dozens if not hundreds of
hours of time to building things because
we all know that that software it's not
just writing software that it's it's
collecting requirements and it's
figuring out what people actually needed
testing things and maintaining it and
doing tech support and all of the
complexities therein and I think most
volunteer developers don't they're
responsible enough to not do it because
they know the scope of the of the
commitments actually necessary and could
we build an organization that would take
that piece off the table they would say
if you've got an hour that you could
spend on our software or a day you could
spend on our software that's a valuable
a useful contribution you can you can
make a meaningful difference there and
don't worry about the rest we'll do the
rest
yeah and so that was really sort of the
vision around that particular piece was
that there was a great untapped need I
think people want not every piece of
software you write for your job delights
you can be particularly meaningful and
and so the opportunity writing software
that saves lives yeah that has that
impact that you can choose on your own
time in your own way and be part of a
larger piece of action you know the our
experience working on the podcast of
talking to people all over the world
often the only developer in the room
only developer they get to see today
that the podcast is their contact with
the rest of the world whether that we've
met some of those developers contributed
our projects that have been parts of
literally hundreds of developers
contributing to a project so they are
part of a larger hole that they might
not be able to get other ways and these
developers are all over the world and
they they're check-in things you can go
to github and what is the HD box network
and just one thing we're doing now the
show probably come out early enough to
at least still get people driving toward
that is we're working with Microsoft's
MVP program they've been very very
supportive of us over the years myself
as a former MVP NRD Richard as well is
we're driving toward trying to get
people from as many different regions in
the MVP program helping us out with the
software so it's great if you're an MVP
listening contact your manager your
community manager and we've got
volunteers who are helping in different
regions you know one thing we hope to
get from this since we started in North
America reaching places all around the
world I am almost certain our software
isn't localized very well no I think
that would be a reader that we want to
be able to help people all around the
world we can't do that if it's only in
English so we'd love to get help from
people in other parts of the world that
can help us International is the
software you guys doing a hackathon
while you're here you are so we were
able to organize it here but through the
graces of Steve Gordon and and mag debts
we are actually doing something on
Saturday so I staying over for the
weekend will will take off on Friday
night and get down there to Brighton
which I've never been to so I'm excited
to see it
I think it's spent a day with a I think
it's sold out it's a group of developers
very excited to contribute and so we'll
have some fun and write some code we got
a good stack of work I don't see there
again you know you talk about the the
plumbing part of running a good project
yes
getting it organized so there's work
items that people can pick up and
contribute so you could get to
delivering a useful pill across wooded
area and that's what I love so I haven't
contributed to humanitarian no but I
pulled you in off things yeah I've been
involved in but what I love about it in
concept is that it's not delivering a
product it's delivering a tool box
yeah and that it has to be sustainable
because there's nothing worse than hey
someone's built this awesome product and
then they have either lost interest in
it yeah or they just can't do it with
other commitments
yeah um generated but all that value is
gradually lost that's still if I can
tell that story just to embarrass you a
little oh what am I gonna say we're
doing this thing and one of the
developers is gonna implement note of
time because we're having time zone
issues and know the time works and it
just does that nice guess part we're
done and he's stuck and I think you can
buddy this conversation going on in the
slack Channel about the complexities did
note of time and they were trying to
work it out and I said would it help if
we could ask mr. skeet about it all of a
sudden there was this thing bottom of
the channel cuz not everybody's in the
same room
John skeet just entered the room he just
starts answering he's been a good hour
with them that John yeah and then and
then he put his feet back on see that
was really key yes that's a failure if I
knew you thought that way then it then
that's clearly a failure in notice names
documentation well it was a conversation
I had after the fact where that number
the developers are like well how how is
this possible said you know the service
you did to John to show him the
challenges of this tool that he loves
that a developer pick it up from scratch
hit this wall so he learned today as
much as he talked today so you know it's
all mutually beneficial and it
absolutely kind of helps it I have your
phone number
well yeah it was great it was it was
very funny but let's give these guys a
big hand for the humanitarian toolbox
and let's also thank John skeet and Phil
Oh Wagner for being our guest tonight
and we'll see you next time on top Ned
