something that is kind of a large topic
but I'm going to talk about data that is
what this talk is primarily about and
it's also about Postgres it's also about
space it's also about Saturn perfect
thing for an afternoon conference talk I
think some patience is going to be
required on your part so what I want to
discuss is the process that I went
through creating a book I just wrote a
book and it was my process of discovery
as I as I dug through the data from the
Cassini mission to put together this
book and I started out with the idea
that I wanted to do something about
Postgres and I started out with the idea
was I am just gonna do e-commerce and
I'm gonna build out a shopping cart
whatnot and I thought that's boring it's
just been done so many times so let's
use some data from space and that's what
I did
it's about sleuthing and diving in
structuring data normalizing things and
building up an interesting database this
is the book by the way I just published
it about two weeks ago it's just on my
website I'll talk more about that later
on I was inspired by the Martian to
write this book and this quote from Andy
weir is one that I really really like
and he talks about his writing process
when he put together the book and what
he did was he let science drive the plot
and you think that was I thought that
was really interesting because he'd
solved one problem in the book and move
on and I thought well I could probably
do the same thing with the data from the
Cassini mission because my idea was I
just wanted to you know take the data
that I could find from Cassini and just
load it into the database and let's go
but the programmer in me is like well no
let's structure it in a linear fashion
and we'll build our narrative and bla
bla bla bla bla and that was just not
possible with the amount of data that I
had so I thought well alright let's just
load the data up and we'll let the data
tell me what the story is so before we
get going who has heard of the little
moon Enceladus anybody in here okay good
we've got two three four or five okay
well when I started looking through the
data
I just thought well what's the Cassini
mission all about let's let's find some
interesting things and Enceladus was
about the second or third thing that I
looked at and it blew my mind I couldn't
believe that this little moon was not on
the front page of every science magazine
constantly it turns out that this thing
is spilling water water ice into space
that's what's happening there in the
southern pole of the planet or the moon
spewing water ice and a bunch of other
stuff in his face and the discovery of
all this from the Cassini probe
basically turned planetary data science
on its head everything that they thought
they knew about planets and the way
planets work in the way they're formed
completely went upside down by the time
the Cassini mission was done this little
moon right here was the leading
candidate for life alien life outside of
the outside the earth and I found all of
this out as I was just doing some
investigations behind you know behind
the data just kind of reading online
seeing what I could find and it all
started back in the 1980s when Voyager
went by Saturn and it was just snapping
some pictures and it's a fun little
trivia story I'm gonna get to the
database stuff I promise it's coming
just got a build up build this up you
guys gotta be patient anyway so Voyager
is cruising by Saturn and it was taking
some pictures and it had the camera
mounted on this arm and it was it could
move the camera anywhere without having
to change the rotation of the spacecraft
Cassini was not that way Cassini's
cameras were hard mounted but back in
the 1980s Voyager had free mount or free
moving camera so they were snapping
pictures of everything and all of a
sudden one day it froze and the bearings
locked up what we're gonna do they
couldn't take pictures of Saturn of the
Rings and they said well it's pointing
at Enceladus let's snap a picture and
this actually was from Cassini but the
Voyager picture is kind of faint and
dark it's hard to see but what they
found is something just like this they
found this little moon sitting inside
the e ring of Saturn which is the
outermost ring it looks just like that
this is a real picture from NASA it is
called an occultation where the Sun is
behind Saturn and it's illuminating
everything the earring is really
diffused and it's made of water ice so
they found this moon Enceladus sitting
right in the thickest part the densest
part of this ring and being scientists
in using Occam's razor there like that
is not a coincidence there's something
happening
so to cut to it what actually they found
out was that this little-known this tiny
little moon that's 313 miles in diameter
formed the e-ring think about that that
earring is gigantic it is the second
largest ring in the solar system it was
the first before they discovered round
one around Jupiter as I mentioned made
of water ice somehow this little planet
or this little moon orbiting Saturn has
created this ring and they're like
what's going on up there to give you an
idea how small this moon is it could fit
comfortably right next to Great Britain
right there
yeah it's C so if it came and just
landed on the earth that's what it would
look like
making sure not to crush Great Britain
of course so here's how it started back
in February of 2005 Cassini just decided
well that's where their Cassini team
decided to send Cassini flying past
Enceladus just to check things out
because they wanted to know like what's
there what's causing this earring thing
and and what kind of readings can be
fine so they turned on the magnetometer
the magnetometer registers readings from
the magnetosphere of Saturn and so on
and this obviously isn't to scale this
is an artist rendering of course but
this illustrates what they found they
found that the magnetosphere was bending
around the South Pole of the moon and
the only thing that would cause that is
an atmosphere and they looked at this
and they said the data must be wrong
they all thought it was a dead icy ball
that's what they called all of Saturn's
moons and they saw that they didn't even
think anything was gonna happen with
Enceladus and in fact they didn't even
look at the data for I think it was
twenty eight hours after the readings
came in and he saw this and they said
this must be a mistake so they scheduled
two more flybys in the subsequent months
and they found out that indeed this
little moon has an atmosphere and in
March I believe of 2005 they published a
paper and said we have found an
atmosphere on this tiny moon and blue
scientists minds they couldn't believe
it so just a cut of chase because I know
it's really fun to get to to get to the
database stuff this is what they
discovered over the 20-year mission of
Cassini with respect to Enceladus it has
a global ocean covered by an icy shell
there is a rocky core
that rocky core is being heated by tidal
friction as it goes around Saturn and
gets pulled by Dione in others it gets
squeezed and torqued evidently heats up
the rocks and the temperatures of the
ocean down at the bottom are the same as
the temperatures of our ocean on the
bottom spews out material Cassini sense
that material that found methane co2
molecular hydrogen all the things needed
for life so basically what the NASA team
said in a white paper not in some
linkbait article they said the readings
from Cassini are a smoking gun for the
presence of life they literally said
smoking gun and I read this in an
article I'm like you got to be kidding
me how do I not know about this oh great
yeah I have to do a book at a video now
and I got to turn my attention now to
Postgres so that's what I'm gonna do
with you guys so as I mentioned I'm
gonna be telling this in a bit of a
circular tale because that's the way it
is working with data and I'm gonna be
repeating this again and again this book
and everything I'm doing or everything I
wrote and also this talk is about
discovery of what's in the data in the
data sleuthing the data and also
structuring it and putting things
together so let's get to see we're going
to start with right we're going to start
with the discovery of the data in itself
so I went to the Cassini website and I
thought there's got to be some
information here that I can download I'm
sure there's things that I could like
raw data there I'm sure that I can get
and as always looking through this
website this is at Saturn JPL NASA gov I
was just overwhelmed with the amount of
data as I mentioned it was just
astonishing how much stuff there was
including all of the instrument data the
schedule information everything and I
didn't even know where to start and it
shouldn't have surprised me I don't feel
if anybody here watch the Martian and
I'm bringing it up again but in the
movie there's a great scene where they
found out that Watney is still alive and
Teddy the director said well we have 24
hours before we have to get this
information out because it's public
domain and we have to release it so I
found out that every bit of data that
Cassini collected is available to all of
us and we can download and do whatever
we wanted and I thought you know I'm
just going to dive in from point A just
like an investigator would if you ever
seen
show like the wire or whatever when they
put the pictures up on the wall they
start stringing a bunch of string
everywhere I'm gonna let the data tell
me what the story is that's what a good
investigation is that's what good a data
analysis is when you start working with
databases and and trying to find things
out so that's precisely what I did and I
decided to find out where can I get
where can I get a schedule a calendar of
events commands sense and so on just
turns out the entire master schedule of
the mission is available online sixty
one thousand eight hundred and seventy
four rows of data and you can grab this
and it's just a big fat CSV that's what
it looks like you have dates you have
the teams involved the target like
Saturn itself the moon Enceladus or Dion
or Titan and then a title and a bunch of
other things and I looked at this data
and I'm kind of a space nerd so I
thought like look at that linear mosaic
of this is how to make neatest fear
doesn't that sound great methane band
photometry so I kind of sifted through
all this and I said perfect I'm ready to
go now what I need to do is I need to
take my investigators hat off put on my
my database administrators hat and I
need to load this data into a database
Postgres and I'm gonna follow a process
that data people are used to ETL anybody
heard of e-tail extraction
transformation and loading the idea is
when you're loading data into an
analysis system you'd go through three
steps the first is extractions so you
pull the data from whatever source you
need to examine so it could be bank
accounts or whatever you're pulling into
a data Mart you transform it so you can
work with it so you put data types on it
you put relationships in it and do
whatever you need to
you also clean it to make sure it's
valid in good data and then you load it
into the database that's it it's a
simple process so what I decided to do
is you can get as by the way you can get
as complicated as you want with this
process or you can just be simple with
it you could just use Excel and kind of
look line by line and fix things or in
my case I loaded it into Postgres and I
was going to do all the transformation
in Postgres to do that I decided that I
needed to create a schema and that's
what that first first two lines are I'm
going to lock all of this raw data away
into a schema so I know that it's raw
import
I'm not actually going to do anything
with it I'm not gonna create a table and
this is really important when you're
working with raw analysis data is you
just want to bring it in as absolutely
raw as you can notice there's no primary
key for this table if I put a primary
key on this table and I'm influencing
the data in fact if I even choose a
primary key here I'm also making a
choice about the data and that's me
having some bias and as silly as that
sounds it's critical when you're working
with data and doing analysis that you do
not change the raw source in any way the
next thing here is you'll notice that
every single column is text this is
something I learned when I was writing
when it's writing the book that Postgres
stores text in for me or string values
in the exact same way regardless of data
type so if it's char or varchar text
whatever it's all stored in the exact
same way and you might be thinking well
why is there no length definition on the
column it turns out you don't need it in
fact you shouldn't put it on unless you
absolutely have to have it it's an extra
hit when you're doing when you insert
data and do updates Postgres has to do
one more step to make sure that the data
that you're adding to the database
complies with the length so the last
thing I needed to do is to load it in
and you can load in a CSV into Postgres
using the copy command as you see here
and I'm just saying copy from this
absolute path pull in the CSV here's a
delimiter as you can see the CSV has a
header so skip the first row and then
that's that now one thing that a lot of
people ask is why are you using sequel
to run an import well I wouldn't use a
GUI you can do a job let's say in some
tool like PG admin nav account there's a
ton of tools out there that can automate
this process and there's two reasons I'm
doing this one is idempotent which is a
word I absolutely hate I don't know why
it's just one of those words it sticks
in my head idempotent sis you might know
it just means I can rerun the same
script over and over and over and I get
the same result
and that's critical so I want to be able
to do that and it's easier to do with
the script you saw the script there was
all of 12 lines or so and I don't need
to fiddle around with a GUI second
reason is I wanted to keep this as real
as poss
this is what database people do they
they have P sequel Postgres DBAs have P
sequel and they write their scripts and
they love their scripts so I wanted to
make sure that this was as real as it
could possibly be next and some people
probably gonna throw something at me but
I like to use make I don't know if
anyone out there is familiar with me but
it's the UNIX build tool it's job
description is that it turns one set of
files into another that's all it does so
when you compile things on a UNIX
platform you just wire up make call a
compiler it'll execute jobs you
orchestrate it it's just like msbuild or
any other build tool the way that you
can use it
dig that make file the way you can use
it with a database this is how I like to
he'll I I like to do it you have some
variables at the top you just tell it
here's here's the source files here's
where I want the build file to go here's
my database and then execute the
commands in a given order I'm not going
to dive too deep into this I'll just
tell you that this is all there is to it
what I have on disk I have some sequel
files as you can see right there I
separate my individual commands out into
individual sequel files I load them in
order
it gets concatenated and put all
together into a build dot sequel file
and then I execute it and that's that
just run make boom it runs so that's why
I been doing everything by sequel
scripts so who here thinks that that
worked
curiosity wouldn't be much fun if I
asked so what I needed to do as I loaded
the data in and I went through and
everything looked good I needed to
transform it which is just a real simple
step right here that simply means I
needed to cast one of the string columns
into a time stamp
that's my transformation that's it and
then load it and I was going to load it
into an events table because this is a
schedule schedule it got events that's
the way that works out so I ran this and
I had a really fun error happen keep in
mind this is data from JPL this isn't
just some around its random spreadsheet
I found this is from JPL it found a leap
year for 2014 in 2014 is not a leap year
Postgres which is really good on these
things especially dates and times barf
and said no that's not valid and if you
work with data long enough you're gonna
figure that are you gonna find out that
dates are a massive massive pain so at
this point I have a choice at this point
I can put on my DBAs hat and say find
another source for that date or find
some more data let's just move on the
investigator in me the data analyst is
saying wait how did that get in there
and why is that in there what does that
mean for the rest of the data because if
this is wrong what else is wrong so I
can't move on until I answer that
question until I know more does anybody
in here ever had to deal with a weird
leap year date in a database just throw
up your hands anyone no one yes yeah
does anybody in here know that Excel has
a bug for leap years this is true this
is I would say it's hysterical but it's
really not there is a there's a bug that
was intentionally built into Excel so
that it considers 1900 illipe year and
the reason that they did this is because
Lotus 1-2-3 had that bug and when they
released excel they're like well we need
compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3 database
stuff or spreadsheet stuff so we're
gonna have the same bug - why not make
it a party so that's in there and so as
an analyst I'm feeling like this has got
to be it because I'm dealing with a
spreadsheet right so and then missing
updates and right here I'm sensing there
something I sat down and tried to do the
math and tried to figure this out and I
couldn't quite do it I couldn't make it
match up but I did look online and a lot
of people said oh yeah 2014 is a weird
ripple effect of this so I just took
their word at it this led me to build a
story about how this got in here and
this is my best guess so here's the
offending offending dates right there
and over here on the far left side you
see we have a column called start time
UTC that start time UTC is formatted in
what they call PDS compliant date format
or planetary data services date format
it's just year and then day of the year
and so scientific instruments that are
up on Cassini this is how they recorded
date
so someone somewhere said that's not
readable I don't know what that is I'll
call or all addict on a column and I'll
name it date and so they put it over
there and they said well let's try and
read it so they try to apply excels
formatting to it because that's a very
Excel looking format how do you think
and it
duped and what I'm thinking is this is
my guess I don't know if this is the
answer but what I'm thinking is that it
was a really old version of Excel may be
running on win XP or something like that
so I'm feeling good about this I'm
feeling like I can close the door in
this I've got a different source for the
date we can move forward but overall
this is something that again you think
about when you're working with data all
the time and this is kind of a mandate
of mine people and data just do not mix
if human hands figuratively touch data
it's suspect always people do horrible
things with spreadsheets they really
really do the good news is it's easy to
fix I didn't have to do any additional
parsing to get Postgres to read that
text column formatted in the PDS
compliant format you just understood it
and as I mentioned Postgres is really
really good about dates okay so moving a
little bit ahead this right here is the
data that I was able to pull in and I
queried it to make sure that everything
looks the way I expected it to and the
reason I wanted to pull this up is this
is the data from the flyby of February
of 2005 the very first one flyby of
Enceladus and right there are the
closest approach observation they turned
on the magnetometer they took a look at
the thermal stuff and they kind of just
poked around what's out here this right
here changed everything in terms of
planetary data science this flipped the
Cassini mission on its head this is the
start of absolutely I'm not being I'm
not exaggerating this is the start of
destroying people's careers from this
point right here they actually decided
to do 20 more flybys of Enceladus and
they took that time from other teams
time on Titan and other moons out there
and other observations of the Rings and
so on there was massive fights inside of
the Cassini team and people quit people
moved on people yelled at each other and
I read a great article about this they
said the drama between scientists is
nothing to be trifled with
so I just thought that was interesting
just looking at the data right there
marking that moment okay so in this book
I have a main character this is a
fictional narrative book that's the only
way I could really tell the story it's a
fictional narrative wrapped around this
process of discovery of the data of
Enceladus and the main character's name
is Dee Ann and Dee has to load up some
data because I is the CTO of my
fictional aerospace company red for I'm
going off to JPL in Pasadena and I'm
trying to pitch so we can have our probe
up on the next Cassini mission and I
can't work with the data so I need her
to step in so she's got three tasks task
number one is flybys task two is going
to be looking at the speed data and then
task three is going to be playing around
with some chemistry so these first task
is to find out when the exact flybys
happens so there's 22 total flybys she
needs to find out down to the
millisecond or the microsecond when were
these flybys because we need to know so
we can have an analysis window I'll get
to that later on so the first thing to
do is to look at the schedule and what
if we just do a fuzzy search on the term
closest approach we just saw it why not
and there's timestamps associated with
the data we know that we run this query
we have 25 rows and I just said there's
22 flybys so why would we have 25 rows
that doesn't make any sense so this
means we need to do some investigation
again take off our DBA hat put on our
investigators hat and we can take a look
now at those dates associated with
closest approach and you can see that on
November 2nd 2009 there was somehow two
closest approaches which doesn't make
any sense the reason why it doesn't make
any sense is because Cassini flies very
very fast does anybody know how fast
Cassini would fly by this moon at full
speed or at flyby speed I should say
anybody how many guests does anybody
know there's a science nerds out here I
know 19,000 miles an hour that's how
fast it goes by this thing so the idea
that it could fly by turn around and
come back won't happen in fact the only
way that could turn around is to go and
then circle around Titan
it's another stupid little bit of trivia
tight and actually drove Cassini around
the Saturnian system most of the time
it's called the engine of the mission
that's the only way it could go out and
come back that would mean for it to even
be able to do two if you have to go into
orbit and so I ran a little query
because I thought why not and this is
how fast Cassini would have to be in
orbit 1919 orbits per hour so that
obviously is not realistic it would have
to be about a foot off the surface so so
we can basically say that that data
isn't going to work for us so what if we
change the term instead of closest
approach what if we use the term flyby
and we're querying on the title one more
time we're doing a case insensitive
search on the term flyby and I don't
know if it's one word or two so I'm just
doing an or statement here and I'm doing
an I like which is a case insensitive
like here's the results for that and
that's run over the entire data set and
this shows me something else
at the very top there you can see
there's three Titan flybys there's t0
down below you can see t3 t4 and t5 the
casing on this flyby is uppercase
whereas other flies are lowercase and
then we also have TA and TB which don't
follow any coherent naming scheme so I
can't use any regex blah blah blah blah
blah what this is telling me overall is
this data Scott problems we have
inconsistent flyby names we have
duplication we have leap your weirdness
and then we have misspellings so what
I'm starting to see is a data analyst
epiphany analyst hat back on is that
people people we hate people if people
put this data set together they put this
spreadsheet together probably just out
there and type it in and then and maybe
how to auto correct or not auto correct
but the autofill filling the rest of the
thing what that basically means is we
can't trust this data source so we
actually have to try again we have to
think well okay where can we find some
data that's going to work for us we
can't trust people so what about
instruments because Cassini had 12 of
them and it turns out that we have two
instruments to track data a lot of data
actually over the course of the mission
we have a CDA which is the cosmic dust
analyzer that's rad it's a mass
spectrometer and then we also have the
inm s which is the ion neutral mass
spectrometer basically they both collect
space dust one of them pulverizes it and
the other one
zaps it with electrons and they try and
take a look at the chemical constituents
of the data and they track where they
were how fast they were going and the
date this is the data for the IMS I
downloaded it and dropped it on my
machine you can do the same thing if you
want this is 30 gigs of data you can see
the way they separate it all out by year
and then month and then day and then a
bunch of two megabyte spreadsheets if
you take a look at the spreadsheet you
can see there is a ton of crazy data in
there this is good this makes me happy
if I put my analyst hat back on this
looks like a machine recorded all of
this and that's what I want to see
because machines are a little bit more
reliable tracking data than people are
so looking this data over I'm quite
happy the other thing that comes with
this data is a manifest it tells you
exactly exactly what the data should be
and then it also tells you what format
it should be in in this case I want to
make sure there's altitude data in there
because if I know the altitude as
Cassini flew by Enceladus then I should
be able to figure out when it was
closest to Enceladus and I can use that
time stamp to figure out the exact
moment of the closest flyby so here's
the catch the eye NMS records data every
30 milliseconds so it records altitude
timestamp data chemical readings and so
on every 30 milliseconds that's really
fast so even going at 19,000 miles an
hour you're gonna end up with data that
looks like this this is the lowest point
observation for the October 10th 2008
flyby the lowest that ever went 28
kilometers above the surface I believe
it is flying at 19,000 miles an hour
again they got so close they hit the
plume at full speed caused the thing to
rotate and almost tumble and crash into
Enceladus and they realized oh we're
getting a little - a little too happy
with this so but this presents a problem
which timestamp - you take and as a DBA
I'm saying I don't care just take a dang
timestamp we need to move on you're
wasting time is the investigator I say
well no
we have to know the exact moment of the
lowest approach so there's a lot of a
lot of hedging you can do here but the
obvious solution at least to me is to
take both dates take the minimum and the
maximum cut it right in half and the
median and then take that timestamp and
you're good to go
that should be your closest approach and
in fact that is the data that I ended up
with the problem that I had was that I
needed to be able to group those low
flybys by something so I thought well
flybys happened you know really quickly
so we should be able to group by day
turns out that some of the flybys
happened right at the stroke of midnight
so you end up with flybys that actually
span two days that doesn't work with a
group by so what I decided to do just to
cut to the chase is write a big crazy
clay that looks like that and I grouped
by week instead of by day and I was able
to capture what I have seen to be the
most precise flyby times that that's
available and that's them right there
and have 22 rows so it looks good to me
and I have altitude data and time stamps
which means victory and I was very
excited the query on the left here I'm
not going to talk too much about but I
do want to point out that this is what's
called a common table expression in
Postgres this is actually two queries in
one or three queries I should say
Postgres another databases sequel server
and other databases do this but Postgres
has the most complete implementation you
can basically say with give it a name
and then say as and then you can wrap a
select statement that's what I have at
the very very top and you can pass the
results of that into the second select
statement down below so this is a kind
of like piping in functional languages
is piping one thing to the next and then
down at the very bottom you just select
your final result see tes are amazing
and a good friend of mine told me once
that they are the most underused bit of
functionality in any database and I
completely agree so we now have time
stamps and that is that is an exciting
thing now we can move on to our next
task which is to find the speed data so
there's two ways to do this you can go
the easy way or we can go the hard way
and so all these always want to start
with the easy way cuz why make things
hard if it doesn't need to be hard I can
just go to the cassini website
it's up it again Saturn JPL nasa.gov and
if I take a look down there at the
bottom I can see there's altitude data
and there's also speed data so that's
what I started doing I just went through
every single flyby which is up here at
the NASA site and I just created a table
and I just kind of wrote it in my hand
the problem with doing this is that
websites are made by people so there's
no way in my mind as a data analyst
putting my analyst hat back on there's
no way that an error did not make its
way into that webpage I don't care how
good you are when you're talking about
scientific data as accurate as it needs
to be so case in point there are four
total problems on this page I've
highlighted two first is the name
Enceladus one flyby that doesn't
actually exist there's no flyby with
that name but for some reason they chose
to put that up there the flybys name is
actually e - one not that that matters
but you know to a data analyst person it
kind of does second bit of problem is
for some reason there's no altitude data
and there's no speed data for no reason
it's in the data set they just decided
not to put it up there but there's two
other problems take a look at this this
is one of the cool things about working
with data is you start to develop a nose
like a detective will when they hear an
inconsistency in his story
they jump on it because they know that
that's the weak part and looking at the
data here
there are two other inconsistencies does
anybody see them yeah that's right the
date for some reason the date here says
March 8th
but the flyby is on March 9th that's a
problem if we take a look at the data
that we just collected you can see on
March 9th 2005 at the very very top
there March 9th on the image March 8th
at the top of the page can anybody guess
why that might be why would there be a
discrepancy where it's later in UTC
that's right later in UTC time and then
Pasadena is in Pacific time well it
turns out that's not actually the
problem the problem I actually tried to
find this out because the discrepancy in
dates between what JPL has versus what's
in the data that I looked up from the
IMS is 9.2 hours just to dive into this
for a second I think the problem is
actually
back to that Excel spreadsheet because
that if you had a leap year you had a
day to every single thing that comes
beyond that so that's my theory I have
no idea so there's one other discrepancy
he up here I don't know if anybody could
see it I saw it and I just couldn't
believe it
so so what does this tell you someone to
me it tells me someone grabbed a random
image opened up an image editor and just
started typing information on a thing
and well I don't call it a zero for even
though it's e1 so I don't know I don't
know what the deal is with that point is
do I have any Warcraft players any wow
players out there or do no all right
sorry trust no one especially yourself
and what I mean by that is as you start
looking at the data and I'll come back
around to this as you start working with
data you start to build a story in your
own head because it's people we want
stuff to make sense so we're gonna try
and like link things together and
sometimes the story is shouting at us
saying it's not you know that's not
really happening but we chose to see one
thing so that bias that bias works its
way in and we'll see that later on I
think I was talking about speeds so
let's see if we can get back to figuring
out speed information turns out that the
AI NMS records speeds in three different
ways
it needs to know their speeds because as
it's cruising through really fast space
that pulls in this these particles and
the speed of those particles hitting the
instrument actually will offset a few
things and so they need to be able to do
some back calculations to figure it out
so they have three ways of tracking
velocity the first way is by tracking
velocity relative to Saturn itself in
what they call the Saturn coordinate
system that's what that is in the far
left side the other is tracking it
relative to Enceladus or the target and
the third way is tracking it relative to
the ship itself so the two two on the
right side I just pick one and I could
use that to find the actual speed
relative to Enceladus that's what I want
to see the other the other one that you
don't see up there too they also have
tracked speed relative to the Sun and it
kind of gets weird when you start trying
to figure out speed data and you're like
speed relative to one
the next issue we have is and we're
going to dive into a little math
velocity is a vector so when you're
talking about velocity relative to
something you have to consider that it's
a vector and a vector is a line with a
value attached to it so the only way
they're going to track vectors in
anything reasonable is to do it along a
coordinate system and so this is ship
relative coordinate system in the XY and
z space so that's how fast it was going
in each one of those directions so we're
gonna talk about skiers running over
losers just for a quick second if I
wanted to know how fast that loser is
going down the hill aside from just
reading the label I put up there if I
only knew the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates
does anybody here know how I could
actually figure out the speed of that
vector going going in an angle between
the x and y coordinates well it's a
right triangle so a squared plus B
squared equals C squared
Pathak orion theorem i should be able to
use c squared or a square root of c and
whatever that equation is and then i can
figure out the speed turns out you can
do the same thing in three dimensions so
we can do it two dimensions we can do it
three we have XY and z is coming out at
you right there at the bottom corner
this is the path the Gorian theorem just
in case you forgot like I did and then
this is the way you could apply it in
three dimensions so that was simple to
figure out and I could plug that back
into sequel and I made a function in
Postgres called Pythian here I'm taking
in three values XY and z and then I just
need to take the square root as you see
and I'm able to use this now with the
raw data from the inm s so these are the
three columns that I was just talking
about XY and z coordinates for velocity
and this should give me precise speed
data and here's the fun thing it
actually worked so this is the data in
the center column there or it's a speed
that's the data that I actually grabbed
from NASA's website and I loaded it into
the table and I named all the flybys
this is my flybys table by the way and
then I compared it with my calculations
and would you know it is exactly the
same as a matter of fact I was able to
calculate the missing velocity data for
the first two flybys so I'm thinking
that
good that I could do a pull request what
you think JP I'll take my pull request
for this data okay
I have altitude data I have speed data I
now should be able to do some really
interesting chemical analysis so my
fictional aerospace company has a
fictional analytics team and what they
put together was an analysis window the
reason they did this is because they
figure that the plumes that are being
pushed out of the South Pole emanate
from the center so there's heat in the
center of the moon and it basically
pushes out the plumes and the plumes
radiate out in a 34 degree angle and I
completely made that up because I can so
why not so what I want to track here and
that's my great rendering of Cassini I
want to track when Cassini enters this
area and leaves it and now that I have
speed data which is telling the time
relative stuff of speed did an altitude
data I can figure this out and so in the
book that's precisely what Dee does and
now she can she can do chemical analysis
right at the beginning and end of that
window to do the chemical analysis we
need to be able to figure out what the
IMS is telling us so it's recorded all
kinds of interesting information I'm not
going to dive too deeply into that and
we have a lookup table that comes with
the data and that lookup table is as you
see here chem data it's got the name of
name and the formula I molecular weight
the peak the peak is the thing we want
to see and sensitivity which we're not
using the thing that I am specifically
looking for is the smoking gun as they
called it in the NASA paper the smoking
gun is this is the chemical signature of
the plume material if they find
molecular hydrogen carbon dioxide
methane and water they're gonna find
evidence of a bioreactor this is
fascinating stuff there are these black
and white smokers some of you probably
all of you know this these black and
white smokers that are in deep-sea
trenches on the earth here and there
they basically spew out this highly
toxic very warm mineral rich material
that you can see right there and there's
little bits of microbes that actually
feed off of this stuff
and they feed on the molecular hydrogen
and then they give off methane and
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide these
that that interaction right there causes
a whole ecosystem to form where you get
these worms and all these weird wacko
things you can see them there these
systems are 100% cut off from the Sun
and until 1970 that was the feeling from
biologists that life on Earth was
powered by the Sun it's the result of
the Sun everything that happens here
they figured Wells part for the
photosynthesis in the Sun but this came
along and they said this is an alien
world on our planet right here it just
kind of appeared and out of no influence
from the surface at all so taking just a
philosophical step back it makes you
want to question life itself and where
does life come from is it random is it
is it highly unique as a lot of people
have fought or is it just normal I mean
is it everywhere and you consider that
life popped up in the bottom of the
ocean no influence from anywhere else
other than having these materials water
chemistry and heat those are the three
things for the bioreactor kind of makes
you wonder we've just started looking
for life somewhere else and we have we
have seen the science on Enceladus we've
actually seen the life here is it
everywhere in fact a lot of people are
taking this up and just really quickly I
wanted to point out that the lot of
people are doing these research papers
musing on just that and they call them
as I mentioned bioreactors our origin of
life reactors okay back to Cassini the
problem that we have is that Cassini
doesn't have any instruments to tell us
if life exists in fact I have a whole
argument in the book whether it would
even matter if it had a camera and it
could somehow go below the ice and snap
a picture and confirm that there's life
would anybody believe it number one and
two would anybody care so I don't have
an answer to that I mean I think Star
Trek nerds like me they grew up in the
60s and 70s feeling optimistic about the
world and you know we're all moving to
space at some point it matters to me
but I know a lot of folks these days
have different opportunities they have
to deal with and I don't know maybe they
would care maybe they wouldn't so we
come around now to actually doing the
analysis on the day
and this is the query right here to me
this query is probably the most
important query that you could run over
the entire Cassini data set this is the
culmination of the entire mission with
respect to Enceladus and I want to step
through this query because there's a lot
going on the very first thing is I
mentioned I have a flybys table so I
just want to pull information from that
flybys table it's got date/time speed
and altitude information the second
thing is I want to have the the chemical
data name and then I want to have the
source and the source simply is how the
IMS collected the data from space
there's two ways it can do it it can
just open up it's open up its chamber
and take the stuff directly in from
space from the plumes the other way that
it does it is it has a little vacuum
chamber where it just lets the date or
let's the flue material seep in the
reason they have those two ways of doing
it is the closed source is what it's
called with a vacuum in the chamber is
good for lighter chemicals and picking
up things like that the open source is
good for picking up heavier stuff that
can collide with it and remain intact
this is important because the closed
source stuff reacts with the chamber and
when it gets in there sometimes it'll
just volatize and give off hydrogen so
you get you get false hits and also just
so happens that Cassini's exhaust is
heavily laden with hydrogen because it's
hydrazine among other things so that
causes problems
so NASA figured well if we can open up
the open source and try and detect
hydrogen we'll have something I'll talk
more about that in a second finally I'm
going to link on the peak in the Ken
data I'm gonna link on the peak and the
mass per charge that is returned from
the IMS and all this simply is is when
the material enters the eye of the mass
spectrometer it is zapped with some
electrons and then it's energized and
they go off and they Bend in a
particular pattern it's the same thing
as when you're looking at the Sun
reflected through some sprinklers and it
bends it into a rainbow that's a spectra
that's given off and the same principle
applies with electrons blasting this
material so what you want to find is how
energised is it and so you can get that
from the mass per charge and you can you
can link that over on peak that is in a
unit and
you're curious called Daltons and then
finally we're just looking for the
formulas molecular hydrogen methane co2
h2o or h2o and off we go so to me this
query is comes down to our way alone and
I know that sounds a little bit romantic
but you know I think well I'll get to
this in a second I think if the clues
are there it tells us something and
being an investigator we want to see the
clues so here's the results this is
fascinating to me this is from the e21
flyby this is when they opened up the
open source chamber wide open to collect
the plume material it's the one way they
could be sure that they could detect
molecular hydrogen that was almost
guaranteed to be external to Cassini
itself you can see that the hid down
below is from the O SNB source which is
open source and we have a lot of it if
you look at the very top water that's
what's expected from the plumes methane
is number two that's what is excreted by
this by these little these little
microbes when they take in the molecular
hydrogen if carbon monoxide and then we
have a bunch of other organic compounds
that is the smoking gun that the team is
referring them to and this little moon I
love this graphic I just have to show it
one more time this little moon now is
being regarded as top it or a subject
number one for the next probe that we
send up and right now NASA is actually
putting together putting together you
know what so what I'm looking for
they're calling out for four bids for
the next mission to go back up and
they're going straight to Enceladus and
I already have the instrument made it's
called selfie believe it or not search
for Enceladus life somewhere there but
this will have the ability to go and
take a look at the biological material
if any under the ice and Enceladus so to
put this in perspective a lot of people
ask me you know really do you really
think there's a life up there you know
how likely is it and what I do is I try
and reconcile the chemical data with
something that you know looking at this
picture here let's say I ask you are
there people inside this cabin and we
can see footprints walking all around we
can see lights on inside that ladder
it's probably a car parked over there we
just can't see the people might see
smoke coming out the chimney as well
this is the level of evidence that we
have right now friends all
this we just haven't taken a picture of
the little microbes which i think is
absolutely fascinating so as I mentioned
I wrote a book about all this and I
thought it'd be kind of fun to as you
could tell dive into the subject matter
while also a learning Postgres and
learning about data that's it for me if
you guys have any questions please do
shout it out any questions yeah one more
time the question was has NASA done this
type of analysis on the data and yes not
not like I did because I did it more for
just kind of playing around with
Postgres in a database but there's been
there still are so many white papers
coming out they're still trying to
figure out which I touched on briefly
but they're still trying to figure out
whether this heats coming from because
the heat that's coming from that moon is
I think 20 times what it should be even
with the tidal friction model it doesn't
account for it so they don't know it's
not they don't that plus radioactive
decay doesn't cut it they they do have
no idea where the heats coming from but
there are lots of theories coming out
which is really nice so yeah yeah you're
gonna pick there yeah there's a good
question the question is what do I know
what selfie is gonna do and is that it
yeah I don't know my feeling is that
think it's not gonna land I don't think
it's gonna land I mean the only thing
you could do is to land hit the ice put
it because there's no gravity there
pretty much they'd have to drill in and
then and then melt their way through the
ice and then wire a camera to go down
all the way to the core that's a lot of
wire because it's salt water so it
doesn't transmit it doesn't transmit any
radio signals I
that's an expensive mission it's not
going to do that I know it's a sensor
and it's super highly sensitive so I
think what they're banking on if I'm
gonna go back to this slide here but
they're banking on is that there is so
much material being spewed out into
space it's awesome I mean this thing is
like here here's your sample material in
my ocean just come and sample it so I
think they found sand particles in there
and I think what the reasoning is they
should be able to find micro
as well which I don't know maybe yeah
I'm anyone else have a question yes yeah
I didn't touch it I didn't talk about
that too much
23 when we go all the way back well
that's interesting isn't it no there's a
reason for that and I can't remember
what it is so there was so I got the
cowling right okay so here's the problem
right so there was I said 22 total
flybys because NASA calls them a1
through 22 they didn't count the first
one easy Rho is my name so the first one
was just to go snap pictures it wasn't
necessarily this scientific
investigation so it didn't have a name
so when you look it up online it's
really confusing it says e1 322 and so
there's actually 23 total flybys thanks
that's a that's a great correction yeah
the
let the data lead this story were there
any other curiosities yes there's so
many in consistencies and that's where
that's the thing that always kind of
locks you on like why is it like that
primarily I hate to sound conspiratorial
about why haven't we heard about this
you know why isn't this more widely
known
I mean people when you talk about life
possibilities of alien life everyone's
like well Europa Titan you know these
are the focuses but this has way more we
have the data because it's throwing it
out into space and we've registered it
we know it's there and so that to me is
a weird inconsistency that why don't we
know more about it and so that I think
is one but in terms of the raw data
itself it's just not jumping to mind but
I found a bunch I have a bunch of notes
but I had to keep on the straight and
narrow and if I remember I'll I'll come
find you I don't have it on the tip of
my tongue anybody else all right well
thank you so much appreciate your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
