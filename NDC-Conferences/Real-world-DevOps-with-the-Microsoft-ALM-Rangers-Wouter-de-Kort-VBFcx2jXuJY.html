a little quiet but maybe more people
will come in and we're going to talk
about real-world desktops with microsoft
alm ranges and the story I want to tell
starts about three and a half years ago
12 years ago I got a new customer and I
wasn't consulted I went to them because
they were having some problems while
building the web application and when I
came there I noticed account of things
first of all they didn't use any source
control they use the network share and
they copied their files to the network
share to merge so that process was as
long as you work in one file and all the
other developers have each and has their
own file you don't have problem they
didn't have a build server of course
they deployed by just copying stuff to a
customer and whatever thought it was a
moment in exercise yeah I mean I know we
can do this better but how can I help a
customer how can you help the community
to raise the awareness to do to make
sure that people discover those things
and while researching it while thinking
about it i came across the microsoft alm
rangers and three years ago during a
weary 2014 i became an alm Rajon by
nomination was accepted then from that
moment on a lot happened i started doing
more speaking i gave more presentation
for the Rangers and i just generally on
agile therefore its application
lifecycle management I started to write
a couple of books I wrote on Boog loss
here on Deafness on the Microsoft stack
and finally it let's do me becoming in
Microsoft ALM MVP and really
specializing in this area and this what
I want to talk to you about today first
who are the ALM ranges general
introduction to make sure and if we know
what we're talking about and then how do
we do desktops and what is that that
just makes making sure we have a common
definition and then we go in deep and
we're going to look into how do we do
def offs and hopefully are the examples
I will show maybe you can learn
something from it or you can copy
something to your own projects or your
own situation and apply there so let's
start with who are the alm ranges this
is the most important link from Jacques
it goes directly to our blog if you
follow it you will find all kinds of
information we
what we do while we do it okay the
things we publish the solutions we have
African sometimes I hear people think
that we are the Power Rangers so
difficult of times while giving this
talk and some of you some people tweeted
this picture so I included in my session
we're not the Power Rangers i meanwe alm
range is just a group of people who are
passionate i will love software
development will love things like
Application Lifecycle Management agile
desktops and we do that by following a
common mission this is a mission our
mission is all around filling gaps oh
she cried Microsoft you've got a product
group they built a lot of software they
built to luling like team foundation
server and fizzles to your team surfaces
that you can use for high doing death of
fragile but it's sometimes there is a
gap and the gap could be a missing
guidance or maybe some missing tooling
or some other stuff that's just not
completely right or that's really
specific to the situation of a couple of
customers and that's what we come in the
alm ranges are ones who try to fill
those gaps and trying to help and make
sure that the adoption of software like
this video team services and team
foundation server everyone can adopt it
everyone can work with it and it works
in the best possible way that's what
we're trying to do we're in the alm
ranges are here since 2006 so last year
we had our 10th year anniversary for me
that was almost the third year and if
you look at what we've done with don't
quite a lot and maybe you know some of
the things down here on the phone slide
first of all we did stuff for awareness
awareness is making sure that people
know that we exist alm ranges that they
can ask us to help them we're also
making sure that fiscal studio team
services all the features everything you
can do with it all the other stuff that
Microsoft has lost visual studio crystal
studio code in order products how do
people know what they what I can deal
with it they can use it and as they use
it in the right way guidance and well
the most popular one is the branching
guidance who a few has maybe never heard
about the alm ranges but use the first
patrol guidance from the alm
anyone used it it's really popular has
been downloaded hundreds of thousands of
times and it explains hey how do you set
up your branching what do you do have
simple branching teams but also more
complicated with hot fixes and service
packs and stuff like that that content
is now all migrated and it's gone into
crystal studio that's coming to the
official official documentation we're at
once quite popular another one which was
very popular are the talks we have on
Channel nine HL nine is Microsoft TV
channel where they distributed all kinds
of videos and films for free for
conferences but also interviews with ALM
arranges ALM MVPs by they talk about
different stuff and finally we've done a
lot of schooling and tooling can be
things like some extension for visual
studio team surfaces and that's really
popular but also to like an arm template
to install a sony cube server and so you
can automate the installation of such a
server on microsoft azure how do you do
that how do you do it in a secure way
we've also created stuff like that so we
try to balance between these three
categories and make sure that what we do
helps the community so that's a general
introduction to the alm ranges now let's
move on to what is def ops and how do we
do get us on what can we learn from it
first what is DevOps now maybe you've
seen this picture before at the blind
man trying to identify an elephant and
depending on what they have and where
they are they see a different part of
the elephant and something a is a deal
and maybe it's a broom or something or
maybe its water hose or whatever it
depends on a small part of the big
elephant and it depends on their
perspective and I see the same happening
with dev ops with that's what we also
have a lot of different interpretations
as some people say a death was all about
automation or Devils is only about
culture and it's about putting death and
office development and operations
together and making sure that they start
working together and then everything
will change or some people say no it's
about featured photos and well monitor
well maybe you recognize some of these
you know all of them are true they're
all a part of levels but what we like to
use it's a destiny
by Donna from brown he is the principal
deathless program manager at Microsoft
so did it is his job to make sure that
everything of Microsoft produces vessels
GD official duty team service articles
has to do support for death hooks and a
Microsoft has a good death of story that
they can help you to move your company
or projects to devils and what he stands
is well this was just about three things
people process and products products or
tools and what you want to do if you
want to use those three optimal as
possible and then make sure that you use
them to optimize your process with the
end goal of delivering value to the
customer and so automation yeah that's
important but automation is way more
important if your goal is ok I want to
deliver it to the customer as soon as
possible as fast as possible so this is
the definition that we use as the alm
ranges and we want to have a continuous
flow of value to our customers and we
try to improve a process the products we
use the people will work wait to make
sure that's what we can do so how do we
do that Fox well I want to go to the
three areas people processes and
products and discuss short how do we do
desktops for such an area product will
be the biggest one I will also have a
couple of demos where I will show some
stuff of the ALM ranges and how things
work I just to make sure that you get a
real sense of what we do and you've
hopefully can use the your own products
projects so let's start with people mike
says alm ranges so our advanced 100 alm
ranges worldwide half of them is an
employee of microsoft hall from them is
not I'm not I don't work for Microsoft I
work for Dina and in Evelyn's and so the
distribution of 5050 we have one
full-time arranger which is our program
energy is seeing here on the picture we
do Peter shell he works for Microsoft
and he's the only one that works
full-time as a range of projects so he
helps us he make sure that we have a
direct link to the product group that we
know what they are planning what we want
to do and that would be able to write
things and help in the right way all of
us are part-timers how we do this next
to our regular job
and we try to do it as much as possible
of course that depends say we all have a
job family and other things so we try to
balance our time and make sure that we
can help the community as best as
possible one of the things we have to
cope with is that we're a distributed
team here in the UK there are ranges in
the US or a lot of range is also a lot
of other places i'm from the netherlands
and we have ranges on every continent
and all and in a lot of countries so
there's also one of the challenges when
it comes to being an alm ranger when you
want to share your amazing and you have
to make sure that everyone is awake at
the same moment and so you have to pick
a time zone you have to pick a time and
make sure okay this is how are we going
to do i'm using so it also has
influenced our process by the way we do
devops has been influenced by defective
where a distributed team all over the
world with people as we're so what does
our process looked like a one thing with
this interesting is how do we start I
mean there is some ID someone thinks of
something or we find a gap or maybe a
customer that points us to a gap or the
product group asks us to do something
okay that's what we start with we start
with an ID then we make sure that we're
going to pitch the IDE not only to
Microsoft but also to dalm ranges
themselves because we're all part timers
we do it as for entirely we are the ones
to decide what we want to work on so we
pitch an ID and when the pitches
succeeded we make sure that we have a
comp rien and a goal for the project and
finally we formed a team and joining a
team is something you decide for
yourself some most of them we have a
backlog of items and if we can work on a
couple of projects that are starting up
or that already have some team members
and you can choose to join a team and
once you borrow for Team you start
working towards the end goal but that's
the basic idea and what I've seen is
didn't this doesn't only work for the
alm ranges I've also seen companies
apply this in-house have maybe some
bigger companies who want to have
innovation and stuff like that they run
in form of projects what people can
volunteer and you need big CID you need
to have sufficient so this is not only a
pliable to the ALM ranges you can also
use it and
situation so maybe if you've got a big
company and you want to think about
innovation please look at this model now
finally we have a blueprint for okay
what do we do once a project starts
first of all we want to make sure that
if teams aren't too big how are we
trying to have teams six plus minus 3i
which is also what a scrum guide says
that keep your team's small make sure
that they can communicate well so for
example we thrive it's not always
possible to make sure that teams live in
the same time zone that's how it is so
they can easily schedule a meeting and
make sure they can work together and we
have four comments print guidance now we
follow a scrum process although I will
explain a little bit later and we have
the same sprint k which is Microsoft
maybe you know a microsoft works in
Sprint's of three weeks so we have we've
made sure that we follow the same
sprints so we're in the streams print
number as they are we start our sprint
when they start we understand one day
and this helps communication so maybe we
are in a larger company or even small
company where you work on multiple
projects aligning your Sprint's really
house with communication now you'll see
that if someone says oh it will be done
in sprint 120 then you know what they
mean now you don't first have to ask oh
and which friends are you now how long
are your sprint what are you going to do
that having a common cadence make things
easier I already mentioned a common
vision now HD needs to have a vision and
they need to be enthusiastic about it
they need to build something they
actually like they wanna build they want
to work on and it needs to be clear what
you are viewing when we pitch in ie we
mostly build a small prototype
especially if you think about crystal
studio team services extensions which I
will show in a moment had those are
actual products and they have some goal
and some ID behind them and we try to
fix them first with a small prototype
that we presented the other ranges
represented to Microsoft product group
and when everyone likes it that we know
what to do or we can continue expanding
the prototype
we've also noticed that goes for all bar
x bar timers yeah we need to keep it in
account when we do a scheduling I mean
having a multi release plan for some
functionality for guidance or maybe an
extension or similar to link that's just
not going to work we can't look in the
future we don't know how much time we
will have so we try to keep a project
small and it really helps we try to have
at one epic I should think about
portfolio management at the highest
level you've got epics we need that
we've got a couple of features now one
two three and we need it it's what a
team decides so some teams have follow a
scrum process and they say okay we try
to have product backlog items and we
split them in tasks I'll just make sure
that they do Kanban for example and they
don't split into task but they just met
the process on the camera mode that's up
to the team and so we let in choose it
for themselves the way they want to work
but making sure that the release stays
small village yeah kind of essential to
make sure we really produce something
because we're distributed and we live in
a lot of different places we do our
other meetings through skype we use
skype for business and we always make
sure that we've got a recording of them
of a meaning we store that in csts so
everyone can stay up to date and you can
always look back at the recording to
make sure that you know what was decided
in the last weekly standup we don't have
daily stand-ups we try to do for each
project one meeting a week and we store
the recordings what we also do in this
turns out to work really well it's
something we adopted for Microsoft
Microsoft us internally because a lot of
teams sometimes working at large
products and you don't know what each
team is doing and maybe you lose sight
of the common goal common fishing they
share a really small video mostly
maximum three minutes at the end of each
sprint it goes into a sprint summary
email that gets sent to everyone and
everyone can easily see Oh what are
other teams doing this we have a small
status updates and the video and when
you watch the video you know okay what
acid on in the lost print what are they
planning to work on
and order any issues that ran into and
sharing this make sure that also
although we're a disability that and we
don't work together one-on-one we know
what people are doing and we still keep
up come and go like common fishing
finally we try to implement cam man for
most of our projects now we we saw it as
using scrum where we had a strict sprint
gayness where we said okay explains of
three weeks with your planning at the
start review at the end it became
difficult because since we're
part-timers we don't have the fixed
velocity you can't say okay my last
couple of sprints I did this much work
so I predicted in the next sprint I will
do this so I'll in my planning meeting
I've commits to a certain amount of work
and we'll see how far we come that's
just not feasible i mean we noticed that
it just doesn't work so we twist to come
man what we said okay instead of
following a strict process where we push
work into the sprint have we liked you
to come and process where we pool work
where someone says okay I've got time
I'm working on the project what can I do
he picks up an item and he decides from
cell that he's going to work on it and
it goes through our process and finally
it gets completed that works really well
and personally when I do consult the c-4
for companies that want to move to
desktops that always suggest them to
Lucas can man kemon really helps in
mapping out your process in seeing where
your bottlenecks are and making sure
that you optimize the right thing so is
it something you're running into it if
you're doing scrum and you don't know
hey what's the next step to innovate
well maybe you can have to look at cam
man for us it worked really good and
also see it working with customers okay
what's your short introduction to who we
are what we do now how we do it I mean
we are the microsoft alm ranges we're
all software developer so we love our
tools and our products and when you
think about microsoft and DevOps i hope
you think about team foundation server
and fizzle studio team services fee SDS
is a cloud hosted environment for
Microsoft that you can use to do death
ops team foundation server it's the same
product with an on-premises so every
three months microsoft says okay
we release an update for on-premises and
them and then PS PS in DFS has the same
features and PS PS at a couple of
sprints and PFS Alliance again so we use
it a lot we use a lot of fissile studio
team services and other Microsoft
products and we try to and make sure
that there's project work well together
so what did we do well we started using
team surfaces the moment it was released
in the first p of you so anyone here you
think this'll studio team services yeah
team foundation server ok dr this yet
yeah it works great i mean the biggest
plant is for us is we don't have to keep
it up to date anymore and we don't have
to spend time on running updates making
sure that we patch have servers at
everything stays in good shape and stay
it's working we couldn't just focus on
what what we want to do physical CD team
serves is managed for Microsoft and it
just works this is the only and not the
only but this is one of the biggest non
Microsoft products we use slack and
we're probably going to move to
Microsoft team teams once it supports
multiple active directory joining
together and stuff like that but we now
use slack we realize it before we use
email and we send you a lot of email so
we did things where we had different
distribution lists HR you could set up
rules in Outlook and say oh an email
comes in goes to this fall or a girl did
that fall or terrible slack works really
good for us we've got a channel for each
project so if you interested in a
project you can just join your channel
where we've also got a couple of
channels for general things and maybe we
just want to share something or want to
ask a question we want to help each
other so we use slack for that when it
comes to sisters to the team services
we've chosen to use the one team project
to rule them all I don't know everyone
is familiar with us if you look at
crystal studio team serves in DFS at the
highest level you've got a projects
collection a project collection maps
behind the scenes directly to a database
so it's really isolated so within a
project collection you can create team
projects but in team projects you can
create these and
something that wasn't really clear it's
still not really clear in the project up
in the product is how do you create
those teams and how do you map them to
your structuring in TFS and what I see
teams doing sometimes or organizations
is well they have multiple team project
collections and within them they have a
team project for each team and within
each team project and have one team or
maybe a couple of things now what we
strive to do is say okay but we want all
those teams to work together you want to
make sure that we can do portfolio
management as we know that what's the
status of all the teams that we can run
queries across multiple teams and so you
can see okay I've got an epic yeah
really high level which teams are
working on it what are they doing
because of that we've chosen for the one
team project structure so we have one
team practice collection on PS PS one
team project called NLM and within their
with multiple teams and those teams all
have their own backlog their own Kanban
board have their own location in source
control so they can run independently of
the other teams but as a higher level
you can aggravate all the data and you
know okay this is what my individual
keys are doing this is what we're doing
as an organization and so maybe if
you're interested in that if you notice
that you are using TFS you've got lots
of team projects with lots of
maintenance and configuration stuff and
well take your favorite search engine
look for one team karate to rule them
all you will find a couple of blog posts
that explain the IV and that that can
maybe help you in configuring your PSD
sdfs environment so already set for work
we try to favor cam man so I'll give a
demo of our camera mode now we use it
for code that for a version control we
made a choice to say okay we want one
really big tfcc repository team
foundation version control and we use it
mostly to store binary stuff like video
recordings big files and each team has
its individual git repository and so if
you look at our hierarchy 1p FEC project
git repos and they all map to your team
except the top one and that maps to the
organization another thing which is may
be interesting for the people who are
running csts or who are maybe migrating
from PFS this the idea of a scaling unit
if you look at the architecture that
Microsoft use is to run PS PS they've
made a couple of decisions they said
okay we want to be 24 7 I will want to
keep your product running make sure that
everyone can use it's all done even when
we do updates of course sometimes
something goes wrong I mean humans make
mistakes that can happen but what I've
done is okay Dave 25 at their product
into scaling units so you've got a
couple of scaling units in the United
States you have some in Europe some on
Australia other parts of the world and
what I do once they start rolling out an
update they start with scaling unit 0 if
the update succeeds they move to one
update 60s they move to two finally they
move to Europe and moves in Australia
and if something feels they only have to
roll back the scaling units they already
deployed it and our program manager
always loves to say that we are bleeding
edge Canaries maybe you've heard about
the mining canary that when miners went
into the mind they always do a canary
with them if they're toxic gases the
canary would die but then they would
know they had to get out and so an early
warning canary well LMK ranges we're the
same hopefully we don't die but we run a
scale in unit 0 so whenever something
gets updated we always see it really
soon we know now that we can test it we
can work with it and if it it may be
sometimes we find issues how we
communicate with a product group they
fix them and they fix them before they
go externally to other product
throughout the scaling units and I will
show you how you can discover your own
scaling unit in demo actually interested
I think at the moment if you want to
make sure that you get features as
quickly as possible you need to open an
account in Brazil Brazil is at the
moment scaling unit 1 so after 0 which
is internal to Microsoft one is the
first guess
updated and then it goes through the
rest of the world so if you look at the
release notes with ESD as you always
have a sentence at the start it says
something like in the coming weeks going
one or two weeks you will get following
updates that's because of scallions they
roll out gradually across the globe what
we've also done is we've got a couple of
sent box account so we have our ALM
Ranger the fizzle studio does comment
count we also have sent box one sandbox
do if we use for testing and especially
when it comes to extension so which are
the products that you install into pscs
or TFS we use those sandboxes to make
sure that we can do better testing
before it goes into the general ALM
Ranger account and before it goes to the
marketplace so I'll show you a demo of
this and how we use pscs to do that so
demo time our desktops home this can
everyone see it is the new fiscal studio
team service welcome page maybe you've
already seen it and if you look at a
project at this is our main project
we've also got another theme project for
link recording so the one team project
to rule them all isn't completely true
now we split this out just to make sure
and that we can keep track of all the
recordings we have and everything we do
but you can see if we need the alm
projects now we've got for example team
project helped create sample data which
a team generator team and those are
different teams that do their own work
has a realm that clock work on their own
stuff and they can do whatever they want
so if you move into the alm range 15 one
thing we really try to use and here you
see an example of that is mark down I
mean as alm ranges we write codes we
create ruling we also create a lot of
guidance and previously we just use a
marks of work whenever we share
something I turned on track changes
maybe you know it and you can do to
refuse in the comments and whatever but
merging those was always manually so if
a document went out to 100 ranges and a
couple of them review the document and
our program manager was the one who us
merging all those documents by hand
that's not a best solution so we
switched to mark down maybe you know
mark down mark down is just plain text
so if we edit this one yes it's loading
then you'll see that mark down is just a
regular text you've got some conventions
for example if you say she started your
line with this that you get a header and
things like that why do you yes the
biggest advantage of this is we can now
use our git repositories to store mark
on files in them and we can use the pull
request that fits us to your team
service and TSN's have to merge the
documentation so we switched all our
documentation to mark now one thing we
probably will add in the future we still
want aunt is automatic conversions to
PDF word and stuff like that you've got
tooling for it we now do it manually
whether it could it could become a
release pipeline where you say hey I
take a document and make sure it gets
pushed to Vista studio com or other
locations where it can be downloaded and
if you look at our desk board one of the
witches failed loading it's because of
the internet speed here and NBC and you
see we try to track a lot of data this
is a dashboard that our program energy
use it so and what we already said we
try to use ethics at the highest level
have we need the epics we've got
features we need them we got the
individual teams that do their work we
try to track for example the status of
our bills and this is a custom widget
the free currency buildings alm range is
not available on the market place but
we're working on it and here you can see
we've got 27 bill definitions running
for all our extensions and they're all
green so if everything is ok a program
manager has this on a really large
screen in his office and he always
watches it and when something goes wrong
he contacts us or sends out an email or
something but he's really happy that we
have this and as you can follow it some
custom widgets this one team protect
health but also these three
these are the countdown witches I will
show the code for them in a moment and
explain how we build them and what you
can learn from it hopefully and here you
see a regular countdown widget where you
can just say hey I want you i want you
to count down to a certain day so for
example in 17 days that greatly 24 will
start with an internal mitosis defend
and we have two days and then sprint
ends so we try to use her own stuff we
try to make sure that we use a CSPs to
the max and that we use everything that
it has this is a 10-member at the
highest level the ALM level as you can
see work in progress limits not really
our thing something we need we
definitely need to work on but it is
really easy to see I mean you know what
we're working on what's approved by a
program management or fizzle studio
theme service product group or whoever
has to make it seem so whenever you've
got time you only anyone who works on
something and you can check out these
items and make sure if you do something
that's useful this is a little a little
smaller this is the one for the team
project hell that one that showed to
build status this is what I'm i'm
currently working on with my team and
what you see here is well apparently one
IM scurvy committed and jacob is working
on it another one is a proof that i'm
going to work on it so when i start out
moving to commit it and we're now
looking into actually modifying the
other camera modes and making sure that
the process we follow have we've got
people who for example especially look
at you x user experience and design at a
day get their own process step and we
don't forget them before we do a release
and the same for testing so this is
something we're going to expand upon but
for us it works really good and as you
can see in this case we didn't make the
decision to add tasks but if you want
you can just say hey I want to split
this I want a task that cough is a
certain part and another part and you
can just add them and they will restore
the same for test cases at the same four
branches that you can start from here so
this is something that works really good
and yes you're not familiar with cam
then I would really advise you to look
into it and see if she can do something
for you
this is our a LMT sec repository so this
is team finishes version control as we
all know it since the first versions of
TFS we've got a lot of markdown file
suggests in our repo that we use the
documentation but we've also got get
report stories for the individual
projects and for example if you move to
the team project help and you'll see
that that git repository yeah is really
small we just have to code in that as
required by the team the team is
ownership over the repository and they
know how they can use it and they also
use branches and pull requests we try to
use get flow so if you're getting
started with gates and we get
repositories and you don't know hey how
should i do the branching how does
everything work and how should I merge
back and what are what actually is a
pull request and stuff like that looking
to get for it so I mean it's not the
best solution on earth but it gives you
a good structure to get started with
using it and making sure that he used in
the right way and personally I always
advise companies to move to get so the
FEC is absolutely it's not that it will
be supported for a long time and you can
you can keep using it if you want but if
you really want to move to death ops get
really helps add the modern pull
requests and yeah can i comment this if
i can put us in an email yes i can i I'm
not sure if it helped but because people
say we don't want to move to get yeah
that's something that I also hear me I
do a lot of consultancy of course we've
got problems with that but it's mostly
we need to educate people you need to
make sure that it is a part of the
project effort of the project so it's
supported it works it just standard yet
it's not different from github or get
labs or big bucket or whatever protocol
the needs the same it supported and it
works really well so yeah it's another
comment
the question was do we use to hide this
version where we combine tfpc and get um
yes because if you look at it this is
one single team projects which mixes won
t fe see how does the first one and a
lot of kids r equal stories but it's not
that you I mean you don't mix them in
one repository I don't think that would
make sense anyway to do but we do use
them within one team project for
different scenarios let us send you a
question okay perfect okay there was a
short injection to our death of tell me
the way we like to use PS PS so
dashboards markdown files get-get flow
pull requests everything another part
which is really interesting and which I
want to share with you is how we build
extensions because that's real fooling
it's probably that's something that you
can use in your own projects and I hope
we can contribute something to the
community this way as anyone already
used a fee SPS or TFS extension yeah
some okay for builds yeah there are also
four bills yeah there they are extension
for bill task released a score widgets
or other parts of the product does
anyone already built an extension we've
gotten one cool okay a really short
introduction I mean this is no extension
101 session but an extension in fee sts
and DFS it's actually quite simple it is
a manifest file which describes the name
of your extension and what it does and
where it plugs into the project it's a
couple of markdown and other files that
describe your extension on the
marketplace so people know what they're
getting into and finally it's the code
and the code of the extension is just
JavaScript a JavaScript with some CSS
some HTML and that's your extension so
combining those three gives you an
extension and what I want to do I want
to show you how we do danfoss when it
comes
extensions and this is the deference
process as we try to follow it as we
already mentioned we're trying to use
leaning cam man when it comes to our
process I hope try to make sure that a
process is live weight and that we
optimize as much as possible we use get
that we use get for all our extensions
and somewhere on github some are
internal to our own account and will
hopefully be oversaw sometime in the
future but if you want to look at
examples like go to github or a lot of
examples of how we use them and although
the gold is in github we still use our
build and release processes within psps
a day align together you can use them
together and it's really easy to do we
try to use to have an automated build
and deploy for all of our extensions
when we started one in a half two years
ago we're building the first extensions
it was easy we only had one extension
and well we build it a program manager
took the file and he deployed to the
marketplace and we were done we now have
more than 20 extensions so it starts
becoming cumbersome to do it by hand and
we started optimizing the process so cam
man get contains integration continuous
deployment with everything that pscs has
to offer so we use have built the new
build system the task wave build system
will use release management for
deployments we use a sure and to make
sure that we can store our files and
stuff like that testing we try to use as
much as possible unit tests in our
extensions we use typescript to write
the extensions which is a lot easier
than driving playing JavaScript to make
sure that we can scale we also write a
unit test in touch script and we try to
make sure that we mock out the
dependencies as we have fun csts and as
we can test them in an automated way but
is still a lot of manual testing where
one thing we're not doing yet is
automated UI testing from the like
selenium and that's the next step that
we wanted to take to make sure you had a
code compiles unit test whether it also
functions correctly in a browser use the
feedback or the marketplace has a direct
option to get feedback and you can both
refuse on the marketplace and we try to
nicely as possible and work with people
when they go to buck or when they got a
feature request what we've also done it
will instrument all our extensions so we
use Microsoft Application insights part
of Asia and we make sure that our
extensions have post custom events to
application insights and general uses
data so we know for example how many
people use the extension what box they
run into we use application which is
smart detection maybe someone has used
it already which just says hey I see
that something is going wrong because
it's different than it was before and
normally the load time is one second now
it suddenly is five seconds it's not an
error and you should look into it so
sometimes I get an email which says hey
one of the extensions you work on
suddenly has produced a couple of errors
you want to look into it and as I said
we try to use Microsoft Azure as much as
possible I want to show you a demo of
how this looks what it looks like how we
use it for my extension pipeline this is
the marketplace if you have an assault
extension yet please go have to look at
the marketplace its marketplace with
sisal studio com and as you can see
there are a couple of popular extensions
this one is developed by me as one of
the alm ranges microphone management so
quite happy with that one these are the
help of Mike's of themselves and are
really big extensions to the products
and so definitely check them out and
yeah well extensions are edit of daily
so at least once a week go to the new
extensions see if something is useful
for you and please try it out and once
you have an extension for example this
is the countdown widget which I want to
show you how it works you can install it
directly in PS PS or you can download it
and install it in PFS right so it's both
on-premises and cloud no problem here
you see the markdown information and how
you can contribute to it and here you
see the user reviews please if you use
one of our extensions of an order an
extension from someone else if you use
an extension leave a review let us know
what you think of it because as a LM
Rangers I mean we work for the community
so you need to know
where the community things first we need
to know what do you like what should we
do what should we add and once it's good
idea we'll each the ID create a project
and we'll do it so that's the way we
work so if you've got feedback please
give it to us well this particular
extension countdown widget you can see a
you already saw it working on the
dashboard of the alm ranges it can count
down to a specific day or it can count
down to the end of the spring it's
completely open sourced this one is on
github so you can view the code you can
work with it please feel free to branch
it for work it create a pull request but
we want to work with the community and
whatever you have please let us know if
you look at the code for this extension
I've got fifth studio 2017 the release
candidate here so I mentioned this is
the the manifest file which says okay
what's the name of my extension what's
the version where does it make where can
you get support what files does it
include and what contributions does it
give and we try to use so already
mentioned we try to use typescript so
this is a part of thi this is some types
of code as kick-starts the extension and
helps you starting it this is our
application inside link so here how we
do stuff like track page views or
correct custom events for summer for the
countdown widget we've got offense that
make sure that we know how many of our
extensions over off of our installs use
the sprint countdown and how many use
the regular cow down which one is more
popular and we also make sure that we
track the errors for each other we know
where we need to invest on and finally
you've got some HTML so this is the
basic HTML that kick-starts the
extension and so allah does it loads the
correct CSS some sdk scripts and finally
its last the extension so that's really
general introduction to extensions now I
want to show you how our death of
pipeline works first of all these are
all our bills as you've already seen we
store our coding
historic we don't get up or locally in
csps and we try to use the continuous
integration build for each widget we
have for each extension we have so this
is the one for countdown widget the code
I just showed you as you can see we try
to do things like well it's mostly
JavaScript and so we use NPM and grunt
to make sure that we have all the
packages and that we can compile the
extension and that we can package it
this one we place token is really simple
it's just a powershell script and it
runs and it makes sure that the
application inside is sedation key which
you can get from the portal is added to
the extension so we don't try to hard
code settings like that we make sure
that we can configure them easily in the
build and it's the same for all
extensions and we can easily update them
white sauce is also really interesting
white sauce is a product it's a
commercial products and with testing in
salem ranges that scans your application
for nolan film abilities so it will
check things like hey you are using open
source libraries but they've got
security issues or they've got
performance issues or maybe licensing
issues and it will make sure that you
get a detailed report of it and we try
to implement it for all applications to
make sure how that we comply with the
things Mike's has asked for us and we
don't have any security problems but the
question is does it also do security
vulnerabilities yes question is if you
can run it on Prem I think so i'm not
sure we are using a TPS yes but i will
check it and we can you can get in touch
with me and I'll I like to know if you
can run it on pram and finally we run
unit tests here is some custom code
which is written in Python because we're
doing JavaScript unit tests and we need
to parse the results and then make sure
if we link them to fear CS if you're
interested in stuff like this and if you
want to make sure that you can test your
script or your typescript please drop us
a note we're always willing to share
stuff and make sure that you use it
finally the extension is packaged and
it's published so this is the container
immigration bill this runs for every
check in be it on github be it on PS PS
and we try to expand it one thing I was
discussing today with our program
manager is
we're not dealing solar cute yet so
we're not many so in a few bits product
of manages technical depth that message
the quality of your code that's not
something we've embedded which sometimes
do it ourselves that we run limiters and
other tools but we haven't made it a
part of by applying it so I hope that's
going to be one of our next steps to
make sure that we not only create
extensions but we also get a good
quality extensions with great code
quality when the build finishes we go to
release and here you see all the release
definitions we have for each extension
has its own release definition and for
example for countdown widget it looks
like this they're all pretty similar
what we've done is we've created three
environments we make sure we have a def
better production and farm and death
goes to our sandbox accounts now what I
showed in sindhi a slide that goes
through the ranger account and product
production goes to the marketplace so
this is the moment it becomes really
public this is a custom extension
publish extensions are an extension to
help write extensions and you can find
it on the market place we've worked with
Microsoft wrote a group to make sure
that we filled all the gaps and it
really works for the scenarios we were
trying to do and you can use it now you
just easy to install and use if you look
at the properties it goes to the
marketplace in this case our own private
publisher and we do things like hey
what's what's the name we add attack and
we say okay we want to have it in this
account if you look at production we say
it's public it doesn't have a tack we
publish on the Microsoft death laps now
which is the public account we use on
the marketplace what we've also done a
set of security if you look at the death
face as you can see it's completely
automated have both the pre-deployment
and the post deployment approval for
automated which means that whenever
someone makes go change and checks in
bushes exchanges neither will be a
continuous integration build and once
the build finishes will always be a
deployment to the Deaf environment
always so we will we will always check
if the package fellas are all files
there can we deploy it that sometimes we
will do some manual tests after it on
sandbox one sometimes that will just
leave
and when you go to the next environment
you will see that someone has to approve
it and we've configured it now with this
option anyone uses so me a program
manager or Matthias one of us has to
approve it and then it goes to better
and maybe you can guess it's all ready
for production we say okay you want to
make sure that everyone approves it so
this is not a single user action but we
all get a message that we need to
approve release and once we've approved
it it goes to the public marketplace now
finally when it is in production we
start measuring out with a bit
application inside some engines already
and we start looking how's our product
use that for example DS it's a data for
the countdown with Keith as you can see
this is data for the past 24 hours
apparently almost 40,000 regular
countdown witches were created and
20,000 sprint account on witches were
created so we tried to monitor this data
we try to see how many uses how many
sessions popularity apparently the
Netherlands is in fourth place so we are
using the switches in the Netherlands
but he'll united kingdom the united
states are also really high you can see
which browsers people mostly use and you
can monitor all kinds of stuff we've got
the same for folder management results
an extension our works on and then you
can see hey do people use tfpc
repositories really use git repositories
how many people open the dialog and then
just close it how many people open it
and answer a folder name which is a
dublicate and how many people succeed in
creating a new follower and that helps
to attract the use of the extension and
make sure that we can optimize for
certain scenarios so that's not that 45
line now we try to use get cam man
automatic build automatic deploy and
find the application inside the monitor
everything and we're still expanding our
white sauce is the newest addition so
Newark you will maybe be a new addition
or other things we can do we try to work
on it we also try to publish as much as
this as possible if you want to know
more about how this pipeline works and
the MS en magazine I hope you all know
msdn magazine is free you can find it
online you can also if you got an msdn
subscription you can take a subscription
and they'll send it to you in the issue
of August last year we wrote a complete
article that shows how to do def off for
extensions so everything let's discuss
here and you can read it for yourself at
your own base if you want that's what I
wanted to show you as for our questions
or other things well please let me know
call to action for you I hope if you
will use our products and look at the
guidance we have look at the articles we
ride look at the tooling the extensions
we create and if you insult something or
download something or read our blocks
please let us know what you think that
leave a review or be as a one to five
star rating a few low in time please let
us know also if you've got problems let
us know now we are here to fill gaps we
want to help the community we want to
make sure that that PS PS and DFS can be
used as widely as possible rock this
possible and everyone and knows how it
works so throughout problems we really
like to hear them and probably the risk
and I know from which country everyone
is but there are probably ALM ranges in
your own countries you can approach and
otherwise you can always use a Twitter
account or make sure that you send us an
email something to our blog will always
respond if you want to become an Al I'm
Ranger that's also interesting there is
a nomination process that comes down to
you approach someone who is already alm
Ranger it helps if you already know each
other you explain what you do why why I
want to be arranged here while you're
passionate about ALM or desktop for
agile but you want to contribute to the
community and your donation will go to
the ranges a couple of Rangers will look
at it and they will do what's mostly
call the google bing test right they
will drop your name in google and bing
and they will just see what shows up and
if they see our he's got an active block
or he speaks that user offense or he
tries to share his knowledge and twitter
or how whatever i mean even if it's
small that really helps in getting a
nomination acceptance of some
too interested but you can always
approach me or go to our Twitter or blog
account you can find a Twitter account
as ALM ranges we're always open for QA
24 hours of data I mean there are a lot
of ranges or you will probably find
someone who can help you is living near
you or how we speak your language so
there was a session if you want to
contact me you can always find me a
twitter email on my own blog and i hope
you've learned something from the rain
from the alm ranges and like you can use
it in your own projects thank you are
there any questions yes
the question is we're now using PFS on
premises we need to update every time
every three months as a new update and
cost a lot of time what if you move to
the cloud can we still deploy to
on-premises yes yes you can the
deployment model I mean we are doing it
in Azure because for us it's really easy
but it also supports on-premises
deployments so you can even run your
builds on premises and you can even make
sure that you store your source code may
be some somewhere else it's all up to
you but justice it is definitely
possible any other questions ok thank
you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
