I'm assistant professor at Delft
University of Technology and welcome to
NBC I guess let's start this morning
actively with a small quiz who knows who
set this any takers
Bill Gates any other guesses hahaha have
you seen this song before
yes really I have heard every programmer
ever say all programming is like the
best thing everyone you learn
programming because it's the future and
it's exciting and yes we love this
however of course this sentiment brings
on a very interesting question because
if we say everyone should learn
programming what do we mean exactly by
programming apparently we have this
feeling but we don't really have a very
clear definition if you ask people what
programming is if you ask 100 develop
first probably you will get 100 answers
it's not really very clear what
programming is and this is especially
difficult for us being programs maybe
you noticed joke about three fishes
swimming in the water I love this joke
and the big fish says hey folks how's
the water to the small to small fishes
and the two fishes say what's water they
don't know what water is because the
only thing they have ever been in is
water they don't know that there's
something that is north water that you
could pull them out of the water and
that's suddenly they would be in
something not watery like Aaron it would
be dangerous these fishes don't really
have a very good conception of what
water is because the only thing they
know is water for them the world is
synonymous to water and in a sense this
is a little bit true also for us
programmers probably the only thing we
know the only profession we know is
programming for some people maybe the
only homey we have ever known is
programming so maybe we are like those
two
little fishes maybe we aren't really the
best people to judge what programming is
because we are swimming in programming
all the time so how are we supposed to
know what else is there so the topic of
this talk is my personal exploration of
being yet out of the water being above
the water happening like Wow Wow there
are other things that are programming
and what is my reflection on programming
so let's go back to the year 2008 for
this personal reflection in 2008 I
graduated my master's degree from an
tovyn University for people that don't
know the Netherlands tiny country and I
moved from antiphon which is somewhere
there in this tiny country to tell us
which is somewhere there in this tiny
country for you probably it's not a big
distance but from for someone from a
tiny country a small move is a big so I
went to delves to this nice TU delft
building you technology University of
Delft and I started to work on a PhD
there the research question of my PhD
that my PhD supervisor has set for me
was let's research a DSL for finance a
domain-specific language specifically
for finance a programming language that
non-programmers but finance experts
could use to program stuff so we
envisioned something like this a
programming language that was easy
enough for a banker or someone from
insurance to write small little programs
that could be executed by a machine such
that the finance expert didn't really
need programmers for everything they
could make their own small changes so
this is more or less what we envision
for a four year PhD project I was really
excited I was like oh wow I'm going to
give these finance people a programming
tool that they can use this is going to
be awesome so the first thing I did is I
did a little internship at a Dutch
insurance company because before I had
only done my master's degree so I only
knew a lot about theory and compilers
and stuff like that but not really about
anything in the outside world this is
what they thought me in school I'm not
really sure if they
I'll teach this to people that take
computer science courses but when I was
in school in 2008 when I graduated this
was sort of my world view there are
programmers and also there are users and
there is a big wall between them and the
user Jews and the programmers program
that's sort of you know how it is and
sometimes maybe there's tiny holes in
that wall where the program is listening
a little bit to what the users want and
usually explain a little bit what they
need from the programmers but in general
you have users and you have programmers
however when I set foot in this
insurance company soon I saw this wasn't
really the case that both the
programmers but also the users were
programming and this blew my mind's
because there aren't any first chip of
my programmer I mentally crisis because
of like Wow users know normal people
they know the known programmers they can
also program but of course they didn't
program like this they didn't use a
programming language a textual
programming language as real traditional
C programming languages what did they
use spreadsheets all the people in the
insurance company were programming in
spreadsheets they didn't need my DSL so
I went back to my supervisor is that
friends I don't need any ESL in finance
they have with ESL in finance and it's a
pretty good one it's called Excel
whatever we are going to come up with in
this four-year PhD project however
amazing it is it is never going to be
it's the greatest programming language
of history of mankind that has ever
existed
spreadsheets now you're laughing when
it's true Excel is such a good
programming language that people don't
know their programming let that sink in
think about doing Java accidentally
I don't know clips just showed up on my
machine you could never do this and I
know it's it's tongue-in-cheek and it's
funny but it's also true the step
towards using something like Java or C
sharp it's a step to a different world
whereas for these people Wow spreadsheet
you know you start out with a bunch of
numbers and then a formula and then a
macro and soon you're accidentally
running the entire company and you can
make fun of that but it's also super
powerful it's so easy the threshold is
so low and the ceiling is so high so
this became the motto of my PhD project
spreadsheets are code it's a it's a real
programming language that we should take
more serious however oh but it's not
just programming it is functional
programming it's even cooler than just
programming it's functional programming
think about it a formula and
spreadsheets can not have any side
effects the only thing it can do is take
information from to cells and calculate
the result based on that there's no way
that a spreadsheet format can access
another cell its value so there
functional programming is even cooler
and there's some other buzz words not
just our stretchies functional
programming
they're also reactive programming
because if you change your firm line and
spreadsheet it doesn't update everything
it just updates whatever it means to
update so if they sell updates it
propagates its values to other cells so
their functional reactive programming
and and yes everyone can do it isn't
that amazing
so spreadsheets are code however they do
lack and are de and this is what's the
new direction that my PhD project
wenting spreadsheets are a great tool
however in a sense they so much resemble
programming like we did it in in the 60s
and the 70s no documentation not really
well structured not very easy to analyze
what is going on so that became the
topic that I really wanted to focus on
analyzing big spreadsheets and how
people understand
what is there and help spreadsheet
programming move to a new level just
like we had procedural programming
moving 200 moving to functional helping
spreadsheet people structure their stuff
because often of course these
spreadsheets aren't just one worksheet
we've seen spreadsheets that had dozens
of worksheets all interconnected formal
as linking them macros everywhere so it
got harder and harder to really
understand what was going on in a sense
what we were talking about here were
code smells in spreadsheets so code
smells for people that aren't familiar
with it are pieces of source code that
they don't necessarily need to have an
error but they're just not structured
really well I may be a famous example of
code smells is long methods so a very
long methods
it doesn't necessarily be wrong it could
be perfectly correct but of course you
know if you have to debug a thousand
line method then it's just going to take
more time and a few small methods and
also another famous code smell is code
duplication sometimes also called code
clones if you have similar functionality
in different parts of a code base then
it's going to be tricky because if you
make a change you might have to make the
same change to all of the clones but
also maybe you're not really sure what
the purpose is of the different clones
in the codes so these aren't errors
there's a long list of course from code
smells as defined by Martin Fowler but
these are some that you get an idea of
what a code smelly's and of course these
code smells are really easily
transferable to spreadsheets if you
think about the long methods you might
as well think about a very long formula
is in the same way
not very montane moe as a long method is
maintainable so this is my new direction
and I wrote a number of papers about
code smells in spreadsheets like this
and then ultimately I became a PhD
awesome great great story so this is a
story as I have told it many times like
Oh spreadsheets or code and then I made
somebody like features and I go to
dissertation in yeah hooray
for everyone however this is sort of the
story of my brain of the the rational
part of me and there was also a story
the story of the heart how was I feeling
while I was doing this a previous
edition of this talk when I gave it
someone said Fellini is doing group
therapy it's somewhat true I think
because for me here we're going to talk
about my feelings a little bit because
initially I was super excited I was like
spreadsheets or code this is it's such a
great finding and I'm sure everyone
would be very excited to talk about how
we programmers could help stretchy
people to become as awesome as we are so
I went off to all these type of
developer conferences to give talks like
that like gosh my teacher code and
people be like yeah but it's not real
programming I was like are you kidding
me programming just like it before it's
functional and it's reactive and it's
super cool and all these people can do
it and it's so accessible and it's
everywhere and people be like yeah it's
not real program and you can laugh but
it really it wears you out after a while
I was just like yeah probably right
probably I am spending my time this
valuable youth I have only known problem
and just I got less and less and less
excited about it without really
realizing that I was even getting less
excited about it but I was suddenly not
certainly not realizing why I was
getting less excited about it it was
somehow it was dragging me down and I
got less excited and less productive and
I didn't really know why and afterwards
of course later in life I was reflecting
on that on how are we as a community
what what are we doing to young people
and at that point I think I thought that
this was the normal way of the world I
thought yeah of course if you're in the
community and you really like something
what you are going to naturally do is
bitch on other people's stuff it's
normal and even though people were doing
it to me and I didn't
you like it I was doing it myself I was
a dildo man in that community was like
haha Java do you have and I thought it
was normal I thought it was being part
of communities like normal because this
is how you grow up from when you are if
you're and you start programming you go
to university this is how people treat
each other all the time oh you have a
Windows laptop you fake program I mean I
could spend the rest of this dog missing
all the communities because I've heard
it all and I said it all this is just
how we treat each other and only later
after I went to this spreadsheets no
longer an interesting phase and also
once I started joining other communities
I saw that this is normal it is not I
also love running people that follow me
on Twitter might know that I do some
running and after a while I really also
started to do races and stuff and I'm
not a good runner I'm actually a pretty
slow burner my best half marathon time
is two hours and 15 minutes so for the
people that don't know running people
that do a full marathon take about two
hours if they're the best of the world
so I'm twice as slow as the people that
are the best at running so I'm not
really yeah I know it's really good at
running however you join the race with
people that are like twice as quick and
they're like oh we love running and how
often do you go and what shoes do you
have and no one in the running community
says what's your time oh that's so slow
oh really you need a shoes no those are
everyone's like oh that's great and even
it's even worse no I'm running people
that have running friends know this we
are actively trying to make this
community bigger if you have just gone
on a jog to catch your train
we runners be like oh you like running
do you want to go for a run is great
reason join your race what is your 10
10k time we want people to like running
because it's
I'm running is great it's way nicer than
sitting behind your computer and only
then I started to realized hey wow there
are these communities where people are
not shipped to each other that is super
nice and I also had people that follow
me on Twitter or see me around at
conferences know that I love knitting
knitting is so great it keeps your hands
busy you create stuff it's like a fidget
spinner for adults
and also I do it in meetings too
especially conference calls because you
have to keep paying attention and this
Lee I was just doing my email and then
using my microphone that's a 10-minute
philemon you have anything to ask
I wasn't cool submitting is great also
for conference calls and then the nicest
thing is suppose you're in it used to
school for one hour at least you
finished half a sweater so it's not lost
time but also the mixing community was
so nice I hadn't in a lot as a teenager
when I sort of stopped doing it when I
was in university so after ten years of
not knitting I went to a workshop and
apparently you won't believe this but
the Knitting community also has fashion
they like oh these needles are a bit
old-fashioned and I will use these new
techniques and these new needles so I
went to this knitting workshop with my
old-fashioned straight needles it's very
much out of style we all wrote use round
needles now I didn't know this so icons
in this workshop and no one is like oh
you're old-fashioned you know stare
they have security breaches and
everything you need that's right
I was like all it's so great to come
back to knitting and welcome we see you
have this needles with Luke we have six
autumn you know that know better in this
way and they're better dishes nicer for
your hands and stuff but no I was
dissing my old-fashioned mini Wow
we should all do more running and mini
and everything that's no programming we
can have nice communities and of course
also in the running community and also
in a knitting community and I'm sure a
nutter
friendly inclusive community it says
well people do discuss tools of course
they say I like this needle more than
that needle but they would never really
bake her on people that use something
else because they want people to feel
welcome Wow
okay let's go back to to nine to twelve
when I was not happy and I had no clue
about communities could that could
potentially be not here so I'm at this
point I just finished my PhD I started
professor position at tu Delft where I
was supposed to do more of the cool
spreadsheet stuff and I was totally
uninspired and I didn't really know what
to do I didn't
want to do more spreadsheets I didn't
really know why and then I'm just
feeling sad and then this happens
I moved cities I started to live in
Rotterdam and there was this community
center with a bunch of kids that said
hey we would love to learn us some
programming there's like okay I guess I
could do that I can do programming so
probably I can teach programming for
children like that's the same thing so I
was like okay sure kids I will teach you
some programming let's do it so I went
to work every Saturday at that Community
Center and told some kids that were
interested in programming some
programming and they had a Lego robot a
Lego Mindstorm said who has it let go -
it said at home for kids right it's
really cool so it's a Lego robotics set
it has motors and sensors and you can
build all sorts of robots with it and
also you can program it with a
programming language sets a dataflow
programming language it looks more or
less like this where you have blocks you
can connect them with wires and that's
how you program the robot so you could
say something like wait until you see an
object block and then connect it to a
stop the motors block and then the Lord
Shake would run like this so one
Saturday kids have gone home I'm looking
at these programs and they really they
look a little bit like this mm-hmm it's
not very well structured is it I think
I've seen this before
normal program errs making programs for
specific goal but it sort of looks like
structure it lacks an IDE hmm these are
code smells little Lego Mindstorms
programs these kids are doing the same
thing that the accountants were doing
very much being goal driven they didn't
care about making a nice spreadsheet
they cared about our budgets much like
these children didn't care about it's a
nice program they cared about catching a
soccer ball or whatever we were
programming but they didn't really
analyze the structure they're really bad
at managing the code because they were
very goal-oriented code smells a Lego
Mindstorms that's nice I know it's
Saturday
I know I shouldn't definitely be
researching or my payoff however I
haven't done a little spreadsheet work
in a while and I'm sure my head of
department happy if I would produce any
research so let's just write one little
paper about code smells in block based
programming languages and at least I
have something to show for at my annual
review meeting even though it's not
really what I was supposed to do let's
just write one little paper of course
you know there's 35 more minutes left in
this talk that it wasn't just this one
paper this was interesting because then
I was wondering does it actually matter
to children our code smells really bad
because these are even small programs
way smaller than the accountants of
spreadsheets so somebody it doesn't
really matter to children that there's
some smells maybe they're just
programming very exploratory and it's
okay if there are some smells because
the main focus is on learning so at this
point I move through a programming
language called scratch who has played
with scratch for our kids right
absolutely so this is scratch this is
the interface that that you start with
so you can see it's also a block based
programming language which is a little
bit different from the Lego Mindstorms
where you connect the blocks with wires
here you connect them as puzzle blocks
and it's a life programming environment
so if you change something here in the
code blocks immediately the program will
update you don't have to compile or run
you can it just runs while you're
editing it and as you can see it's very
very colourful very encouraging for
children to play with to make games to
make animations and stories music and
it's made by MIT it's free and
open-source so everyone can play with it
and you can also localize it so of
course most people speak English but
many kids Dutch kids speak a little bit
of English but perfect you can set the
programming blocks to be in Dutch or
Danish or whatever language you speak
and that makes it a little easier for
children to program so if you haven't
checked it out yet for your kids it's
really very nice so we did a second
experiment and now I got some fresh kids
not the kids in my
in a club he had because for after a
while it got sort of unethical to
experiment on children you're also
supposed to supervise on Saturday so we
went to a local high school wait some
fresh kids and we divided these kids
into tree groups so one group got nice
scratch coat nicely structured well
organized scratch guards the second
group got code with lots of duplication
so we repeated these puzzle blocks tax
in small varieties very much like you
would see code duplication also in
professional code bases and the third
group got the same scratch coat with no
duplication but with very long stacks of
blocks frame is like a long method we
just stack up lots of blocks together I
made it as messy as possible and then we
asked it to look at a game that we
programmed a breakout game so you have a
bat and ball and after remove some
blocks and we asked the kids to explain
the source code to us so a fresh source
code and never seen it could play with
the game a little bit and you ask them
what is this code doing explain it to us
both the whole program it also small
instances parts of the program what is
this specific piece doing and we also
ask them to adapt the source code a
little bit so for example the game would
run until five points now you get a
sound and they had to change it until
ten points only that you sound good
right and what we found answering the
question our code smells bad quick
interesting yes we found that the kids
with the noise source code did a lot
better on explaining and adapting tasks
so even in this small programs for
novice programmers they had had an hour
of introductory scratch before and then
represents them with the exercises of
the breakout game it does matter to kids
if there are codes males in their
program so if we all produce messy codes
if children produce messy code then it
does impact the understanding of that
source code if they read a door there a
neighbor or whoever is going to read it
so yes it does matter like okay maybe to
fade first maybe explore this a little
bit more so then I wanted to know
Artie's goat smells come
do they really occur in practice because
in this breakout game of course we had
inserted two code smells but maybe just
maybe real children would not make code
smells maybe they were all producing
fantastic could be you never know and
this is research at this point I was
like oh this is going somewhere
so scratch isn't only free and open
source itself but it also has a scratch
repository it's a little bit like github
where kids can share their programs and
they can also fork the programs of other
kids and adapt them in scratch this is
called rhe mixing but it's it's a
sensory the same thing as working and
this repository is also available to
analyze so if kids share a program they
agree that everyone can do whatever they
want with programs so if you see a
scratch program you could play it you
could also print out the source code or
download 250,000 scratch programs and do
some static source code analysis on it
if that's your thing well that's my
thing
so that's what we did we analyzed these
programs and we looked at what are those
programs how are they structured and we
found that 30% of the programs in the
public repository suffer from the long
meta smell which is quite similar to
professional source code smells levels
we also found that 26% of the program
suffered from duplication so code clones
number of different varieties of source
code spread over the program so it
seemed like these kids in need were
producing smelly programs much like
professionals and this could hamper
future understanding of these programs
by other kids as was demonstrated by the
previous experiment we also found one
more thing that was very very surprising
and at that point I couldn't really
place it anywhere in my understanding of
things but we found that only half of
the programs had user interaction so
only half of the programs did something
if you click the mouse push the button
made sounds and the other ones were
static programs innocent stuff was
happening but you would start them and
then they would use do stuff I was
surprised by this
lastly mm-hmm it's weird it wasn't what
I was looking for it sort of stuck
somewhere inside of my skull as a a fact
that I knew but I didn't really know
what to do with this and then of course
this paper was about exporting to Coates
miles away so I don't remember that but
otherwise I didn't really touch it
at this point you're getting this I
guess I'm like oh this is going
somewhere all these papers build up upon
each other not what I wanted to know was
can we can we make the world a better
place
can we explain children about code
smells and tell them that it's just not
a very good manner to organize your code
in a big stack of looks if it's possible
you should split it up because then we
would prepare the future for better
programmers and of course this is a
slightly selfish motif here because
these eight-year-olds programming
scratch in ten years they'll be in my
university classroom and then if I say
hello kids good morning welcome to the
University don't do coat smells they're
all like why we've been doing this
forever you tell me now it's like maybe
if I can tell them a little bit younger
that coat smells are a bad idea and
after a while in a very long time then
maybe all gets better for mature
students dream of every University
professor of course so that's what we
said to find out we wanted to know is it
possible to explain to children that
coat smells are bad so what we did is
we've created a few a free course on
edx.org a website that's normally used
for massive open online courses for
adults but they were open to the idea of
offering a course for young children
there and in the first run of this
course 3000 kids participated in
learning scratch online through YouTube
videos and exercises and we told them
that it was a programming course but
secretly we explained programming to
them but also coat smells and we
explained it like this is the way
programmers like they like to organize
everything they like to a clean working
space if you don't need your code
anymore you
remove it you will make comments what
early lying to them about what
programmers actually doing like but
watch for a good cause so just bear with
me there I told a message where
programmers do and we closed the course
with questions questions about
programming but also questions about
code smells so for example we will
present them with a program saying hey
here's a programmer one block is
redundant you could remove it what block
should you remove questions like this
where we could test do people really
understand or do the children really
understand what a code smell is and how
to fix it
well short story yes we can teach
children about code smells we found that
on average they scored 72 out of a
hundred points for the programming part
and 85 points out of 100 for the code
smells question parts so from this we
could conclude that indeed it was
possible to chew trained children as
young as seven kids in the course were
between 7 and 11 mainly we could teach
them about code smells they understood
it they knew how to do it
of course the open question here is if
they would actually do it if they were
free playing but at least with this
experiment we had demonstrated that it
is possible to explain to children what
is and what isn't a good way of
organizing source code so at this point
a year in I think since I started
working on this I'm pretty convinced
that this is my new topic I'm like
spreadsheets no programming for children
yes that is where I'm going so I thought
it might be a good idea to look back on
what I had done her research normally
goes at least how researcher pretends
research normally goes is you have a big
plan and you divide that big plan into
little chunks and then you execute the
chunks one by one and then you have a
big story but that never really happened
here because I sort of fell into it and
then started running so I never really
made a big plan of where am I going what
are the research questions I'm answering
I just started it to do something so I
thought after these four papers now it's
time to look back at what I did
and make a bigger plan to work on this
longer and this is when this water of
programming thing really started to dawn
on me
because looking back on all these papers
I had just written I realized that I was
making so many assumptions I didn't
realize I was doing it when I was doing
it but I was looking back I was like wow
you have a a small and narrow view on
what programming is look at all the
assumptions I made one of the
assumptions I made is the domain is
really irrelevant for this first
experiment where we wanted to see if
coat smells are bad or non bad I just
picked again when I was talking with a
co researcher that also worked on this
paper looking back in that decision like
did we even consider - to do something
else did we even think about doing notes
a game
no we just thought programming games
kids don't like it just assuming that
game programming is equally interesting
or exciting to all of all the children
in the experiments later this is a
recent paper that just appeared in
November of 2017 all the researchers in
Germany they told children free
programming for three days and then they
analyzed the programs that the kids made
and only three percent of girls made a
game so maybe in just ignoring the
domain we had made some kids more
excited about programming than other
games the other assumption and this was
it is big this or this nugget of
information that was still stuck in my
brain and it didn't really know how to
process I was assuming that software
does something I was so surprised when I
found that only half of the programs had
user interaction apparently because I
was assuming that a program without and
user interaction it's a weird program or
maybe even a non program or a fake
program however this is apparently what
the children were interested in rather
than making games that would of course
respond to user inputs they were very
interested in making animations
stories you just click a button and then
a princess walks up to a cake and says
hmm I'll eat this cake and the cake says
no don't eat me and then a princess says
okay let's be friends and then they go
these these are things that some kids
were really excited about making it
animation where there was no user
interaction at all so our perspective as
professional programmers making software
for a customer that most likely wants
something to happen if they click a
button is already only a small part of
all programming could be commercial
programming isn't necessarily
programming and the third assumption I
made is that building is learning when I
started the course the online course
when we designed that I just thought
okay I'm going to explain to children
where programming is by programming but
necessarily of course the only way that
you could teach program and you could
also say let's first reads from programs
together
oh there's first brainstorm on what it
is we actually want to build rather than
diving in immediately there were so many
assumptions I was making this is just a
few of them it's like hmm I really want
to be better at this I want to have a
broader view of programming because if
I'm really going to teach children for a
very long time I need to be as open as
possible on what programming is because
otherwise I'm like accidentally drowned
them in my water of programming rather
than having them show me what they can
do with program so one of the things I
started to do is I asked children in my
Saturday clip again what do you want to
build rather than coming within with
ideas my selves over it sheets of
lessons we downloaded from the internet
I asked the kids what do you love what
do you want to build and they come up
with the weirdest thing there was this
one kid in my class I will never forget
that forget this he says you know what I
really want to do teach I want to build
a website for the local supermarket and
you just have to like bite your freshman
cop friend that thing has a website is
it's a big international chain a million
like okay okay that's cool why so that
people in my neighborhoods can see when
the supermarket is open and I can make
pictures with my phone of everything
that's for sale and
really nice because some people don't
have to go to the supermarket to decide
if something is there they can just see
from their home ok we'll build that and
he was so engaged he was way more
engaged than in building games because
this is what he was excited about he
wanted to use his programming power to
make the world better probably for his
granny or mom or dad I don't know
someone that apparently was struggling
with knowing when the supermarket was
open it was just just shut up and listen
to what I want to do it was amazing
something else that we actually did is
Donald Duck so I don't know how this is
in the UK but in the Netherlands we have
a weekly Donald Duck magazine it's a
very popular magazine there are 17
million people in Netherlands and there
are 1 million Donald in magazine
subscriptions it is the mode I'm not
kidding it's the most read magazine
among 18 to 25 year olds it's very very
very very popular I have a subscription
myself I'm not I'm not ashamed to tell
you that
so this Donald the universe is something
is very well-known in the Netherlands
and a nice thing is it's a very rich
universe because in the same universe
you have different types of stories you
have Scrooge McDuck once more money and
goes on a treasure hunt to fight more
money let's teach children about
capitalism stories you also have Daisy
make Daisy Duck and Donald Duck can they
go on a on a dinner date and then
glamour comes in and ruins everything
let's teach children and healthy ideas
about romance type of stories Mickey
Mouse mystery stories there's a plethora
of stories to pick from so one of the
things we did in the class this is the
class is I brought these Donald egg
magazines that I have plenty of at home
and I let them pick a story to reprogram
in scratch so the nice thing is they
were all in the same Universal they
could exchange ideas and talk about each
other's plans but they could also be
very personal and what they wanted to do
some kids copied the stories to
perfection they really want to have all
the pixels exactly as in a magazine some
kids just do the story as a sort of
inspiration and
on their own adventures so it was really
nice because it allowed them freedom but
also a shared experience experience we
also tried this with Pokemon because it
was super hip at one points but not all
the kids had enough knowledge about the
Pokemon universe to really respond to
each other each other's ideas so that
was really nice about this Donald it I
also went to explore the idea of no
interaction
what does programming become if we
remove interaction so I challenge the
children to think about what what could
you make if it's no interaction so one
of the things that they come up came up
with was artworks
so especially Mondrian Marianna's a
Dutch painter who you probably know him
with pictures with lines and boxes we
could create such a program relatively
easy with scraps so here you have a big
classroom this is at the University
where I gave a guest lecture to young
children
ten eleven years old I had all of them
draw a memoria so we could look at the
variety of Mondrian that they could come
up with and then we together programs a
program that could generate as many of
those Mondrian's as possible for example
everyone had blue and the other one had
yellow okay that means that color is a
parameter
some people had lines like this or like
this but other people had land diagonals
as well okay that means that the
direction of the lines has to be a
parameter so by doing this we could
reflect on programming but also on what
exactly constitutes an artwork what was
interesting slash sad about this
experiment was these are ten eleven year
olds and they were they knew that they
would get a programming lecture but then
I gave them a sheet of paper and some
pens and I said draw a Mondrian some of
them are upset they're like this is
supposed to be programming class why are
you making us draw stuff this is stupid
they were already already drenching in
what apparently other people had told
them the programming was and we also
asked them what do you think is
programming for apps websites robots
there's nothing necessarily wrong with
that but already their view was pretty
small and they didn't really immediately
understand the programming and artworks
were something that actually matched
took some a while to see them and then
this final assumption the assumption
that building is learning that if we
want to teach children programming the
practice we're going to give them is
building programs it makes so much sense
in the context of programming but it
makes so little sense in other contexts
so for example go back to running which
I love maybe you didn't know this about
me but I love running so if you're
practicing running you're never going to
practice the real listen so suppose
you're training for a 10k you're not
doing a 10k every day that is not good
practice what you're doing is maybe a
longer distance 15k on the slower pace
what you're doing is 5k as quickly as
you can or with some interval training
you might also do weight training you
might change your diet a little bit
there's all these other things that
you're doing you're not training for 10k
by doing a 10k however if we're
programming we're practicing programming
by by doing programming why don't we
have all these small little exercises
that you could do that would also
definitely make sense no one thinks
doing some cardio fitness isn't going to
help your running even though they're
arguably really different so this was a
tough assumption what is the reverse of
building it's learning and I was
thinking for a long while what actually
is proven what is it and how could we
train it and how could we teach it and
at this point I was doing a sabbatical
you came bred so it wasn't a difference
environment hanging out with different
people thinking about it lots so it
wasn't really that I was just thinking
myself and this print idea hit me it was
lots of conversations we're really smart
people that I hang out with is like I
get it programming is like writing and
it's sort of weird but it also totally
makes sense to me at least because if
you're programming you have this high
level idea like for example an app that
tracks compliments I would really like
to have that if people say nice things
about
like sit it again so I can record it
with my phone you go from this high
level idea to letters and sentences
maybe in the middle you do some planning
you think okay these are the classes or
these are the screens of this app or
whatever you do some planning but
ultimately you go from a very high-level
idea to letters and numbers suppose you
have a high-level idea for a novel
something like a frog murders foreign
diplomats what do you do if you want to
write a novel about an idea you take
this very high-level idea you translate
this idea into words and sentences and
maybe you have some planning in the
middle some novelists use character
sheets or organizational sheets of who
knows each other and who meets each
other but ultimately you go from a very
high-level idea to words using some
technique so this idea struck me as
being very interesting hey I see the
similarities between programming and
writing and what could we do in it but
of course these spreadsheet hating
people hadn't really disappeared from my
memory yet so it's like people are going
to tell me that this is and
it's not real whatever they like just
like hmm
why is this interesting what does it
matter that programming is like writing
I mean if you generalize often enough
everything is like everything like this
is a thing I'm a thing
I'm the clicker do I click like you can
think about these things for a very long
time and lose lose any any relationship
with reality but this programming and
writing thing it did give me some things
one thing that it gave me is that
writing has some really nice ideas that
helps us reflect on programming in
writing you have this idea of two
different types of writers plotters and
Panthers and floaters have an idea and
they really think about it for a very
long time and then they write something
so the first step
is thinking planning making a perfect
plan in their brain and then writes
something I know these people exist
because my PhD supervisor is definitely
a plotter he could just sit like this
and then write a perfect paragraph it's
terrible but in writing you also have
these other categories people Panzers I
map answer
so what pastors do is if they need to do
something if you need to write something
they just said this is where the words
comes from they set on their pens and
they start writing so the first step is
just write write write write write write
write write
and then they rewrite and make it that
so maybe they give it to someone they
ask for feedback so these are two
strategies that are very different and
famous writers who put themselves into
categories they say oh I'm really a
plotter I'm really a fencer and this for
me only knowing this for writing already
made me feel better
okay this is a and other people are
fencers and it's not ridiculous that I
have no plan I'm just typing like a
maniac this is a type of person you can
be and it's also a valid way of working
so for writing it also made me better
but of course you also have this in
program in programming sometimes you are
fencing programming you don't really
know where you're going you're exploring
certain space you're just writing
writing writing writing changing and
sometimes you are promoting programming
sometimes you have requirements that are
really clear you have everything in your
brain and your writing and also probably
in programming there are people that are
more towards fencing and people that are
more towards clothing so this idea from
writing helps me understand not just my
writing style but also my programming
style
and other people's programming styles so
this is a discussion you could probably
have in your team maybe you're having
this in your brain right now you're like
my opposer at my appender my colleague
harry oh yeah oh he's definitely a Pence
right now I understand why he's always
committing things that aren't clear
because his brain just doesn't work like
that he needs to get it out first and
these metaphors that we use for
programming they're really shaped the
way we see
programming so I know there are many
metaphors have people say programming is
like cooking programming is like
gardening programming is like writing
programming is like engineering but the
final one programming is like
engineering is quite widespread in our
industry we often say things like I'm a
software engineer courses are called
software engineering we say architecture
we say scaffolding so this metaphor of
building and engineering is very much
spread to our throughout our fields and
there's of course nothing nothing bad
about that but one metaphor might be
very suitable for one type of person and
another metaphor might be really
suitable for someone else for example if
you're a brick making a bridge if you're
in this engineering metaphor that's a
very very welcoming
situation for plots or light persons I'm
making a bridge okay I have this bridge
in mind I'm designing this rich step
step step step and now I'm building this
bridge so the engineering metaphor and
plotter people go hand in hand that make
sense but if you're a fencer like me
engineering doesn't really fit you can't
pinch your way out of a bridge okay
we're going here for a little while okay
we just put the steel over the water oh
oh it falls oh yes yeah right snow ice
true totally I've seen that coming ok
let's try again it doesn't work so the
fact that this engineering metaphor is
so well spread throughout the community
probably makes some people view very
much at home and other people not so at
home because people that aren't able to
really immediately see all the
implications of architecture might not
really fit in a programming world in
which everyone thinks that engineering
is what we should be aiming for so in
this sense the metaphor we use the
metaphors we use really shape our fields
it's not this fun thing where you say
all programming is like engineering but
it's also like cooking dominant
metaphors really matter to how we see
our field how we see ourselves how we
see the ideal
view of someone that is a programmer or
a nurse or engineer and I found that
this language metaphor really helps some
people to feel at home and really helps
to place some things in perspective for
example with language comes the
assumption that everyone can learn it
everyone knows a language you have your
own language maybe you know a second
language even if you're deaf you might
know sign language if you're blind you
might know Braille in addition to spoken
language everyone knows a language and
this especially matter for teaching
children because in teaching children we
have this other metaphor note
Imagineering metaphor but the
mathematics metaphor if we keep saying
programming is like math it's like logic
reasoning with that metaphor comes the
idea that it's stuff that you have to be
born for it otherwise you can't do it
whereas a language everyone can learn it
so if we keep saying programming it's
mad maybe some people think it's not for
me and this is not a hypothetical thing
there's lots of research that shows that
the more people believe that a certain
skill is innate
rather than strains the less women
participate in the field so this is no
like oh this crybaby things it's hard
and they're dropping out it's important
because if people think ah it's not for
me because I don't have the right genes
they'll drop out so this is why I really
really really like this language
metaphor because to a way lesser extent
that with mathematics you know that
language takes practice if you want to
learn French even if you're good at
learning a language you will still need
practice and you will also need practice
for ever I had six years of French in
high school she dropped me in France now
I'll never get back you need to keep
practicing this skill and these are all
things that come with this language
metaphor it's not innate it needs
practice everyone can do it so it's a
really nice man
for especially when you're teaching kids
another thing that I really like about
this language metaphor is some stuff
makes no sense at all
in mathematics stuff makes sense in
language some stuff makes no sense who
is Dutch in the audience some people
okay oh you're so your speed - okay
that's good
so you'll extra enjoyed this example so
here's me this is me as a teenager
learning English so I like like my chest
I like Dutch that's a good language so
here I am
I read a book so my teachers like well
done Felina you are getting the hang of
this now the next sentence comes okay
I've read a book I've read a book
no no it's I've read a book I'm not sure
if you even know this but there are
languages like Dutch for example that
have a one-to-one mapping from letters
to sums
it's might come as a shock to you but
this is a thing that languages can
actually have we're an all and it
combines are always the same thing and
in an income when they're the same thing
if there's a matter in what words or
sentence you place then they're the same
thing so in a similar sense of course
some stuff in programming just does not
make sense why does the one language
have a semicolon at the end and the
other one doesn't there is no logic so
if you tell people this is like math
there's pure logic logical reasoning is
the skill you need for programming and
then you present them with absolute
logic maybe they will think hmm
this is not for me this doesn't make
sense so this language metaphor also
helps us to see that languages also
programming languages are made by people
and they're not perfect and sometimes
they're absolutely illogical and it just
doesn't make sense what you're doing so
that's another benefit I think comes
from the metaphor of programming as a
language that's especially useful if
you're teaching people it just some
stuff makes no sense you just have to
accept it so these are things for which
I'd say yes let's broaden our horizon
into not just saying programming it's
math and logical reason but also saying
programming is like a language that is
made up by people that sometimes make we
our decisions make me extra love Dutch
language so to close this off when I
have gone through this period of
programming it's like writing I was like
okay so now what can we do with that
because it's a nice metaphor and it
might make our community better but what
can we can create Lee do in teaching
children and it might surprise you to
know that there's a lot of research
about how people learn a language I like
I move into all these papers about how
do you teach language and we know so
much about how people acquire their
first language so much more than we know
about how people learn programming so
one of the debates
in learning and language is the phonics
versus the whole language approach these
are two different approaches of how you
should teach reading to children and
there are sort of competing schools and
some go in and out of fashion but the
basic idea is phonics is where you
really focus on the letters and the
sounds you first practice all the
letters and the sounds and only then you
go to words so for example you would
read this really as read
this is how you practice you practice
all the letters one by one and then you
get the reading skill the whole language
approach is putting things into context
the philosophy behind the whole language
approach is children like language
they're already in a language rich world
they can already speak so rather than
focusing on the mechanics of reading
we're just going to give them censuses
give them stories let them write even
though they can't write yet so did they
practice their muscle skills and after a
while you get reading so there are
competing schools and as you can already
see from this example maybe you
understand why the phonics approach is
it's very popular in the Netherlands
because we have this one-to-one mapping
and it totally makes sense whereas an
England whole language approach was
popular for a very long time it's now
shifting a little bit because you can't
really do the read because it depends on
the place in the sentence if it's read
or read but still these are competing
schools and then if you focus on
programming what do we do as programming
we very much focus on the whole language
approach we teach children programming
whole programs immediately we'd say ok
this is an if and how you place it in
the context now we're going to make a
higher lower game or something like that
but how would how would how would a form
X approach should look like in
programming
how would programming class go if
instead of saying we're going to make
this game and for that you need these
building blocks we would say here's an F
and before we move any further with and
thing we're just going to make sure that
you know what this thing is in any
context will give you this building look
practice practice practice practice and
only then you get to apply it I don't
know but it would be interesting to
explore how that would look like and
potentially again we're talking about
context and metaphors if we practice all
the concepts separately we remove some
of the context we don't have to choose
for the first lesson that we do a game
or a song or an artwork we can just
focus on the building blocks and see how
kids put them together so this is
something I'm really excited about
exploring can we teach small building
blocks without giving too much context
and this is more the whole language
approach and this is one of the things
this is in Dutch sorry one of the things
we're trying to teach children separates
programming blocks and have them
practice what a specific block means
this is setting a variable before they
get to apply it somewhere and you see
that this isn't even context-free if you
know Dutch because Penton means points
so it's already again directing a little
bit against we're trying to keep it as
free from context as possible hopefully
leading to the fact that children can
then come up with weird ideas like the
supermarket stuff that I could never
come up with another thing that's really
really really nice from language
education is we know that stages
children go to when they're learning a
language we know the things that they
believe to be true while they're
actually false
so children this is an experiment done
on three four five year olds they can't
read yet but of course they see language
all around them ads newspaper milk
cartons everywhere is language so we
know that they have hypotheses for
example children that can't read yet if
you present them with the words with all
the same letter you'll say that's not a
word they don't know they don't read
they have no clue of how to pronounce
that what it could mean they say no same
letter in other words they also say that
non words are words so they would decide
that bizarre is words
because it has not all the same letters
there are different letters so it must
be in words it looks like a proper word
maybe there is a human language in with
za is a word so they have a hypothesis
that that's words ok another hypothesis
that they have if they're reading
they're learning to read a little bit
further and I think ok in a word I hear
sounds like mama so maybe a letter could
present a sound that's the next
hypothesis they have and letter could
represent a sound mom ok that makes
sense so now they have sort of a
conflict of hypothesis because they say
mm-hmm could be mama but they also say
no it doesn't really look like a words
because it has too few letters so the
fact that these two hypotheses bump into
each other makes them form a conclusion
okay so I was thinking that a letter is
sound syllable but I'm also thinking
that a short word came your word hmm
so then probably I have to come to the
conclusion that letters make sounds that
letters represent sounds rather than
syllables so we know very very well all
these steps that children go to first
they believe this and then they get
another negative information and then
they believe that and then they believe
that and after a while they know
everything that they need to know about
reading so we are studying these type of
hypotheses now also in the context of
programming and in programming they're
commonly called misconceptions so we're
studying ways in which children could be
confused about programming and here's a
common way in which people could be
confused about program we of course
aren't but they take one second to think
about what this would print so some
novice programmers believe that this
would print five and also seven because
a common misconception about variables
that children have if you learn to
programming also by the way adults have
this misconception if they're learning
four
is that a variable can hold multiple
values but somehow this first value is
remembrance so we're thinking what are
things we could present to learning
programmers to make them quickly break
this hypothesis well there's a program
that we could show that they say oh wait
it doesn't work like that and just this
print thing probably isn't a very good
strategy because what we know about
misconceptions in other fields is that
if people have a misconception and
there's lots of scary stuff they tend to
hold on to the misconception because at
least that's something they think that
is correct so we're exploring different
ways of explaining programming here's
another common misconception that novice
programmers have so take a second to
decide what that would bring so some
novice programmers think that this will
only print zero because they think that
the loop stops as soon as B becomes
false and this is probably a
misconception that comes from natural
language where if you say while I'm away
you should do something then that if you
come back into the room immediately
people would stop doing it and is it
like first we finish this talk and then
you get to do it so probably this comes
from the world while meaning something
slightly different in normal language
than in programming language is another
nice idea of you know it doesn't really
make sense so together with my PhD
student Alan in Sweden we are studying
these types of misconceptions and also
what we can do to quickly alleviate them
so that people learn programming and
this is all based on this idea that from
language we have so much knowledge about
the type of wrong things that people
believe and how they need to follow in
order in a logical fashion because for
language we know that kids need to go
through these stages if you have
three-year-olds you can tell them
letters or sounds but it doesn't stick
yet they don't have enough knowledge
they need these phases to learn so
that's one of the newest things I'm
working on that I'm very excited about
so that's it that was my talk I hope you
have a great MVC before I send you
office of coffee
I just want to wrap up my talk in 1
minute so if you came in late or if
you're like oh so early it's your second
chance to get the most important things
from my talk first thing is listen to
your heart
it took me way longer than necessary to
realize I wasn't excited about
spreadsheets anymore I don't know how
you should do this but checking with
yourself
am I still liking what I'm doing I found
to be very very very important so if
you're not liking something figure out
why and don't just continue for a year
too long
second thing realize that we are all in
the water of programming look around
like look in this room see how
incredibly similar we all are in various
ways it cannot be that we represent
programming the fact that we're all so
similar we're doing similar things like
making software that we sell for money
it's it's only a small part of our
programming in so try to do whatever you
think in your community or life to to
figure out what else programming could
be for you or for other people and don't
be those people I'll be here all NDC if
I catch you no real programming to
anyone now find a well find out where
you live and I'll come to haunt you so
don't mean a people be the knitters
Beauty runners be like programming is
awesome everyone is welcome
third thing that's important the mechs
of course we use shape the way we think
about our field if we continue to say so
for engineering I mean it's fine I'm not
saying don't use it for realize that
engineering might be a welcoming
metaphor to some people and not to other
people so a diverse group of metaphors
is probably also going to result in a
diverse group of programmers and
programming is writing this metaphor for
me has made my life richer and more
interesting because there's so much to
reading and writing culture accents
languages countries this for me is a
very very rich metaphor that I hope to
work on for for a very long
and I hope no one comes to not real
programming me out of this love because
probably my generation will have pension
at 100 years so I hope it stays fun for
a very long time that's it I'm aunt
Vanina at on Twitter and Instagram - I
also have a blog Fleener dos comer i
also review programming sets for
children so if you're trying to figure
out what's fun to buy for your children
you might want to check out my website
I'm not doing Q&amp;amp;A because we don't
really have time but there's one
question that I always get I just want
to answer it people ask me how do you
make these slides so I have an Apple
pencil which is a nice piece of
technology in an app that's called
goodness good notes so just a shout-out
to Apple and good notes because they
allow me to do these awesome slides and
a special thank you to some people that
