officer flying 787
so last week I was in San Jose next week
I'm off to Baltimore the week after that
I'm off to India so I get around the
world all over the place as say under
787 fleet so but having said that I know
I said I sometimes do these talks
normally the talks I give a behind a
bulletproof door and I'm facing that way
and I can't see the whites your eyes so
I seem nervous a little bit worried it's
because I can actually see your faces
and cedar looks in your faces
so I'm not the best of public speakers
I'm trying I've listened to Dillon BC
saying you know more people should do
speaking these conferences which is why
I'm PS his fault so make a fool of
myself it's me making fooling myself not
any company I work for but me as I've
said my my day to day job is that of an
airline pilot for UK major airline my
passions code in electronics IOT i-17 a
lot more of that now and learning new
things I love learning which is why I'm
here in DC a lot of supporters here I
can see that I can help someone make
themselves better or you know they're
struggling I like to step in and help
out all that cycling ride a mountain
biking and family wife three boys two
dogs you can see my passions are coding
and electronics and things but the day
job Easter is the airline and flying
planes which gives me a unique as a
freelance developer advantage over other
philosophers I don't have to worry when
the next projects coming in because the
day job pays the bills puts food in the
fridge and the roof over the family's
head and the stuff that comes in form
development means I can follow our
passions that you learn new things and
do courses come to places like this
that's my office so that's the 787
flight deck you can see we've got
head-up displays so you know feel like
chakra and I sit in the right-hand seat
so I'm a senior first officer at captain
seats in left ANSI and I'm always asked
this after everyone comes out when he
got a little kind
so the control come can come back so you
can pull it back to all G if you need to
do a lot maneuver I your flying towards
a mountain or something he's never good
so aircraft's the - a aircraft
I delivered one of our - a aircraft took
from Seattle three years ago and it had
a bill price of two hundred fifty
million dollars that is just a bit of
paper we give to HMRC the actual real
price is something that the airline and
Boeing dream up and it's a bit like a
car you want mud flaps it's gonna cost
you
the seat I sit in that one there I found
out about eighty to ninety thousand just
for the seat it does nothing special
it's electric it doesn't remember me as
as the driver I have to position it
every day I go to work off if you so we
get some kind of cool views this is a
picture I took a while ago was racing
these guys across the Atlantic
overnights coming back from the US they
thought they want me close down in front
of us but we were lower and the lowest
aircraft always get priority because
they're not that descent it's like an
imaginary ten-mile envelope around the
aircraft so they'll have to come into
that so we beat them into Heathrow not
that we race on the left is a it's
constant Elmer as far as it says in the
text below if you've already read it
it's wonderful you see all these static
discharge on the main windows you're
flying along she's great it looks really
pretty and that wasn't me by the way and
this is a picture I found on
airliners.net she looking it's really
nice and then you think oh they were
about to get hit by lightning because
that's what generally happens you see
this an almost violent lightning hits
your aircraft
so yeah it's nice to see you have to
think through what's going to happen so
just some facts about the aircraft to
fly total onboard power as well ninny
what 1.45 megawatts it's enough to power
about 200 ohms even we've alder Wi-Fi
and tech that kids have these days
so five times more power informational
airliners so it's quite a lot of power
really but that's because you all got
your I think it you want to plug your
laptops in everything onboard the
aircraft is electric even the air you
breathe has not been through the engines
it's being depressed by electric
compressors that sit in the really
aircraft so there's no chance to be
getting oil in gestation from the
engines into the cabin air supply the
787 cockpit has been taken by Lockheed
Martin and Boeing and they've adapted a
little to fit on the Orion spacecraft
doing a space I'm really hoping to go
let me have a go I'm not sure that's a
we'll see windows someone said they've
been with someone who's been on the 787
he's flown on one yes you've seen all
the big windows and they dim it's kind
of cool and the cabin lights changed
colors and we can dim them and do some
rise so instead of the Cameron Crowe
just turn the lights on you hold on like
this and the lights car over a period
about 30 minutes so it naturally brings
out sleep it's another reason why when
you get off a 787 flight you feel a bit
better a bit more refreshed because you
have been jolted awake but they bang the
pots and took cups around wake you up
anyway but pain flies at Matt eight five
six hundred fifty miles now I found
normal cruise space I've had out to Mack
nine zero to meet an ocean entry point
it can go a touch faster the other day I
was coming back from well as it was
coming back from it's from San Jose he's
crossing it was about a hundred and
eighty mile an hour jet stream week
which equivalently job and even when
flying the aircraft is slow as it will
fly kind of dragging on the sky because
I was you get to Heathrow before it
opens and we had a ground speed of just
over 750 mile an hour which is kind of
Mac 1.04 somewhere on there because so
speed of sounds is Mac one at sea level
not the altitude we were out this about
Mac point one 104 it was at sea level so
quite quickly and as I mentioned earlier
and so on ask we have the smooth ride
technology on the wings and the tail of
the aircraft so the angular tack probes
at the very front of the plane so you
imagine the very nose kind of plane is
turning of attack barrel on each side
they sense the movement of the air so
they sent the air that a plane flying
through is trending up
they calculate that calculate the
opposite that tell the tailplane
which is yeah 60 meters behind it to put
the nose down so by the time the air
reaches the tail claim which is
affecting the pitied aircraft it's
already no doubt that movement maybe you
think you're doing 650 miles an hour
that 60 meters happens pretty quick so
over at Honeywell systems right that
bear code is pretty good I think
just as I fix a few other things be nice
so on the 787 it took me a while to find
out from burn engineers and the airline
engineers how many computers on board
and we basically took this as any
computer that runs code that's been
written for that computer so things like
your window blinds there's a little
microcontroller in there which is when
you push the buttons to open and close
the windows or the cabin crew can tell
the window to be fully open or fully
closed from the main console there's a
little micro controller and allocate
access we can add that as a as a
computer so I've got thousands on the
787 a lot computers make trillions
decisions every second but it's us
fleshy bits of sit at the front and make
the ultimate seasons when it all goes a
bit wrong so how do we work out what to
do well we have a little framework that
we use which is what I'm going to talk
about today all our framework to all
developers well not yet than the
JavaScript framework this one's a bit
different this is these days so this
little video here have you watch this
now before we take off we do any take
off anywhere in the world who is the
pilot briefing what's the weather doing
what state is the aircraft in are we
carrying any defects to the aircraft
because we're allowed to carry some
defense meaning it's so much redundancy
so many computers really loud you know
one meant if you're working but we can
carry on we can get back to it's a home
base we're always brief the departure
when we take off we're going to turn
they're going to do is climb to altitude
and etc etc and when it's brief the what
if what if the lift engine goes boom as
we take off what if the cabin starts
filling with smoke when we get to our
initial climb out a tune of 6,000 feet
so they'll you know we always talk about
the what is what when we do reason we
talk about on the ground or a cup of tea
nice and relaxed yeah when we got spare
10 minutes still waiting for the fascist
aboard and the bags were loaded he
starts that when we do have that
situation when were airborne we can calm
me we talked about this on the ground
we've already made decision what we're
gonna do is it any difference what we
talked about on the ground yes or no we
can currently go for our framework
without being panicked
because we really brief what we're going
to do these guys here obviously did this
textbook work and hopefully it should
play sure then you remember this but
those Tweety birds straight down the
right engine engine stays in the way
she say there they've got an airborne
and a bird down engine they weren't
expecting that when the government in
the morning yeah and their bowl of
porridge and a cup of coffee but that's
what they were presented with they've
briefed on the grounds which is why he
could say what their intentions were
cause it only briefed it on the grounds
it only talks about it this is what
gonna do grab an engine fail it will
carry on with the city go to wirelessly
climb maintain 6,000 Erin troll come
back give them just the bare information
they need to know all runways are
available and this is the wind don't
need to know anything else shut up leave
me alone
that's what they are trapped in try a
new care trying to do she's awesome
other parts of the world they'll start
talking to you and telling you all sorts
of things but yeah these guys went
Browns they dumped some fuel spent about
20-30 minutes in here come back nice
landing taxes I for engineering get the
aircraft over think we broke it and the
pass has got another plane and off they
went on their on their holiday now in
the next slides I added on the train the
other day because it occurred to me
looking at Twitter and you know my
friends are following me that aviation
as well in January nine years ago and
January 10 years ago these two instance
happens so I'm sure you remember seeing
all over the news and where you were in
the world you were seen it socially
Sandburg dish in the aircraft and Hudson
it's in geese taking fat at LaGuardia
and Pete Buerkle and the guys and keeps
getting his name John coward that's it
having the oh three eight incident at
Heathrow now the US Airways flights took
off hit the gate about fifteen hundred
feet they were told lots of things you
listen to the audio tape from air track
control they were give it loads and
those three instructions far too much
and when they were asking can we do this
can do that it's like you know negative
and those lots of you can't do that
because
and aircraft over here in UK they
attract all brilliant they will they
will sort with lots out the radar get
rid of them and you can do what you want
to do and they'll worry about that side
the end up coming around they could make
another one way they couldn't get back
because that girl engine failure so
ended up sticking on Hudson awesome
decision is fantastic work that day and
you know the only reason the aircraft
sank because they went through the
checklist for ditching and the last item
on the checklist is you know when you
get to 200 feet you push the ditching
button which closes all the little holes
around the bottom the aircraft which
normally is where the air flows out when
it comes in from the engines on the
aircraft
you guys breathe it and when you breathe
out yeah yeah carbon dioxide it's all
sucked out the back of the aircraft out
to atmosphere that enclose that didn't
push the dishing button which means that
little valve but the back of the
aircraft was still open which means it's
not filling with water and that's what
sunk so the manufacturer of that is no
bus a320 I've now moved that item a
little bit higher with the chest it's a
safe hand to sort of pick aircraft out
of the water
these guys here first they knew of the
engine is having problem because we do a
continuous descent approach into into
Heathrow first they knew it's about 700
feet just shy of 2 miles from the runway
they're doing 180 mile now so we've got
about 50 seconds give or take a bit to
make a decision of what to do what's
wrong that plane what we're gonna do how
we're gonna resolve it claps in Pete
Buerkle made an awesome decision that
day and made the flat leave them flat 32
flat 25 25 still landing flat but it
means that you reduce the drag so flaps
retracted just enough from top over the
fence and the BP petrol goes it's just
here on a thirty land there bounce and
then land there I mean skid to a halt so
yeah everyone got off everyone was live
on both aircraft so brilliant decisions
again I'm going to talk today about how
we made these decisions on the flight
deck and what we do now you can imagine
here when that happened to them that
happened to them and the Thompson
flappers before what do you think is a
first reaction
anyone so that's some swear to be goods
you're gonna be you're gonna be like
what the heck is happening I didn't
expect this when I had my coffee this
morning
yeah we call that our chimp response
yeah so you all got an in the chimp and
in the chimp rattles a cage and says get
me out of here I don't like this I'm
gonna go so we say case of chimp
she having inputs into the human being
the chimp sees at first just got the low
road and the human sees it second so we
say cage a chimp sitting your hands
wined you watch
take a deep breath another swig of a tea
or coffee don't react yeah feed the
chimp a banana do whatever you need to
do just just don't react instantly do
you do it'll be a chimp response which
means you know when you hear a loud bang
you'll jump that's a naturalistic chimp
response you grab a hot pan we'll drop
it yeah then the human kicks in don't
pick up that hot pan it was hot you're
hurt last time yeah so that's the
chimney spun the human is analytical to
thinking the cognitive function you see
sir Bradley Wiggins here they saw kind
of you know when his doing the Dylan
picks and the Tour de France who's
talking about the small gains
David Bradford isn't it and they use a
lot of this in their in their kind of
training to make sure you didn't have a
chimp response right hit the brake
gracious gone I must chase them no
because actually you're gonna wear
yourself out
think about it is it right to chase him
or not actually no it's not what catch
him later it's fun got another 40 miles
to go so it did a lot of this kind of
training and this is what we do every
six months I have to have my license
over to the training department going
the simulator for two days I did mine
week before last and hopefully pass the
same check whatever it is they fear they
could throw absolutely anything at you
you have to pass the same check they
sign your license and you back to you
then can go and fly passes again you
don't pass a simcha
you know you mess up the engine failure
after departure you get airborne engine
fouls and you don't handle it within the
prescribed parameters you don't get the
signature you thinking your license back
now your careers on the
the roof over the family's head etc etc
so there's a lot of pressure in that and
you could quite happily think of it as
been the chimp response I'm going this
Tim I'm really not happy but you get so
used to every six months I've been doing
this for what 15 years now flying planes
it's it's kind of no second nature going
this him now and practice my skills so
let's say a type of decision making got
naturalistic that's the the chimp that's
the drop in the hot hand here in a loud
bang next you you know where is a police
siren for Atlanta was I speeding
the first thing yeah you know 20 mile an
hour in a 50 zone and the first thing
you do is look at speed Oh was I
speeding well Chris I'm not but that's
in naturalistic response got the analyst
called the human taking a bit of time
being calm thinking it through get a cup
of tea then you got your wall base which
is the bit in the middle you don't have
enough time to be analytical you really
don't want to be naturalistic and the
champion bold but rule-based that'll be
where you have a checklist yeah and you
go through a checklist or a list of
instructions so to say naturalistic
pattern matching got lots of time trying
by experience you can train your chimp
daily see something you know we're not
going to do this we're not going to jump
yeah you can show which is where you
hear soldiers coming back from for more
zones and now have a lab bang next time
they won't jump because they're so used
to hearing loud bangs of war in whatever
war zone is it doesn't bother them the
view is really really really important
so if you do have a naturalistic bugger
jump yeah try and calm down take a deep
breath and get the human involved to
review what's going on why did I jump
where did I drop that hot pan oh it was
hot so I'm not gonna pick up again why
it's a good idea humans thinking it
through takes time takes effort you need
to climb yourself down first take a deep
breath before you can get the human
involved and you need to cage the chimp
is what we call it feed it a banana
before it takes over before it gets
panicked you see this craft any young
children if something happens they'll
get panic to start running around
crying and jumping up and down getting
upset he calmed them down you know tell
them something nice take their mind off
it and we use a framework called T da da
this is what all the pilots at the
airline I work for the trains and it's
taken from NASA from the Apollo space
program just we've changed some of the
what the letters are and I did the T at
the front because NASA didn't have that
which is the time and human can think
through options if there's group of
humans you can get more options so you
know it's always good to do these things
in groups that's why there's two pilots
at the front sometimes three or four and
I would say some in the middle is a
shortcut it's wall base it's quick it's
easy you just follow the checklist
decisions do intuitive because you've
trained them you've followed that
checklist every six months and you do it
religiously again and again and again
you know where it is someone else has
done the thinking the hard work you know
I said about Chelsea's son burger and
the ditching button to close little
holes that had been designed by many
engineers at Airbus the legal people who
were involved they got involved again
the legal people days after the incident
so let's move that out the checklist so
we don't have one of our aircraft
sinking to the bottom Hudson if it ever
ever happen again and a site shortcuts
your brains way of helping us you know
you come out to set traffic lights you
don't think about you know dropping down
the gears and applying the brakes
because the lights are turning red in
front of you just do it don't you yeah
just naturally do it without thinking
that's the ball base and the point of
train the near gym but a chimp is
involved it can take over you have to be
mindful of that happening so this is me
flying across Atlantic I've been up all
nights he's about four o'clock in the
morning Sun is just rising it's in the
summer decisions that me as a pilot have
to make most of them you know just about
the day's journey I pulled out five that
have happened to me in my 15-year career
so far there are many others but I
didn't want to put them on a sliding
scale off but stop by lightning you see
there's a chimp response a human
response we'll all basis months
who thinks chimp anyone see people three
for some hands who thinks it's war based
few more hands okay who thinks it's it's
the analytical human get involved nobody
okay I can tell you for now the
lightning struck the last time this
happened when she brought me up there
struck just there as our city and see if
it responds there was lots of swearing
oh God but then training kicked in I
took a deep breath calm captain was
wetting himself of laughter he thought
was hilarious
yeah and he took control of the aircraft
you could see that I'd just been kind of
shocked by what had happened so he's
that I have control
we choose fantastic that's the training
kick him in I took a deep breath Assad
off you oh yes new me dealt the
situation I've lost count how many times
I've been struck lightning it's I'm
getting our fingers you're ever an
aircraft have stopped a lightning don't
worry the planes designed today it's a
Faraday cage the lightning goes round
the outside the airframe it doesn't go
down the center if you think you've seen
something go down there our way it's not
it's the fact the Lions Graham in the
outside the eyes have picked up through
the windows so it feels as if it's
coming towards you or just to left
you're just to the right of you yeah no
aircraft have been brought down by
lightning engine search topic line who
thinks that's when you see those guys I
had it at Manchester when engine went
bang bang bang bang that's when the
internals engine have been damaged and
it's the air flows going the wrong way
through the engine so it keeps banging
misfiring bases just like an engine in
the car it's all climates just getting
there
clunk oh just handed our breakfast we
just said first fork full of food
hanging in the air costing around
brothers sky and you think that's a
chimp response a few hands human
response
analytical so I will based lot more
hands yeah it was that see first
response was
put a plate of food on the floor on the
tray our necklace and and yeah we full
base got an engine surge went through
the chest what it wants to do after that
it then goes to the analytical phase the
human right now what we're gonna do you
know we just shut down this engine you
know we're just somewhere over France
off to Zurich what we're gonna do now
you know that they we spoke to
engineering team on the ground and they
said we'd like you to bring it back his
gun is uric Halley they really want to
go there with a single engine because
well he was quite big and so we went
back to london heathrow medical
emergency just push back off stands
literally moves about 20 feet there
called from the chemical odor back
saying we can see the cab there crew at
the back of the aircraft giving heart
starts a just to a passenger in the
aisle way let's all dunno I'll get back
to you that's all you know do you think
that's chimp response well based a few
human response yeah it was a human
response actually it's not oh okay what
do you want to date him
he talked it through hard the ground
tugged I stopped pushing the air cards
put us back on stand because we want to
get medical help it's got you as we can
assuming this person I mean if you don't
pop stop seeds it's not good let's be
honest yeah we went back on stands got
the paramedics on board and truth we
have a those had all things what they
called the defib that's it thank you
they've done that and the kit we have
tells the crew what to do it says
charging charging and standby standby a
shocking stand back and it goes through
this whole thing and they shocked they
did that three times before the
paramedics arrived no paramedics said
that when they arrived they did a second
just for the family to prove they did it
right the first time and the primary
said he's never known anybody to the
heart start didn't at first I've never
known anyone in all these years
experience with a heart start to work
the second time they did it three times
we've got a weak pulse so you know
they're trying to just keep going and
tell the paramedic arrives even if
that's the mid-atlantic and they still
got four hours of flying time before we
can get somewhere to get help they will
just keep going Airport closed do snow
chimp responds rule-based few hands yeah
the human analytical and a few more it
was human analytical there's a little
bit really my car's parked they I want
to go home you know but other than that
it is yeah what we're gonna do we're
gonna go how we're gonna sort this out
having it passes to where we want to be
baggage system failure
early morning departure this is the
exercise that we're going to do at the
end so you pay attention this one here
you can answer this at the end of the
exercise so T Dada that's what I said we
use only whisper it in interest of time
this is the first one clicky thing start
working diagnosis so diagnose what is it
that's wrong what we trying to fix
options decision assign and then finally
of you did we do the right thing
have we fixed what we're trying to fix
have we got more time left can we do
this whole exercise again so time how
much time do we have is it an emergency
do I have that quickly do we have to
rely on our rules and procedures get the
checklist out it's an engine failure at
the surge can we make more time is there
something we can do to patch the
situation put stinky plaster over it
make us a bit more time so can actually
think about this properly a really good
answer
and we quite often use this thing
haven't got time for a cup of tea
we like tea so if we can push the
bing-bong button get the camera crew up
in a cup of tea then we've got plenty of
time we can calmly sit think about it
and if there's time for chalky biscuits
as well really really good so the first
thing we do is trained it's ingrained in
us if we hear one of the alarms on the
aircraft or we hear a bang or something
shocks us one of the things we do Robin
is sit on the hands one of the things we
do to feed the chimp he's pushed to stop
watch run it's just like intuitive if
you used to play me that the siren
master warning and caution signs from a
787 or any Boeing aircraft my first
response is to do that just because it's
eating yeah ingrained in me and you
always come back to T to see if things
have changed because you may have said
oh we got ten minutes it's fine you may
do something
reduces that ten minutes down to two
minutes yeah think about me cut the red
wire in a bomb in the movies and
something drops down by a few minutes it
also stands for team really really
important to team exercise it's not
you're on your own it's not you and your
colleague they've been given this
problem you and everybody around you
your whole department your company there
could be someone that seen this before
there could be someone's got more
experience in this than you reach out
for help give them a call text message
email the diagnosis what do you think
what's happening discusses the the
symptoms don't say well I think the left
engines failed you know discuss the
symptoms I look at the AG T on the left
engines gone really high and then one
which is speed of the blade at the front
of the aircraft as has almost stopped
you know we felt a big bang and we swung
to the left you know talk about symptoms
agree what the symptoms were that way
you can come to a really good idea as to
what the problem is you're trying to fix
another thing we're trying to do is one
of us to talk about symptoms and will
agree what the problem was I think the
left engine family yeah okay yep
why do you think it's not the right
engine then well actually because the
right engine eg teasing normal in one
gauge is sound about right the fuel
flows about right it swung to left as
well which means left engine failed or
my engines carried on pushing oh I've
gone to the left okay yeah that's good
enough reason yeah it works for me
and then agree what you're trying to
tackle right left engine fouled we gotta
fix that problem are you happy yes let's
deal without it yeah you see we've gone
through that systematically we took a
bit of time about it we talked it
through as a team yeah you're not just
jumped off all gone off in different
directions to solve the problem I do
this and girlfriend passionately cabled
just talk it through work it out and
this isn't the sort of thing you're
going to a meeting room and get the
white or book out two hours we're gonna
take our time and really sort this
diagnosis out quick punchy get it done
yeah
options this is a sort of thing you can
see sort of people in meeting rooms you
know option generation the whole kind of
they're brainstorming we're gonna put
everything down we can possibly think of
so brainstorm the options give me
another option if the rooms gone quiet
you know pick someone out if you're in
the meeting and pick someone out give me
another option what do you think you
know I often find when I've done this as
I served on these talks in a medical
profession with doctors and nurses
you'll often find there'll be a junior
doctor or a junior nurse at the back of
the room quite meet and sitting there
doing nothing I picked them out and they
have normally got the right answer and
it's perfect I've seen this many many
times where it's normally the quiet
person sitting at the back there's got
the correct answer or got the gem of an
idea so pick them out if you're the team
lead and your stand like fun just kind
of lead in this then pick them out ask
them what do you think no such things of
a silly idea
verbalize ever think your idea which may
seem silly let's shut down the right
engine that's it yeah you know might be
decieved an idea for somebody else might
be to see if their giant oak of a
brilliant idea which solves a problem
thinks is it don't drag it out again the
clock still ticking you've started your
stopwatch take your time go through it
nice and slowly decide she decided what
the problem was you've got loads of
options on your whiteboard in your slack
channel whatever it is you've decided to
make your list of ideas and maybe she's
verbal talking between you just saw what
you know though this is what we're going
to do to fix this problem okay once you
decided it decided again as a team you
decide this it's not the team leader say
no we're doing this yeah because if
you're on a team leading you deciding
saying you're Dennis and the rest of
team actually decided they want to do X
instead of Y you've lost your team
you're not going to get it done yeah
they're gonna go back to the desk really
you wants us to do this no so there's a
team decision make it a team Susan and
you'll find if it's a team that's made
the decision a team that's been involved
in the decision the team that's helped
generate the options who get more
engagement McGrath's a debt they'll skip
back their desks and be involved in
sorting this problem out
but the really really really important
bit is state the decision make sure
everybody knows what the decision was
including the person sitting tapping
away at their emails while you've been
making the season and doing option
generation checking their Twitter feed
and stuff
what this is what we're going to do this
will how we're going to do it and fairly
to decide is decide to file that come
from NASA you don't make a decision for
default you don't resolve problems even
decide what to do you can't you can't
solve the problem can you so just pick
one does it matter what one if you've
got two answers or decisions that look
as if they'll both fix the problem just
pick one doesn't matter which one you
procrastinate over it take your time and
think oh I really wish I had that bit of
data and it don't prove it's that one
well like I said earlier prove it's not
that one I gunned down the other path
and you see no could you soon have you
know and management customers clients
whomever it is that you're trying to
solve this problem for screaming and
shouting you do need one she will go
back down the path reset and go down the
correct path so pick one a assign the
task and this is the first time I've
really mentioned the team leader this is
the bit the team leader does yeah and
the idea of the team leader doing this
the fact that they know the strengths
and weaknesses other team they know
who's best at doing the you know where
is on the SQL part of some of these
Behcet's they're not a VM or you know
best with docker whatever it is that is
in your team you're trying to resolve
when you need they will know who's best
at doing that and who's weak at doing it
and they can assign the tasks
appropriately make the TAS short within
the teams kind of skill set so don't
give them a million one things to do
just give them right this is what we're
looking for you do but you can't just go
off and do that bit for me let me know
we've done that so I know where we are
in the chain of sorting things out if
you give them a whole list of things to
do use the team leader have no idea
whether they're struggling with the
first item or they're nearly finished so
if you give them like they go this this
this is what Ramon's are do this what I
need you to fix but do that bit for me
let me know you've done it
you know quick note and slack kept in
email click wit phone call
batten the door say no wait John I fixed
it it's not rice don't think well we
need get this done quickly I'm going to
do it as quick as I possibly can because
if you do base you'll make a mistake
we're human we're fallible we make
mistakes it could be why you're in this
situation to start with so take your
time nice calm methodical go through it
nice and gently
completely tossed away as you can don't
delayed him if you can't complete it
this is why I'm saying the team leader
must make sure that they only give out
small snippets at the task let me know
what the whole task is but small
snippets so you can see if that person
is struggling with the task they come
back a few minutes late and say I've
done that I've accidently go actually
before he did that big can you gonna
help you know Simon over there because
he's a bit stuck and I know you know how
seeking seeking reassign them sort it
out get the problem sorted quickly
consider overload if you see someone
still there at 10 o'clock at night
batting around the keyboard because
they're struggling yeah
consider the fact that I see overload
you got too much on the moment I need to
you know switch off don't have a drink
and are really really important bit to
review but everyone forgets bit at the
ends and assign the task to fix a
problem yes this goes to the pub and
have a beer no review did we actually
fix the problem isn't resolved is it
fixed do we have more time actually we
said we've got until Tuesday fix this or
we've got an hour to fix it we've got
ten minutes to fix it we've got five
minutes fix it
just look at three minutes left let's
see if it was the right decision
did we diagnose the problem again
there's the problem gone away actually
no it hasn't we saw edge place over here
okay what options we got to fix that and
your options would have change by then
because you would have started to fix
parts of the problem so go back around
the loop it's still good season and we
still been down to my part don't be
scared to change I see this so often in
teams that I work with when we go
through this to fact they're scared to
change their their ideas we've gone down
this path and it's nearly always the
team lead that you're scared to do this
so if you're a team lead in your
department for your company don't be
scared so actually you know what guys
skills
I've got it wrong we've gone down the
wrong path let's change let's do this
okay well you know and if you're in the
team and the team lead is lower you
wanting you down the long pass stand up
and punch it out
trust me they'll thank you for it later
they're not set your face or maybe well
you know I'm not talking to no but I
think they'll go home that night and
think I got they stood up and sort it
out for me because otherwise we'll be in
really big trouble yeah because they're
human so and earlier you admit to a
mistake if it was you that made the
server fold over and crash yeah I did
that mrs. Howe I did it because that
will help with the diagnosis help the
option generating if they know the whole
team knows what happened and why did you
hide behind your desk wasn't me so this
is ta-dah this is what we use stay in
they outs no matter what the situation
is from bags bags boxes and failing to
engine failures burst right captain Pete
Burr kill with these minute to decide
what to do before they they hit the
ground this is what we use it's a great
tool tried and tested in battle as well
it's it's brilliant but the really
really important bit you know how long
it took me to work out do that and
PowerPoint review review review and you
didn't get it review again so this is my
office
that's why I sit you see perfect
practice makes perfect
you're sitting there you're sitting back
in your office then wherever it is you
do day to day and it all goes horribly
wrong yeah hopefully you'll remember the
TDR model and hey going to do now I'm
aware that I've got time do we finish
this got 25 minutes left away yeah okay
so hopefully we got time to whiz through
this so it's a bit of a challenge it's a
foggy day at Heathrow so we're somewhere
down here now yeah it's foggy at
Heathrow the reason I know that that's
where houses of parliament are because
the thing that really clears fog really
quickly he's hot air houses of
parliament lots of hot air so it clears
the fog great so yeah you're at Heathrow
it's foggy and you've got 15 minutes
that's right decision so girl just check
how long got that you don't mind so what
your team do so we can get into little
teams you know however you want to spit
it up but if you can try and keep it
shiny say four teams that'd be great so
I think we split down an aisle that way
and the back half in the front half you
can just get together so 25 okay cool
no what 25 pass so I have 25 minutes 25
pass right okay cool so we get in teams
move around grab pen and paper and this
is the situation you've been dealt like
I said earlier so scenario it's 4:30 in
the morning Helsinki it's dark outside
the pickup with the hotel was at 3:30 so
your alarm call was just before 3
o'clock that morning and you're flown
back to Helsinki yeah so a little bit JD
a little bit tired yeah 150 passengers
boarding for full flights really high
club load that's the people to pay a bit
more for the bigger seats at the front
so you're completely full I put this in
checks complete so you don't have to
worry about the aircraft setting up the
data is having some who had a an
engineer in the flight deck we had a
small technical problem was trying to
resolve as well which added to the
situation and made things a little bit
more complicated we're in London as you
see it's thick fog the weather report
you're having fun to you says it's going
to last until around midday yeah so
never right and my office always well no
one wants the Met Office today no good
air traffic control advise you have a
slot of 14 of 450 yeah so we'll give it
10 minutes slot is basically your
earliest airborne time you're allowed to
go five minutes before or 10 minutes
after you've got 15 minute window to get
wheels off the runway that's when your
time is if you can't make that you miss
your slot you need to apply to central
flow management and Brussels for a new
one and they could give you one
sometimes afternoon waiting five minutes
time you don't know CRM which is
turnaround manager this is the person
who quite often sit he's very wearing a
red cap or you know down route they come
a minute
and so financing fish jacket and
headphone things captain captain
the baggage sisters fouled and the
engineers have called them on the way
but I think we're going to go about half
the bags I don't know yeah I'm gonna go
and see the loaders to see what's going
on still need to deliver to the aircraft
side and put on what you know
it's brilliant answer I like that yeah
he's Casey's chimp already he's done
that isn't he so yeah okay what you know
they not a lot but looks a bit so let's
start by getting into little teams and
talk about it I gave you the tee dodo
model have a think scary this inclusion
bit isn't it getting together make
friends
for you and they'll give you an
estimated slot which is when they expect
you to be given a new one it's never
that it's always later than that so
they've given you a new slot estimated
at 800
don't mind it's still 4:30 in the
morning so it's a long way away so there
you go so how bad we're can always lands
because the air carp and auto loans say
yeah you can land but the reason they
have flow management if you imagine
going along the m25 doing 180 mile an
hour supposed to speed we land at and
you're looking for Junction 11 so exit
because that's where you want to go
you're not really gonna see are you so
you're gonna slow right down as you
approach to look for it and that means
we spend longer on the runway because we
spend longer on the runway the aircraft
that's normally 40 seconds behind you
that's gonna land can't land because
you're still on the runway looking for
the exit that's the whole reason that
flow gets stretched out because you
spend more time on the runway
so to give us night vision goggles walk
off really quickly across money doesn't
it so there you go
yeah yeah that's that's the we can get
the slot delay is they look at not just
when London can next fit you in but when
all the other control zones on the way
can fit you in so they look at the
that's why they called central flow
management and look at the flow of
aircraft around Europe so look at
actually the Heathrow might be upset you
at seven o'clock but the control guard
it's it's in Paris is really busy then
so you can't deal with you so they push
your back
some more informations come through
you've asked what the aircraft doing
today so you've sent a message to Mum
back at Heathrow and said pretty please
didn't tell me what the planes doing
today you get a printout what the
aircraft movements are and it's doing
six flights today so it's a busy
aircraft most of short aircraft do six
to eight flights a day most of all for
150 passengers
it's just leading up to Christmas
everyone must go home or go and see
family so make that what you want
bit more info I'm just moving it along a
little bit quicker just so you got more
type of questions and a bit of fun right
very ends cabin cruiser is coming near
cups of tea and where they hand the
motors now catching by the way we've got
a group of 12 gold card holders
businessman off to London and asking for
the quickest way into London you don't
know which train it is they can get from
Heathrow to to wherever it is are coming
but also going now so the cabin crew is
still none the wiser because they're
busy sorting the passengers out so at
this point we told the Karen clear what
was going on I really I want to go home
take my boyfriends and stuff I hope so
yeah
say hello we knew as much as that on
long-haul flights yes I'm sure holder
all kind of bundled in together clearly
because it's just the way two planes
designed but on long-haul flights the
the first bags tend to go in a special
because it more of them so they go in a
bin of their own but I'm sure all
flights there may not be any any Club
passengers so we don't separate it out
really oh okay yeah a lot you thinking
bit more info I've gotten his name but
you come from the back of the aircraft
coming out captain
I've heard the fact that we might be
delayed because there's baggage problem
as a really big group of teenagers are
back and given a performance at the
Royal Albert Hall tonight and yeah I'll
let you know just in case it was their
stuff that was missing so erm was in the
flight deck of a time and says I think I
haven't seen any bands shake equipment
seen any big boxes so maybe it's part of
the kit that's missing
another bit of info the turnaround
managers just got a phone call from the
engineer saying it's gonna be at least
say two minutes when the motors was
burnt out on the baggage belt feed bags
out from underground and yeah we've got
getting motors to at least 30 minutes at
least yeah that's what they said we had
20 minutes but I'm sure I'm kind of a
bit shorter because I'm a aware of the
time got today yeah yeah yeah it was 20
minutes yeah I don't know did you start
watch I'm moving it along yeah so we've
got about two and a half minutes left so
yeah basically before we have to make
shoes know what we're gonna do
so not the moment no they do they
reconcile the baggage as it's been
loaded but they won't get that report
into the aircraft push back on stand
offs and so they they kind of know what
bags weren't booked set buzzed and if
that is the barcode reader says that
we've got more banking we should have or
we've got a bag that isn't in the
computer system tells them instantly
otherwise I reconcile it afterwards the
a team at the back there I've asked how
many flights Helsinki that day there was
four and just add insult to injury
you're just sitting there thinking about
what's going on and he started to snow
outside its Helsinki it's winter night
it does that and it's you call it air
trapping trying the tower and say this
this snow wasn't on the weather report
so yes a storm coming in from the north
yeah it looks like it's gonna dump a bit
more snow than the where there's a new
eight ish which is their terminal
information service which gives the
weather there's no updated ATC want to
grab it and yeah it said it was going to
snow quite a lot
it's a de-icing airbus a320 takes about
fifteen to twenty minutes
yeah we've got go in a minute
my microphone you'll see when I need it
thumbs up guys
what do you decide don't shout it out
there's an even better idea
what's your pH the passion is gonna be
okay
who is the team leader over here cuz I
like your hair there you go and well the
PA to our past passengers I just read
the instructions so yeah sorry yeah yeah
yeah so unfortunately there's been a
fault with the baggage moving thing it's
got a burnt-out engine so there will be
some baggage left behind however we will
endeavor to get this to you as soon as
possible we had to move because
otherwise you would be extremely late
you do it better okay you don't get
second chance they're all panicking now
so oh bugger hope it's not me who's team
leader over here then who was nominated
same there who started to stopwatch oh
you didn't yeah yeah I'm pretty certain
you heard I heard you say what time do I
say go okay there's been a problem with
a baggage loading system unfortunately
some bags have not been loaded we can't
be certain which ones they are we are
close to our slot if we miss this slot
will be delayed by a number of hours so
we've made the decision a hard decision
to actually make leave on this slot and
we will bring your bags as soon as we
can on a subsequent flight okay
we're not do this for the NHS with
doctors nurses we go in uniform as a
group Lister go along we put we hand out
a cap and whoever's wearing the cap
because it gets moved around by the
doctors no nearly always the nurses are
wearing the cap and yeah it's like they
got the cap on they get the microphone
there you go
who's team leader back here are you've
nominated one excellent they go you can
do yeah it'd be really good yeah and you
have found a Top Gun so we know you have
your inter plane so hello ladies and
gentlemen just a quick update from the
flight deck here we're pretty much ready
to go here and we are just closing up
the doors and preparing ourselves for
departure unfortunately you might notice
that the baggage that the baggage
delivery is not quite completed some of
your bags will be left here in Helsinki
and we'll hopefully be able to get them
over to London by the end of the day we
wish you a safe right and we will be
departing in a few minutes oh it's good
I like that one
he's over here that's gonna do it you're
pointing back that way so it's got with
you then it's not so yeah we decided to
leave a right few minutes yeah pretty
much from the same reason we didn't want
to which much I can't make what's called
the pilot voice even before because I
never quite understand what they're
talking about
we've still got the croissant stuffed in
the back yeah sometimes I understand
Perry's or 11 will be inter in two
minutes okay so yeah we decide to leave
because all the other options seem to be
like bigger cost for the company and for
I'm like for the image of the company
self like yeah okay cool thank you very
much you turn off now thank you
see all decided to go you'll decide to
leave you'll decide to leave the bags
Pines you'll decide to tell the
passengers now think about that for a
moment if you're a passenger on that
flight
and usually been told we're going anyway
this was set at the front yeah
the other options going to cost the
company a lot more money how would you
feel come on be honest
someone speak up how would you feel okay
and you did no use like that what's
going on yeah I mean telling the
passengers before he pushed back I think
you were had a riot on your hands
hey where's my bag okay I'm not going
down got my bag I'm down on holiday
who's been held for the cabin crew Paul
cabin crew have to deal with this yeah
so what we did what we decided to do was
go leave the bags behind as you guys did
we made a perfectly normal passenger
dress the passengers work on board this
flights going to London Heathrow spit
foggy in London you notice you're
starting snow here in Helsinki we're
gonna push back hopefully get out of
Helsinki before the snow settles and we
have to de-ice we're gonna make our
route to London will give an update a
little bit later of our time arrival
into London because of the fog there's
probably going to be some extra holding
place into a London Heathrow today sit
back enjoy the movie enjoy your meal and
I'll switch a bit later on
thank you and that's what will happen so
that would have been a PA that I would
have made on the day to them effects so
we got airborne flying to Helsinki spoke
to to mum as we call office back at
Heathrow what bags are missing what
passengers and they don't give names we
only ever go by seat number for depth-x
and walls because anyone can get an air
band radio and listen and they shouldn't
a text message space at least the
aircraft and a car that listed all the
seats that had missing bags it turned
out most of the bags are missing were
the band equipment at the back because
they come what they fail to tell us in
Helsinki it was that our gauge baggage
system that broken not the normal
passionate baggage system so it's all
the outer gates and the trumpet and the
trombone and Weishaupt stuff it's
missing so we knew this so we gave it to
the guys at the back of the aircraft
said why it's mostly you a lot he went
and found that the group leader for the
band and said by the way you know your
bags have made the flights their books
on some later flight which is at midday
when they arrived in London where would
you like the bags taken are you going to
wait for them at Heathrow actually we
were lab hall if you could deliver them
there be great ok let's come back back
in the flight deck we've got that
message
you spoke on the radio a bit closer at
London us we've got radio contact and
said the missing baggage is for the seat
group ins and gave them the range can
you arrange them to be taken to their
final destination tonight which is the
world about Hall excellent
got there everyone was happy yeah the I
went back with my cap on and as a do
stand by the door and say goodbye to 150
people thank you goodbye thank you got
to the band lot they were happiest
people I've seen in a long time and this
week it's a young girl she must have
been 14 15 she plays that big cello
that's it so each other she plays that I
mean how she lifts the thing I don't
know she was over the moon but it's now
been hand-delivered for her so she
doesn't take up an underground
doesn't got worried about it on the bus
it's being taken for her she's over the
moon she's just a tea
everyone got off happy so you can see a
framework like tea dotar isn't just used
for when we have an engine failure and
it all goes pop bang whiz
we have a lightning strike can be used
in any situation like you guys have just
used there to solve a situation about
baggies equipment and a bit of time
pressure that's added in and you know we
had an engineering issue as well which
added to the problems which thank you
we've got resolved and we got underway
so that is me that is my job when I'm
not punching code
I get to fly plane around the world and
get to visit the world I'm mindful of
fact there's only a few minutes left but
if anyone's got any questions I'm here
today and all day tomorrow feel free to
come and find me baby now shut them out
no thank you
just say no I thought ahead so I thought
heads and thought the time is nothing
else I've taken all the red and yellow
stickers away can I put green in the box
brilliant thank you very much thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
