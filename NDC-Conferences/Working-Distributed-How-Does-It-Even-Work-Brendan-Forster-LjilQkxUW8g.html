feel some time while we wait so good
morning everyone and welcome to NDC day
to thank you for being up so bright and
early and coming to attend my name is
Brandon Foster and I come all the way
from Australia yes I will do silly
Australian freighters for you whenever
you want but that's not what I'm here
for today so if you guys are on twitter
or github my handle is shift key I work
at github as a senior engineer and I've
been together for almost three years now
what was interesting about github was it
was my first real remote job and there
was a lot of learnings and a lot of
mistakes that I've made it along the way
but ultimately i really enjoy the
ability to kind of work from wherever I
feel like and so that's kind of what I
want to talk about today so currently
github itself is about 580 people this
is a little screenshot for Mary internal
one of our internal apps and you can see
that we are scattered around basically
various parts of the world all up we
have think technically 321 remote people
and we consider remote to be not based
in San Francisco so give or take as
people move around that's probably
better fifty-five percent of the company
so I'm one of those people I've been in
Europe for the last month doing a couple
of talks and working but dune and I'm
kind of based in Australia so to kind of
break the ice a little bit I'm going
back to a joke that was made a few
months ago the willing to relocate to
San Francisco mean that was going around
the place lots of people had a lot of
fun with us but the actual roots of this
were in a joke so information
superhighway you know the grand promise
of the internet being able to kind of do
whatever the hell you like but we're
still at the situation people want for
working tech companies to relocate to
San Francisco and my heart just breaks
this one here I won't name the company
that's being made fun of but you guys
can probably connect the dots and so
once this happened everyone kind of got
into the groove of things and everyone
had a lot of fun and the whole point
that was missed there that we didn't
question why this is so I do know some
people at so so called company yes it's
it's fine
so anyway this is a talk about my
experiences of being remote and all the
stuff that we've learned being a remote
team at github I have colleagues in the
US and Europe so we have iterated all
the stuff over the time and ultimately
we believe it's a successful way of
doing work but the three things i want
to focus on today are how you would
support remote workers in your company
what's like being a remote worker how do
you actually do your job well when
you're not in the office and distributor
teams because of all the fun of time
zones there's a whole bunch of extra
stuff that we've had to learn over the
years and I kind of want to share that
stuff with you so lots of people have
tried doing a remote work and lots of
people have told me stories about how
things have failed to give you an idea
of like how easy it is to fail are doing
the stuff I'm going to tell you a little
anecdote so here's a team of let's say
for developers they all work in the same
sort of office they share cubicles open
offers planned sort of thing they all
talk to each other they don't really
need to kind of do any fancy tooling
they get stuff done and ultimately there
are happy team but then a curveball
happens Bob one of the people on the
team is going to become a dad and so he
says I would like to kind of work from
home and support my wife and new child
he goes up to the bosses and he says can
I do this they're like sure yo go nuts
take your laptop home and so he does
that he moves out from the office takes
his gear home and he's doing his job you
know in the spare room at at home the
big problem here is that nothing else
changed about the situation sigh from
Bob relocating home the normal
day-to-day stuff that happens the office
is still there Bob's trying to fit in
with the team but ultimately it is not
feeling like he's a member anymore so he
gets sad he's concerned that the team
doesn't know that he's actually trying
to work really really hard on stuff he's
also missing out on discussions and
important decisions being made he's just
he's not feeling like he's a part of the
team anymore of course over time as
these stuff things don't get resolved
Bob gets sadder morale is Morales down
it's yeah it's a shitty sup but she spot
to be in cool
flip sila is that the team don't hear
much from Bob either he's is you know
they believe he's around they think he's
doing stuff but they don't really know
they get angry at Bob and ultimately
because of this communication breakdown
either the experiment fails or you know
or Bob quits or gets sacked it's so easy
for the stuff fail because we assume
that we don't actually need to change
our habits so rather than getting so sad
about that I kind of want to reframe the
situation so there's two phrases that I
like to hear being mentioned when we
talk about remote working so remote
friendly and remote first I like the
latter term because it's actually really
really strong it emphasizes that you
know that this is a problem and you do
really want to take steps to address it
whereas lots of companies will say that
they are promote friendly so let me use
carrot and stick and allergies to kind
of go through how you would sell the
stuff to your boss so show of hands who
works in an open office plan that is a
lot awesome how many of you like working
in open office okay so about two-thirds
their hands went up and then I reckon
about a half of those hands went up for
actually liking it yes they're up
efforts to a openoffice plan in
particular being able to kind of work
alongside your colleagues and work
synchronously on stuff that stuff is
very cool but how many of you actually
own a nice pair of noise cancelling
headphones there's my hands so
programmers hate open office plans
because of distractions I own a lovely
pair of noise cancelling headphones from
my days as a consultant and I definitely
use them a lot you might think that it's
not insignificant amount of time but
there are some surveys out there they
kind of dig into this so this was from a
company called get void they pulled
together all these details about the
downsides of openoffice plans and for me
these stats were just amazing so about
quarter of the day you spend trying to
get into the zone for people like
programmers and those people who are
very detail focused and needing to carry
a lot of information in their head you
can see why they kind of hate open
office plans distractions every three
minutes I do remember those sort of
distractions coming up I didn't realize
it was that bad
but ultimately the last step that I
found only I really really loved so 75%
of distractions are totally unrelated to
your work this is the sort of
environment that we kind of tolerate
let's put it that way they're also
various monetary downsize to all these
distractions how you would scale that
out I think this is based on us data but
ultimately we deal with these costs of
doing work and we don't really question
why we do that so that's the stick side
of things let's talk about carrot so by
enabling remote working as an option
there's all these tangible and
intangible benefits that come up people
are actually more productive people
happier and healthier and there are
benefits to the business as well
everyone kind of assumes that because
you're working remote you're going to be
slacking off but that's not really the
case so what sort of things do we have
people who are working remote and have
the ability to kind of work on
interesting work will be more productive
for fields such as call centers or ones
you might not necessarily associate with
working remote they actually get more
work done than their colleagues who are
based on site morale also helps with
remote work so people will work harder
when they are happier they'll work
longer when they're happier these things
actually add up but I also love the non
work related benefits that come up when
you are working remotely who likes a bit
of an extra sleep in on the weekend
that's it that's it the fact that you're
no longer commuting definitely opens up
like a whole bunch of your day for other
things I love that step down below here
that when people are commuting longer
things get things in their lot of
personal lives impacted the ability to
kind of say like yo I'm no longer
commute hour half a day these things
these things are a flow-on effects from
not having to commune business side of
things it is kind of easy to quantify
the ability for people who are working
remote to save businesses money
this study comes up favorite won't get
to that last one so less office space
less electricity costs smaller office
spaces the ability for people to work
remotely leads to lower absenteeism you
know people are taking stress leave or
taking significant time off work that
stuff goes down when you have a bit more
of a flexible work routine retention of
staff also comes into this having the
ability to work remotely is appealing
and you can also bring in new people by
supplying this option so this study the
last link there was from Cisco's
internet business services group they
did a study on working fifty percent of
the time with two thousand people across
six or so countries and they found
significant benefits like there are
these options out there and we just kind
of neglect them so let's say that sales
pitch worked with your bosses and they
want to kind of dig into how yeah you
laughs how you would support remote
working what sort things do we need to
think about so the first thing I'd
suggest thinking about is what gear you
need to do to get your job done for most
of us who are programmers it's fairly
straightforward you know need a laptop
sort of thing but there's also other
things to keep in mind do you need to
access work systems are they going to be
available outside the firewall their
specific processes like VPNs or
something that you need to use if
they're if they're not there we got to
talk to whitey and ask beg grovel
whatever fer for that access to do your
job what about if your devices get
stolen what's the process for that data
sovereignty and things like that they
come up hopefully you have the ability
to remote wipe a device like these
things are out there but generally IT
might not be such a fan of implementing
it and yes I have dealt with a whole
bunch of IT departments in the past who
have been fairly conservative with their
thoughts hopefully it's gotten a bit
better since those last days but
ultimately it be nice to kind of have
them come to the party so the other
thing that is important when creating
remote culture is
the culture side so when you're in the
office and all working with each other
and all the stuff there's yo various
things that happen which are rather cool
beer o'clock is probably one of my
favorite things because it's on a friday
yo random discussions to come up like
all this stuff happens organically in
the office how do you go and recreate
that in a virtual aspect so a fun fact
if chat was not a such a thing at github
I probably would have thrown in a remote
work a long time ago for us everyone is
in chat everyone is hanging out there
doing work and not work the ability to
have everyone in one spot has been
amazing for my sanity and just the
ability to kind of feel part of the
organization and yes you might think
that people use it for slacking off at
times we have an Australia chat room
that all the Aussies hang out in and no
work gets done there lots of been
appropriate jokes that sort of stuff yes
check can be used for slacking off but
that's a part of the puzzle you know the
watercooler aspect of the classic office
you can recreate in chat I will also say
that chat is not a replacement for email
but oh have another rant about that in a
little bit so we slack a github we use
campfire before that I don't really care
what stuff you use for chat but I want
to call that that the client should be
available on all the platforms so that
everyone can be included so we've set up
chat we have set up slack and we kind of
just like let people go off and organize
themselves however they want I wanted to
call out yep I wanted to call out these
are the sort of rooms that we set up and
chat so it for organizing projects and
working together will spin up specific
rooms and all hang out and there will
also have social rooms for you know
whatever hobbies or interests people
have outside of work the region based
stuff is interesting so we have support
people who are scattered around the
world we have offices in air today and
Tokyo and Colorado and we let those
people organize themselves
geographically I mentioned before the
Australia room I hang out in that one
despite not being
Australia that often yeah and also want
to call that Pratt there so there are
times when you do need to have chats off
to the side but for the most part I can
see them to be in the minority of things
so for more information you are
discussing publicly with people the more
that everyone can get onto the same page
so the other cool thing about having
chat you're plugged into having everyone
in chat is that we can integrate other
systems so this is a page from slacks
just integrator sort of things just to
give you an idea of what's there so we
have build systems we have just yep
other sorts of pieces of information
flowing through our chat of course these
can be noisy so I definitely recommend
experimenting with it and trying stuff
out but we also sell specific rooms
where the chat integration is off to the
site so humans and nonhumans like that
that's sort of the stuff that we do and
if you've been living under a rock for
the last couple of years github has had
a project called cubot going cubot is
our a little bit of a robot Butler let's
pull that way he sits in our chat rooms
and we tell him to do stuff the simplest
way to kind of explain that is with this
little demo so this is my colleague
Andrea asking cubot you know where is
everyone in this room and because we are
all scattered around the world it's easy
to ask Hubert than to ask everyone else
so the dot there is our token to tell
Hubert like this is a command you should
be looking at Hubert goes off he checks
some things and he returns with lovely
summery so he's found a few people who
are in the room further down the page
he's drawn us all on a graph all this
stuff was automated all the data was
already there we didn't have to do
anything manually so what's fun about
this is that it plugs into my fort
workout so as I'm traveling around the
world I'm punching in a coffee
conferences whatever that sort of stuff
that then flows back to our internal
systems and so who bought then knows my
most recent location this stuff is
really nice because it's again we don't
have to think about as stuff just works
and people don't have to ask me where
the hell I am they just go and say where
is
so I really like Huebel as a concept
because we plug in everything into him
we let him do deployments of software we
let him set up infrastructure we let him
do silly little things like remember
jokes we have teams other teams of stuff
build their own customizations sales HR
support they all have your integrations
rather than having to do stuff with
manually or do stuff as a human we set
that up so Hubert will do it and then
everyone else can do it so while I mean
who talking about slack I'm going to go
off on a little bit of a tangent so I've
been no familiar with a chat and team
chat for all my time at github and as
everyone has gotten fallen more in love
with slack there's been a theme of
people falling out of love with slack
they look at things like information
overload distractibility and just the
fact that you find yourself in there all
the time I don't believe that's a fold
of slacks itself but it's kind of like a
fault of like how you use slack so if
you've ever complained about having too
much email I think the same problems
with email you will have with slack so I
think this is like a disability thing to
manage and I'll give you some tips that
I've learned from having to deal with
slack so I think at this point I'm in
about 20 different rooms and on the
github slack instance it's it's noisy
but ultimately like yeah for the most
part I keep things simple so important
rooms that I follow I focus on them
everything else is just kind of thrown
into the background remembering that
chat is asynchronous no matter if the
person is actually online the ability to
kind of just distract someone is
definitely a thing and people will leave
slack running all day which is ok but
also knowing to kind of shut slack off
when you need to get some work done i
think definitely helps i have to throw
in some more gifts so the concept of
fire hose lots of people who get started
at github will describe their first
couple of weeks as drinking from the
firehose it is totally true
there's a whole bunch of stuff going on
that people will feel overwhelmed about
this is happening beautiful yes
discipline and knowing when to shut
things off and get work done I think
will help with managing this stuff
another little anecdote I was I took a
month off in Japan and I thought I'd
disabled slack completely a notification
got through to me and I just got angry
because I was really in the mood for
avoiding work I had a chat with slack
support team and they were like oh we
had this thing coming up is cool do not
disturb I'm like cool when's it out so
it came out a couple months later but
they have the ability to snooze your
notifications for a period of time or my
favorite feature is setting a time
period so midnight to 7am I disable all
my notifications that's good because
there'll be a whole bunch of stuff
happening in the US and I will just get
spammed overnight so I set stuff off I
sleep really well I also found this
little nugget recently mark Wohlers red
is available for slack shift escape and
just move on with your life every of you
I've there is I generally look at just
like notifications that mentioned me
Orca specific keywords and for the most
part I will just close stuff out and
just move on like it's it's okay to let
slack kind of just go into the
background so on top of chat we use a
video conferencing stuff the one that we
use at the moment is called blue jeans
and so every github person has a blue
jeans URL that they can then share and
do video calls so this is me looking
very grumpy as like seven in the morning
or whenever it was having a chat with
some of my colleagues Marcus is in
Sweden a muse in New Zealand at the time
josh is in New York so we're all kind of
like up and about but ultimately we just
can try to catch up and talk this is the
point when we were doing like weekly
hangouts around a certain project and so
it was good to kind of just hang out on
top of our regular chat we also do
things like of course 12 ones with
bosses sort of thing we also have like
book clubs and reading of academic
papers we do that stuff via video
conferencing because the real time
aspect of it is
really rather than us and the thing that
I really like about the blue jean stuff
is it doesn't require a login so i can
give this out to people who are outside
of github and they can participate
without having any friction internally
we also do a whole bunch of recordings
for events we have dedicated AV team who
will stream out stuff that happens in
the office and also record it the
benefits for this is that I despite not
being in the office or even in an
appropriate time zone I feel like I'm
still part of the company because I can
catch up with things after after the
fact we also do things like Q&amp;amp;A so we
ran up a little thing called commish he
we can send questions in whether we are
in the office or not and they will get
fed through to whatever event is on now
basically building out the stuff so that
remote people can be part of the the
company is I think really important to
ensuring everyone is on the same page
the events that get published up will
turn around like a couple of hours sort
of things so it's it's really fast and
really helps so this was like my first
week at github I ran into this guy
Maddox he did a little talk the fact
that information is easily linkable you
know the classic sort of a hyperlink
sort of stuff means that things can be
disseminated shared around discussed if
you're in a traditional sort of work
environment quite often you'll have to
make a sharepoint joke here sure so your
sharepoint server things go in there and
they don't necessarily come back out
having everything driven from the
website of things I think is really
important so slack discussions can be
linked to from github issues dope issues
can be linked to from show notes for
events having the stuff that we can kind
of share around means that it's kind of
available for everyone whether they are
in the office or not so I'm going to
talk a bit here about the github side
there's some interesting things that I
thought things that I think are
interesting around how these guys
how we organize ourselves so one of the
things they look after at github is the
desktop app so this is the desktop team
at github we structure things so that
they're reasonably easy to understand
and so you should be able to find the
right team so if you need something from
the desktop team you just mention it's
like that and that's what it looks like
inside a github issue this one was so
bold text indicates of the veil team
someone can click on that and see the
members of the team and the notification
get sent to us fairly straightforward
but we have a lot of teams in a github
these are a few of the other teams that
I follow let's put it that way technical
support windows the API side of things
we're allowed to kind of jump in and out
of teams that are relevant to our
interests I cover a fair bit of stuff
around the windows side so being on the
windows team definitely helps where have
restrictions on what teams you can join
it's up to you to kind of opt in and out
of that the fun side of this is
accessibility just there are all these
teams that pop up around little niches
and so we can then pull them into
specific issues so rather than
mentioning specific people on a team in
an issue or a PR we mentioned teams so
everyone who gets a notification can
then jump in and help out for teams that
are scattered geographically this is a
greater kind of spit a great way to kind
of speed up the process the other
important thing when you're mentioning
your team is to give context so that I
know whether I actually need to go into
this issue or what you're expecting from
me coming back to this original example
here it's it could be okay I've obscured
the context there for sanity but
ultimately maybe the desktop Team just
needs a heads up on this maybe there's a
whole bunch of stuff that we need to do
that isn't quite clear the context
around when you kind of pull in another
team I think is something important all
right so we'll talk about the tooling
side of things we've just got this we've
talked about getting the business on
board let's say that they are they're
happy for you to go ahead you've got the
permission to go and work remotely what
happens next
so another gif I had to include getting
started with the remote book does sound
glamorous no the ability to work from
home on the couch not even having to
wear pants no one's checking your desk
we do there at 9am the commute from the
couch the bed to the couch is fantastic
all of these things yes all right first
development power they all sound very
cool but it's it's it's an easy trap to
fall winter so this was a paper
infographic that was published by the
office apps team office 365 team they
were celebrating the way that their
tools could be used everywhere and for
me he this kind of hit home a whole
bunch of stuff that I have done around
working remotely that are kind of bad
all this stuff around always being
available working weird hours destroying
work-life balance and stuff like
technology enables us to do this and so
i'll show you the stuff that i've done
that kind of lines up with this
infographic so that first one there
nineteen percent of people have worked
when going to the bathroom i have not
done this I there is just a line there
that I care across a third of people
have worked to or from the commute yes I
have done that forty-seven percent of
people have worked when they were on
vacation yes I have done that for was
the one is twenty percent appearance of
said they worked at a kids activity I
haven't done that but that's because I
don't have kids twelve percent of people
have worked when they've been out eating
so dinner date phone buzzes someone gets
it I have done that but that is
definitely one of my pet peeves these
days when people do that again work-life
balance separation been there done that
forty-four percent of people have worked
when watching TV yes I have done that 27
people will have to work when they've
been in bed yes I've done that all these
things can creep into your life when you
have no boundaries between work and the
rest of your life and of course if these
things continue the unresolved it altima
tlie leads to burn out I had a nice
little crash last year let's put that
way
it's absolutely shitty to deal with but
setting boundaries around work versus
life definitely helps so my first advice
for people who are working remotely is
to have a routine treated like a normal
day you may not be going at the office
but still think about it in that way
working from the couch in your pajamas
is cool but it's it's not healthy that's
by the way things like eating at your
desk over lunch because it's going to
shorten the day don't do that actually
take a proper lunch bag shut the laptop
and go somewhere else to eat the cool
thing about being able to kind of work
your own hours is that you will kind of
slack off you do a bit of work here but
work there but work there and before you
know it's eleven o'clock at night and
you don't seem to have done anything if
you're familiar with the Pomodoro
Technique of 25 minutes of work five
minutes of break repeat repeat repeat
try something like that structure your
work day out hopefully you'll get a
whole bunch more done but at the end of
the day and you'll feel less inclined to
come back and work in the evenings again
another thing that I kind of was
terrible at was having a decent place
for work so 2015 I kind of went nomadic
and jumped around between conferences
and traveling and all that sort of stuff
and I never really had a desk so I would
work from hotel rooms or or people's
couches or things like that having a
workspace that lets you get stuff done
means you have you know the space for
work and then you leave the space so
Charlotte detroy is this your space now
Troy or is it something else old house
cool so so back when Troy was in Sydney
this was his workspace it might look
ostentatious having four months and all
that stuff but Troy took some time out
to invest in what he believes would be a
productive space I would definitely
recommend doing the same you also had a
nice chair I think that was being
discussed like this that you're going to
be there for a lot of the time each day
make it actually a nice space the flip
side of this working from home is that
it's easy to get isolated and I was kind
of fortunate living in sin email that I
had a lot of contacts and the local dev
community so it was easy to go out to
usergroups got a co-working spaces
making sure that you kind of get out the
house and remain a functional member of
society is I think important one more
lucky gif in there Jack Nicholson from
The Shining just yeah I know that mood
it's it's not great no no it's it's not
great being that character alright so
we've gone through the remote side of
things we've gone through the tooling
we're now we're looking at expanding out
our our plans for world domination so
distributed teams deal with time zone
related issues on top of everything else
so they're still remote like they're not
working the same space but ultimately
they're a lot more distance so there's
things that kind of keep in mind well
that we've learned from our experiences
around being a distributor team so first
thing up is being aware of time zones
people work when they feel productive
people live in different time zones
therefore the overlap is not going to be
a hundred percent between you and
someone else on your team the fact that
people work flexibly means that there
can be hard to get to this sounds like a
recipe for disaster right no one gets
anything done because no one's talking
that's not so so hopefully your team has
a goal or something that they're some
project that they're working on
hopefully they have a bunch of tasks
that you are all taking contributing to
there are ways to kind of split things
up so that then when people are working
asynchronous Lee that's they can all
head in the right direction okay so i
have three time zones on my laptop in
the corner this covers the eight or so
people like github that i work with the
most days just knowing what time of day
it is in that part of the world is i
think rather important so if i'm on if
i'm up in the morning and my colleague
Phil is around it means it's like after
noon PST so I can catch up with him on
some stuff but if he's not around I'll
go and do something else
so a quick note in there yes my calendar
had something on at two in the morning I
did not go to that meeting yep so with
our team being distributed around the
world there's two sort of distinctions
so the time when we overlap and then the
time when we don't overlap we call this
like golden time because there's so much
stuff that we can do when we're working
together we can bounce ideas around we
get feedback on stuff we can get reviews
done or we can just kind of talk this
time is really really valuable but it's
it's also kind of limited and with us
being scattered around the world it does
kind of feel like passing the baton in a
relay race so let's say may come back to
the you never with Phil let's say that
Phil and I are honest on the same time
let's work together on something so the
kind of the process that I'd recommend
doing for this is keeping it simple
keeping it fast keeping you a brief so
if we're online at the same time blitz
let's jump in and do something out if
we're not alike the same time let's find
a time slot that works for us morning
Australia's home is after noon PST
roughly so that's generally like the
sweet spot for catching up once we know
we've got a time slot let's actually use
the tools and get things get things
going sometimes chat is just good enough
for talking about stuff other times
let's jump into screen sharing and run
through some stuff but the goal here is
to kind of keep things focused having
things drag out is just is not the
greatest and it can kind of become a
crutch for people if they are kind of
dependent a lot on working synchronously
and of course let's say we get some wins
will close it out we'll celebrate sort
of thing and then we'll kind of go back
to where our specific designs this sort
of way means that we kind of like get
the best of both worlds between working
together and then working apart because
for most part and most of the day
working asynchronously is the default
some people kind of like this other
people struggle with it for a time I
loved the fact that my work days
like split half and half the mornings
I'll catch up a lot with the people in
Europe and us and then they'll kind of
go off into their evenings and I'll have
the afternoon to kind of work on my own
this is really nice because there's
there's different things that I can do
at different points of the day the stuff
that is a bit more meteor complicated
sort of things i'll do that when people
aren't around if i need to focus without
distractions i can do their stuff in the
afternoon if I have important questions
and things I need to raise I can do
those in the morning having both options
available means that I definitely think
a bit more about how I structure my day
but it kind of means that I get to have
a nice balance of both and of course
because we're all asynchronous we do
need to have a lot of initiative so
knowing what stuff needs to be done what
stuff is urgent versus what stuff is
optional that stuff really yeah yes so
knowing where to spend my time I believe
is really important to the overall
scenario the team has a goal we've got
stuff they're working on we know what
the priorities are we're all adults just
yeah get stuff done one of the early
things early github quotes was this
thing called the tyranny of the Sun
because people are always working
whether it's you know because the time
zones because of the yells that they
keep there's always something happening
at work and so there is this impulse to
kind of be around and and and
participate letting go of that I think
was really important to my sanity let's
put that way at one point I was doing
kind of a split day I'll do some stuff
in the morning I'd have the afternoon
off and then I do the evening to do some
more work there it wasn't that it wasn't
it sustainable because I would kind of
do work in the afternoon as well and so
then I'd have like a 12 16-hour workday
the the fact that there are other people
around again work-life balance goes goes
goes to hell so acknowledging it I think
it's a good first step but generally
cutting up your work day into a simpler
process I think was really good
the other sort of things that we do as a
team we make sure to not mention people
are less really important so this is a
little quote here because my handle name
kind of gets mentioned we spaced it out
and so then it doesn't get a
notification they're talking about me
but they don't really kind of need to
pull me into this discussion lots of
stuff will happen overnight and when
people are away or pull in those
discussions into a new shoe or something
some other spot to so that other people
can catch up later another thing that I
didn't put on here was code reviews so
we have a general rule to say no no self
mergers and no fast mergers so because
we're all scattered around the world we
want to give people a chance to give
feedback on certain pull requests so for
things that are kind of controversial or
big or significant they will sit for
like 24 hours or thing to give everyone
a chance the fact that we all have
different time zones and we might not be
able to get stuff immediately then kind
of impacts like how you guys work
together the other fun of being a
distributed team is that we have little
ways of kind of talking with each other
so the isolation of being a remote
worker the time zone differences like
all these things kind of conspire to
attack morale let's put it that way so
we have this little internal phrase
called real talk I'm just going to talk
candidly about the stuff this is you
know a tricky topic to talk about two
way for us to kind of just say I guys
I'm not doing okay and can I just talk
about the stuff because there are times
in you need to vent and when you are
working remotely work from home
isolation can hurt I do like the fact
that if I'm having a bad day I can just
say guys I'm having a bad day i'm taking
some time off to kind of recharge this
stuff is nice because we get to be
honest with each other when things are
good that's good when they're not so
good we kind of bring that stuff up yes
the ability to kind of acknowledge this
and take steps to address it rather than
slogging on through
the stuff that's there definitely helps
and of course us being distributed team
we have a lot of time spent writing
whether it's chat issues pull requests
get help that sort of stuff there is a
art I think to writing succinctly and
yeah to writing to singly I think there
are ways to inflame the situation by
writing stuff and just shooting from the
hip I like them now drew the cultural
differences between people can be
exacerbated by just writing I love to
use Australian slang I probably
shouldn't in this stuff but that stuff
can confuse the the writing and make
situations unclear and of course you can
just write too many words in waffle on
so the lovely TL DR summary in your
issues can definitely help writing is in
a distributor team is so very important
take time to think about the stuff that
you're doing draft it up if it's
something that's controversial or tricky
put it down for a bit go for a walk take
some air come back do you still feel
that way no cool have another go at
rewriting it taking your time with your
writing i think is also important
because it means you're a bit more
thoughtful but you're also taking time
to ensure that the stuff you say is
meaningful and of course we are a
tribute a team but we catch up every now
and again so one of my colleagues
markers on the booth this week we caught
up a few months ago we're in San
Francisco this stuff is not a substitute
for actual interactions it's always nice
for us to kind of catch up and do stuff
that is not work-related so one of my
examples here was back in March when we
were in the San Francisco we spent the
night just kind of playing games in the
office it was really cool because a we
didn't do any work base and whiskey came
out and see like we do we just kind of
go did stuff that wasn't work related I
definitely recommend if you guys do our
distributor team where you do
find a path make time to catch up
because those sort of bonds and
friendships definitely help when you go
back to your a regular work so I've got
a bit more time up my sleeve and I'm
just going to summarize and do a little
bit of a rant now so the tools are so
important to your team to ensure that
they fit in I definitely recommend
experimenting with tools and making sure
that you find the right ones we've
talked about replacing the re re
creating the cultural experience using
chat video AV stuff if you want to go
really really hardcore these things can
be used and they can recreate
environment and yeah it makes remote
working a whole bunch more fun and we've
talked about how being remote worker is
not as glamorous as all the promotional
material suggests treat it like an
actual job make sure that you are
disciplined about things and make sure
you do unplug at the end of the day the
last thing there i think is really
important the colleagues there alongside
you even though they aren't physically
alongside you are really important for
this thing to succeed there are there
will be good times there will be hard
times and knowing the person alongside
you really well definitely helps yeah so
the last time I did this talk I had a
lot of questions at the end I notices in
DC and it is infamous for being quiet
let's put that way but do we have any
questions
ah thought I get one yes so as matter of
fact we are distributed to you even when
we are nervous in the UK office as they
called us are representing States I find
really add the big at the beginning I
was asking if you find situation we're
working that in the afternoon and I've
had something that i don't know i am to
us and one is going to be there to give
me an answer until the next day
okay so the question was let's say I get
blocked by something in my work day and
there's no one going to be around for
12-24 hours sort of thing what do you do
so for me I've generally got a whole
bunch of things on the go like they're
you know number task to do that sort of
stuff i find myself context switching so
let's say I'm going for a view for
someone else a review for a PR for
someone else I put that aside I think
pick up something else where you're
blocked on something is definitely
fascinating I think it's always if it's
appropriate to ask if someone's around
if it's dependent on a team rather than
a certain person there might be someone
else able to help but the trick is I
think like is to not get bogged down in
that sort of stuff the fact that it
might take 12 hours to get an answer i'm
i'm okay with because you know people
will be back fairly soon it's not like i
have to wait until the next business day
sort of thing yeah I I definitely have
things that are blocked like at one
point I had six different code reviews
for stuff just in the queue sort of
thing like keeping balls juggling i
think it was nice but definitely when an
important thing gets blocked I'd see if
there was someone else that could help
me yeah bad
yep so for so the question was do you
have an induction for new people at
github so we have two weeks of people
coming to San Francisco to kind of get
set up with all the non work related
stuff and to just get a feel for the
place we will have a mentor a buddy
there from their team for the first week
to show them the ropes around the
various sorts of things so that's like
generally like the first week is mostly
just all the getting setting up and so
then the second week is us actually kind
of sitting down and getting stuff done
so kind of go this is what the team's
doing bah bah bah bah yep so making sure
that we're going to get a combination of
like the San Francisco experience and
the headquarters experience but also
having someone on their team there to
kind of show them the ropes like we kind
of trying to balance both because
ultimately when they go back we want to
make sure that they still feel like
they're included I found out well my
onboarding week was two weeks long I
came back to Australia and then we let a
bunch of people go that was not great
for my room morale because I was new and
I was getting straight into the remote
sort of stuff I was really worried that
I would be next yeah yeah yeah
yeah so the question was do you see
personality types that like working
remotely in distributed versus others
that don't I think there are some people
who are extroverted you know who feed
off sort of the the presence of other
people like I think those people do
struggle a bit with the remote stuff
whereas like introverts definitely kind
of go they get to control their
interactions a bit more I see that
that's that's kind of like probably the
archetype that I'd see but I know plenty
of extrovert saget up that that met
their hangout like it's not necessarily
straight down the middle sort of
distinction yes okay so the question was
have you ever seen a team go from
decentralized to distribute it I have
seen that work it's been a specific team
sort of thing versus like the whole
company like it's a good way to kind of
prove the thing out is to take a team
and and scatter them out the guys that a
company in Melbourne they did
distributed for a while and it it was
okay for them but so they kind of went
to kind of a hybrid model sort of thing
so they've still got an office in
Melbourne and the team can work from
wherever but it's like percent of the
time sort of thing like there are always
kind of introduced this stuff and find
out what fits for the people rather than
mandating like everyone take your
laptops and go home like I think like
making sure the thing succeeds by doing
it carefully is definitely important
yeah
my team not so much mostly because we
haven't found a great tool there was a
tool that was done so the question so
pair programming tools that have been
good I don't really have a good
recommendation from that let's see like
engine screen here I think was the 110
derp derp derp derp didn't they get
bought out by slack Who am I thinking of
something else so yeah okay so screen
code was the one that a person help you
recommended I've not used it i know some
other people used it and they're like
it's okay sort of thing yeah i think
it's kind of one things that i do miss
but yet on the whole like there's other
ways for us to kind of collaborate yeah
yes so the question was do you see
issues with people who are situation
where people are co-located and people
are distributed I definitely do see that
stuff because what you'll see is people
will fall back on old habits discussing
things in hallways and not you know
discussing that stuff in chat so a whole
bunch of stuff will then be only visible
to certain parts of the team and it's
event like the communication breakdown
sort of stuff that happens getting
people to kind of either summarize that
stuff back in chat so that people see is
tricky it's easy for the people to kind
of just turn around say Oh would you
think that so and so and so like and
then that stuff gets lost making people
work remotely at least part of the time
I think would encourage people to kind
of do that stuff but that's yeah it's a
tricky thing so how do you think you can
overcome it I think making everyone work
remote a bit of the time at least so
that they feel the same pain is I don't
think it's about mandating that everyone
should be remote but like giving people
the option I think and also getting them
to feel a bit of empathy for those
people who do work remote I think just
yeah awareness of these differences and
the fact that it's easy to exclude
people when you're in that situation
yeah
yep
okay so the question was along the lines
of moving the technology people is one
thing moving the rest of the company is
also another thing I I don't really see
a distinction between the two for some
people in those traditional sort of
teams like HR and cell sort of things
they do kind of prefer being in the
office but I think giving them the
option to work remotely like a part of
the time is actually really really nice
so some I'll bring up our Amsterdam
office because that's us down the front
some of the sales people will say in the
morning like I'm not coming in i'm
working from home today like just having
that option i think is really really
nice selling that to the stakeholders is
if we're all running decent laptops and
that sort of stuff like it then becomes
a whole bunch easiest to do again like
probably newer companies vs more
traditional companies that they're sort
of stuff yeah I think like technology
people it's an easier sell because of
all the lovely distractions but I think
other parts of the organization and
would jump at it let's go that way well
quiet if you miss cool okay yes so the
question was how much do I travel it's
rather atrocious let's put that way I
have tripit looking after all my
itinerary so stuff and for the last
couple of years I've been on the road
for seven months of the year four
consecutive years so it's crazy I don't
recommend it but yeah yeah
cool so the question was when you use a
lot of text based chat you missed a lot
of the feelings and emotions behind
things the I think the perfect fault of
that is emoji we definitely abused emoji
on get up the website we abuse emoji in
slack sort of things like throwing in
that little extra context like now just
a little smiley face a troll face that
sort of stuff I think it's a good way to
Telegraph emotion but I think in terms
of like people's writing once you know
fairly well what they're like you can
pick up on these cues where people are
you know angry stare feeling but down
like there is a lot that you can read
from text I think once you rip know the
people that you work with really well ya
know so the question was have you
experimented with virtual windows no we
have not there's been a couple of times
where we've had a an open video
conference for stuff so before we were
doing the launch for get up desktop we
were just basically you know in a war
room scenario just hang out making sure
everything was fire so they were like 10
of us in this room it was be like the
Brady Bunch but full of nerds we've done
that sort of stuff because it was kind
of good to bond and make sure that
everything was there but just as a
general sort of day-to-day stuff give we
don't I'd love to a kind of experiment
with that but time zones quite often
just yet don't make it as feasible yeah
yeah
yep
I definitely hope that's not the case so
my my own boarding experience was we
went to a conference just before
onboarding and so I got to hang out with
my team and then do the github
onboarding and then do that stuff so it
ultimately was like almost a month of
like getting to know my team I think in
general like making sure that you check
in with new people on the team and make
them feel welcome and included in our
sets or stuff yes it can be isolating
and this comes to like communication
breakdowns and everything yeah it's
tricky No okay a couple of minutes left
if you guys don't want to squish in
publicly I'll be hanging around
otherwise thank you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
