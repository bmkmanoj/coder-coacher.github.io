we're going to talk about anger too and
I suppose a lot of people here no angler
one anybody know diagram yeah good yours
the typical audience that I want so
that's perfect before we talk about I
can run up maybe I should be introducing
myself and you know this formalities
stuff and magic it works I can control
my laptop from the phone which is not
wait for 2016 but I'm ligi I work as a
senior consultant in ray defy quite a
reputable take southern company and I
write a newsletter for web developers
species was working with with anger GS
on guru stop dotnet however I think the
reason I was accepted to talk here is
that Iran's ng Sydney user group the
angular you use a group in Sydney and
it's happening today actually so if
you're considering something you know
after event might do that however i
think if you ever in my name will Iggy
in in this conference is most likely in
the twitter leaderboard class thing
called number one yesterday so kind of
Twitter addicting not working a solution
currently so one very quick thing about
interesting again we're having it today
we're having password talking about
anger not react and with some good luck
would be having Josh as well and more
talks about like if you are already
working with with angular 1 and you want
to move to is six top script kind of
thing how would you go so just like to
check that that'll be cool now let's go
into this talk I already checked it it's
very good that a lot of you do I got one
already and I'd expect that a lot of you
have been working with anger one before
angry 1.5 right like who worked with
components in
angular 1.5 not many that's good because
i'm not going to assume that you know
anything about that because it's
actually came it's like backported from
anger too so if you already know you
wouldn't need to attend this session so
that's right assumes there are a lot of
dead people here it's kind of NDC after
all right don't net okay good and and
that's just because we're going to make
a few dozen net references so yeah
here's what we're going talk about what
kind of new and different in angular 2
what surprisingly just the same like
anger one just you know who my cheese or
whatever and then we're going to talk
about you know this then the things that
anger team keep talking about playing
you know anger one was a framework anger
too is a platform but you know what what
does this mean and after that you know
try to get realistic where we are what's
the current state you know how what are
the goat cheese and all these sorts of
stuff after this one after the lunch
there is another angler to talk to be
Duncan and I think Adam from ssw they're
going to give a little more advanced
version of these talks they're going to
talk about it's all going to be like
real life experience because they have
been working on a lot of language to
project and you want to tell you know
what it's like to actually do this
however this talk is going to focus more
about you know how do you translate your
knowledge from anger one to anger too so
uh you know you'll use hangar 1 I guess
you loved it we we had you know the
basic and classical envy star or I still
like to call to embassies you know you
have you have your controllers you write
JavaScript you have your HTML you are
templates data binding works and it's
all good with with that you get a few
extras so
you get you get forms you get validation
you get routing you get dependency
injection you get all this extra stuff
and it's all cool and you start
developing your own way to Forks oh okay
in controller I'll write like light view
logic without much no manipulation I'll
do the manipulation in directive if
there's any complex logic output in
services and now I I have you know the
same feelings that I would get from a
normal server side and we see I like
it's cool that works of course there is
about the main issues that you know we
will seem to have with angle run
applications where the fact that you are
you have a scope to assign properties oh
that's a good thing that's not amazing
however all the prototype nature of the
scope going you know the other side
parent in order sign route all this
stuff it can get confusing it can get
you know can cause bugs it has a lot of
issues services how many how many ways
they have in in anger to insert an angry
one to define services its provider
factory service and I think there's
something else so um this you know can
be a bit confusing and this is very
eager specific performance was angry one
is not bad however if you start in
eluding big grid like twitch sometimes
having in our enterprise application and
stuff it starts to have a few glitches
mostly in IE and usually you know
they're all solutions to these things
and like you might get some third-party
grid or whatever and you know they're
always however most of the ways that we
get tend to be trying to escape from
change detection because that that seems
to be what's causing you know the all
the extra efforts the tangler is doing
and because
you have a scraper thing threaded so you
know these blocks surrender thread as
well and now you're you know you know it
gets a little bit like hanging feeling
and that's why somebody once said i
can't remember who that in angular you
get better performance the less anger
feature used we could like you know the
more you escape from the change
detection of stuff is good and then save
ourselves late that was react to you
like the more features of react to use a
faster I don't know how accurate the rag
version is but for for anger one
definitely you know like it gets faster
the more you go out of the digest loop
so that's angular world for you know I
got one point oh all the way to anger or
1.3 1.4 but you know the world is not
just angular right there is a lot of
things happening in the JavaScript
ecosystem we we got a transcript 2015
and we actually go who who knows we also
go to 2016 as well that's already
released there's only two features who
knows what are two features I remember
ok so there is an array it does include
and there is like star star attribute
which allows it to go like math to the
power of that's the only thing you know
justin langer and in it can still give
some 16 but Agnes Krypton f15 was a more
interesting one because we got arrow
functions you know we can keep this
variable from you know changing all the
time and we got interpreted strings we
can have template like strings and more
importantly like the most important
features in a coma script 2015 maybe our
classes and modules who has been to the
cut Allen stock yesterday okay and not
that many I guess okay so I'll have to
explain a little bit about them so
here is the projector is really not
helping so so boldly this is a class in
econ script 2015 it's called hello world
and extends react dot component so
that's let's let's react component and
you go render and then this is not equal
scrip 2015 this is gsx but everything
else is so we have a class and we can
inherit other classes or extend them and
and it's still refusing we have imports
and leasing boards are like modules so
you can think of them as in a dll or
namespaces and dls as well and then we
have to so we have to get react so that
we can get the component from it and we
we have to get react don't because we
act can render to multiple things so it
can render to react native whatever so
that's that's how you you do this in
react and if you're doing ember it is
getting into classes as well if you're
doing orillia is getting into closer so
it looks like the whole world is moving
into it my script 2015 what what does
this bring you now your cruise classes
you're everything you're right becomes a
module but you know browsers don't don't
understand classes and there is no way
to load modules like even in standard
for egg my script 2015 there was an API
called system dot import so that you can
lu the module into the browser and they
didn't get approved so there is actually
even like there's no official way to
load modules so if you are going to use
modules which everybody seems to like
and if you're going to use classes you
know just just to be friendly to most of
the world browsers you will have to use
the transpiler so you'll have to try get
a compiler that translates from it gets
gives us at fifteen two years five
well if you're going to use a transpiler
anyway why don't you go one step farther
and you'll stop script because you know
if you're going to go all the way to to
the effort of having an compiler having
a bundler you know things that tells the
roster to understands the modules and
all this stuff you know why don't you
just go one more step and that's what
angular prefers I here too so here we
have very similar example to to what we
had in interact world we import the
component and we import the browser
specific would strap because I angler
too just like most of the similar spa
frameworks in JavaScript now it can you
know compile to native script or react
native or on the server on or anything
so you know we're saying we're doing
we're going to use the browser version
of the bootstrap and the same text were
in board for producer haven't come to
scotts islands talk you can say import
star as angular so you know if stadium
broadstairs angry and then say angular
the bootstrap your component and you can
think of your component as your module
in angular 1 concept and then you find
that it's very very similar to what we
had now this component in here there are
two things I want you to notice first in
anger to you can do a tribute just sorry
Tom script you can do attributes just
like you doing in c-sharp to just call
them decorators and the syntax is
slightly different instead of these
brackets they use that and component is
just a function so when you see other
issues like that it's a function that
will get an instance of the class like
that whenever you use a new app
component it this function will get cold
and it will be the ones that will return
you the instance or can modify the
instance as well and we'll talk
how this is useful in just a bit however
forget about this particular component
name let's talk about this whole thing
what does this look like to you as an
angular 1 developer it has a template it
has a function because you know classes
are just like function if I would hear a
constructors like function and it has a
selector did I hear directive somewhere
yep let's let exactly what what you can
think of of a component so anyone it
started to just controllers because was
for designer so the controllers were
just so that really so that you would
wire the data binding to the UI as a
seat people started doing crazy things
with it and now it got directives or at
least plaque made of directives
available publicly and now you know
people started working with okay now I
have a controller but the directive can
have a controller as well if you did any
any serious work with directive you know
that it's not just compile and Link you
can also have a controller like the ng
model directive most of the work is the
thing called ng model controller and of
course the directive can have a template
so you know why not so actually in
angular 2 components are just subclass
of directives and you can think of it
you know as a directive that has
isolated scope that has transclusion you
know it overrides with the template and
yes it can have like a child content in
its template and the scope is the
instance scope so you know anything
that's like this in here would go into
the template needless to say you can
have the template in line or we can have
a template URL just just like the
rector's in hangar 1
if the internet works this is exactly
the same example that you saw that's why
you don't need to really see that good
and if the internet works you find it
working when you deal with this here are
the parts that like you didn't see in
the example in in our index we lose a
few bully fuels full flood and we have
to have a custom tag in here of course
this custom tag didn't will match the
component selector and let's have the
bootstrap knows you know to to use this
and that's why we didn't even need to
tell the bootstrap in here you know
where to apply the component like like
interactive you if you notice to you we
needed to in this example because
reaching Lambert runs completely in the
browser we had to deal with something
called system yes and you'll have to
deal with the same if you're doing any
spa development and you want to do
compilation just in the browser so
system GS is the library that tries to
bully fill the system dot import method
that didn't get to make it is a standard
and what we're seeing here is first we
are mapping all the all the libraries
that we need from nvm CDN because we
don't have local nvm and then we're
saying ok here are all the different
modules that anger to is a split to we
just want to load them and we lose them
with this angular backslash who knows
what this angular flash means
have you ever tried to look for the
bootstrap CSS framework on Bauer or mbm
if you did that you'll probably find so
many libraries or like power modules
that that look quite the same it's a bit
hard to tell which one is the official
one so nvm has a solution to this
problem which is called scoped packages
so add angular is like what we call a
package namespace so that's the official
angular thing and everything underneath
is a different mbm module that's our in
game package that can be loaded
separately you'll probably find yourself
a bit overloaded with a lot of concepts
that I talk about in here the problem is
these concepts everybody in the
JavaScript world have been starting to
use them with react with ember with even
circle view there's just so many
libraries out there and they all use
these concepts however you know for us
angular 1 developers with just you know
sticking with our alberta script i'm
good and and then you know when when i
get to started to you know like just
follow the fashion the trends we're like
why are they doing this it well they
didn't started you know there's just
really following the trends now let's go
back to the component bit now that you
can you can control how app component is
instantiated because angular 2 owns the
function that will return you an
instance of app component whenever it's
called why don't we also use this to do
the witness injection just like the same
way you do it in a bit of net oh like
auto fakro tavern you know so here I
have a constructor injection and if i
add a modifier like an access modifier
to
the barometer in here it automatically
becomes a member of the club so this is
just like if I said private member
service in here in the class yes that's
top script note angular 2 so now anger
too will know that if anybody will
revise this user service it will inject
it into here and now I can in my
template go and use it if get name you
know comes from anything the transit
synchronously web service that you know
uses the token or whatever like the user
authentication token or anything like
that then we can have this a sink filter
except in anger tools they call it pipe
but you know lolz news it's just filter
and and what this is going to do is is
going to tell the UI okay if there is a
promise if this will come from a promise
I will wait until the promise is
resolved and then I'll render it in here
I'm able to write multiple lines in the
template because i'm using this stick so
this is not that if you notice yeah and
this is like a akmal script 2015 strings
there's the the key just to the left of
number one in your keyboard and now the
only thing this needs in order to work
is I need to import the service from
here and that's just so that I can
reference it and you can see that in in
typescript you can import things from
nvm like I'm doing in here or just
import local files and that and it means
that i have in the same folder i have
another folder called cheered and then i
have user 2 30's it's a bit difficult
vention for this requires yes and then
later we're back and english
15 modules that let you don't include
the extension so now in my boot strap I
can say okay you know include this user
service and then it will automatically
inject it for you if you remember when I
said you can think of the component as a
module and that's because I can I can
also come here and add the thing i call
it providers and just pass this
particular array and it would just work
so akmal script gave us classes give us
modules our functions are hand use
classes because you know if you're using
a class when you're using a lot of
methods that are in the class were you
don't really want your this variable to
change and then top script it gave us
decorators and it gave us types and we
saw the types we're very useful
independence injection and it gives us
interfaces and interfaces are very nice
so interfaces means you can just define
a schema and you know instead of instead
of a class and instead of having to say
new repository or new user wrote every
you can get whatever jason is coming
from the HTTP and and just cast it into
the type of the interface without having
to create classes or anything however we
also saw that you know we had to do all
this system GS stuff to get things
working if you have a library that's not
written for typescript you will have to
also include a thing called typing for
it that would give you the intelligence
you know that would tell you how to get
it if you don't include the intelligence
you know you can just go ahead and work
without timings because you know timing
lean in diving in typescript are
optional sorry I like all the types and
stuff are optional of course there are a
few other things that
are happening in the web world so the
thing that's called web components and
you might have hears of polymer or you
might have heard of shadow Dom a little
and and here i don't mean react shadow
Dom that's actually I've use of the word
in a way to shadow Dom what it what it
usually means is you know if you have a
text books with with some placeholder in
it how does this placeholder it gets
written you know the the browser
internally right someday for something
inside the text books and this is dom
you know this is you know it's just HTML
but you can't access it from from your
javascript as an HTML is completely
independent you can style it a letter
browser give you a special singing
that's completely isolated so that's
that's what usually I'm shadow da missin
and in html5 you can define your own
shadow domes that doesn't get affected
by any style sheets or anything other
than the ones that targeted specifically
and another thing that we also found
this happening and not becoming a big
deal at all in the developer community
is that custom tags are those a big deal
anymore who here remembers when you know
using custom attributes in angular 1 was
like I will not use angular 1 because
custom attributes are not standard did
anybody did anybody get get this
rejection before if you have if I used
angular 1 for long enough we were like
no no I I have to add that attached to
to that tribute so that the standard
gets what custom tags are now kind of
standard and like you you are free to
use them on one condition just included
a schism and this is so that like your
future proof so that you know if the
HTML standard introduces new tags they
will never use the dash or hyphen you
know in in in the tag name so you know
you'll never clash
is you know any future HTML text to come
so a kind of future proof and that's why
you know we will see this in all the
anger components that we create now
these are the things that you find it
like that you face when you start
working with hangers to know Oh
subscript 0 different syntax what are
these directive all of this however a
lot of things are not that different
from what you have sorry the directive
who can tell me what this directive does
yeah yeah it just sets a background
color so let's talk about how angler two
works when I get it to translates your
template into HTML it's using the
documental create element ABI they did a
lot of testing and very surprisingly
they found that this was the fastest way
to create elements a very nice bonus
that you get to any create the element
this way is that you you get a reference
to the element as well so it's very easy
to to get the element as the native
element in here any idea why why we we
get this elementary from native element
while this complexity exists Maggie
guess
all right do you think it is for
comfortability with all the browsers do
you think it's for compatibility with
ionic do you think it's frequent ability
of native script you know how I react
native works okay so eager to can run
not just on HTML but you know on any
template language so you can implement
your own what they call renderer so you
don't have to write to HTML only so
similar to them are in there is the
thing from telerik now progress called
native script and native script is
allows you to have a special xml
language that they would translate to
native elements for for iOS or Android
and I think they're now supporting
winforms as low a wonderful so that's
why when you get an element reference to
your not one hundred percent sure you
know if it is a Dom element or not
unless if you are and you know if you
are you can just go and use the native
element then you're good and now let's
go and see how how this one looks like
it's just a directive with a selector
and you do whatever you want in the
constructor and that's it that's very
simple that's you know you can think of
this as your link function
let's see how HTML side of things works
now I'm going to tell you about all the
kinds of syntax that you might use in a
template and it's very easy once you
stop thinking with the angry one mindset
so if you have an event and you want to
have an event handler for it you use
these brackets which are like let the
circular ones all right and then the
name of the event instead of the dog
just like angular 1 with the ng-click
and all the other stuff it gets the
event object and you can use it one
interesting thing though is that
everywhere in here all the strings that
you see they're all JavaScript so
there's you don't need to worry about
that leaf directive support
interpolation or not do I need to use
this or not inside your table so
everywhere whenever you're working with
Anna take that you're working with this
and actually you're never working with
an attribute but i'll explain this in a
bit so now you already know this syntax
for data binding so I don't even need to
explain it it is an event here it till
it is an attribute then we just use the
other bracket and there is a very nice
and energy to think about this one which
is if that change is coming from from
the UI from the user and calling
javascript code then it's the circular
one is event if the change is in
JavaScript code and it's going to affect
the UI then it's the ADI collett what I
call these square brackets you can tell
I'm very prepared so if you think about
it this way that this is that the first
one is coming from the UI to the
world and that these guys coming from
JavaScript world to affect the right
effect the element then you can very
very easily reason about the guy this is
two-way data-binding you would use it
with forms only obviously and I till
today I haven't really seen any anything
that uses it other than ng model so now
you don't like from the eye to the
JavaScript from JavaScript to the UI or
vice versa you get this so that's all
good except I lie to you about a very
small thing when I said that max length
is an attribute that was a lie what what
we are dealing with in in in this square
bracket Thanks resign who you reminded
me of the name it's always going to be a
Dom element property so i don't know if
you guys are very familiar with it if
you have done a lot of jquery code
recently like in the recent years you do
realize the difference so if you have a
check box and this check box has a
tribute checked then when it loads it
would be checked if the user clicks the
check box then the checkbox is unchecked
and in this case the property checked
would be false as that tribute checked
will still be there so that table just
you know what what gets rendered inning
is text but the property is the real
value so I sometimes you might have
different names for for that tribute and
the property they're not always the same
and sometimes you would have a property
that doesn't have an equivalent a
tribute like styles for example and
sometimes you'd have an attribute that
might not have an equivalent property
like cloth should have cloth cloth name
however for for simplicity angular 2
also gives you a few like it does a
little bit of a few tricks to make it
easier for you to write this code so for
example you don't have to do class name
in here direct guys would would really
like to have just being able to take
class because react works the same way
we are also dealing with property so you
have to remember that you should write
class name and if you're our classes I
JavaScript reserved it world so you know
to not work here you just say and you
can say either you can fit the entire
class or you can set a conditional class
a warning will only be set if the value
sorry if the length of the text is
higher than half of the maximum length i
had to write it backwards to get the
coloring to work because it may work and
all flow if angry too has a reference to
the element to ready you might want to
use it why don't you just go and use it
and yeah you can just use it to use this
and you can give it a name and you can
this name please name a moot point to
your input element and you can use it
like I'm using it in here but the one
element can have multiple directives
just like angular 1 what if you want an
instance of this directive what if you
want an instance of the ng models that
we set in here you can just use the same
syntax but you know by default it would
be the same element or the component
because this it could have been
importers this could have been my app
but if you want to set it to a
particular directive you'd use this
little be useful when you are working
with forms for example if you want to
get a reference to the form so you can
say you know dot dot is required or they
have a nice thing called value which
realizes all the values in the form and
stuff like that so now we know how to go
from from the element back backwards to
it we can do a few hacks so in
addition to class you also have dot
attribute which is just at and style so
you can go style the background or pixel
and then you know set it to a number and
then that will just work the last thing
we have is template at so if if we write
this guy this guy doesn't get written to
the HTML just like it is instead they
write an HTML tag called template for
you and that's the just a valid HTML 5
tag and then they will only right you
know the div if this condition is true
see and similarly this one also will get
written to a template and this is the
only place this mg for that's the only
place you write a special angular 2
syntax everywhere else you just try it
was mostly playing JavaScript it
technically it's not but like you you
can think about it exactly like any
JavaScript expression here is the only
place you'd have like a special syntax
and they were really really really
trying to avoid it when once they
started but you know so how do you
recognize that it is a template the star
exactly so right now the whole point of
the template syntax if you're wondering
why is it why is it like that is to
eliminate kisses so now I know this is
an event you know if in angular ones the
main problem was a directive laws if you
see it you don't know what it does but
here you know you know it's an event
handler you know that you know you're
sitting a property you know that this is
just an identifier you know this is
going to rewrite the tag so it's mainly
to eliminate get it then when you work
with it that and that way it's very nice
one more thing that you'll find that you
really no it's not
weird at all is filters or vibes as
usual just like the component you know
and the directive you you get a
typescript erection and you just give it
the names that you're going to use in
and just like a think in another example
that we saw if you want to make sure
that you know you you implement your
your variable sorry is that you
implement the right function you can you
can implement the interface a little
just you know make sure that yeah I'm
writing it right and and here you just
get the value and you know you can use
it nothing special in here routing i
think is one of the little bit silly
bursts of anger too because the header
outer and let z deprecated it and then
he had another router which didn't live
for like one release or something in
them there's a lucky suit and that's
what we're dealing with now and it's not
likely to change so you'll need to worry
about that much they had three goals
with the router first it needs to
support angular 2 and angular 1 because
that's going to be the story for the
migration so what you do if you have an
angular 1 application is that you would
work like you you would migrate to this
router first with all your anger one and
then step-by-step start moving your
angular 1 components or angular 1 route
into anger to an and move on the second
one is they want to support lazy loading
of some route which would be optional so
sometimes yeah I want to load all this
on beige lewd and I want to lazy loot
only the admin section for example the
third thing is it needs to support
bundling as in so they have this thing
called offline compiler which would be
able to take all your component also
that end it and just take it in one
piece and the router needed to deal with
that as well if you don't get what I'm
saying for this one will be talking in
more details about in a bit so they're
out what i want to show you now is that
it's quite simple in the sense of you
define a things that of type route
config and why would you would you say
that it is a fright of type route coming
so that you'd get intelligence for pass
and for component and desire to and all
the sorts of stuff top script
automatically understand this so here
we're saying you know for the if there
is no bus at all and that's why we're
saying the bus match in here because bus
much like it can be a lot just say you
know I want the bus match to be anything
customer / anything you know anything
that matches partially customers and
then we're saying you know okay go to
the customers which just defines the
component who can tell what's the part
that I omitted in here like I didn't
include I in order to reference the
customer component I need to import it
as well so you know I just didn't
include them boards it like the using
statement here there's another example
if you have children you just give them
this way and it's really not not that
much different from what you through
instead of ng content you just have a
router outlet just it so ah now we
talked about tab script as the main
thing that you know unger introduced we
realize that everything else is quite
similar maybe the business injection
change it a bit yeah now we'll talk
about the other new conflict that is no
specific time here too but a lot of us
got good introduced to only in anger to
which is observables observables are the
marriage of promises and event and scope
the broadcast so events are a
synchronous right
you don't know when the event is going
to happen so it has to be a secure on so
if you have an event like an event
listener you know the function will be
invoked as synchronously sometime in the
future however event they can be fired
more than once so that's different from
a promise a promise we'll just resolve
and that's it in the same way if you
want to raise your own event in angular
1 the way we do that is that I could say
you know Scott the tomatoes cook the
broadcast and then somewhere else would
have scoped on and like try to listen to
it now all of this has been replaced by
it's one thing called observables them
let's see what observables look like so
observables allow you to subscribe to
them and when you subscribe you get
multiple values so here the way I'm
defining this observable by hand which
is something you rarely do when you say
create it gives you a thing called
observer and the thing called observable
observer what it does is it it's like
I'm going to raise this event I'm I'm
scope that broadcast and then you can
say ok send this value now like triggers
this event triggers if other event with
this value when you are done complete so
on so what this is going to do is
because I'm calling it in a set timeout
it's going to wait for two seconds and
then directly bus these two
independently and then say I'm done one
thing that you can't do with promises
but you can do with observables is that
you can cancel them as well so whenever
somebody subscribes to this observable
which is equivalent of the then for
promises we can return a subscription
and they can call unsubscribe unit which
will call our clear method so a funny
thing in in promises for example is an
HTTP because in anger one HTTP used
promises if you make an HTTP request you
cannot cancel it it will have to come
back and you'll have to in the end of
this promise you know make sure that
like you're going to start it somehow
even though the actual object ABI like
the oh maybe I support aborting the
xmlhttprequest but because it's wrapped
in a promise you can't access that now
HTTP in angular 2 uses observable so
it's so you can easily cancel you can
HDD balance you can easily do a lot of
things and I told you normally you
wouldn't be creating observables like
that you can just you know take any
value and make it an observable you can
you know call them livable on some
interval so it keeps repeating after a
while you can convert any promise event
as you actually quest into an observable
if you have an array can you know get
each item to be cold so this example
that I'm looking at what's going to be
what's going to do is it's going to have
an observable that's going to give me a
number every half a second but then I'm
going to have another observable that
will only fire for the first ten numbers
and here I'm having a third observable
that will only fire for the even numbers
of this and that's a real power of three
let the real power of observables that
you can compose them so you can have one
one request and you know composite with
other values and stuff like that so
actually this a sorry these functions
they call them operators and there are
tons of them and they're just like link
when you think about it map is like
select do it's just like for each but
there are also a few more interesting
things you might have noticed
in the first example of those liberals I
I through a narrow so if this isn't as X
you can have a retry and you can have
four sorry sir I you can have it based
on a function or based on specific
number of retries you can have you can
tell it don't don't give me any results
until you know there is a new new value
it can redirect like you can return a
completely different observable so here
here is an example of using observables
and using services as well at the same
time so services in angular 2 because a
very quick one services are just playing
classes any classes you don't even need
this injectable thing however if you
want to use if you want to use the main
st injection then angular will need to
know about your constructor method and
the way the only way angler would know
this is that it needs some at attribute
to be written on the cloth when
typescript sees any attribute to this
this injectable saying a particular it
does nothing it's just so that we would
have something on the class so the top
script if you set the the right config
which in all the projects of angular 2
they get set for you by default they
will write all the arguments of the
constructor in the generated JavaScript
so then angular can can use a thing
called reflex meter data and do a little
bit of reflection and no you know what
what arguments do I need them and just
include them back to observable hear
what the service does it gets the list
of repositories for the github user
names that you send so now I have a
username i'm using the typescript
strings here so that you know I i
construct my URL and i'm returning an
observable of I repository
a little durable all it does it just
uses HTTP which you got injected from
here and we already know that you know
when when when we have an access
modifier I can call it with this so just
let okay get that and then map it to
hear what you get from the gate is just
an observable of HTTP response you
probably want to that I don't want the
whole response so here we call a handy
function that anger to gives you on the
response I just converts it into a Jason
and while I'm here why don't I just cast
it and that's less the same texts were
forecasting in in time script why don't
I cast it in this so that you know type
of script tool automatically in fair
that the return will become this I don't
need to write it in there and then if
there is an error in in this case I'm
just dealing with it a little bit
naively and I'm just returning an empty
array one more thing that kind of it did
change in angular 2 but you most likely
don't have to deal with it is how change
tracking works and actually angular 2
started from here started from this
library called Sanjay so think 12 mishka
from the anger team like he was the one
who inverter hangar 1 he had this crazy
idea which is saying okay and instead of
doing all these Cobb the digest and
stuff the only way something is going to
change in the document is that and I
wouldn't know about it is that if it
happened uh synchronously there are only
a few if he is in the dome that can that
can do that like add event listener or
an eject call or set them out or set
interval and stuff how about if I have a
library that can go and replace all this
function is the browser with its own
functions that would
just call some calls the change
detection for me after the synchronous
thing finishes at first sounds like a
crazy idea what this thing you know
overriding native baby items the browser
used to be like a no-no kind of thing
surprisingly it works very well so it's
like oh yeah it's that's nice lets you
know let's use this and now let's lift
kind of was the first seed that I know
of where anger to start the coming that
okay our change tracking is very slow it
is the one that's you know holding us
back why don't we make it faster by like
just making it close to the bare metal
but that's not the only thing when i go
to seize the templates that we looked at
it generates some javascript for you
right so these you have a script that it
generates it doesn't it doesn't it's not
genetic code so if i say in my template
add this user name it doesn't just say
okay there is this key is username an
object if the string is an array no it
doesn't do that it because typescript
gives it enough static information it
just goes ahead and write a specific avi
is a specific comparison of this
argument that used in your template and
this means that you know there's no
generic good so they could really really
fast you know doesn't have to go through
a million of possibilities to just you
know know how to compare an object
because it's already knows what it is
and this made anger to really very very
fast and let's not only option so they
have this thing called change tracking
strategy so maybe you want to say don't
run change tracking for me if you know
it if I care about something I'll just
subscribe to an observable you know I
want to be very fast I want to be very
explicit about how I do change tracking
that's that's also support no problem
and this whole thing starts with what's
included in angular
to the platform first assembly compiler
if you are wondering why angular 2 is
not released this is this is the thing
that once this thing is finished we get
angular 2 so what's this now you saw on
the very first anger to example we we
had this import from browser dynamic
browser and stuff and that's be cool
what the angular team want to do and
what they already did in some unofficial
repositories is they want to be able to
take your HTML template and convert it
into JavaScript just like the same way
you know that template compilation
happens in angular 1 except the DGA
script you know would be very specific
about tributes and the properties that
you're using so to be much much faster
and then write the JavaScript code into
what they call template factories and
just stir it so that now well once you
convert to HTML to JavaScript you don't
it's not just that you don't need the
HTML templates anymore you don't even
need the compiler from angler to anymore
so they can omit this from from from
your bundle and you know your
application becomes much much much
slower uh not slower much faster so did
the things that they want and this is
the things that kind of contradicts with
the lazy loading when you think about
them and that's why the router was quite
a big question for them so a lot of
people ask me like when do you expect
anger to to to ship I do not know but I
kind of guessed that you know you should
get this going by maybe end of
september-october kind of
and now how about you know now we knew
how to optimize the compilation but how
about the change tracking how about the
stuff that you can't avoid drowning in
around time well the web has a thing
called web workers like threads for
JavaScript multiple for multiple threads
that can run in the background why don't
you just use this yeah you can so
angular 2 already implements an example
that shows you you know you can run the
whole angular work in in web worker so
that even if it flow even if it's doing
something slow its nope LA Kings I
rendering you I but if you're running it
in the background or already you know if
if you can separate it from the dome why
don't you run it from the server why
don't you run it in react native or
native script or whatever so that's kind
of the big picture that we want you know
I want to be able to run angular
applications even offline why wouldn't I
be able to run it offline because now
there is another thing called service
workers not a web worker that can run
even if the if the pages is not opened
that would be useful for for mobiles so
I can go to your website you can show me
a dialog you know do you want to just
put the shortcut to our website on your
on your home screen and then I click
that but the 3g is not working well so
the service worker will run and you know
okay yeah you're flying I'll put some
resources for your flaw as that I i
cashed before and you just work with it
so that's one story for mobile and the
other story obviously is ionic which is
exactly as similar as you as you would
imagine it in iotic one the other mobile
story is also a native script but let's
not everything in there one thing I want
you to know about angular 2 that's
different from anger one is that hangar
1 it was very
an opinionated so you people people were
doing anger abs in completely different
ways and unfortunately even even like
the right way you know that you'd ask
the team when who says rato it changed
like today in the 91 both laugh you
should be using components all the way
because it'll make it very similar to
angular 2 but just a little bit before
you're supposed to use controller as
with the directives and just before it
was no no no only use controllers and
you know use directions only for Dom
manipulations there's no way I get to is
quite opinionated to the extent that it
prefers a certain directory structure
notice that I use the word prefer no no
la it doesn't force you to do that but
you know if you follow the style guide
you'll be doing exactly like everyone
else you know so you'll be able to work
with anyone else on any angular
projecting on same conventions same
naming conventions same folder same
everything is very easy to work with
stuff and that's why they even created a
CLI to a command-line tool that will
jump generate things following the style
guides for you one one more piece of
what they're including as well as a
debugging tool so if you were used
Batarang so it's a chrome development
tool i'll be showing it to you now why
don't we just you know skip the schedule
and to please come on come on come on
internet internet hello okay cool so now
this is a website that just you know
shows the tools called augury and now i
can go in here what you might not notice
this i have a new tab in my developer
tool to tools called augury and now i
can see all my components and once i go
to this component for example i can see
what dependent feel it has I can see
what state it have and I can even change
it so if I say here in book data change
it it got changed here and here you know
everywhere where binding works and even
I have routing I can have a routing tree
so that's that's very nice going back
here we were talking about mobile and
they told you the whole thing about
mobile is I thought about service
workers I told you about the ability to
run offline however the way you do this
you'd have to write some some files
called manifest and like work with some
very ugly AV is that a lot of servers
don't like so if you are using the CLI
or if you just you know want to use the
guidance and apply to your own project
manually you can go to mobile the
tangles aisle and you know it they will
help you avoid all the ugly ABI then
just work directly and and you know get
all the benefits of your application
running from the home screen just like
an normal application and you know
working offline and everything but to do
this you know it will be always easier
for you to follow the conventions so
things like okay I want to have my
component I want to have a test for it
so the test should be component that
spec OTS and so on and these conventions
you get for free if you use the CLI you
already have to use the CLI I've seen
Steve Sanderson show some great stuff
running with the human generators that
they have in a spirited cool for the no
services but you want to make sure that
you follow the style guide even if
you're not using the still I the CLI
have been very fond of it recently it's
very simple
you just create a new project and then
it can generate the gist is for generate
you can't read a component a service and
interface and it will generate
everything for you and then you can have
it running with life reload and you can
create a production bundle and here this
is going to be why you really want to
use the CLI because that less where the
angular 2 team is going to give you
automatically the offline compiler and
the tree shaking you know excluding any
part of angular 2 or of your code that
you're not using to make your bad little
smaller right now the the bundle the
production version of a hello world
application is 100 something kilobytes
like close to 200 however and there are
unofficial attempt and unlike official
unreleased attempt that got this in 223
kilobytes which is ridiculous so and
that's like the whole angular and like
your own code for a hello world and the
bully feels that they include because it
later line a lot of mistakes features
and zoom GS itself it's considered the
blue field because it's now introdu like
it's now coming as part of the a
proposal for the Eggman script standard
to be like bar to the standard not just
angular so if you if you use you know if
use the CLI it will use the NGC the
anger compiler under the hood and we'll
do it used to be working with system GF
just threesome please they moved into
web back which makes it much easier for
them to do that what they call tree
shaking is as a debt could remove Lou we
already talked about sorry but you know
again there's a lot of things that are
happening there working closely with
telerik for the native script story and
I've seen a react native stuff
working with was anger to ionic also are
working very very closely with angular
to that they they are both going to
release almost at the same time most
likely at the same time and you can even
use the inner anger too because you
already have a flying carriages and
everything so you can also even create
desktop application was it using
electron why not so where are we now do
there is a release for going on I'm
expecting rc5 to be any time now there
were there are a few things that we're
plugging it because one thing I forgot
to write in this slide that you also
have a lot of the like usual stuff that
used to get to anger one like
internationalisation animation stuff
like that so there was an important bug
with animation that is now in their bull
tree waiting to be shipped with rc5 they
there are viewers are using google
closure compiler to get angry to
applications to crazy small things
although in your own experience you'll
not get that like the i think the
standard application and if mood will be
about two megabytes the if you build
broad you will get about close to 200
kill about it but you know we have seen
examples you know that let go to like 25
23 in 20 however there is one big thing
that's going to happen that will make
you angry one guys feel like okay it's
all the same you know they're going to
have modules just like anger one so at
first they were like we don't need to
make our all modules yes 2015 we're cool
however now there they realized i need
to know which components I need to bring
co biol with the flying compiler and
include in this bundle and which
components to lazy loot
and even when the components I lazy load
you know they'll have their own
providers and services and other related
components oh haha how would I call a
bundle of stuff that should be compiled
together and that is going to be ab
modules that's a big thing that's going
to happen before the release to enable
the work for the router and the ng
compiler to to happen and if you like
the best way to know about this is if
you follow the weekly meeting notes for
the angular team so we'd like to see
what what the July tool gives us do we
have time we were way over time already
so I'm not sure if anybody would like to
see that maybe after lunch you know come
and you know I'll show you what what
structure gives or you know what let's
just go very very very quickly into this
so what you get is just a packages to
Jason was also require the modules
because of the silly thing about you
know being to modulars that you get too
many modules and it it gives you the
broker and typescript configuration
let's let thing called TS conflict to
Jason which already uses the very very
latest version of java script that still
in beta club strip too and then all your
app is here in that folder story source
app folder everything starts with the
end ex off so is the main and that's
where you have your your own
bootstrapping and then it includes the
app component for you so generate the
app component by default when it when
it's a new also it includes selenium
like good the feeling the protractor
framework I don't think many have been
using it for frankly run but it already
generates it and it generates it in a
very nice way because
this is a beige object so your test will
just use that the beige object which
traps the actual selectors it's just to
Lenny me choose the name under the hood
and you might have hit Scott Island say
oh I have to include browser include so
many tutor on this latest version of
protractor saves you most of the imports
you see all the described and before
each and eight I didn't need to include
them the only thing I did really was
just a bitch object and also it gives
you an this a little bit of a hidden gem
it gives you this public folder any
anything you boot in here will be copied
as is to to your version like your
production version that you include and
it's very useful for for me for demos if
I want to simulate calling a JSON API
without really having a node server
whatever I just put a JSON file in here
and you know call it unfortunately i'll
be able to show much because the time
but you you can go to goo stop dotnet
and just enter your email or be sending
a few links related to a couple of free
books for angular 2 and you come and
talk to me i'm having a lot of people
asking for some private and you have to
work shop and just trying to figure out
logistics how to do that so if you are
interested talk to me you know to
include you in that make sure to come to
the anger to session after the break for
more advanced version of what I've been
saying and yeah if you don't talk to me
I'll be around read if I booth in
another floor I think the seats you must
be so tired thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
