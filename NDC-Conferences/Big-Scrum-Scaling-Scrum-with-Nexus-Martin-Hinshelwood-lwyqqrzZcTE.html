here apart from those that I met last
night at dinner there were the workshops
my name's Martin Hinchey woods I'm a few
things I do I do various things I'm one
of those weird people that sits in both
the process and the tools space so I
have to have arguments with myself all
the time over whether it's a tool
question or a process question that's
the way I look at it but is actually
weird I have a lot of customers that
call me and they want me to deal with
their tools problems but they don't let
me touch the scrum process and I have
other customers that call me for the
scrum thing and don't let me touch the
tools thing there's some some weird
thing going on there you can tweet me
out at mr. hench
and I just wanted to say where I come
from where my background is I like I
said them a lot of things I'm a
professional scrum trainer with scrum
dot-org so I work with Kench Weber out
of Boston and I'm a visual studio ALM
MVP
anybody here know what the MVP program
is yes you people cool I don't think
there are visual studio ALM MVPs anymore
I think we're developer tools and VPS
with DevOps or something I don't know
but that's what I call it and I also
work with the visual studio ALM Rangers
as well MVP you get for being loud and
obnoxious yeah being in the Rangers you
actually have to contribute working
software in order to get in there so
it's kind of a balancing act
anybody here planning on coming to NDC
also awesome so if you're coming to NDC
Oslo after NDC Oslo we will be doing
Tough Mudder in Scotland so you're
welcome to join us jakub's going to be
there along with some of the other
speakers so we're going to do Tough
Mudder on the Sunday for anybody that
doesn't know what that is it's an 18
kilometer obstacle course designed by
the British Special Forces so it's kind
of fun it sounds much worse than it
actually is but you get to tell people
that that's what you've done so it's
kind of kind of fun so enemies
interested you can you
use the link there I work with many
customers on both tools and practices
not although I'm based in Scotland I
kind of work all over the place I think
I've last year I had 38 customers in 14
different countries so I travel all over
the place all over the world which is
kind of fun but I don't get to see my
house very often I spend about 300 days
a year on the road which is kind of fun
but it means that I get to see a lot of
strange things that customers do because
customers call me when they've your
problems a lot of people ask me you know
what what do most people do and I have
to say I really don't know what most
people do I only know what the really
messed up people do because they're the
ones that call me so my picture of of
the world of software development is a
very jaded one of her practices bad
software delivery and terrible terrible
software but that's just because I'm a
consultant but an interesting thing that
I found and anybody heard at the Kaos
report yes some have you read it or just
heard of it because I think it cost like
$5,000 to buy it's ridiculously
expensive but they do a bunch of stats
they collect data from thousands of
projects software projects around the
world I think it's about 60% u.s. 40%
rest of the world and they collect it
and there's a bunch of key pieces of
information that kinda came out of the
2015 version that I like to mention at
the start the first is that and I used
to get a lot of people saying to me that
scrum only works for small projects it
doesn't work for big stuff you heard
that one before well the first time last
year I get somebody say to me I'll scrum
only works for big projects you
shouldn't use it for small ones next
Kelly what it's kind of a bit weird but
it's flipped on its head but if you look
at the actual stats for projects true
enough small projects are 32% more
likely to succeed than traditional
project management if you use scrum and
agile
32% quite a bit but if you look at large
projects six hundred percent more likely
to succeed so scaling is where the
biggest benefits are many teams working
together are where the biggest bonuses
are there's a couple of weird things and
that I like to mention as well one is
that your customers are happier if you
don't deliver what they ask for
that's an interesting one but if we
deliver what they need no that's what
they'll love you for and that's part of
that empirical process that's why we
need a new way of doing things so that's
that's I think is a really powerful
quote and the other one if you look at
people that are doing they use the word
waterfall a lot they really mean
traditional software development or not
agile
yeah because many organizations do I
think the most common process in the
world is no defined process we just make
some stuff up and and do that so I think
that's included in in waterfall because
generally it looks kind of staged Gaetti
when you just make up your process and
one of the key factors to success is
having highly skilled teams if your
teams are not highly skilled
professional teams you're not going to
be able to deliver working software or
as much working software as you would
like so I'm not saying that purely
skilled teams don't deliver anything
they do because hundreds of thousands of
companies out there are building
software many of them are building bad
software but it's still software that
somebody gets value out because people
are paying for it yeah but it could be
so much better it could provide so much
more value to us the customers than it
does if they had highly skilled teams
and it's actually very rare in my
experience but again I go with a lot of
the the customers that have problems and
so there are four things I kind of want
to cover the first one is the cost of
scaling I'm actually going to convince
you not to scale because it is a bad
idea it's just a bad idea
do it unless you have to and then talk
about how we get there
why do what do we need to get their way
do we why can we not use the commonly
expressed scaling frameworks that are
out there why are they bad why they're
not going to work for us
we made first assertion and then I want
to talk about how we can use scrum to
scale scrum do we need anything else if
we do need other things what are those
things that we need in order to make it
better and then I want to go through if
we've got time I usually try and get
through as many as I can but I have a
big list of practices that are super
useful in that world and some of them
are practices that you'll be doing
already okay
these practices are applicable
regardless of the process you're
following but if you're trying to build
software its scale some of them become
less optional okay so I'm going to talk
about that so the cost obviously if I
have two teams I can deliver twice as
much work yeah four teams four times as
much work yeah well that's what our
project managers believe yeah because
people are just widgets when you just
add them up but it's not really true you
don't get that you don't get that but at
the top and really what happens is that
thing more people get together I said
this this idea applies regardless of
whether you're talking about a team or a
group of teams working together and we
know with the sweet spot is four or
what's the recommend recommended size
for scrum teams so three pizzas that's a
good one I like that one in the scrum
guide it would say six plus or minus
three so if you get less than three
people why don't you just sit next to
each other and build some software yeah
you don't need scrum you don't need any
kind of process if you've got more than
nine people it's probably you can't feed
them with two pizzas and it's going to
get a little bit complicated to know
what's going on that's why you have that
sweet spot
and that sweet spot kind of applies in
exactly the same way two teams working
together if you have two teams working
together maybe you don't need to worry
too much you just get two groups just
have them talk maybe sit in the same
building in the same room and talk to
each other got three teams starts to get
a little more complicated
six teams you maybe need something ten
teams you're going to have even more
problems because then you're hitting
that greater complexity issue okay so
you want to be able to simplify that as
well I don't remember if I have a slide
on that but anybody here get more than
nine teams working together okay so you
don't need to you know need to worry
about it anyway I have a customer in
Norway that I work with that has I think
it's just over 80 teams in 12 locations
in nine different countries building one
product so that's kind of fun that's
kind of difficult that's kind of like
office sized groups of people but what
really happens and you'll notice if
you've worked on any large-scale project
is when you get a little bit too many
teams working together productivity
starts to drop off you start delivering
less value to the customers because
things are just too complicated
there's everybody stepping on each
other's toes getting in the way so my
advice to you is if you don't have to
have more than one team don't have more
than one team have one team working on
your product if you can scaling is not
the solution you're looking for anybody
read Jeff Sutherland new book scrum
twice the features in half the time Jeff
Sutherland is he's effectively a venture
capitalist one of the founders of scrum
he has company buys organizations that
are failing at delivering software
implement scrum and then sells them for
much more than they paid for them that's
what they do for a living so it works
for him twice the features and half the
time that's four hundred percent
improvement so why don't you just take
that one team that you've got and make
them 400% more effective then trying to
add four more teams and all the
complexity that comes with that
yeah so we had this thing called scrum
and unfortunately most teams especially
almost all teams that I see most teams
that I hear about aren't doing what I
would call professional scrum they're
doing what I can likes to call it
amateur scrum I don't like the word
amateur because it's there's a lot of
implication there but it's kind of true
I kind of like a mechanical scrum I
think a few people have been using the
word flaccid scrum that works too even
more connotation with that because what
are they doing they're just following
the rules that's it we're going to have
we're gonna have a daily stand-up which
isn't really the rule the rules Felix
gonna have a daily stand-up and yeah
that's it that's what we're going to do
and then we're doing we're doing scrum
aren't we yeah or even if we're
following all the rules are we actually
getting the value from it that we're
expecting to get from it so if you're
not getting at least twice as much value
delivery as you did before you
implemented scrum you're probably not
yeah
very few teams get the 400 percent but
you can get pretty close to it so what
we can have ended up with when teams
tried to implement scrum or something
more like this because they focused on
following the rules the rules of the
magic you know the magic fire-breathing
cat riding the unicorn that's going to
solve all our problems
okay it's not we need three things to
have an effective professional team we
still need the rules yeah I like to
think about it if you guys went out and
you bought the board game Monopoly you
have that here pretty sure it's
everywhere by monopoly would you expect
it to come with a rulebook or a strategy
gate come the rulebook is the rulebook
going to help you win that monopoly no
you just you need to understand the
rules to be able to play effectively
within the scope that you're playing in
you need some kind of technical
excellence domain knowledge
understanding of your not only your
product domain but also your
at technical demand and then maybe we
need something to help us help guide us
so that we don't make the wrong
decisions and that's our values and
principles our moral compass making sure
that we're not delivering software which
doesn't totally work we can it doesn't
have time to finish all the testing last
sprint but we're going to ship it anyway
is that respectful to your customers
your customers expect working software
or buggy nasty software that doesn't
always work and what have you trained
them to expect that's an interesting one
for those that haven't been following
the changes to the scrum guide last year
scrum that org and Jeff Sutherlands
realized that the values weren't as
prominent and the scrum guide as they
should be so they added them right up
front in the scrum guide and these are
the values that you need to add to your
scrum process in order to help guide
decision-making to making the right
decisions so we need we need courage we
need courage to show exactly what's
going on even when it doesn't look good
sometimes we're building software and
things go wrong things look bad yeah
that's not the end of the world we need
to go fix it no blame fix it we need
focus to actually get work done so our
product owner needs to leave us alone
during the sprint to go build stuff our
customer needs to allow us to have focus
we need that sprint goal to have focus
our development team needs commitment to
delivering working software notice I did
not say commitment to delivering
everything in the sprint I said
commitment to delivering working
software I don't care how much as long
as it works at the end because that's
the thing that matters we need to
respect our customers by delivering high
quality software that they expect and we
need the openness to be able to say it's
not quite what you expect or this is
what we've delivered to all of those
things we need all of those things
together so for me if you guys don't
have what I'm defining as a professional
team all
three of those elements we're doing it
the right way for the right reasons with
the engineering excellence and following
the rules you're not a professional
scrum team and you're never going to be
able to scale you need a professional
scrum team first because if you take to
amateur scrum teams and stick them
together what's the result going to be
an even bigger car crash okay so if we
can agree that that's the foundation for
scaling we no need to talk about how do
we go about scaling why do we need to
scale and how do we get there how do we
get to this scale so I'm going to M
culture the thing that is going to block
all of your ability to change and
continually does which I'm sure you've
run into is culture I mean you get a
good definition of culture because I
have one here how we do things here is
your culture so when you want to do
continuous delivery in your organization
and we want to deliver working software
every day we want a new version of our
software shipped to production every day
and the company goes well that's not the
way we do things here our customers will
never accept that it's actually not true
you can change those cultures but those
are the things you run into and there's
a lot of things which impact that and
I'm going to use an example here to give
you an idea there's a lot of scaling
frameworks out there others are a very
expensive complicated diagrammed famous
one that is one of the the most common
ones done it's scale because it's easily
purchased and I want to explain why just
taking the way somebody else implemented
something if you heard of the Spotify
model there's a Spotify whitepaper and
loads of people take it and implement it
the Spotify guys laughter I saw fit
people that do that because they know
it's not going to work for you because
it works for them in their culture and
here's five language use the the
Schneider model just as an example I
don't necessarily want to debate the
merits
danger model but let's see we have a
people orientated culture on the
left-hand side of our x-axis and our
company or entity on the right-hand side
I'm sure you can think of your company
and where it might fit on that from very
personal based all the way over to
corporate based and then if we take our
vertical access of innovation at the
bottom so we have a lot of competing
ideas and we try start from the
experiment all the way up to actuality
is all about you know what's the problem
now and let's fix that okay what's the
next problem now and let's fix that so
we're not necessarily innovating we're
solving the problems of today was
actually makes sense okay so if we were
to break that into quadrants let's say
the top right is can we succeed by
keeping and gaining control I'm sure you
have some companies that you've worked
with that that's their mantra yeah we
control everything a little bit more
everything will just turn out well with
a more detailed plan and if all the
developers would just follow every task
at the time start time and end time that
they were told to everything would work
out okay so that's the control culture
every company has a little bit of
control these are not absolutes I'm
drawing them as absolutes but you sit
somewhere in the model and that so let's
control other companies we succeed by
being the best at who we are that sounds
fair so we're craftsmanship
professionalism achievement efficiency
that's competence
nobody has no competence ever well I've
worked with some companies that maybe
fall right at the top of that bar but
most people are have a percentage of of
these things as competence or we succeed
by working together we're going to take
a group of people we'll work together
and we'll deliver working software so
it's all about interaction and Trust and
partnership and all of companies and
every one of these quadrants build
software yeah so that's a collaboration
and then we have the final one we
succeed by growing
for who fulfill our vision I can I can
think of at least one company that sits
in there and Netflix so they focus on
the people so creativity it's all
subjective it's based on faith there's
not not any the the rules that you would
find in normal organizations and that's
like kind of a cultivating culture I
will cultivate the people they will grow
and they will deal with weather problems
that come up and figure out what's best
to solve our company problems can be
very if you're in control cultivation is
totally idealistic and unworkable yeah
but there are come companies out there
now that is annoying if it does it again
I will need to do something okay so I
want you to think about where your
company is right now think about your
organization the organization you work
in are your customers if you're a
consulting company and where did they
sit on this was I right of course I
wasn't I might have been close but it's
not going to be exact because there's
too many variables what about where
where's your company going where's their
what's their plan for change every
company has some sort of plan it might
be stay where we are that might be their
plan but is your company going to that
be location probably not probably going
somewhere else on that grass maybe it's
closer to at control maybe it's closer
to competence maybe it's closer to
cultivation whatever your company wants
to go can we get there via straight-line
we're just going to make a change and it
happens you just go there no it doesn't
work because every single organization
that you guys work for has a different
culture they have a different culture a
different place right now and they're
going somewhere different it's unique to
every company in their journey is unique
and you probably have something more
wavy and wiggled all over the place till
you get to where you want to be but the
idea that you can have a blueprint for
how an organization should offer
and just apply it to your organization
is completely unreasonable and it may
work in some places it may partially
work in other places but in most places
it's not going to work you can you can
squish people as much as you like into
the same round hole but if they're
square it's not going to fit you can
shave the edges off but people be
unhappy to leave so I don't want to have
some methodology that I'm going to go
into in an organization
I want companies just like a scrum team
doesn't have a methodology they have a
framework and they build their own
methodology for building software in
their company with their culture around
that we want the same thing at scale we
want to limit the rules have the minimum
set of rules the minimum set of
mandatory happenings as possible and
allow everything else to go with
practices and I also try and avoid the
word best practices because there's no
such thing as best practice it's only
adequate practices for the current
culture that changes practice exchange
so I want to use scrum to scale scrum
because that sounds reasonable but we
need we need something to call it
because we want to refer to it just like
we refer to scrum when you refer to
scrum you're talking about one team
scrum applies and focuses on one team
look at the scrum guide and nowhere does
it mention two teams working together
yeah it's about one team so what is a
group of things working together it's
kind of a nexus yeah so scrum - argh
have their their Nexus framework which
is an implementation of scrum at scale
to try and help people again the rule
book rather than the strategy guide in
figuring out what that looks like so
I've got the scrum diagram they're
fairly fairly straightforward to ever be
familiar with scrum obviously you're
here so you're probably already familiar
with it anyway this is the nexus diagram
I've highlighted the differences there's
not that many we have a couple of extra
little mini events happening because we
need to enshrine additional
communication paths because things are
more complicated when you're building
software with groups of people yeah we
need to make sure that certain
Communications has to happen ok we've
also got an extra kind of group of
people there called the integration team
I'll talk about that a little bit in a
little bit but we're still making
working software we're still following
the same fundamental rules at the end of
the Sprint we have fully integrated
working software one piece of working
software not we get nine teams
so we've get nine features in nine
different branches you are not building
working software then you're building
nine different pieces of working
software you've still got to do work to
merge them together so at the end of
that sprint you have one piece of
working software that your product owner
can choose to ship to production that
makes sense same as scrum so no
additional difference there so what are
these things well we've got our our
diagram we're going to have a bigger
backlog it's just going to be bigger
refinement file you could maybe in one
scrum team in a simple domain get away
with not doing a lot of refinement what
used to be called grooming the backlog
refining the backlog you now have no
option but to refine the backlog because
you get multiple teams working together
you need enough understanding of the
dependencies between items in your
backlog to be able to work that across
multiple teams that's pretty difficult
so we're going to take that
understanding of the backlog so we need
a lot more understanding of the backlog
and we've got this new thing called the
Nexus sprint planning which really
includes two things we've got some kind
of group of people I like to call this
the team of teams approach you heard of
that expression team of teams team of
teams is whatever needs to happen you
have an event people have to turn our
pass it the people who turn off are the
right people yeah somebody doesn't turn
off they don't care they don't care
they're probably not valuable to be
there anyway yeah so we want
representatives from all of the teams to
up at this meeting because we're going
to discuss dependencies the dependencies
that are going to impact how we're going
to deliver things during the sprint
because we've got nine teams and we
might have one feature that needs three
teams worth of work combined together in
the same sprint got to figure that out
that's hard but it's reality so we're
going to have a little group of people
get together and then pass that
information back to the teams while they
do their their normal sprint planning
but they have extra input to their
sprint planning make sense the reason
that kind of nrfu is kind of like a
relative being one box it's a kind of
stack of boxes is because I might have
multiple teams across multiple time
zones if I get a team in the US a team
in India a team in Australia I'm not
going to be able to do all of those
meetings at the same time so this nexus
sprint planning is probably over a
48-hour period yeah that's just reality
reality of time zones big teams okay and
then we need something to show all of
the work that's underway that's what the
Nexus Sprint backlog is we need to see
everything from all the teams that's
underway but we want to be able to
compartmentalize it and see just one
team's work at this point you're
thinking how do you do that without a
tool you probably can't okay at this
point and at this scale you're probably
going to need some kind of tools I'm a
TFS guy I'm going to recommend TFS or V
STS I think it's a tool that's built by
a scaling team to do scaling the STS
team is about 70 teams working together
to build one product so they're using
their own product to build it JIRA does
work there are other tools out there you
can knit together your own solution as
all kind of things to do that but we
need those two views we need to be able
to see one team's work so that a team
you can see their own work
we need to see everybody's work together
cool we're going to have a more
complicated daily exercise everybody's
going to have their daily scrum in
different time zones so we need
a team of teams to get together this is
not the same as scrum of scrums scrum of
scrums was the scrum masters get
together
this is representatives of the team get
together so it may yes you're the scrum
master may be the one that goes but I
would prefer if it was members of the
engineering team because they're
discussing dependencies so they're going
to get together discuss dependencies for
the next 24 hours or 48 hours depending
on your time zones and then they're
going to take that information back to
their team cool so we've got that
communication on a daily basis we've got
it on our sprint basis and at our daily
basis we've only building one product so
we only have one review because we're
reviewing one product now that means
you're going to have to use additional
practices to figure out how to go
achieve that because getting 600 people
in 12 locations in nine different
countries together for one meeting is
going to be pretty difficult go figure
it out that's an engineering problem
that's a process problem there's loads
of good ways to do that some teams if
you're reasonably co-located do a
science fair style approach he's
familiar with the science fair you get
everybody in a room every team gets a
booth your stakeholders go to the booths
that they care about giving feedback for
and provide the feedback that's one way
the VSPs
team at Microsoft that build their
visual studio team services they at the
end of their sprint one of their sprint
outputs is a video of the features that
they did that gets sent out to all the
stakeholders and then their review is
just about providing feedback they don't
do any demos or anything you go watch
the video before you get there
how do you scale these things you've got
to come up with some kind of solutions
there's lots of strategies for that what
about an integration team we need a new
accountability we get three
accountabilities in scrum the
development team is accountable for
delivering working software the product
owner is accountable for maximizing
value and the scrum master is
accountable for the process
why do we integrate stuff together get
lots of teams working Theo so we kind of
need a new group that is like an
integration team and their
accountability is making sure that at
the end of the Sprint everything stuck
together now generally this is a team of
teams ie representatives from each of
the teams I worked with organizations
that call this their DevOps team or
their build team I would prefer it not
to be a permanent team
I want representatives of the
development teams because then they
bring that knowledge back to the
development teams and the development
teams on it themselves you've not got
the overhead yeah but they might have to
get together on a regular cadence to
help figure out dependencies help other
teams with their build process all of
those kind of things it's kind of like
our coaching role coaching the teams
helping them understand kind of putting
me out of a job but there you go and
then when we do our retrospective we've
kind of got two team of teams that has
to happen we have to take the problems
at the integration level ie all the
teams working together we have to come
up with a list of problems that we want
the teams to discuss give that as input
to the teams the teams take that plus
their own problems do a normal
retrospective with that information and
then they might have awesome ideas
output it so they put that together that
group get back together decides what the
Nexus wants to do as a whole so you
might have Nexus at commitments at the
end of the retrospective as well as
individual team commitments that goes
back to the teams and they figure out
how to achieve them the next break
there's your inspect and adapt loop
because it's slightly bigger problem so
we're still doing scrum there's very few
additional things in there in fact all
we've added is one role to give
additional accountability for
integration because we need somebody to
actually look after that because if we
don't see you guys are looking after
that nobody will if you've worked on
large-scale projects you'll know that's
what happens we've got a more
complicated planning because we've get
time zones we get a more complicated
daily scrum because we've hit time zones
these teams working together in
different places you
if you're in the same building it's the
same problem yeah it's just over a
shorter period of time and we've put one
review again to give that idea that
we're not having separate reviews so we
have two cannon in it and we have a
retrospective so we've actually not get
a lot of additional stuff there there's
not anything new and we've still got a
sprint backlog it's just bigger so yes
that was a good question so the question
is would you only have one backlog and
one product owner yes because you're
still doing scrum but the proton is
always bottom eight okay so in the scrum
guide the scrum allocates and maybe
using the wrong terminology scrum
allocates 10% of the development teams
time to help a trial attorney with
backlog refinement okay so if you've got
a team of six people plus a product
owner you've got the product owner
full-time potentially I know there's
bottlenecks and they have other duties
as well but let's see part 1/2 half time
role managing the backlog may be full
time and then you've got in a two-week
sprint a whole day per person for your
team members so that's six Mondays to
help the product owner okay well if you
have nine teams of six working together
yeah so that's that's how you scale that
now you're going to have at some point
maybe the product owner has additional
help somewhere that's that's that's kind
of okay when you get to really big scale
or you might break it down differently
for example the the the bsp team
effectively run multiple nexuses they
have some groups that it's one team
working on part of the product and other
places where there's two or three teams
working together when it's two or three
teams working together there's one
product owner when there's one team is
one product owner so that's not one
product owner for the entire product
it's for each part of the product this
company's product think of all
it's not the same product owner
forwarders for excel yeah but they ship
one product in the box so there's ways
to break down again you're getting into
practices now so you might have product
area owners might be the case you have
break your product into area so but it
depends on the complexity of your scale
did that answer your question answered
it both ways I said have one product
owner and then I said you can have
multiple product owners practices the
product owners in different areas not
having the same priorities yes and
that's a really difficult problem to
solve it's so difficult in my scrum
master class I have a whole whole set of
exercises around thinking about those
ideas because there's no hard and fast
rules it depends on the situation
some organizations they have a one
product owner but lots of product area
owners but the product owner makes the
final call you need one person or I've
worked with a company in the u.s. that
makes coffee and they had the problem of
I think it was nine different area
owners and they didn't have an uber so
just lock them in a room with a computer
and it's the only computer that can
order the backlog you guys figure it out
your business people solve that problem
yeah does that make sense for everybody
any other questions on Nexus and the
additional yes
that's that's a really good question so
and none of these meetings are any
longer I'll caveat that so you're Dale
your your your sprint planning is your
normal sprint planning if you're doing
in scrum sprint planning is defined as
eight hours or proportionally less for
smaller Sprint's so generally a team
that is doing two-week Sprint's will do
no more than a four hour sprint planning
meeting fair right this bit of the star
is 15 minutes if it's taking longer than
15 minutes your stuffs too complicated
you don't understand the backlog enough
of refinement wasn't done yeah if you
understand what's coming up next that
should be an easy right we're just gonna
have a discussion around the
dependencies representative of each team
get together figure it out or can take
that information back to your teams that
should be pretty straightforward because
remember the teams select the work from
the backlog so you have to have that
agreement up front about what are we
going to organize together to go do the
dessert yeah
yep we'd have too much control and there
would be too many points in the chain
and the message would get lost
yeah same as what we have the difference
between traditional organizational
hierarchical structure versus the noise
based structure the agile fosters you
push responsibility down in the
organization the teams have
responsibility and accountability for
delivering working software of deciding
what software they're going to go build
off the backlog the product owner sets
strategic direction and goals in the
backlog but just cuz some things that
the top two things in the backlog might
not be the things the team selects based
on the Sprint goal that is agreed with
the product owner at the beginning of
the Sprint yeah to get focus spring goal
gives you focus so yeah you're probably
going to have an access goal as well
what's the overriding goal and then the
each team has their own goal that goes
to fulfilling that larger goal did that
cool so it shouldn't shouldn't be longer
than 15 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes
wai-wai-wait be longer than that same
for daily scrum yeah even if they're
getting together and it's taking longer
than 15 minutes you probably get too
many teams same as your normal daily
scrum as I have too much work going on
or your teams are too big if you get
more than nine teams in your Nexus
you're going to have that problem same
as if you get more than nine people in
your grumpy sure ah yes indeed you can
so those aren't talking about it in here
but the I teach a class from the dork on
scaling scrum I teach you the
programming Vic Ling in in Norway and
it's this tunnel over Europe but the
there's an idea of Nexus plus so I'm
going to have multiple Nexus working
together to build one bigger piece of
software so for example if you think of
something like office you might have a
nexus for excel I don't think it split
up that wave you have a nexus for excel
words exchanged sharepoint and then
they're all working together to have
compatibility across and dependencies
across all of their products yeah it's
taking into account the reality that the
more people you put together more
complicated it gets and at some point is
too complicated same as a scrum team but
20 people in a scrum team and see how it
gets on yeah 20 teams together have the
same problem and I do see it time and
again in organizations trying to get too
many teams working together on one
product and the product owner bottleneck
is the most common one in fact just not
having a product owner at all is the
most common dysfunction that I see in
organizations I think very few
organizations I've ever been in to
actually have somebody who's a product
owner that's their biggest problem so
they're not even if their teams are
awesome they're still not delivering the
right software you need your product on
a first deliver the right software at
least deliver the right software even if
it's badly built at least is right so
some practices that will help you I've
taken a selection of practices from the
course the scaling professional scrum
course the course talks about about 50
different practices that are useful on
top of you know the other conversations
around scrum and scaling and those kind
of things so my first one that I
mentioned before descale if you've got
60 people working together to build one
product and they suck at it you probably
don't want them working together
building one product you probably want
to scale it back go back to individual
teams encourage those teams to be
awesome make individual awesome teams
and then bring them back together to
build one product once the our
professional teams rather than amateur
teams and then you'll get more a nicer
integration it's all about maximizing
the value that you're delivering at the
end of the day that's what we're all
here for that's where our customers are
paying us for delivering value to them
yeah various ways to help with that
something that that Ken's been talking
about a lot recently is something called
grumble it's the the scrum equivalent of
pulling the chain in Kanban in Toyota
and the production lanes if a person
who's running their particular station
in the production line finds any sort of
problem we've got a chain next to the
production line but mixing their station
that they pull it stops the entire
production line and all the managers
come down to figure out how do we solve
whatever the problem is that resulted in
building the chain and they may pull the
chain two or three times a day combat
they're working in a production line a
production line is effectively a much
simpler process in those I'm not
belittling the complexity of creating it
but once it's running it's the same
thing all the time software is not like
that software is different all the time
otherwise we wouldn't build it in the
first place so we may get to the point
where we have a significant enough
technical debt that it is almost
impossible to add new features to the
product yeah if you monitor the number
of features that you add to the product
year-on-year you'll find as you go on it
will get less because you're not
cleaning up after yourself you don't
necessarily have professional teams
you're not necessary any teams here got
a definition of done so that says it all
not a single hand went up if you don't
have a definition of done how do you
know when you're done at the end of the
Sprint how do you know you've met the
minimum quality bar and your shipping
yourself where how do you know whether
you've to do tests for this story or not
while it's not our done so we'll just
skip it for this story of the Sprint
it's ok it looks good ship it ok now
you've shipped and there's some sort of
problem in it because you didn't test it
that's technical debt that builds up
over time every time you don't go back
and refactor that shortcut you took when
you didn't know enough technical debt
that stuff is going to bite you in the
ass later you got to go back and fix fix
it so at some point you get to the stage
where it's too difficult to add new
features you need to stop adding new
features because you're just adding to
the problem spend some amount of time
paying back enough technical day
refactoring some react acting maybe
upgrading technologies whatever it is
that happens to be the problem and we'll
get you there and then restart that
sprinting process so this is we're
completely stuffed and we need to fix
fix the problem are having some kind of
dependency map to help you with cross
team refinements when you're refining
work across multiple teams there's
multiple things going on you might have
something this is a technique you can
come to my class figure out how to do
the technique or you can google it as
well but effectively arrows pointing
this way are have a dependency sorry
correct
dependency ie the dependency is on this
side of the thing you want to do whereas
if the adult you've got arrows pointing
this way you know that it's trying to be
done before something that it's
dependent upon so you can't do that and
you have to figure that out across teams
and things that are verticals are
dependencies within the same sprint and
again having some way of visualizing
this having some way of making sure you
know that these things are happening and
will help your teams figure out the
dependencies even if you just get two
teams sometimes this makes sense three
teams it makes a lot more sense and this
is color-coded by what what the problem
is you might have people dependencies
between teams that's okay just deal with
it that's the real world and we've only
get one database analyst that
understands that part of the schema and
three teams need that person well you
gonna have to figure it out cross
training pairing doing things in
sequence all of those type of things are
scaling teams it's very difficult to
just go get a 80 people and magically
have eight awesome teams or ten awesome
teams or whatever number you end up
having it works a lot better if you
start small make one awesome team
building that product that awesome team
will have a demonstratable velocity
if that velocity is too low you rather
meet the team better or add additional
teams and sometimes it makes sense to
break those teams up into smaller teams
and then add people so that's the
splitting and building up model or you
might have something more like an
internship model where people rotate
through you have one team that is you
know these guys are rock stars and will
rotate people have internships through
that team and then into their own teams
that can work too can you imagine the
company that I was mentioning before
with 80 teams and a ridiculous number of
countries they had not a single team on
the same cadence so they were all
delivering software on different
Cadence's yet they had to create our C's
and betas and how does that work well
you end up with a lot of buggy software
being shipped to customers because
people aren't finished so if you're
going to have multiple teams working
together get them on the same cadence if
you can't get them on the same cadence
at least get them on our and you know if
you're doing do four week agencies and
then some teams can do one week in two
week but you can't do three week that
makes sense it will multiplier of the of
the cadences to at least at the point in
time when we say this is our line in the
sand for the whole Nexus we've got a
working version of software from
everybody that works ah this is an
obvious one you probably run into this a
lot feature teams I don't know I've been
bashing my head against this one for
about ten years
feature teams is absolutely key yes you
can do component teams but it's a
nightmare for dependencies absolute
nightmare the way you minimize
dependencies feature teams and yes it's
difficult if it wasn't difficult we
wouldn't be building a software that's
just the way it is our communities of
practice those old silos in our
organization so we used to have tests
have customers that still have that have
tests and QA or
marisol ization whatever you want to
call it and then you might have
operations and you might have what else
might you have I don't know analysts all
these silos ditch the silos create
communities of practice people that
where the managers for those silos
should become community leaders yes
they're not necessarily going to be the
right person for that job totally get
that but give them the option and then
you have communities of practice across
your team so you have cross-functional
teams not necessarily cross-functional
individuals but cross-functional teams
that can tackle almost any feature that
comes in and yes you may have some
specialist areas but that's just reality
you know this team can take this feature
that this other team can't that's okay
but make sure you have communities of
practice so you don't lose some of those
skills you don't lose the tester skills
you don't lose the automation skills you
don't lose the analyst skills make sure
they can all get together and and have
some kind of cross-pollination of ideas
across the team's famously used to do in
the silos yeah
any doing communities of practice right
now you guys community practice are
awesome is a very different style of
organizing the knowledge but it works it
works really well and is result in much
better value to your customer because
you're able to share that knowledge and
just because I'm a coder doesn't mean I
can't go to the testing community of
practice I want to go find out a little
bit more about testing so that I don't
make my tester as unhappy as my code
does yeah our usual micro-services
breaking how do you take that bigger
product with one product owner and not
have to deal with scaling make your
product smaller break it into micro
services that are independent products
can be released on an independent
schedule but may have dependencies with
nice contracts between those pieces of
software that will solve some of your
problem it's not a silver bullet but
they seen many teams solve almost all
their problems by moving toward
more micro services today architecture
that works as well you don't need to
scale good scaling is that scaling is
always bad okay have some way to relate
things that you're doing up a kind of
hierarchy of work items I'm a TFS guy
and we have epochs in TFS that break
down into features which break down into
backlog items which then break down into
the tasks and you can monitor that
hierarchy your product owner might only
care about features that can be okay
that's another way to scale your
products order goes up one level the
team's write their own stories the teams
deal with the execution as long as it
rolls up to the feature product owners
happy again granularity depends you are
going to have to have some sort of tool
you're going to have fields you're going
to have data you're going to have to
know which team things in your back
covers can you imagine having your your
Nexus backlog on this wall and five
sprint backlogs on this wall and you've
got to keep them in sync
yeah that's going to kind of suck isn't
it okay so digital to move stuff around
again I get TFS up here because that's
my comfort zone your comfort zone might
be JIRA or Trello or something else as
long as you can create the
visualizations that works and that's an
old screenshot anyway
it even says Visual Studio online in the
corner which is very old our telemetry
users lie user feedback isn't always
awesome and users lie users will tell
you they need the kitchen sink when in
fact they're never going to use that
kitchen sink and the reason they tell
you that is because we've trained them
to give us that information because we
deliver on a yearly cadence I'm not
saying you do but you know in general in
the industry so when a customer says is
giving you requirements they give you
everything they think they might
possibly need at the time you would
deliver the software they may not need
half of that stuff
they just think they do right now but
they may not for the time you get there
so have some sort of telemetry in your
software monitor feature usage button
clicks super easy and web applications
with lots of options but you can do it
in applications as well this is one of
my application sites are just a
screenshot of a plication insights
that's showing the user sessions skip
pages but I use it for my applications
and I have command-line tools which I
gather the same sort of metrics for so I
can see how often my command-line tool
is executed what commands people are
executing how often they execute those
commands so when I'm thinking about
going and refining a feature spending
some time fixing bugs
should I go fix the bugs and refine the
features in the tool that nobody uses no
spend it not where I want but where it's
going to provide value to customers our
internal open source this is a huge deal
now within organizations anybody here
work in an organization with more than
100 engineers thousand engineers 10,000
engineers okay but 10 times more than
10,000 engineers go well 10 times people
that call themselves engineers ok I'm ok
with that
so internal open source is about
bringing if you've got a lot of users in
your organization bringing some of that
community and love in the open source
world internally so it might not be
stuff that is available on the internet
like you're not going to go and publish
your too long github but I want team 4
in in India and team 5 in Beijing to be
able to contribute and add pull requests
to my products because maybe they have
time to find and fix that bug that they
care about that I do not yeah so
internal open sources are a big deal in
many large organizations and it's it's
really powerful because you know do we
really need to write another logging
framework that's the common example but
there are hundreds of different ways
ways of doing that which is why open
source exists in the first place so
that's one of my favorite practices and
it's very
in organizations just now so I talked
that they have a thing I talked a little
bit about our not scaling and then we
kind of discussed or I get a given
example of why a methodology isn't going
to cut it yeah you're not going to be
able to use a methodology that somebody
else came up with a recipe for your
skill you're going to have to suck it up
and build your own skilling process
using practice plenty of practices out
there pick and choose the ones that make
sense for you but have some sort of
fundamental rules to make sure that you
don't go off target and you enshrine
communication paths within your
organization that's what Nexus is trying
to do enshrine communication only and
some of the some of the planning ideas
and then we covered Nexus I don't know
anybody here from visit your first
introduction to Nexus yeah so it's
something that I've been working with
for for quite a while now I have a
number of customers which have started
using it it was actually reverse
engineered 10 didn't just go oh Nexus
right and write it down he went out and
scrum the darks and a lot of people out
to various organizations around the
world that are known to be doing scrum
well at scale places like Spotify places
like Salesforce at Microsoft now is
doing very well in the in the scrum
world although sometimes Windows still
sucks which I'll get a problem but
that's an engineering issue rather than
a scrum issue
it was reverse engineered from from that
so they're trying to what is the minimum
that we need to do have any questions
cool if you've got any any questions
that you didn't want everybody else to
hear because your practices are so
ridiculously bad that you don't want
anybody else to know you're doing them
feel free to come up afterwards I have
business cards if you want them you can
find me online and I am happy to even
just answer questions if you have
questions even if you just want to email
me
also also happy to come and visit visit
your organization too if that is what
you want and by the way I must blunt in
person and an organization as I am here
so if if you want me to come and beat up
some people that don't know what they're
doing I'm perfectly good with that too
