defining your own success or failure you
are agile Yoda is often my guide
whenever I'm thinking about things with
regards to agile most of the principles
that he taught young Skywalker could
probably be attributed right back to the
manifesto metering the song there we go
okay so this is lien accessibility
building inclusive design into your
agile workflow I mentioned this last
night to some friends normally I give
this as an eight hour workshop for
different people on a team but we're
going to compress it into a single hour
as such I think it's important my name
is Elle Waters in case you need to know
that and you can find me on twitter at
nether lines and I love email I answer
email Elle it's simply accessible calm
the company that I work for we're a
globally distributed team so we have
team members and the United States and
Canada in the UK Eastern Europe
Australia Perth Australia and the
Philippines there was a period of time
where we all had this vision of how
beautiful and and lovely the idea of
waterfall development and we saw it as
we have all of this massive information
at the end of that there's going to be
this rainbow that will be this perfect
project that we launched on time on
budget meeting all of the stakeholders
expectations this is the reality the
stark cold reality often that waterfall
brings to developers which is that it
feels like of a massive amount of
requirements piling up on to you and
you're never on time never on budget and
always chasing after that dream a lot of
people look at accessibility and they
think of it as sort of the antithesis of
what you would experience with agile but
one of the things that I hope to be able
to share with you is that accessibility
and agile go together like peanut butter
and jelly that they are fantastic
partners in helping you succeed in both
of those goals so I am married to an
agile coach and we have a Kanban board
at our house we used it to put our son
into college and
I would be remiss if I didn't abide by
the time frame so I'm gonna try really
hard to stay in line with this it's
gonna be really difficult for me to do
but I put a put an alarm on my phone so
you'll hear it beeping which means at a
time move on because I want to respect
your time and I also want to be able to
buy by some of these principles which is
to time box what we're doing so we'll
talk about what accessibility is just a
brief overview and why consider
accessibility and then how to do
accessibility in a lean and agile way
and then hopefully we'll have a little
bit of time for a Q&amp;amp;A and discussion I
would love to talk to anybody afterwards
as well about this and I'll buy you a
drink tonight if you're going to any of
the after dark events so sprint one what
is accessibility this is what wikipedia
says web accessibility refers to the
inclusive practice of removing barriers
that prevent interaction with or access
to websites by people with disabilities
it's pretty straightforward
when sites are correctly designed
developed and edited all users have
equal access to information and
functionality that's kind of a mouthful
though so it's simply accessible we
basically save for every person for
every device or to put it simply making
things work for everyone regardless of
their abilities the web content
accessibility guidelines which is a set
of international standards creates this
really handy acronym called poor which
stands for perceivable operable
understandable and robust so all of
accessibility kind of falls under these
four principles if you're thinking about
the word perceivable basically an
example that would be providing text
equivalents and alternatives for content
so make me aware that that content
actually exists I don't have time to
share with you this video but I'll have
it on the slides it's definitely
something you should take a look at it's
a wonderful video about the importance
of captions and about the perception
that somebody needs as
primary form of content being captions
as compared to audio on multimedia the
second is operable a good example once I
know something is there allow me to be
able to use that thing whether it's a
control an interaction make
functionality available and typically
it's to keyboard and assistive
technologies because most of the time
you don't have difficulty making
something available to a mouse user
where we run into challenges is making
something available to a keyboard user
or somebody uses assistive technology
this is a good example of things that we
can never predict as web designers of
how people might be interacting with a
website that we've created this is a
curved keyboard for someone who uses a
stylus and it's curved because that way
he doesn't have to reach quite as far
with that stylus in order to be able to
tap out the letters on the keyboard this
is another example this is a refreshable
Braille device often it's used in
conjunction with a screen reader and the
interesting thing about this is not only
is it a really cool piece of technology
but it comes out in a linear format so
that changes how somebody consumes your
content because they're getting
everything in 80 characters at a time
understandable one example of course
would be make content readable intuitive
and predictable this is a version of our
website it's simply accessible and we
have this little bookmarklet that we use
to demonstrate what it might feel like
to have a learning disability like
dyslexia where oftentimes you'll be
transposing letters on the page as
you're reading so let's take a look at
this you can kind of make out what it is
we're building a and I think probably
because of the context you'd be able to
know that means digital world for
everyone and as you go down some words
very easy learn how and then
probably to navigate and if you go
through all of that you can decode all
of that that's that's something you
could probably do but it takes you
longer to decode than it does to just
read and this is not an exact replica of
what it's like to have dyslexia but it
gives the same feeling of frustration
and slower reading of content and the
need to be able to decipher exactly what
the word is that really communicates
that same kind of anxiety that
oftentimes people experience then
finally the last principle is robust
maximize compatibility with current and
future user tools is the easiest way to
explain it so make something as
backwards compatible as you can but also
make it as future-proof as possible the
reason for that being that assistive
technologies rely on a common language
in this case w3c valid code in order to
be able to interpret a website to be
able to use it and so if we're looking
at this we're really thinking about the
idea of creating semantic structured
code that is not device dependent this
is a good example this is open signal
back in 2015 so this has changed but
this is a graphic displaying all the
different possible screen resolutions
for Android devices and their market
share so this kind of gives you that
understanding if you're a big fan of
responsive web design and you understand
the value of making something pretty
independent then it's something that
you'll be able to keep in mind alright
so I'm almost out of time and I'm
nowhere near the end this is terrible
what different types of disabilities do
we need to think about most people think
about blindness or mobility it's the
first things that come to mind they also
think about deafness and sometimes they
think about people who have cognitive
disabilities like autism or they're
aging into dementia the truth is
somewhere much much much deeper much
greater there's so many different types
and layers of disabilities that it's
impossible to start thinking about
designing and developing
just for specific disabilities how many
people have disabilities there's often a
sort of an awkward question that we get
in the work that we do that this is
really just a small group of people this
is you know making something accessible
for this small and you know marginalized
user groups that may not even use your
website the truth is one in seven people
in the world have a disability according
to the World Health Organization and
google.com accessibility this is a
really important statistic that's
effectively 1 billion people in the
world or 15 percent so to put it in
developer terms 15 percent of the
world's population versus 5.2 percent of
Internet users are IE users and yet we
think about Internet Explorer as a
browser that we need to support all the
time so the Department for Work and
Pensions discuss something called the
purple pound here in the UK households
with a disabled person have a combined
income of 212 billion pounds after
housing costs so that's a pretty
impactful dollar or pound or euro
depending on where it is that you live
there's a statistic very similar to this
and many people have more than one
disability so people everyone lives on a
continuum with their own abilities and
challenges susana gonzales put this in
Smashing Magazine several years ago and
it was called designing for the extremes
and the idea is that if you design for
the extremes you meet the needs of the
many and so somewhere along this is
where most people find themselves in
that bell curve accessibility is not
binary all-or-nothing or black and white
and we have every shade of grey in
between so how you view this point will
frame up your ideas about accessibility
and what you do both today and going
forward all right so sprint one retro
definitely over time
I hope that was a general introduction
to accessibility and understanding sort
of the overarching sort of holistic
nature about the idea that this is
really about people more than it is just
about technology or it's about the idea
of making something usable more than it
is about making something compliant so
let's talk a little bit about why
consider accessibility accessibility as
an agile practitioner it's important for
me to think about what the value is it's
more than just something that is the
right thing to do we live in a world
that's a business driven world so we
need to consider what value means so
this is a overly cliche concept in a
game called family feud some of you guys
may have seen this television show kind
of surprised it's still on television
but the idea is basically we surveyed
several user experience and developers
and asked them why don't you include
accessibility and the work that you do
so
survey says the number one answer
accessibility is intimidating yes it is
this picture is not unlike what my home
office looked like the first year that I
was trying to understand everything
there was to know about accessibility
there is a mountain of information out
there there's no real clear way to know
how to get started if you look online
you see all of these different
techniques for testing for CSS for
client-side scripting for playing text
for aria for flash even Silverlight PDF
etc what do we call this in the
accessibility industry a good start
right because once you've learned these
things it's giving you what a foundation
to be able to go from there you don't
easily know how to put that into
practice in what you do every day and
then there's all these devices and it
can be very intimidating but
not only are you thinking about the work
that you do and the techniques you need
to learn but then there's all these
other devices that people with
disabilities may be bringing to your
website or your application and it's
kind of hard to know exactly what - what
they will be bringing and what you need
to account for sometimes they look like
a Casio keyboard this is what I thought
it was I honestly thought it was a
keyboard when I first saw it and then
there's even the most popular screen
reader out there has a menacing
terrifying name jaws so absolutely
accessibility is intimidating
survey says number two answer
accessibility is hard
yes but accessibility is hard because
good design is hard Apple who I consider
one of the one of the pioneers of design
is quoted as we believe that technology
should be accessible to everyone the
most powerful technology in the world is
technology that everyone including
people with disabilities can use we
don't design products for some people or
even most people we design them for
every single person so when you strive
for good design you're also usually
striving for inclusive design before you
even may realize it and when you're
striving for accessibility you're
actually raising the bar in your own
craft whether it be design or
development or being a product owner
you're changing the bar and the level of
its excellence to include everyone and
third and final answer that we got from
this survey accessibility is not my job
really so the real question is why are
we doing this if it's not your job to
build something for users why are you in
this business so we decided that we
would go back to the drawing board and
start looking at what the with a value
is so here's agile principles to the
rescue why consider accessibility at all
so a definition of value and ways to
measure it and then we can talk about
the value of lien accessibility and the
cost of delay and what accessibility
does for agile so according to christian
barrages founder of agile as' our agile
istic he put out several different
definitions for value in an agile world
there's commercial value there's market
value there's efficiency value customer
value and future value so if you were to
put lean accessibility into these
definitions for a commercial value it
increases the usability and speeds up
purchase paths without a doubt proven
analytically verifiable from a market
value perspective it increases potential
new customers absolutely you're talking
about 15% of the population efficiency
value it increases organizational
efficiency and decreases operational
costs absolutely accessibility mandates
clean semantic designs and code and a
standardized way to approach something
and because it requires that it makes
you better at those operational
processes customer value it increases
customer loyalty people with
disabilities have an inordinate amount
of brand loyalty once they find that a
website or a mobile application works
for them they will be always going to
that website in that mobile application
because you've made it that much easier
for that person to be able to conduct a
transaction make a purchase you know
accomplish a task future value if future
proofs the work to provide more value
later on you don't have to worry about
the next device that may be coming out
by the next major manufacturer maybe
there's another mobile operating system
that's coming out in a year you don't
have to worry about that because of the
fact that you've built things solidly
with a strong foundation and it's valid
so it's future proofed and be able to
handle any kind of device resolution as
well so
things to consider when you're back at
your job everything that you do to make
things work for someone that is blind or
deaf actually helps with findability
and SEO and everything that you do to
make things work for someone with low
vision or mobility challenges actually
helps with mobile users interactions
these user personas are very similar to
one another and everything you do to
make things better for someone with
cognitive difficulties making things
easier making things predictable and
consistent that helps everyone the cost
of delay so this is a concept about the
idea that the longer time you take the
more the less value there is in what you
deliver and it's an important agile
concept it's part of the idea about
delivering and release when ready and
delivering early and often with regards
to accessibility we worked with a major
airline client and they delayed the
project by two months and because of
that they didn't have time to be able to
incorporate accessibility into the
design phase and that was in January we
didn't get started until March or April
the idea was a planned release in June
and because they had to go back and do
all this rework again and again and
again
they're now six months overdue and six
months further into project costs and
they're launching hopefully next week
and so there's a real measurable lack of
value decreasing value the longer that
you delay with a project on the flip
side of that when we incorporate
accessibility early into that process
we're building components that include
accessibility things sail past any kind
of user testing and as a result of that
any kind of timeline for maybe
traditional UAT gets completely shrunk
as a result the power of the web is in
its universality access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential
so if you need a final word on the
matter probably Sir Tim berners-lee is
the right person to ask and ultimately
accessibility makes agile better because
it focuses on users it focuses on
testing it focuses on the idea of
continuous improvement all right so
let's see how we're doing
yes gain time back so the next piece is
really the part that I wanted to focus
on more because this is the kind of
thing that's really about the how-to so
how do I do
lean accessibility and the best way to
approach this I think is by looking at
individual roles so how many of you guys
are developers it's gonna be a guest
that there would be the majority of you
yeah how many of you guys do any kind of
UX or design and the work that you do a
couple yeah a little bit yeah and
there's maybe a couple of you guys maybe
you write stories I don't know it
depends on how your team is organized
sometimes it doesn't take just the
product owner to write stories so let's
look at this guiding principles being
agile minded it's much more important
than any kind of particular agile
methodology experimentation continuous
learning and improvements that create a
better online experience for users
that's what I would call being agile
minded so really lean accessibility is
the exact same thing experimentation and
continuous learning and improvements
that create a better online experience
for all users right so this is not a
fix-all so the no magic will occur in in
this in this talk or this session
however you do have permission to fail
and so often people look at
accessibility as that thing that they're
sort of terrified of making a mistake on
but one thing we know from what a jille
has taught us is that if you fail and
you're considering your users as the end
customer and you're always committed
improving you will always benefit from
that failure so fail you have permission
to make mistakes with accessibility and
I may get hauled off by the
accessibility police but it's worth
telling you guys that so that you know
that you're able to experiment and find
things that improve the user experience
so leading accessibility by role we'll
go through this somewhat quickly and
then we can talk a little more about
specifics if there is questions that you
have as developers so for product owners
product under guidelines for inclusive
design there are only two kinds of
stories that you need to write and three
kinds of requirements that you need to
define and no sleepless nights that you
should have in this so stories are by
definition at their purest form the
result of a shared understanding of the
need the solution and the value for the
user so what they are not is a newspaper
delivery drive by messages secret Clues
left for a team to interpret oftentimes
stories are written as the only form of
communication between a product owner or
business stakeholder and the team and
that's not really what stories are meant
to be write stories are meant to be
something that we all understand what's
happening and what the need is and the
requirements and this is just a document
that reflects that so stories that are
specifically about accessibility are
about the need being accessibility the
solution being accessibility and the
value being accessibility here's an
example of a story that's specifically
to fix a problem it's a remediation
story there's a problem on our home page
with the embedded Twitter feed it's
making keyboard users get stuck in the
iframe without the ability to do other
things on our website so that's what we
call a keyboard trap where you can tab
into like an iframe experience but you
can't get out of it so the need is about
accessibility the solution is to be able
to fix that particular keyboard
accessibility issue and the values
accessibility but also it benefits
anybody who's using just a keyboard
another example of a story would be that
accessibility is built-in
and so it's really part of the solution
and the value so another example of this
is maybe a new feature you want to put a
Twitter feed on your website
I want a Twitter feed on our homepage
that allows our users to read all the
latest tweets that we post in real time
so they'll buy more cool stuff from us
so that need is really about an embedded
fit a Twitter feed that's a feature that
you want to be able to introduce the
solution is whatever it is you've
decided how you want this to work plus
accessibility and the value is all the
stuff that you assume that you're going
to get deeper engagement people are
going to interact more maybe it'll
increase your purchasing power plus
accessibility and here are the three
requirement types for anything having to
do with building out accessibility into
an agile process there's one stuff
everyone should already know how to do
duh and so I'm using a teenager rolling
her eyes timeless best practices and
then things that are kind of snowflakes
so let's take a look at that let's say
that the story that you want to be able
to develop and design and develop is
about a modal dialogue so here's a
screen shot maybe you get a mock-up of
what it is and if you're looking at that
here's an example of accessibility
requirements for that modal dialog that
zip code field will look at the zip code
that zip code field should have a label
well that's kind of like telling a
developer to actually turn on their
computer in a lot of ways right because
that's something that you should know to
do if it's a form element it needs a
label and not just some orphan thing
that looks like a label but actually the
for an ID attribute right linked
programmatically that's something that
you shouldn't really have to explain
because it's just about doing things in
a valid and and well-structured way the
second requirement would be what we
would call timeless
best practices so using the Escape key
should close this modal dialogue that's
something that is the case regardless
it's always going to be an accessibility
requirement it's never going to change
in that sense so it's the kind of thing
that may not need to be in the story it
may be something you just keep in sort
of a best practices wiki and then the
last piece is really the stuff to focus
on as a product owner when you close the
dialog the focus should go back to and
it's very specific to that particular
designer development project so when
we're looking at this you have role
based job skills and that's really about
people knowing how to do their own craft
right if you're a developer you should
know how to be able to use HTML elements
in the way they were designed to be used
then there's sort of a knowledge wiki
and that's timeless things that will
always be true as far as accessibility
requirements about different things
having to do with forms having to do
with modal's having to do with
navigation elements and then there may
be unique story requirements and that's
what you put into the story and that's
basically any specific detailed thing
about that particular feature like where
the focus path should take a user after
they've closed it so UX and design leads
for those of you guys who do some UX 5
things to know about inclusive design
really that will carry you very far the
first obvious winds call it what it is
the second make it simple make it easy
the third make it consistent make it
predictable the fourth change your
perspective and assume nothing and the
last go see or the Japanese word gimble
so the first one obvious wins the
hamburger menu several years ago I think
it was Facebook who decided this would
be an awesome idea to roll out a new
design idea and they put together
stacked lines and they publish that and
they thought well maybe it would be
really
intuitive that people would understand
that behind those sacked lines or
hamburger or pancake is actually a menu
but there's an extensive amount of
usability research that's been done to
show that unlike ourselves who are web
professionals this is not obvious to
people and there's a lot of people who
still to this day don't understand what
that icon is supposed to be and they
found actually that the thing that made
this most understandable to people is to
put the word menu and so looking at that
recognizing that having the word menu
alongside of a hamburger menu is making
it really obvious right making it very
clear and easy to understand another
example this is a this is on our website
examples dot simply accessible comm and
we put a lot of different things
sometimes we put things that we're
testing and we're making purposefully
inaccessible but this is an example of
how we recommend people to treat forms
and validation and error messaging so
some of these things are built
specifically because of doing some
usability research and recognizing that
if you have multiple errors on a page
you want to group them all together at
the top of the page and in doing that
you want to be able to provide a couple
of different ways both with color but
also with iconography that there's
errors on that page
another thing we did too was we actually
listed how many items require someone's
attention so the people don't have to
guess how many is in that list if you're
listening to this with a screen reader
you'll be able to actually know I have
three things that I need to be able to
fix on this page and then one of the
other features that we did in order to
help people with mobility challenges is
we made the actual list item within the
error messaging bucket a hyperlink that
will take the user directly to the field
that needs to be corrected and we found
that that made things a lot simpler and
a lot easier for someone to be able to
recover from their errors and from their
mistakes we've recommended this
particular pattern to a lot of clients
and a lot of teams
it's succeeded across different
industries as far as usability research
make it consistent so we're big
believers in pattern libraries
regardless of how far into that work
that you are and so people should be
able to know that when they're
interacting with something that it's
gonna have the same action each time
that they interact with it so your
navigation elements your error messaging
all of that should be incredibly
consistent throughout the site instead
of five different ways to handle error
messaging instead of three or four
different navigation patterns or
collapsing divs you should be consistent
with the way that you approach those
things and it makes it so much easier
for your users this is uh this is a
screenshot of one of my co-workers and
what we like to teach people to do is to
simulate the feeling of what it's like
to have low vision and so we have it
it's called the straw test and you
basically put your hand into like a
straw like you like you're holding a
straw and you close one eye and you look
through your web page through that
experience and so the idea is to put
yourself in the position of somebody
else and even though you maybe can't
actually experience what it's like if
you don't have that particular
disability it still allows you to be
able to make different assumptions or no
assumptions about the way that you're
designing things this is especially
helpful when you're a designer and
you're thinking about issues of
proximity specifically and then finally
always go see you've heard me mention a
couple of times that we do a lot of
usability research and testing because
no amount of best practices or
techniques will ever compare to actually
testing with real people and this is
especially true with people with
disabilities last year one of the things
that we found that was very surprising
to us is when we were doing
usability testing our clients are now
moving pretty pretty much almost all the
time into responsive design so we were
doing some testing for one of our
clients and we found out of the eight
people who use screen readers three of
them didn't have a monitor so they don't
necessarily need a monitor somebody is
blind he or she is not necessarily going
to need to hook up monitor to their
computer and when we're doing this it
occurred to us that what's happening is
the operating system like Windows
operating system would be rendering a
small version like 150 pixels by 150
pixels or size and in doing that it was
throwing it into the mobile experience
even though somebody was on a desktop so
even though they were using a keyboard
and they're using a desktop screen
reader they were being delivered the
mobile view that was a pretty big
surprise to us so now when we do our own
testing with our own testing team we
actually run through the paces of doing
some unusual scenarios where we have
split view we may have a really long
portrait view we may have the bookmarks
toolbar type things open and we will be
looking at the mobile view through
desktop testing tools just because there
is no way to know until you go and see
what people might be using in order to
be able to interact with your content
yep that was one of our examples so
usability testers we've talked a little
bit about that a lot of times people
create personas when they're doing
usability testing and they look at who
their primary user is and who their
secondary user is so we've kind of
mapped the idea of inclusive personas
not personas specifically of people with
disabilities but mapping some of those
disability considerations to the
personas that someone already has so who
is my primary user and who is my
secondary user is something that a lot
of different people with
the design field should think about if
you're working in content strategy or
information architecture your primary
users are nearly diverse users so anyone
who may be on the autism spectrum or
they're aging into dementia your
secondary user are non-native language
speakers so people who don't necessarily
speak the language in which the site is
built as a primary language this really
helps you understand creating a solid
content structure and you can conduct
usability testing with paper prototypes
and sketches so you can do it way early
in the design phase for the visual
designer low vision users and color
blind users are the two primary personas
to consider and you can conduct
usability testing with high fidelity
mock-ups for the interaction designer
people with mobility challenges and
blind users there's a whole lot of
accessibility that is built in at the
keyboard level and you can conduct
usability testing with HTML prototypes
after you've done some internal QA it's
really important if you're gonna do
usability testing and you're pulling
somebody in to do a test whether
remotely which is what we typically
recommend or maybe in your office that
you don't make something that's an
obvious barrier something that means
that they can't even complete the test
you want to do your own QA first before
you do that developers now we're here to
the good part right like science web
standards exist whether you believe in
them or not so this is by far if you
take away one thing as a developer for
accessibility if you are absolutely
zealous about web standards you will
have gotten 60 to 70 percent of the way
towards accessibility because as I
mentioned before assistive technology
relies on that standardized interaction
between the technology and your
languages whether it be HTML Javascript
CSS client-side stuff
so if you make it look like a button and
act like a button don't make it a span
or a div make it a button if you decide
that you want to have a radio button but
you're gonna make it a span below the
scenes then you have so much work to do
in order for it to really interact as a
button or radio button with assistive
technology so that is the number one
thing by far the second thing that we
typically recommend test-driven
development this is probably at this
conference is something that you guys
are like yeah okay I do this all the
time absolutely we do this every day
this is actually still pretty uncommon
in a lot of large organizations it's
difficult for them to embrace this but
this is the absolute best way as a
developer for you to be able to ensure
accessibility is baked into what you do
because you create the test you run the
test you'll find out immediately when
you commit something as to whether or
not it failed or passed right and it
teaches you one of the things I love
about developers is they're not afraid
of making mistakes developers actually
embrace that as a way to learn to
improve and so that's one reason why I
think that they're tremendous agile
champions and they're fantastic
and once they adopt accessibility into
what they do because they understand the
concept of being able to do something
and learn from it and improve as they go
pattern all the things this becomes an
incredibly difficult adventure to make a
bespoke accessible dialog every single
time right but if you do this and put so
much effort into a single really well
designed and created modal dialog that's
all that you need to do from that point
on
so pattern all the things yes what is
the best assistive technology for
developers to test with this is a
question we get a lot and I'm happy to
say
the tool that we recommend the most is
free and you all have it the best
assistive technology for developers to
test with is your keyboard there are
other things there are screen readers
there's zoom technology there's voice
dictation software that allows someone
who might have mobility impairments
there are all manner of kinds of
automated test Suites that you can run
that will pick up some accessibility
issues but by far the most important
thing that you can do after having web
standards driven code is to be able to
make sure that you have exemplary
keyboard accessibility that you
understand how to be able to use arrows
and tabs and enter in space and that
you're doing it according to the
specification this makes for a huge
amount of accessibility for many user
groups one thing that we recommend if
you are going to be doing some
individual testing at your desktop is
simply called the web developer toolbar
or extension depending on Firefox or
Chrome and while this isn't expressly an
accessibility testing tool as you see
it's got all these menus within there
and that especially for you guys who are
really comfortable with source code it's
wonderful between this and having
Firebug installed or something to be
able to expect the elements it allows
you to be able to take a look and really
identify some of these pieces we believe
very strongly test automation
however it's not something that you
should really build in until you really
are willing to look at accessibility as
a process and the best thing to do is to
think about integrating something into
say if you have selenium or Jenkins and
you already have some kind of test
automation look to build accessibility
into that workflow otherwise you know
you're gonna be buying some overpriced
very big tool that doesn't really fit
with your processes so this is an easy
straightforward way these are the ways
to be able to build in accessibility
into what you do if you're looking at
enterprise level test automation think
in terms of
test suites that you can write there's
JavaScript tests that you can build into
what you're already doing and that helps
you get that extra 25% if you say commit
things and have a nightly build have
accessibility tests run that way and
then you'll be able to get that kind of
feedback that you're looking for QA
testers so this is a this is a question
that I always post people so why isn't
this agile where we have a wheel two
wheels and an axle a convertible without
a steering wheel and then a convertible
with a steering wheel this is a
participatory participatory --zz for it
I'm gonna ask that question why is this
not agile what's that three sad faces
why are there three sad faces yes you
should be happy agile is happy exactly
if that's it the reason why there is sad
it's because they get no joy and they
get no use out of this stuff until the
very end right and that's sort of the
antithesis of agile instead if you look
at agile which you know we can tell it's
agile because there's happy faces across
all the way so that's one thing we've
definitely learned but it's usable at
each step right that's the whole concept
of a Minimum Viable Product as the idea
is something that's shippable
immediately and usable so I don't know
if any of you guys have ever had that
painful moment where you did a demo with
a client where you only had code and
only had back-end stuff and it didn't go
so well because they you couldn't really
demonstrate all the work that you had
put into something because it really
wasn't a slice it was really more about
foundational layer and while that makes
sense from a development perspective it
doesn't really deliver something usable
and create that bond and that trust with
you and the business stakeholder so
likewise with accessibility with testing
in particular there is no point in
looking at accessibility testing saying
well we have to do all of it or none of
it like we can't possibly do all this
accessibility testing so we're
out we'll figure it out next year
instead what we recommend to client
teams is to take it exactly the same way
it iterate off of your testing the most
important things that I think we talked
about earlier is keyboard invalid code
keyboard accessibility invalid code are
the foundational most important things
we did a research study with all of our
last four years of projects and we found
not only ended 60s and 70% of the issues
that we found originated with bad
practices like invalid code using things
kind of shortcuts that kind of stuff but
we also found that keyboard issues while
it's maybe only about 30% of the web
content accessibility guidelines it
really addresses more than 50% of the
most common user needs so it's the
higher value item for more users so
keyboard accessibility invalid code then
you come back to that after you've
released that images making sure that
there's text equivalents for images
color with color contrast and making
sure colors not the only thing that's
conveying some meaning then you iterate
off of that and you start looking at
headings and forms and honestly each
time that you're releasing something
along this it becomes exponentially more
accessible then you're looking at text
resize being able to have a really
flexible layout so that you're not
breaking all of the content just because
somebody has bumped up their text
proximity making sure that if you have a
call to action here that the button at
the bottom is not what is related to it
right group related items and then
everything else and if you approach it
this way then you're basically making
this really measurable improvement and
providing huge value each time so who
benefits from lean accessibility testing
people with mobility issues to rely on
the keyboard or other alternative input
devices people who rely on assistive
technology for any reason people who may
turn off images or they need more
contrast on webpages and people who have
difficulty
using headings or forms because of
cognitive learning language or attention
issues this is the kind of amazing
quality and value that you bring to all
kinds of users when you're approaching
this in an iterative way all right so
where are we where they're time yes so a
final word about scalability and I think
it's important especially if you guys
work at large organizations one of my
favorite quotes
Jeff Cassell of course a writer of lean
UX he said scale principles not process
so as you're looking at how to be able
to build accessibility into a lean
process as you're looking at how to be
able to incorporate inclusive design
into your agile workflow think in terms
of what the value is for your end-users
and knowing that your end-users 15% of
those users or people who may have a
disability it's so it's less about
compliance and your process needing to
scale and it's much more about ensuring
that your principles are intact and that
it's a part of your culture because when
it's a part of your culture it becomes a
much easier thing because it becomes a
priority so process gets you short-term
gains principles get you long-term
change so questions shall we discuss if
you have any questions specific to
accessibility yes
uh that's a really good question I think
that it really does boil down to
keyboard accessibility and images we
typically when we work with clients we
we start with keyboard and image related
issues and then we go ahead and tackle
forms because we're trying to build a
pattern library for them and there's
kind of this this feeling like if they
can get through an entire form like say
a multi-page form they've pretty much
addressed almost every accessibility on
their site issue on their site because
accessibility is more of a challenge
when it's a much more dynamic
interactive experience so anytime your
users interacting with something often
it involves a form element so between
keyboard accessibility and images those
are the two probably most common and
then right after that we typically go
after forms because invariably like
we're really surprised if we're doing a
lot of testing and we find that somebody
has built very accessible forms cuz it's
rare especially when you're doing these
drag-and-drop kind of controls there's
not often a lot of accessibility built
into that that's a good question yeah so
you mean like return on investment for
accessibility in particular yeah it's
difficult because oftentimes there's if
you're looking at something people are
redesigning their entire experience they
may be beefing up the search engine
optimization they may be looking at new
technology stacks so some many times
accessibility is sort of a partner to a
lot of different initiatives so it's
difficult to parse out that specific
return on investment we do have an a/b
test that's going though that is working
on something where we've kind of
injected similar to multivariate tests
where you put a different view layer
we've taken the same webpages and put
accessible web pages in their stead
without changing a
design elements because we're trying to
measure that exact thing to be able to
show a conversion increases or not but
it's it's hard to get that kind of
information and it's harder still to
share it outside the organizations that
we work with I know that when I worked
at fortune 100 healthcare company we saw
measurable improvements but it's because
of the fact that we approached
accessibility from a usability
perspective and so we definitely
increased conversion when we made things
more keyboard accessible we also though
had an older audience because we were
dealing with Medicare products so you're
always going to see sort of an overlap
between older users and people with
disabilities because sometimes they're
one in the same but often times people
are aging into maybe some disability so
we definitely had the metrics to be able
to to prove that we had about a 30%
increase in conversion when we improved
keyboard accessibility and color
contrast other organizations though it's
it's always a sort of a chasing after
that metric it's something that I
desperately want to be able to to find a
way to anonymize and share for sure you
interested in the pilot we could do
something together right
sure well right right well and I think
that you know one way is how stronger
your analytics to begin with and then
being able to have a comparison over
time definitely and if it is the only
improvements that you're making then
it's relatively straightforward to be
able to determine if you have a pretty
consistent sales cycle for example
you're able to compare then it's an
straight forward kind of thing to do
there's ways to look at abandonment
rates and whether or not those drop off
and see whether they're related to
keyboard accessibility issues we've done
that before as well any other questions
