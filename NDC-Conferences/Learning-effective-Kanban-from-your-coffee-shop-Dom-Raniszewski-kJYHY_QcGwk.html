consultant and ratify and it's not going
to be a technical
I do three things at work so I build
Data Solutions I help with assists in
able delivery practices and I drink a
lot of coffee so it's a third day of the
conference and I think we've learned
enough or pretty much everything about
Server last containers machine learning
and whatever other session you you join
do so it's a good time to talk about the
most important thing in software
development which is coffee so we all
know there is no code without a coffee
we also know there is no good code
without a good coffee so coffee might be
a really good source of energy but
having a trip to your favorite coffee
shop might be a really good source of
inspiration as well so some time ago I
was waiting for I was waiting for for my
favorite beverage when I when I realized
that my coffee shop actually follows
Kanban Kanban a properties without maybe
even knowing that
so what's Kanban exactly so Kanban is a
something that is extremely simple to
explain extremely hard to practice and
also it tells us that we should develop
our own process because every single
environment is different and we know how
to operate in this environment and we
should we should know how to do it so we
need some inspirations how about a
coffee break so I'm going to use a
coffee shop model to go through the five
of Kanban properties probably one
visualize the workflow so you're not
able to improve anything unless you
understand how the work is flowing in
the in your system and probably if you
ask a software developer to go to a
coffee shop and help them to visualize
their work you will end up with
something like this that might seems
legit however imagine updating you know
status of every single work item as they
flow through the system so coffee shops
actually developed their own system of
visualizing their work which looks more
like that every time you go to a coffee
shop they take an order from you they
put there something you know that a user
story name on the lathe like
as a Sam I want my flat white to be hot
extra hot or something like this and
they use those tokens to actually
monitor and track the work through the
whole system so I guess I what I'm
trying to say here is try not to rely on
other teams practices because they they
might just not work for you and by all
means don't rely on the templates are
coming from any kind of you know agile
project management software because
they're fairly generic it's your process
so just go wild see what works for you
and test it with your team second thing
that works really well in coffee shops
is a how they limit their work in
progress so have you ever seen barista
making two coffees at once even if they
physically could well they're not going
to do that because their work is a
fairly atomic in a very small sizes and
keeping work like this actually makes
the process more predictable I know
exactly how long I'm going to wait for a
coffee my favorite coffee shop they're
not going to deviate because they have a
massive order coming well actually I can
see by the list of by the number of
leads or by the number of people waiting
for coffee and if I can predict how long
things take I can measure it and process
predictability is a measure of process
maturity how actually when the orders
are coming to coffee shop how they
manage the workflow and it's something
that is very common with our
environments as well so our work is very
it's very rarely you know evenly
distributed throughout all the roles and
responsibilities we have a little bit
more of testing a little bit more of
development a little bit more of design
little bit more of UX and same hat same
same things might happen in your coffee
shop so what's the answer to this
problem
cross-functional and self organizing
team so even though you might see a
person being more often in the one
station than the other they very quickly
adapt to the situation regardless if you
have many people you're ordering one
coffee each that actually might put some
more load on
in payment systems or one person
ordering 20 coffees because they have a
conference in the room upstairs which
actually puts more load on a different
part of the system so they're really
adopting really nice to those situations
but also there is a one important key
component to how they operate they
always pull the work there is no
micromanagement there there is a strong
assumption that every now everyone knows
what they're doing and how to perform
their work so when you put an order in a
coffee shop you actually all delete all
the orders or however they track those
tickets in the system they form a FIFO
queue right and every barista who Bruce
a coffee or float a meal actually takes
from the top of the queue performs the
whole task and gives it to the next step
and funny thing that happens over there
is they die don't drop work in the
middle because there are customers
waiting with more orders and more money
because if they did something like this
well coffee goes cold they have to redo
so instead of actually getting more
outcome from their system they start to
generate more waste and they're very
strong advisors of let's finish
something before we start next thing so
obviously there's one thing when you
start operating in a certain way and
this is something that can ban tells us
as well you have to make your process
policies very explicit otherwise people
will be confused otherwise all the
discussions about the problem will stand
on the would stay on the emotional and
subjective level obviously when I walk
into a coffee shop no one gives me a
process guidelines and tells me how this
place operates because well I've been so
many times in this in you know in a
situation of buying a coffee that I
don't expect you know to get a haircut
over there or something like this right
however the understanding of how the
process works is on a both sides so guys
behind the counter people behind the
counter they are
understand how to deal with stakeholders
customers ordering more coffees right
they know that if you come with a weird
order well pretty much they will not be
able to serve you because they know
what's their capability and how they can
deliver to to the promise and also you
know straight away how the system works
so you can just take a glimpse into your
coffee a coffee shop to understand okay
actually this line in this line I'm
going to wait not five minutes but ten
minutes and obviously there's a one
important thing like a classes of
service so your favorite coffee shop
might have a classes of service like a
coffee my coffee shop might have a also
banana bread or something like this and
funny enough once again no one comes to
me and tells hey this is our SLA
agreement that says we are going to
deliver 95 percent of our coffees below
five minutes I implicitly understand the
process however in the software
development we have a slightly bigger
problem because our our processes are
much more common more complex so I think
what's the biggest takeaway from here
make sure whatever process you you
establish for your team for your
stakeholders everyone knows exactly what
to expect from each other side and
because you know how to how to do your
word do it before other people study for
you and to me the most important thing
what makes the difference between a good
coffee shop and the coffee shop that
makes you feel a little bit like home
when they call you by name without you
know when you show when you show up when
they know exactly what's your order it's
because they develop two things
relationship and leadership they develop
relationship between each other and
funny enough you won't find managers or
very strong leaders in this group
there's just a bunch of people very
dedicated and very passionate to serve
your coffee
simple as that and once you have this
relationship with each other once you
can start building relationship with
your stakeholders in your customers you
start building trust and when you have a
trust you can start experimenting with
new things
you can get more feedback from your
customers you can actually ask them
straight away I can you frankly tell me
if this works for you or not right we're
not in this in this world of contractual
agreements when we have to actually say
no this was ordered sorry we're going to
stick whatever is on the paper we're
responding much quicker we adopt much
faster we develop better processes for
both sides development teams as well as
our customers so I guess what I was
trying to say is the inspirations on how
we can improve our processes might come
from very unexpected places it might be
a coffee shop or some some places you if
you you're going frequently so maybe
instead of chasing another deadline and
putting those extra seconds you know to
put another lines of code all deleted
lines of code let's have a coffee break
and let the word inspire us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
