hello here let me do this hello there my
name is John Galloway
I love net and I love dot love open
source not necessarily always just
dotnet open source just open source in
general my favorite kind of applications
are usually like Inkscape and GIMP and
I'm always looking for the latest
release of audacity and whatever so so
it was really kind of stunning and
exciting and all these things when I was
asked to become the executive director
of the dotnet foundation the earlier
this year I think it was March and one
of the first problems that came up was
answering to my mom to my co-workers day
you know whoever in general what exactly
is the dotnet foundation so I took a
step back and I thought you know we're
an advanced modern civilization and we
have ways of communicating complex
concepts so I went to dippy to look for
an animated gif too to be able to
explain you know what exactly that is
and and it was pretty clear it was
pretty clear on exactly you know what
the overall feeling is of open source
software foundations Sally and Alpine
take a step back let's go to more
authoritative source and I asked a
professor I know
and professor Wikipedia said a lot of
words and like a lot of Wikipedia things
it's things the words are all
technically correct but unhelpful like
if you already know what the thing is
and you read the words you say those are
good words but if you don't know what
the thing is and you read the words you
say umbrella organization funding of a
menu back to this so what is an open
source software foundation and I'm
actually going to leave you with a bit
of a cliffhanger here we'll talk about
some other things and we'll sort go back
because I want to give some background
on
what actually is professional mature
open-source development and then I think
we'll be able to kind of loop back and
say what is an open-source software
foundation so I'm going to spice things
up moving from talking about foundations
to talking about maturity models because
that's going to get to your you know on
the edge of your seat but actually I had
this talk pretty much ready to go which
was early for me like a week couple of
weeks ago and I went to dotnet fringe up
in Portland with anyone else there
anyone here about innocence so I could
buy too I could say anything you
wouldn't know you weren't there but the
first talk of the day was by Sean
Killeen and he gave a talk on casting a
wider net and it said a lot of the
things that I wanted to say and it was
organized in a really cool way so I
thought you know what I'm going to get
merged and so I'm pulling that in so
talking about the overall idea is how
does an organization how does a person
but but specifically how does an
organization move to adopting open
source and you generally start with a
fear uncertainty and doubt phase where
you kind of avoid it and hope it'll go
away then to a kind of grudging
acceptance and then finally consuming
open source not really collaborating but
consuming and then later moving to
contribution deeper participation and
finally embracing it as a culture so you
know just the the general steps on this
fear uncertainty and doubt phase you
know I remember trying to use a library
for something that was not worth writing
our own code for this was a while ago I
was at a financial company and I said
hey this is a great library let's pull
this in I think those reporting or
charts or something and I remember the
lead on the team said oh that's some of
that open source bloggers malware stuff
huh yeah let's not use that and it was
really frustrating you know in the end
but I think culturally that's where a
lot of it was there's concerns about
security is how do I know this how can I
trust this code there's also confusion
over what are the legal implications
what of all these licenses means
there is a desire to reinvent the wheel
maybe because it's fun or just because
you're comfortable with it and there's
often a kind of a an assumption that we
know our business model we know what
we're doing here it's a known quantity
and so we're going to stick with writing
our own code eventually you move into an
acceptance phase hopefully where it all
kinds of work but you don't really know
how it works
right it's some magics happening and you
know out of the machine comes from open
source and you're generally kind of
learning two moves here you're trying to
figure out okay what is a how do I file
an issue what is a pull request that
kind of thing then you go into consuming
so using packages sometimes a lot more
packages than you think
pulling you know restore the entire
Internet when you bring up your project
but that is a consuming pace and when I
talk to people and I say are you using
open source software and the answer is
almost always whether they know it yes
almost in you know file new project and
Visual Studio for a long time has pulled
in a lot of packages you know in most
software at some point you're using some
open source right there's also at this
phase you're starting to understand the
ecosystem a little bit there's a there's
an ideas like there's distributions and
there's this source code hosting and how
things work and that kind of stuff
they're still kind of a magical like
something is happening and I'm not sure
how it all works you are moving towards
figuring out how to responsibly consume
meaning if something's wrong you don't
just flame you don't maybe send an email
you post an issue you try and help debug
it then you move into a contribution
phase where you're hopefully sending
pull requests and you're seeing open
source as a two-way street you are
receiving value and you're contributing
value and then you move into part is
what's participation where you are
really as a organization you are
participating in the production of that
open-source software and things like
your your business actually
incentivizing and not grudgingly
allowing you to work on open source but
seeing the value in it and
couraging it right and then you move
into a phase of cultural embrace where
you are kind of open source by default
so rather than always having to ask
permission rather than having to fight
with people to do things open source
it's assumed why wouldn't we do this
open source but so this is this kind of
this progression so you know where are
you at on this scale where when you look
at where you're adding your work and
also just in your mindset when you are
working on your own project do you write
your own code are you you know worried
about using other people's code etc and
I take read questions by the way as I go
as I see we have some plans from the
audience so so this this came from this
talk cast a wider net so it's a wider
dotnet such as popovers that real quick
right so that's here and there's kind of
a deeper explaining what these phases
are but also digging into what do I do
if I am having a problem with something
like for instance if I don't know my
licenses there's some links here to
choose a license or TLDR legal so these
are resources where you can say gee I
don't know boss can I use an MIT license
what does that even mean right and then
I can go in and get some now this is not
full on legal advice but this is this
will help guide me towards you know how
these licenses work together right so
that's out here at a wider net and of
course it is on github and it's you can
you know contribute pull requests to it
and and so but the idea is this is a
place to UM to continue that discussion
so let's look at some examples and I'm
going to start with one the slides that
you just saw a white man because I
actually had some things I liked better
about my model or at least was more
familiar with I gone through and I spent
time on it I was comfortable with it and
I was trying to merge parts of Shawn's
you know model and his talk in with mine
yes and I thought this is so like
contradictory of the things of the
principles that I'm talking about right
it clubbed me on the head I'm like this
is exactly the thing instead of not
invented here come up with my own saying
try and make mine the canonical saying
whatever why don't why don't we
contribute to the same place why don't
we point to the same thing so that was
kind of a light bulb moment for me
another kind of you know bigger bigger
example is Microsoft's journey in
general into open-source so if you look
at it starting with there was long ago
some source open even going back to like
rotor which was hey here's net here's
some source code you can look at it you
can't use it you can you know like in
fact maybe you shouldn't look at it
because you can't you I thought so but
but there it is there's some source code
so thanks for that then going on to some
things like open design notes where
we're at least talking in public about
here's here's what we're thinking of
right designing in public then going to
source open with some limited
contributions and I'm thinking of some
things back on like for instance the MVC
and web api source code out on codeplex
there were some places where we would
the community would say like hey you're
routing an NBC kind of a pain a lot of
people are using attribute routing Tim I
forget his last name his library and you
know let's see about using that and so
then there were emails and months of
communication and back-and-forth and
some components in some parts of
attribute routing end up in MVC and web
api a few years ago so it's limited but
it's very controlled and constrained the
kind of contributions moving to a full
open source workflow so my
experience with this was watching dotnet
core back when it was project K being
built on github and actually saw like so
you know we all love David Fowler David
Fowler is my I'm up too late alarm so
meaning David Fowler stays up all night
and if I'm like working and it's like
1:30 or 2:00 in the morning and I get a
chat from David Fowler and it's like hey
dude check this out then I'm like oh no
tomorrow morning it's going to suck
because this means I'm up way too late
and then pretty soon the Roosters start
crowing stuff but he would send me stuff
and he would be working you know on
crazy experiments with project K which
became DN X which became a Skynet core
and from the beginning they were working
in github repos and as soon as they kind
of got the permission and they're like
yeah this is kind of in an okay state
boom it's you know these are life
repositories and they're full up in
repositories right so I don't have to I
mean for those that haven't seen like if
I go to right so here's petrol HTTP
server if you looked at the commits you
can see the commits as they're happening
so you know you can go in and watch okay
eleven hours ago since the last commit
so you guys are slacking a bit you can
this is actually the real repo there's
not some kind of magical
behind-the-scenes repo and usually when
I show this to people now they're like
daya we now all know this it actually
for a long time was like everyone
assumed that there were secret behind
the scenes repos because that was kind
of the Microsoft way of doing open
source for a while right and then of
course if you look at the committers you
see number two is Ben Adams who is not a
Microsoft employee right and who's
contributing to the project some of the
some of the most exciting parts moving
from that to documentation so actual you
know like putting the documentation on
out on so that open source on github as
well so I can go in and I can edit and
change the documentation and finally
moving towards shared ownership meaning
we actually work together to set the
direction of the project we figure out
what's the roadmap we discuss the
roadmap we don't just you know say hey
community what would you like go out to
user voice and then we look
pick and choose we actually should be
working together to form the direction
of where we want to go so an example
here of this kind of looking at
Microsoft's kind of movement here is
what get what Microsoft has done with
git and so there was a so Microsoft has
had its its own source code for all the
Microsoft stuff right including
you know whatever Xbox windows office
you know including net and it's been in
a variety of repos there's been some
that abandon team team system but a good
amount have stayed in in source Depot
which is Microsoft internal and they ran
into some scaling issues and some things
where they couldn't collaborate well and
so they said hey why don't we put this
all in to get so it sounds neat there's
just Lib get to library which is you
know an open source not Microsoft
Project and looking at that they said
yeah we can use this but there's some
things in here there's no support for
the kind of merge we need to do and
stuff like that so the idea here was
like hey let's contribute to this
instead of building our own kind of
thing and they also worked worked with
worked on as well with this get virtual
file system so the result to get virtual
file system are now being able to do
some things that were really prohibitive
before there's some things that seem
like they shouldn't be a big deal that
builds even a check out of the source
code for for Windows could take could
take hours you could take a build could
take forget about it like a whole
weekend right so some some pretty
positive things out of this and this is
a big repo this is this is significantly
bigger than you know the kind of repo so
most people are working working with so
the end result here surprisingly is that
whereas github is you know the largest
the largest get hosting provider
Microsoft actually has the biggest get
repositories so the result that I kind
of want to narrow in on with this is
that as to come as a result of working
together in an open-source way Mike
soft embracing the kind of mature way of
working with open source here they saw
hey here's some things we need and we're
able to contribute this back and get
virtual file system is you know is open
source and it's available for everyone
to use so another example dotnet core so
a lot of examples of this but one just
simple one is by opening up that net
core even in 2015 and you see all these
worldwide contribution and then growing
to 2017 it's kind of contribution from
all over the world
ok so let's kind of come back to dotnet
foundation you know where the
cliffhanger comes to an end here so
narrowing in on what is the dotnet
foundation there are actually on the
dotnet foundation site some relatively
helpful words so there's some things and
I'm carefully I'm sure there's some
things like they're supposed to be
lasers I was told there'd be lasered
oh well it's an independent organization
so that's a key thing the dotnet
foundation is not owned by Microsoft
it's a 501 C 6 non-profit right so it is
not a Microsoft thing it's a its own
it's an independent organization so
built for collaboration collaboration
between community and commercial
developers so that's a key thing we'll
look at and you know things about
openness and community participation so
oh I think I killed I'm surfing smack on
the resulted switch I have to switch to
Johns
keylogger
this does have a laser where is the has
a bigger receiver - everything about
this is better look at that okay so from
looking at this this thing let's let's
go back and look at something that
things that it's not which people kind
of commonly misunderstand it's not
primarily marketing it's not really a
marketing organization and that's good
right because the dotnet team already
has marketing organization there's some
pretty good marketing people if you look
at other open source software
foundations those that are supported by
larger companies they have marketing
organizations too right so there's no
need for yet another marketing
organization there's also who here does
not know what the word ombudsman means
okay so the last time I talked a bunch
of people are like what's about buzz but
so but now I'm in Europe and people
won't do that people will not talk well
I'm talking but this was in Portland so
but so the idea is an ombudsman is
someone you talk to when something's
messed up right so it's kind of a back
panel somebody you can talk to and say
hey I'm having some problems here can
you take a look at this can get to the
bottom of this right and dotnet
foundation there's definitely parts of
that several people in this room I've
had you know direct message
conversations with trying to figure
stuff out and saying hey this is messed
up let's let's get this fixed but that's
not the sole purpose that's kind of an
outgrowth of some other things that an
open-source software foundation is all
right so what were the problems that we
actually you know built dotnet
foundation to do so one is from from
that definition earlier to allow for
community and commercial contributions
so working together in the same place
the community or commercial and
community working together so if you
look at you know who the technical
steering group is we have at least John
there from Google
we have we have several people from I
don't know who else is actually here in
person but we have you know
representatives from these different
companies here so the technical steering
group is actually you know helps provide
the technical direction of where dotnet
goes going to to a bigger than
microsoft.net right so some things some
values there one is trust and the idea
is that Microsoft makes mistakes pretty
regularly if we all make mistakes right
and and so having dotnet be bigger than
Microsoft hopefully gives you it gives
me some some kind of trust in the
longer-term direction and you know
what's going on with dotnet so dotnet is
very clearly in Microsoft you know
future interest by Microsoft needs net
for so many things that it ships but
even if Microsoft said yeah we're done
with net it's all plastics or whatever
it's all 3d holograms now the dotnet
foundation stays around and dotnet stays
around because of the licenses and
because the way it's set up so and some
of that is this shared ownership so
actually when so there are a lot of
Engineers at Microsoft that are daily
checking in code to you know all these
github repos for net there are people
here in this audience they're people
throughout the community they're also
checking in code regardless of whoever
checks that code in it says dot
copyright dotnet foundation so a
Microsoft employee checks in that code
it will actually the copyright notice on
that says copyright botnet foundation
that code has been contributed to the
bat net foundation so we're all sharing
that code together because it's all
owned by this one foundation right and
then there's also this thing of
governance and so the idea with
governance is that you have a shared set
of rules so I'm going to got a github
slash net I don't take dot dot in that
anyone remember that good
so if we go to github that home so
there's some things in here where we
spell out what exactly like jumping a
gun there there's there are some things
on what is how does governance work what
are the bylaws how is it kind of set up
so the idea in and this should grow over
time right because what we're trying to
do is spell out it's not just some
people off in Microsoft and some
boardrooms making decisions this is a
community discussion of where we're
going and how we figure things out so as
an example of this I mentioned the you
know when you check code in or when I
check code in you actually this code is
reviewed by this dotnet by who we'll see
has this github user signed a
contributor License Agreement and that
happens for you know for anyone it
happens for for you it happens for
Microsoft employee regardless and once
they do then the bot says yes you've
signed the CLA ok great that code is
contributed to that net foundation now
it's funny this dotnet by actually
originally it was just a github user
called dotnet bot and then everyone kept
seeing it pop up on there we created
this cute little robot and it's actually
pretty active on github because it's
continually doing things and reviewing
things and stuff it's actually so active
on github that it started to get
recruiters interested so so the dot
Nirvana has a bright future I'm sure but
ok so that's the first thing I think
kind of the more obvious thing of what
is the foundation view this is Microsoft
this is Google this is Samsung this is
Red Hat this is you know all these
different contributors working together
as companies and then people in the
community then Adams you me well ok but
the community checking code in as well
right this is shared ownership but
another thing that the dotnet foundation
does it exists to support the entire
dotnet ecosystem right so from from this
point of view there are community
contributed projects so there are some
like I'll give you an example Nancy
effects right or cake cake build there's
a lot of other ones where there's a
slide coming up with with a ton of them
right but but the idea is that community
projects can join the dotnet Foundation
and when you look at this like the more
you kind of think about it why not
why aren't they any why is a a project
that you make in your spare time that's
contributed to the dotnet foundation any
less valid any different than a project
that Joe engineer at Microsoft creates
right it's the same thing when you look
at it from the point of view of a
separate foundation whose goal is just
to support that open source so some
things that it can do foundation one is
sponsorship and you know like the
sponsors that here really doesn't mean
money it's not like hey we'll pay now it
could they're the foundation does not
have a huge budget usually when you want
to budgets you do talk to marketing
people and unfortunately we're not
marketing but as far as sponsorship
there are other things like hey we need
a build server hey we need code signing
certificate hey we'd really you know
someone on our team needs software
licenses needs an MSDN license so those
are some things we're routinely we're
providing from the.net foundation
another thing is governance so I showed
you that thing on the on the the.net
repository here here's some of the kind
of governance things that we've spelled
out if another project wants to join the
botnet foundation there's a thing we
have in here where it is actually is
guidance new projects so this is kind of
a checklist for projects as they joined
about that foundation and there's some
things that are including like a little
handy markdown checklist so some
projects will actually just create a
pull request and include this and case
you didn't know if you if you use that
markdown it actually creates a checklist
and a github issue right which is kind
of
any easy so but the idea is some things
like hey do you have you know do you
have your license spelled out do you
have a code of conduct you have things
you know
that make it easy for a contributor to
get involved I'll tell you what I think
is probably one of the most important
one or two things is how does a new
member become a contributor how do they
actually become go from someone who's
submitting pull requests to someone
who's approving pull request how do they
go to being a project owner when the
original project owner leaves and I
don't know how many of you have this has
happened to me so many times where I've
got a problem I search around I find an
open source library it looked awesome
and the latest commit was two years ago
and there's a ton of emerge pull
requests and open issues right sad sad
sad trombone it's the saddest thing and
so this is a place where governance and
longevity because something that a
foundation can do because for projects
joining that foundation there's actually
a DNF admin account the github account
where we join your repository as a
maintainer and we're able to you know we
spell out here's what happened here's
how succession works here's how new
people can can join and say you're like
you know what I'm done with this it's
other someone else says hey I would like
to take over that stuff's all spelled
out most projects people have good
intentions that they don't think about
this stuff right you're you're thinking
about hacking code maybe shipping a
release fixing some bugs and so then
when you move on to another project you
stop working on this one
none of that stuff spelled out right so
this really is a key important thing is
to keep the project's alive projects
thriving by spelling spelling out the
ways that new people can become involved
so I talked this over with Scott
Hanselman and he's like oh you got to do
the pizza service thing so I think it
mostly fits I'm still kind of figuring
it out but you've seen this whole
service approach thing right a way of
going from like I a sub has or whatever
this is pizza as a service so we go from
no keeps I made at home where you're
doing everything you're responsible for
the whole stack right do I have laser I
have laser right so this is your pizza
from scratch going to well I actually
bought my piece at the store I don't
tell my kids I just don't pop it in the
oven right but but you know we still
have to set the table and get out the
drinks okay going up to delivery where
we just ordered out and and they come to
the house and you ever go here soon by
the way left
what is it is no cheat no sauce left
sausage does anyone know what I'm
talking about there's a you can go
through and you can left sausage none
pizza with left sausage this is
definitely do like a motive none pizza
with left beef that's the problem that's
why you didn't know I was talking about
so you can go through and you can you
can say what you like on your pizza
right so there's this actually there's
there's no way I'll be able to tie this
in but somebody realized on this form
you could say I would like no tots or
cheese and I would like beef only on the
left side and so then there's a whole
thing where tons of people people dress
as none keeps it with less be for
Halloween so anyway so that's a that is
an issue you would encounter if you are
ordering out pizza and then finally you
go to going to the restaurant where you
just show up and pay right so looking at
something like this what if we're doing
an open source project and we want to
apply some of this model you could go
from just you hacking on your own so you
are writing the code you're fixing the
bugs you are you know doing the
publicity the blog posts and all that
kind of stuff you are doing you're
dealing with legal and governance
hopefully that's just picking your
license when you set up the project but
you also are having to deal with do we
have a code of conduct - how do we deal
with you know someone that's abusive how
do we deal with succession for my
project all that kind of stuff
we have things like setting up a build
you know how do we actually create a
release is it me on my laptop probably
security do we do code signing do we do
you know security analysis how do we
handle the security of thing and then
finally there's the
and of expenses so whenever I need to
you know host a new site when I need to
buy a new cert when I need to do
anything it's always my credit card
comes out right so now I bring a friend
on to the project and I've got a team
project so now I've changed from I
should have made the one on the left
blue because that's kind of sad but
anyhow it's a different color this is a
team ownership of this right we're
writing the code together we're fixing
the bug together we're doing publicity
guidance governance build server
security and paying expenses but we're
responsible for all of it moving to say
like a sponsored project so this is a
project where I am working under the
sponsorship or somehow I'm being paid by
a company maybe it's my work at
sponsoring that project so I'm still
writing the code and fixing bugs still
probably doing the publicity and legal
governance maybe I don't know maybe my
workmanship in but they're providing the
build server security and paint expenses
what we want to get to though what can
we do if we've got tons of different
open source net projects with two or
three people working on them but they
all have the same cross-cutting concerns
how could we kind of pool that all
together and make some poor guy
administer all that for your project
right so instead you're just writing the
code and fixing the bugs and then we're
handling all this other stuff for you
and you still have the kind of control
over it you have the ability to say hey
we need this or I'm going to write my
own blog post when we need but you know
we can kind of help with that so this is
kind of a loosey-goosey sort of thing
I'm not really there's tons of different
things that go into different projects
but this is the overall kind of idea is
moving from you're really responsible
for writing the code for your project
the stuff you love doing and the
foundation that's supporting you is
doing this other stuff I should take a
step back for a second here and say it's
not just the dotnet foundation there's a
lot of other open-source software
foundations out there
I got patchy comes to mind Linux or
several other open-source software
foundations really honestly for the most
part I don't care like if you find if
you are if your project fits under a
software foundation that's going to
support you keep your project healthy
go for it like we have talked recently
the projects that wanted to join we're
like hey you know what you might fit
into this other foundation that might
work better for you you know I mean so
the idea really is let a thousand
flowers bloom have a thousand happy open
source project but have an open source
foundation supporting you right yes
absolutely let's add that slide I'm
serious
we need this project well okay so
actually I would say something more like
project trust Trust trust and project so
there is both the project won't vanish
I'm thinking here the Abraham Lincoln
when they did the Gettysburg Address in
PowerPoint and they did like nation not
sale but it's a project not vanished but
another thing is I can sell easier to
sell to boss right so endorsement I
guess since I mentioned that I have to
pop over to that
right exactly
so and I've talked to people lately
where they said like they that would
submit they are dotnet foundation
members and they said that that um yeah
well whatever right so this is the
information map fail they said that the
biggest advantage that they got out of
the botnet foundation was that they were
able to go into what you know banks and
say hey we are we are a dotnet
Foundation project we are supported by a
foundation it's a great great point so
thank you that make sense everybody the
idea here of it's you are a part of a
bigger thing is on paper the and so you
can the community can trust your project
more yeah yeah okay so I think that I
think that's a good point and to repeat
for people that couldn't hear John is
saying does this endorsement mean this
is a good project with great code that
will work in your project right is its
library something that's going to work
in all and I think that's pretty that's
not something we can say right it's even
if it's the world's great even if noted
time is the world's best time library it
may not work and whatever it is it's
debatable
it is not doing but well it shouldn't be
and hope I don't know if we need to
spell that out but I think the thing is
more that it's it is not a Bob and Jane
and Steve project is a dotnet Foundation
project you know what I mean so so in
terms of going and talking to a bank
going talking to your boss you can say
this is a project that is supported by
you know a legal entity like so I think
that I think that's that's kind of that
I do there so it's an idea of here are
projects both contributed from and some
outside of Microsoft
there's actually a lot more here it's
like got full but there's something you
know like cake is one that I've been
interested in lately there's people
there's there are several actually that
we're working with a bit like Kerala
State but there are projects that are
from inside of Microsoft that they're
like hey this is something where an
engineer inside a Microsoft Research
built
it's an utility you know and love you
use it probably before and let's
contribute it to the dotnet foundation
right so so that it's officially like
even if Microsoft loses interest even if
this guy goes and works at somewhere
else you know like so what like this
this project is a bigger thing that
lives on right okay so let's take a look
at a few more in-depth case studies so
one is this the idea of nougat
succession so this is this is something
that unfortunately like people go away
from projects for different reasons
sometimes they just lose interest
unfortunately sometimes people die right
we do die currently we do still die and
so what happens then is there something
written down as far as how does someone
take over this project so nougat is
actually a dotnet Foundation project and
we had someone raise this issue and they
said hey you have nothing spelled out
here so there is a very specific case
where someone had passed away and we
needed to figure out what happens to
their code and to the ownership of their
new get package we can do that as a
one-off right we can go through and we
can say yeah this makes sense and we can
verify this person passed away and all
that kind of thing but bigger picture to
do grown up open source to do this the
right way let's spell out an actual
policy so this is something where you
know I rung up the right people I go and
talk to the project managers over in the
nougat team I talked to the legal people
in Microsoft there's both the Microsoft
legal people and the dotnet foundation
legal people and we said let's hammer
this out now short segue here
I love the legal people I work with at
Microsoft we're open source you would
probably picture that they are just
sitting the
are saying no no no and the time was
that they did that was they were really
focused on minimizing risk they wanted
to take know as much as possible because
they controlled the risk really now I
have a good amount of the times that I
get pushback from from the legal reps
are where they're saying why isn't this
more open why is this controlled by
Microsoft why is this not you know what
I mean so there's they get it and so
it's it's really refreshing to be
working with them and there's no amount
of pushback against open source at all
but till we worked on this and we came
up with a policy right so this policy is
out is published on boxed at Microsoft
comm and it actually is it is something
where it's I think it's a pretty good
policy I think we're pretty pretty happy
with it being spelled out it is
something that I guarantee will probably
change it's guarantee will probably that
doesn't know if it's good English but it
is likely to change because this is a
you know most policy should continue to
get better but a surprising thing my
first my first thing when they raised
this issue they said hey what is your
policy and I said oh let's cheat let's
copy someone else's answer I went out I
looked at the other big packages package
repositories and nobody seemed to have
this spelled out NPM didn't many worthy
gems I looked around a bunch and I
didn't find anybody haven't spelled this
out maybe it was there and I didn't see
it but I saw in a way I almost felt like
we're kind of blazing some trails here
and I'd like to see us do more of that
so let's look at another interesting one
and this was one where I kind of you
know like what stuff around myself maybe
than I needed to be but I wanted to feel
the pain of what is it like being an
open-source project again I hadn't done
like run an open-source project for a
little while and so who here has used a
Windows Live Writer you know a decent
amount of people so it's like it it is a
a blog editor a blog post editor right I
loved I loved it I wrote so many posts
for using that it's great because it
handles a lot of formatting things it
lets you get down into the source code
you can go and tweak them
few years ago it was open sourced as
open Live Writer so this was a result of
a lot of people you know working
together and getting permission to
open-source something little segue there
it's a lot harder to open-source
something that you don't start from the
beginning it's really I've had several
projects I've worked on at Microsoft
including like build keynote demos and
painters like hey let's open sources oh
yeah let's wait till the end and then
we'll do it never happens it's really
really difficult
so just pointer there if you can if you
think you might open-source something
start doing it as early as possible even
if it's doing something like checking
into a private repository that having
your like licenses spelled out and
having a plan for we're only going to
use you know libraries that fit into
this license etc but so they did the
open source open Live Writer but then it
kind of they got a few releases out it's
using squirrel for for doing kind of
updates and then so that that was cool
and then they did a Windows 10 store
version of it so that was maybe
September of last year so that's that's
through the magic of centennial I think
it's a uwp bridge or something but the
idea is you can run so it's actually a
windows forms application but you can
run this desktop app converter and it
will kind of suck something in and it
virtualizes in business and it runs the
magic happens and it runs as a store app
cool so the problem with that was in
order to make both things happen we
ended up with a little bit of a
completely broken and ruined project
sort of because there was there you
couldn't do a secondary store release
but it was also broken in terms of doing
a desktop release so I was kind of like
well this is a dotnet Foundation project
let me get in and try and help and so I
took a look at things talked to a bunch
of people and I realized what what was
going on was nobody knew how to do the
store build the person that had done the
build was actually on the store team and
they had like moved off and then
something
the people that yeah it was a well so
one thing was in order to actually do a
release
you needed to Remote Desktop into a
virtual machine and run this script to
do a build so you needed all that you
need to login for this virtual machine
and then it signed the build that the
certificate was expired so so nobody
could do a build it was impossible to
build so we went through and we figured
stuff out and I actually work with
several people I worked with some Paul
Betts who does who actually build
squirrel and I work with or Novotny
who's who's got net Foundation Advisory
Council or yeah visor II council member
and he helped me kind of get the secure
build running so we've got certificates
and the signing service and all this
stuff set up so every code check in
creates a signed release right so we did
a release a couple of weeks ago and I
literally took the files that were
created by the signed release copied
them up to a blob storage and the
release is live so the idea there is
like okay it's a case study that is one
project but the idea is bigger picture
like can we do this for more things can
we document those processes can we
figure out some ways that we can share
some things so one thing that we can
share there is that code signing so when
you're releasing software a lot in a lot
of cases you need to do code signing so
that for instance this is a desktop
installer we need you to be able to run
the installer without smart screen
popping up and saying this is untrusted
and all that kind of stuff right so the
way a lot of people do this is you
download install these suits locally and
you manually run sign tool every time I
keep stepping on that link and you
manually run sign tool or you create a
batch file or something right so we
actually set things up teasing out there
and calling them to a signing service
and so that's something that net
foundation runs is a code signing
service where you are registered with
this you have a certificate you can use
to call into the service and it will
sign your binaries for you right so
that's an example of a service that we
can take and we can go from a specific
case to a general case and we can solve
a lot of problems
so the general idea is that
unfortunately giffy does not allow pull
requests but if they did I would like
this to be the gift that you get when
you search for open source software
foundation because the idea is right to
keep your project going and going so
what's next you know what do we do from
this well some things I would recommend
coming out of this one is to get
involved so there there are some links
I've got listed here up for grabs and
your first pull request if you have not
started contributing creating pull
requests these are good places to get
involved another really obvious and easy
place to start doing pull requests is
through Docs Microsoft comm so let's
take a look if we go in here this is
introduction to asp.net core right if we
look at this we could say asp.net core
came out almost 15 years ago as part of
the.net framework but I happen to know
because I read this blog that dotnet is
more than 15 years old right as a
February so we can actually go into this
we can click on edit and now I'm going
to go to click on the pencil and we'll
scroll down and we'll say came out more
than and then I'll sit click down here
and I will say updated dotnet page and I
will propose file change
okay so now I'm ready to create a pull
request so boom here we go you know how
some people do like I'm launching this
live on stage well I'm doing a pull
request live on stage it's so exciting
right but so we can see here that it's
going to go in and it should in a second
the dotnet bot should pick up and say
did you sign a pull request and then
it's going to you know it'll verify yes
in my case as a Microsoft employee I've
already signed a CLA
for for your case you know the act of
actually going and signing a CLA is
incredibly simple it's not it's not a
big deal you'll go you click through a
thing you get a DocuSign and you sign
and you say I'm signing that I have
permission you know that I am
contributing that my I'm contributing my
contributions right so I've gone through
and done tons of these like this is
something I regularly do with I am just
reading through documentation so I
recommend here's another one that I did
recently this was on you WP I like this
as a just general practice not just
because hey we're making the Box better
for everyone but it's a way of in your
brain thinking of continually doing pull
requests continually working together in
community right yes so here we've got
which was that system been I think
system dot been is later I had a lot for
that too so then just cast a wider net
this is a wider net website so again if
you are indeed starting to get involved
stage I definitely recommend take some
time and look at this I recommend like
sharing this around in your company and
figuring out how do we get to the next
stage where we add on here and how can
we level up calling out to you and
Cooper's talk here from earlier this
week so the video is not live for this
but this was really I thought really
inspiring there's kind of a a stick at
the beginning there is a who here was it
and who here was not a TN stock okay
highly highly recommended very very key
talk
talked about what is the state of dotnet
development right now where we are right
so M had a blog post recently I think it
without a complete - that is okay so
there's there's really a couple of parts
to this and first of all is establishing
the need right why do we need a
Renaissance and so so n does a great job
of explaining what are some of the
things that are causing stress and
sadness in the.net ecosystem what are
some negatives pressures on the.net
ecosystem but then I really liked him
his talk where he went and said where do
we go next what can we build where can
the community get involved and what I
think is really important that you
pointed out again is is the idea that
this is a problem for the community
really to solve and Microsoft can do
some things to support the community and
the foundation can do some things to
support the community but this is a
thing where the community really can
ensure to own this right as far as how
we move forward so I'm looking forward
to that video coming out and hopefully
hopefully since it was streamed on
channel 9 it also should be out there
okay excellent
so so that's really all I've got
unfortunately it's really it's like it's
difficult giving a talk with no code
it's hard for me to kind of plan the
time because I can space things out with
with that do we have any questions we're
a little bit early yeah
you know honestly that I don't know so
what John saying is programmer plus
programmer project project post project
foundation foundation plus foundation is
what I don't know like and so I actually
went to audit on a few weeks ago and
talked to some other foundations and
there I was like hey I'm from that
probably something like cool cool you
know and it's like okay what do we do or
you know so I do think that there's some
things where we can collaborate better
there are some and we have done some
some things where so the previous
executive director is that foundation
who is now a VP of dotnet Foundation he
ism is Martin Woodward and there are
several things where I've talked to him
before he like you know what Apache also
does this let's check with them so we do
have some kind of loose collaboration on
things there are some differences in
what foundations like so dotnet
foundation has dotnet at its core right
that's really like what that meant
foundation does but there are some
cross-cutting concerns and things so for
instance that signing service that that
Oren set up that we're using design
nougat packages and dotnet binaries we
actually did a decent amount of work
with talking to a bunch of other people
talking they did to start talking to the
windows team talking to people to say
hey can we create a generic signing
service that doesn't require you even
joining the foundation so yeah the
answer is I don't really know I do feel
like that's an area we can grow in and
if from my limited experience I'm
guessing that a lot of foundations are
relatively strapped on time and could
use some sharing of you know sharing of
resources and expertise so there is also
they do have some regular like them
conferences and meetings and stuff I
have not been to one yet outside of Oz
comment other questions or comments yes
get getting wet on the path a few so is
it mostly about visibility okay so yes
there's a few things so ant asking what
can we do to help with visibility into
projects one is definitely I do think
that like.net foundation can try and
call out publicity publicized projects
there is if you go to dotnet foundation
on the site there is a project look up
it's not particularly you know it's not
incredibly exciting that you can go in
here and you can search for different
types of projects right so if I search
for like build I believe we should have
what take building here somewhere right
had some others yeah so another thing
that that I think we can do more of is
there's this up for grabs so up for
grabs is a kind of common thing for new
people wanting to get involved and so
you can say like I would like to work on
something that has you know time right
you can find it many times not on here
that's sad but the idea here with this
is if we look at this project here it
shows there are six up for grabs issues
and the way that's done is these these
issues actually have the github label up
for grabs and you'll notice when you
look at these that some of these have
different different ways of marking
there's some some use up for grabs label
and that's kind of a recommended one but
there are others like superpowers which
is new to me uses the help mounted tag
right bond bonds and interesting ones
like am it's a serializing thing that's
pretty pretty advanced there's so if you
if you scroll through there's tons of
different ones so this is a way of
publicizing in terms of getting people
involved in your project
I'm also kind of hoping this summer and
I haven't completely like kicked it off
or anything yet but I'm trying to set up
some things where we're actually doing
some some open-source hackfest kind of
stuff where we're encouraging people to
get involved in hacking on projects and
then yeah so those are some ways I'm
open to suggestions
- of course is there a better way a
difficulty with publicity is sometimes
like I don't want to make just a bunch
of noise either right so you know it's
important to kind of have targeted and
focused and useful information we do
have there's like Twitter net foundation
dotnet fdn so we do things on here like
for member projects right here's the
cake team you know Ladon listed on this
weekend dotnet so here's another thing
actually that we just launched recently
this is myself and a teammate miranda
gaga and we're doing these code
conversations so these are short little
interviews with open source net
developers the ones we've done so far we
went and recorded 25 in channel 10
studio because we could just line people
up but the goal really here is to have
at least as many from non-microsoft
people right so screen sharing and what
we're doing on this is trying to go
beyond the here's a an advertisement for
project and look more how do I actually
build something with it right so we have
some things in here where we're talking
to like for instance tag helpers and
we're sitting that down at a limo and
I'm saying you know how do we actually
create a tag helper totally open to any
other suggestions of course but those
are some some things other questions
that's one more
I know it's your but one more person has
a present but you're welcome you know I
have to say it's a people ask like what
do you think of this job do you like it
and stuff it is and some some people are
like Oh foundation you must hang out all
day it's like super easy and you have a
few budget and none of those things are
true but I love it I seriously going
back to you know my first original hello
slide right I love Matt I do love open
source and I love to say hello but but
so you know I mean those are some key
things and there have been times where
you know like oh man I get a little
discouraged and I'll talk to Martin who
is doing this before and he would just
say like you know you can help out a
project everyday like that's a big thing
so thank you thank you all right folks
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
