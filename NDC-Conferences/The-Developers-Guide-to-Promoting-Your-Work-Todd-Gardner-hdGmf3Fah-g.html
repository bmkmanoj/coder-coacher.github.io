for coming to this session this is the
developer
to promoting your work this talk is
probably a little different than most of
the other amazing sessions here at NDC
most the other ones are gonna talk about
how to build something with new
technologies or how to apply things to
be more effective this talk what I hope
to show you are some ways that you can
be more successful with the things that
you're already building to take those
things and show them to bigger groups of
people and and make them even better
with that feedback and get a clicker to
work so over the last ten years of my
career I've I've stumbled and I've
learned kind of through trial and error
how to promote myself through the things
that I wanted to do and it didn't come
easy to a developer like me I'm I'm not
inherently this extroverted person this
persona that I've been able to develop
but being able to do it and learning
that has completely transformed my
career and I think it can do the same
for you and I think this is really
important because all of us regardless
of what you're doing and where you want
to go we're building a product right now
whatever you want to be in the future
the startings of that are happening
right now you're building relationships
with other people
you're building the connections that are
going to grow into your next job
breaking into contracting starting your
own firm getting a promotion building a
blog launching a product whatever it is
that you want to go off and do that's
all happening now but one of the biggest
fallacies that seem to happen in the
developer community is that we all
believe that that if you just build
something great that it's just gonna
work right and that's not true there's
so many great tech examples of that not
being true
Betamax clearly we all used Betamax
instead of VHS tapes for the longest
time the difference is that you have to
spend just as much time talking about
the things you build as you did building
them so that people know about the stuff
that you're doing and how awesome it is
in my opinion almost all great things
have followed this same basic formula of
how they've grown they started with
promoting their idea
and then they build a little bit of it
and then they spend a bunch more time
promoting it and then they built a
little bit more and then they promoted a
whole bunch more and developers tend to
go step 2 step 4 step 6 you just keep
building and building and building and
never actually talking about it with
other people and so this presentation
I'm going to tell you three stories
about me about different phases in my
career and how I learned to promote
myself to accomplish my goals at the
time and hopefully I'm going to use some
examples you can apply these these ideas
to what you're doing and where you want
to go related this could also be a story
about how the hair has moved from the
top of my head down around to the bottom
over the years and so way back at the
beginning when all the hair was on the
top I I used to work for a company and I
decided I wanted to become a consultant
because at the time I worked for a
company called big Corp CBS worked for
big Corp big tall building boring name I
don't really know how they did millions
of people working for them this is what
my office looked like it was a cube farm
much like any other cube farm does
anybody else's office look like this is
what offices look like in the UK or is
this a u.s. thing you don't you don't
have these all right well so I hated
this this it wasn't the cubicles
themselves but it was everything they
represented it was like a yearly
performance review somebody who I barely
knew evaluating whether or not I was
doing a good job and my only path to
advancing my career really started to
look like it was going into management I
couldn't find a technical path to doing
better and more I was doing the same
projects every year with just slightly
different people in the chairs in a
slightly different variation of goals
and so I decided to break into
consulting and the great thing about
consulting is you gonna use lots of cool
clipart pictures of people shaking hands
and laughing and it's just it's just
what consultants do but before I could
really be successful Consulting I needed
to find clients and so as an independent
how do I find people to hire me and I
thought the best way to do that was
through professional speaking was to
come to user groups and conferences and
talk about the topics that I was excited
about and I was interested in to try and
show people my perspective clients
hey I know what I'm doing and I'm fun to
work with and you should hire me and so
I didn't know what I was doing here's a
picture of me at one of the very first
conferences I did which is a conference
called twin city code camp and this was
awful I'm not going to show this to you
but it is out on YouTube if you want to
go find it it was basically me for like
90 minutes in front of a computer
staring down at a barely acknowledging
that the audience existed and like live
coding some some JavaScript and doing
some stuff in fact I was so nervous
before I used to go on stage that I
would used to carry around a flask of
bourbon and like maybe 15 minutes before
I was about to go on Jacob
you shouldn't have known that maybe
about 50 minutes before I was about to
go onstage I'd be like in the bathroom
like pulling back if you just just to
settle the nerves and it works I mean
you don't want to take too many sips
because then you might slur onstage but
but that helped me get over that initial
anxiety to get up here and start talking
and the more I did it the more
comfortable I had I became doing it and
the more effective I was at
communicating my ideas so I leveled up I
got feedback I watched my own videos and
saw how terrible I was and tried to
start fixing it and you can grow through
like there's a like a ladder that you
can climb through this professional
speaking most communities have a very
rich group of user groups that you can
go to speak to and they're all like
looking for people like all of you could
go back to wherever you are and whatever
you do and probably speed the featured
speaker at your user group next month if
you wanted to and go out there and start
getting this experience and once you
kind of like start improving yourself
you can quickly grow from a local user
group to a local conference to a bigger
conference and then and then come to NBC
and it'd be awesome and there's awesome
feedback loops that happen if it's
easier to get into other things when
you're doing this one of the other
things that I think is really important
that a lot of first-time speakers don't
do is that they reuse their they don't
reuse their talks I reuse my talks and
here's why the first time you deliver a
talk is literally the worst time you
will ever give it is the worst time your
jokes are wrong
your topics are wrong you're saying the
wrong thing about the wrong topic and
you don't know that yet you don't know
that until you've given it a few times
every time you give it you get all of
these subtle cues from the audience
about what's resonating and so as you
give your talk get feedback change it
make it better this particular talk I
think I've given about a dozen times
it's gone through two full rewrites
where I've just completely scrapped
everything and started from scratch and
it's considerably better than the first
time I gave it I've watched the first
time I gave it it was awful
hopefully it's not so awful this time
but you'll be the judge of that
once you go to the conference's I think
it's a very important point to always
stick around for the after party because
that's when great opportunities really
happen it's the people who you've made
the best connection with you will find
you at the after party and you will make
these real these deep connections and
you'll you'll establish these
friendships which will be the building
blocks of those next steps in your
career all of the greatest advancements
I've ever had in career have come
through a relationship that developed
because we were drinking beer together
at the after party I can tell you lots
of stories about that when we're not on
camera later so why does all this matter
Todd I probably just spent the last five
minutes trying to convince you to do
literally the most scary thing you can
imagine about getting up onstage in
front of other people I know it's scary
but like I said at the beginning you're
all building a product right now you're
building yourself you're thinking about
your idea you're building connections
and sometime it will become time for you
to try and sell that thing you're doing
when you're up on stage and you're
talking to people we're becoming friends
in a way maybe not like lifelong like go
on vacation together every year friends
although maybe I mean you never know but
we're becoming friends in the way that
I'm recognizing you we're gonna talk
over the next three days I'm gonna you
know follow you on Twitter and we'll
have a chat and you'll recognize me
you'll be like oh I saw Todd at NDC
London we did this thing is cool and
later when you go off and launch
something and when I go off and launch
something we'll want to succeed because
selling
to your friends is easier than selling
to strangers we want our friends to
succeed regardless of what you all go
and do the bigger the community you have
around you the more friends you have the
easier is going to be for you to get
your first client your first hundred
customers your first thousand
subscribers whatever it is you want to
do so because we're friends now
and friends help each other let me help
you if you're looking to get into
speaking if you're looking to try this
and don't know where to start or you
have an idea but you don't know how to
turn it into a talk send it to me and
I'm happy to offer my advice take a
picture of this here's how to get in
touch with me that's my real email
address send me what you have and what
you're scared about and what your
questions are and I'll get back to you
it might not be until you know next week
when I fly home but I will get back to
you and so seriously if you'd like to
take a picture of this please do that
goes for everybody watching the videos
at home so then then some of the hair
started falling off my head and moving
around and so I want to tell you the
second story and this is a story about
Todd the entrepreneur so after I had
been consulting for a couple years I was
doing a lot of JavaScript work and what
I started to realize is that a lot of
times JavaScript kind of sucks and that
it breaks in ways that I don't often
expect and so I was working for a client
and we needed to know how JavaScript was
breaking was very important to that
client and so we built a little way to
track the errors that were happening in
our application and it was kind of neat
and then I went on to another client and
they the same problem so we built
another air monitoring like subsystem
for that client I think I did that like
three or four times until it finally it
beeped into my head that hey everybody
needs this let's build it once and so I
partnered up with a couple of my other
contractor friends and we started a
company called Trac Jas which the point
of it was this so nights and weekends we
started working on this project to say
hey what if we just built an error
monitoring subsystem independent of any
other projects in a way that could just
drop in to any of the clients we were
working with
and so over the six months lots of
nights and weekends
lots of bar nights you know banging out
code that we regretted the next day we
released track J s and the important
realization was that nobody cared we had
invested thousands of hour out of hours
of our lives into building this thing
and we released it expecting oh this is
brilliant
everybody's gonna need it everybody's
going to sign up day one and nobody
cared that we carried it all and so
we're like oh well we're just missing
that next feature
if only we had X this is gonna work and
so we we do it again and we build that
feature and then launch and nobody any
cared and we do it again and again and
it took us probably 18 months to realize
that my job in this company for it to
succeed wasn't to just bang out the next
feature the thing I needed to do was all
of the other things you need to market
your product you need to figure out who
is gonna use this and how do I like
describe their problems to them how do I
call them and like let them know that
this is a problem how do I engage with
these people how do I tell people who
are likely to want to use this how to
use it and how it solves their problem
and then how the people who are using it
how do I make sure that they're having a
great time and so I wasn't any of these
things I was a developer and I didn't
know where to begin I had gotten pretty
comfortable with talking about myself
through public speaking and being an
independent consultant but now I need to
not talk about me I need to talk about
this other thing this I need to develop
a brand for lack of a better word around
around this other this other entity
called track J s I need to figure out
who is this going to be when I talk
about track J's who is it it's not me
it's kind of me but it's not it's a
separate thing and so I looked out and a
read a bunch of literature and my
favorite my favorite person talking
about this on the internet was this
character here names fake Grimlock
has anybody followed fake Grimlock on
Twitter same I never heard of this
person he's at
I don't know he it is at faint Grimlock
on Twitter and it is a giant robot
dinosaur from outer space that's here to
make your startup awesome and he talks
in all capital letters and he just drops
out punctuation and why because it's
awesome and he has a lot of really great
ideas on the topic and I encourage you
to go look at it but I'm gonna bring out
one particular one which is this idea
that's one of the first things he wrote
about which is minimum viable
personality it's not minimum viable
product it's what are the main things
you need to do to identify your product
your blog your brand who you want to be
and so in order to develop your Minimum
Viable personality here's that here's
the quote which I'm going to try and
channel what I hear in my head when I
read fake grimlock here's here's how I
believe fake Grimlock would sound most
important step for build products is
build product second most important step
is build personality for products no
have personality products boring
no one wants all products can fall into
the categories of do you want to be the
thing that people need but it's kind of
boring or he want to be bacon you want
to be bacon develop a personality so
that your bacon so the basic kind of
mechanism of how to develop your Minimum
Viable personality according to fate
Grimlock is you have to answer these
three questions of one how do you want
to change the world what is the thing
that you want to make better by your
thing existing second what do you stand
for to make that happen and then third
and this is the part a lot of people
miss is what do you hate because you
come off as really fake if you're just
generally positive all the time to all
things you have to be against something
and this kind of manifest yourself as
your mission your values and your enemy
and so if you can define those three
things you can't you can start and so
here's how I did that for track gist cuz
I went through that exercise so how did
we want to change our kind of model was
we
a lot of really crappy websites on the
internet with broken Java scripts and
tried to book a flight and it didn't
work or I can't interact with Twitter
because the button is broken if I do
these key combinations or whatever so we
wanted to see that happen less we wanted
to know tell developers about when their
stuff breaks second what do we stand for
what is gonna be different about us like
what is our priorities as a company we
always think that simple before powerful
is kind of a gap in the developer
community a lot of tools try and jump to
like super uber power tool that can do
everything but has this archaic context
to do it and we didn't want to be one of
those we just want to be like hey we're
gonna tell you probably what's going on
but you probably can't take it any
further than that but it works for 80%
of the time and what do we hate we hate
broken web sites and cryptic javascript
errors to the point where we actually
got in trouble because we used to like
publicly shame on the internet people
who had like javascript errors which
probably was not a good idea
it was not a good idea but it was a
manifestation of this is what we hate
and so with all of the advice I'm gonna
offer you today iterate because you're
gonna be wrong this isn't this isn't
like a definitive thing like a lot of
program like you don't know that you're
done you don't know that you're right
until you just start talking to people
and if people are bored if people are
uninterested if people are offended then
you've gotten something kind of wrong
and you need to re-evaluate so once you
have a brand you need to start building
an audience figure out who you want to
talk to you the important thing to
remember about that
because when you're building an audience
it's always about them we are
narcissistic animals that are more
interested in ourselves than you and
that's okay everybody is so when you're
building something you can't immediately
expect people to care about you and what
you do you have to bring something to
the table for them so how do you build
an audience first figure out who you
want your audience to be who are the
people that you want to talk to you're
not going to build something for
everybody on the planet if you're going
to try and build something for everybody
you're gonna fail because you're gonna
sell to nobody figure out who are the
people who are interested who you want
to be interested in and then build stuff
for them build things that are
generally of value for them write blog
posts about something that is valuable
for them build a tech demo about how to
do something build a sample application
that does something interesting with
your technology show things that are
inherently valuable independent of what
you want to do and then go and talk to
them they're not going to come to you go
to the places where the people who you
want in your audience are naturally
congregating and talk to them there be
part of their conferences be part of
their github organizations be part of
their social networks the example of
that is this right now I know it's so
meta I have identified a good audience
for the trashiest brand as the people
who come to NDC London and so I've built
a presentation which I hope is going to
help you all become more successful in
your careers by showing you some of the
things that I've learned along the way
and then I'm bringing it here and
offering it to you with the hope that
you'll become part of an audience that I
want to grow together this isn't a
perfect example and with ever whatever
you want to do you can apply this same
thing think of who you want to be in
your circle and build something for them
and go to their conference and talk to
them it gives you a great opportunity to
meet people who can help you grow again
iterate you're gonna be wrong you're
gonna go the wrong events you're gonna
build the wrong thing it's okay
learn from the experience and keep going
if you're lucky and you've built a brand
and you have an audience and you're
talking to the right people and they're
interested you might have a chance to
give a pitch and say great I love it
thank you so much tell me what you do
now you have to answer and tell them
what you do and so how do you do that to
be effective at that I think you need to
do a couple of things is you only have a
little a little bit of time to say one
what do you do second how am I better
for it again we're we care about
ourselves it's like I don't care what
you do I really care like how am I going
to be awesome after I have that thing
and then third if they care about the
first two what's the next step how do
they how do they get this thing you're
gonna get rejected doing this
you're gonna put yourself into this
vulnerable situation where your blog
yourself your product your whatever
you've just laid it out on the table for
this other person and they're just gonna
yawn and kind of walk away and say
that's cool
see ya it's gonna happen a lot and you
need to be okay with it but every one of
those experiences teaches you something
it teaches you that either you're
selling the wrong thing or is the wrong
person or you did it in the wrong way
and you don't necessarily know which of
those things is wrong but you have a
chance to like figure that out through
trial and error and so you're gonna
iterate I want to show you an example of
an early version of a track jeaious
elevator pitch that I recorded on video
I actually used to do this at earlier
NDC events so if you've seen me at
previous NDC events and we've gone to
the after party you might have seen this
particular demo at a bar that I used to
give like on my hand while holding a
beer so here it is hey I'm Tom from Trek
Jess this is my business card demo that
describes what makes Trek just awesome
so this is a javascript error right
he is undefined scripts Jess line one
it's terrible JavaScript has not been
good about giving us good air
information and it sucks if this is all
you have to go with to fix a customer
problem but the first thing is knowing
that it happened because these errors
they don't happen in your server so you
have great logging tools now they happen
in your users browsers and probably
crappy ones like ie 9 so the first thing
Trek GIS does for you is let you know
that it happened and we tell you
interesting statistics like 80% of your
customers who are on ie 9 are running
into this particular error on a URL but
that's just to start because I don't
know where to begin
debugging he is undefined so Trek jess
is listening to events that happen
before the error to give you better
context
trechie is polyfills and reports console
and makes it safe to use in all browsers
the console allows you to log on your
client side app like you log on your
server and record interesting events and
state changes in your application in
this case we know that when the user
first loaded the page your application
started initializing the user for a few
seconds later your customer pn
interacting with your app and enter 16
email characters into this input
treacherous reports interesting metadata
about these user actions but we never
record the actual values to protect user
privacy
after entering the email the customer
clicked on this button and this Ajax
event began going to slash CPI slash
users it lasted thirty five hundred
milliseconds before coming back with a
five hundred and that was the last thing
that happened before this error occurred
which indicates the air probably has
something to do with handling the
response we package all this information
up with other interesting context about
the browser and application for your
developers and with it they can
reproduce the exact series of events
that let a customer to a problem and fix
it quick
so that's track J s we're protecting a
trillion pages a month and making the
web a better place I'd love to help you
to check us out at Trek J Escom so
there's there's a lot that's weird and
awkward and not good in that but it does
cover those basic three things is it
talks about what do we do like how are
you better for it like look at all this
context that we can give you and then
third these are literally printed on the
back of my business cards and so I can
hand them I made these with a company
called mu mu business cards to let you
print a different picture on the back of
every card and so I carved up a core
part of our UI to be able to tell a
story here so like in my pocket at any
time I have these set of cards I can
just pull it out and say and tell this
story at the bar while I was drinking
now it's a little long and this
recording is not great and a lot that's
you know we iterated on and have made
better since then but this is an early
version now the fact that it's on
business cards and there's actually a
physical thing is kind of gimmicky but I
think it's cute gimmicky it's not like
bad gimmicky because I think it's cute
gimmicky because a lot of people have
like come up to me after the fact and
said that was awesome like that was like
I remember that for like years
afterwards that you had that the whole
business card demo thing and so gimmicks
can be good gimmicks can make you
rememberable so if you're lucky enough
that people are interested in what you
do after your elevator pitch they're
gonna you know want to learn more
they're gonna come to your page say
alright tell me about this person tell
me what what they do tell me about what
their software does tell me what they
write about whatever and so I have some
ideas around how to design a page to be
effective at bringing those people in
not like the CSS layout stuff but more
about how to actually convert people who
might give you money into people who
actually give you money and so my idea
around that are I think pages should be
simple I think
the page should have an audience in mind
of who do I want to talk to what group
of people do I want to land on this page
and once I have that group of people on
this page what do I want them to do and
I think these two topics is what I
should spend all of my time designing a
page around is who are they and what do
I want them to do and so I want to give
you an example of how I do that today
with with track J Escom so I'm actually
gonna just flip out and not show the
show this okay so here is here is our
web page now the audience for this is
people who might want to give me money
so people who I've talked to they've
come to our site what do you think I
want them to do I want them to start a
free trial I have a giant red button
above the fold saying hey I really want
you to click on me and I'm trying to
like identify with them I'm trying to
like put myself in their shoes so I
found this this piece of stock photo of
like developers staring at a computer
like oh my god what have we done we're
losing so much money how are we gonna
fix this now the thing that I did I'm
just particularly proud of this is when
I found this piece of stock photo they
were just developers concerned at a
screen and I turned them into JavaScript
developers because I photoshopped in
that sticker and I can prove it because
if I go to track this for angular their
angular developers but that just me
playing alright so I want them to sign
up for free trial so I'm trying to
identify with them and give kind of a
headline at the at the top and then if
they're not quite ready and they scroll
there I'm trying to get them more proof
that I want them to start trial so I I
tell them a little bit about the
software and what it does and remind
them about what our UI looks like if
they haven't already seen it I try and
offer social proof a lot of times just
talking to somebody isn't enough you
want to know like well who else uses it
are you like just a fly-by-night operate
how many other people actually use this
thing see some social proof point out
some other companies give some quotes
blah blah blah and then I pitch it again
I'm like alright I made my case please
hit the red button and let's go
and then I offer one more bit of advice
at the end it's like okay a little bit
more social proof Hey look at all these
people who do it but I know that my
audience like I imagine a lot of thought
of your desired audiences are developers
and a developer is gonna be like that
number is moving awful fast
I'm pretty sure that's Todd I'm
gonna see how you do that and I'm gonna
write you a nasty email I'm a popover my
console I'm gonna look at it and look Oh
we just left them a little note right
there in the mark-up I'm like oh hey
there developer I'm sure you'd
understand it wouldn't be cool for us to
just get a live session count every time
some random person hits our website so
here's the equation that we're using to
do it we do it with a little bit of
JavaScript if you want the number you
can email us at hello at Transcom and a
lot of people look at this because I get
at least one email a month of somebody
who emails me like dude that was awesome
my god I want to know and like that was
just cool because as developers we're
often as interested in how our our
things are built as the fact that they
exist I look at the sites of customers
that are of companies that I'm looking
at working with and see how their how
their page is built and so we spend a
lot of time actually leaving little
notes and little things in our code I
like things that we think are our
customers are gonna be interested in
about how did we build something we're
developers and so the markup of our code
is just as much a representation of our
of our brand as anything else
so again iterate I'm iterating the slide
iterate you're gonna be wrong you're
gonna get things wrong we've changed our
website a number of times we're in the
process of changing it again now but
don't overdo it this is specifically for
the web developers in the room we tend
to build technology instead of just
using what's already there if you want
to start a blog your first step is not
to write your own piece of blogging
software right what's available it will
work for what you need to do I promise
you do not need to reinvent everything
you do to launch your website you do not
need to build new technologies and
research the latest greatest way of
doing something you are procrastinating
the hard work by doing the fun work of
tech and I know that that's happening
because I do that all the time so now I
want to move on to my third story here
and this is the story where basically
all of the hair has moved all the way
around which is which is now and this is
a story about Todd the producer and so
through my relationships with
conferences I spent a lot of time coming
to conferences and hanging out with
speakers and hanging out with attendees
and we'd have a great time and then the
conference would just end and people
would go all kinds of different
directions and you didn't know where
anybody was some people would leave town
and other people just wanted to hang out
and tell jokes and so Jacob and I
actually this is the first time I think
he's ever been in the talk when we've
gotten to this this part of it but it
was Jacob and I who had this idea to
create pop comp and pub cough is this
idea that all of the best experiences
from conferences happen in the hallway
track they happen they happen when the
relationships start building and we
started tearing down those barriers and
so we wanted to create this place after
the conference when everybody's at their
you know their peak of the conference
high to just like take advantage of that
and like we're gonna throw a party and
we're gonna tell developer jokes and
it's gonna be a great time so we pulled
together a bunch of funny speakers to do
five-minute funny talks in a bar we buy
all the beer we buy a bunch of food we
just kind of have it's a good time so
now I want to talk about some of the
actual
Kanaka this now I went through the same
exercise kind of developing the pub comp
brand developing the pub comp website
all those sort of things but I'm not
going to cover all those although I will
just kind of reiterate on the page
design what do you think all right this
is the pub comp page what do you think I
want people to do on this page by - you
can see that my design philosophy has
fully carried on to the pub comp website
like I want you to do this one thing
please do this one thing but now I want
to talk about the actual like mechanics
of growing pub comp after I've already
have the brand in the audience in the
pitch I want to talk about marketing
words scary marketing words I'm going to
talk about the funnel how many people
have talked about the funnel where they
work now few people how many of it is
this kind of like this hand wavy thing
that nobody really talks about but it's
just like the abstract thing that the
marketers talk about or do you actually
know about so the funnel is this core
part of your software architecture yes
it is part of your software architecture
it is probably the most important flow
in your software architecture it is how
you turn people who might give you money
into people who will give you money
without this part of the flow of your
software architecture your software will
not make any money and it will go out of
business and everybody will be fired and
it will stop existing whether or not
you've thought about this or not it
exists the funnel is one or more steps
that your user takes between when they
first figure out who you are and when
they give you money this exists for all
of you today whether or not you've
thought about it is whether or not you
have a chance to optimize it and make it
better here's the funnel for pub Kampf
the pub comp people land on our page and
there's three simple things that I'm
trying to get people to do one is I want
them to look at who are our featured
guests and what's stupid silly things
are they talking about
and if they do that I feel like they're
much more likely to want to comment buy
a ticket then they'll look at the
tickets and see like the details of the
of the event where is it when is it how
much of the tickets that sort of thing
and then hopefully they buy a ticket and
they become a customer my funnel is
probably way simpler than yours but you
all have one today of what are all the
steps that you're asking your
prospective customers to go through to
give you money so let's let's bring this
back out how do you know any of this
works this is part of your architecture
and it exists in some abstract way but
how do you know if it works you spent
all the time defining your goals and
defining your flow how do you know if
it's working or how to make it better or
what to focus on and so if this was a
piece of software you would do that
through tests you would write a test
suite to know which parts are working
which parts are failing and that sort of
thing and so analytics is the test
harness for your funnel analytics tools
allow you to measure how effective each
one of these steps are the common
mistake a lot of people make with
analytics is they just throw Google
Analytics on the page and they think
they're done like oh we have all the
metrics we need we're good to go too
much data and unstructured data isn't
valuable you need to take your analytics
and you need to tune them to what you
think your funnel is you should have
reports that tell you how effective goal
one is how effective goal two is how
effective goal three is and you use
analytics to build those things for you
so you're going to build tests with
analytics specific to your funnel and
how you do that will depend on what your
funnel is and what tools you want to use
the thing that's different about these
kind of tests versus you know a red
green passing failing test that you
might be used to is that this is the
test results you get from analytics and
I don't know what this means this is
good this is bad this is passing it's
very subjective and it's open to your
interpretation so I'm going to show you
some more real data so again here's pub
comms funnel and over a particular time
period where the numbers just happened
to round out particularly nicely I had a
thousand people come to my
vent page 196 of them came down to view
speakers 140 but of view tickets and 118
bought tickets now that roughly
translates to this conversion rate on
every step of the way right 19% of
people came down and viewed speakers of
the people who are left
71 view tickets and so on now that means
if I total it all through the person who
comes in the top two how many they come
out the bottom I have about eleven point
eight percent success rate if I just
total all those up these are my test
results I don't it's now up to me to
interpret these about whether or not
they're passing and failing and where I
want to invest time I particularly think
that that 19% sucks and I think I should
do better but I'm pretty happy with the
other ones and so recently if you've
been to the pub comp website before you
might have noticed it looks different
now we actually did a major rebuild
maybe three weeks ago these are numbers
from before the rebuild so I'm still
gathering evidence to see whether or not
it worked but the rebuild was largely
meant to address that number right there
is I wanted that 19% better but the
jury's still out on whether or not that
worked so let's get back out to the
funnel itself so we dumped leads in the
top we have some percentage that's going
to become customers and then we're gonna
get money out the bottom and so if we
can figure out how to tune this thing
just right we can turn the funnel into
like a machine that just prints out
money for us so to do that we need to
figure out what is it gonna cost us to
put a new lead into the top of the
funnel and so there's lots of ways to do
that what I talked about the beginning
were more organic ways of building
relationships with people who are just
gonna come to your website because
they're friends with you they know who
you are that sort of thing but you can
also just buy leads through a process
that we all know called advertising the
common method of paying for advertising
on the Internet today is cost per click
there's lots of other ways but I'm
oversimplifying for the sake of this
example so we can pay for new leads to
come to the panel by advertising in a
cost-per-click way
and so for pop Kampf the mechanism of
advertising that I found particularly
effective is Twitter developers tend to
use Twitter a lot especially at
conferences and Twitter has great ways
that I can target people who I think
might be interested in
so before I throw a pub comp event I
build a set of ads for every one of the
speakers that I have featured at the
event and then I broadcast it out to the
region so you might have seen ads if you
follow any of our speakers or you're a
develop or if Twitter things to your
developer between the ages of 18 and 65
and you're within a 50 mile radius of
London you probably saw a pub comp ad
maybe and so I have a whole bunch of
numbers these are for an earlier event
where I'd built this all out so I have
ads for every speaker so like I could
you know use this data in interesting
ways like I could say hey I had this ad
here for Lindsay pageant and I had
another ad here for Damien and 126
people like Lindsey's ad and zero people
like Damien's ad so clearly Damien's
not-not-not good clearly I have data
evidence to prove this fact I have dated
Revit driven evidence but ultimately
what's important to me about this is my
overall is I what I care about is for
every dollar I put in versus how many
clicks I got I paid a dollar 17 to get a
click on my ad that is the effectiveness
of my advertising and so that is the top
of my funnel I pay a dollar 17 to get a
new lead into it because I click means
they land it on my website and they
entered the top of the funnel and now I
have a chance to win them over
so we already learned from my analytics
test that my funnel performs at eleven
point eight one percent and so if I just
take those two numbers together I can
figure out that if that's my conversion
rate and my cost per click it cost me
about ten bucks
to acquire a customer I can pay ten
dollars and somebody buys a ticket to
pop Kampf
on average now this kind of starts to
make sense of if I can be more effective
with my advertising and pay less or if I
can make my funnel more effective I can
get customers cheaper and that's how
that starts to work out so I have this
all kind of put together I pay a dollar
17 for that percentage to pay 10 dollars
to get a customer but I don't know if
that's good or not yet because I need to
understand what does a customer worth to
me was a customer worth to your business
and that we use the term called lifetime
value it's not just what they pay you
once it's what are they gonna pay you
over the lifetime that they're with you
and that's gonna be different right like
the lifetime value if you have a blog
the lifetime value of a customer is
going to be like probably really really
small
it's like a customer comes in they might
look at three pages how much are you
gonna earn off of your advertising
partners off of showing you know three
ads you know a fraction of a penny so
you'll have a very very low lifetime
value whereas if you are an enterprise
consultant the lifetime value of a
client could be hundreds of thousands of
dollars and so how much you're willing
to spend to get a customer it's going to
depend a lot on what kind of business
you're going to do for pop cough though
we're an event and we cost about thirty
dollars a ticket it goes up and down
depending on the city we're in and how
much beer costs but it's about $30
ticket and based on prior data if you've
come to a pub comp event there's a 50%
chance you're gonna come to it again
like that I don't have to buy you
through another ad that I'm just gonna
send out an email and say hey we're
coming back to London and half of those
people just buy a ticket right away
they're like I loved it I'm back and so
those two together mean I believe my
lifetime value of a customer is about
$45 is they're gonna give me the $30
once there's a 50% chance they're gonna
do it again so I use this number when I
think about that so when you're thinking
about the lifetime value of whatever you
want to do kind of a good rule of thumb
that you need to keep in mind is that
the cost to acquire a customer that $10
that you pay to get a customer needs to
be 1/3 or less of
lifetime value right and the reason for
that is you can't pay all of the money
that that customer is going to give you
over their lifetime to get them right
you need to earn some money
- like deliver the thing that you want
to do it's actually you know I have to
buy the beer for pub comp I can't just
spend all of the money getting them to
buy a ticket and you obviously can't
spend more because then you would be
losing money faster than you're making
it so here's all of my numbers put
together on the funnel so I'm spending a
dollar 17 to get ten dollars to acquire
customer but I get forty five dollars
worth of value out of that and so what
that means when we kind of like
transform this a little bit is that pub
comp is this marketing machine that
allows me to put ten dollars in one side
and buy $45 worth of beer on the other
and I can just keep doing this the more
money I put in the more beer comes out
the other side and I think that just
makes us a win for all of us so these
were the three stories I wanted to tell
today about how I got into consulting
how I started a software business and
then how I started a user group event
kind of thing kind of the big takeaways
here are one biggest piece of advice I
can give you is that if you're at all
thinking about it get into professional
speaking it opens up so many doors with
whatever you want to do you don't even
need to know what you want to do ten
years from now professional speaking
will be a way to enable you to be more
effective when that happens second build
up your audience professional speaking
is a way to do that but you can also do
it with blogs or just being more active
on social networks or just going to the
community groups in your area building
up your audience is going to enable you
to get more friends who are going to
support you whenever you go off to
launch your products and then third once
you're ready
once there's actually money involved
measuring your funnel is critical to
like understand whether or not this
thing you're doing is going to be
sustainable and how to make it as big as
it can possibly be so this was the
developers guide to promoting themselves
thank you so much for coming I'm gonna
be here all week I'm down at the truck
J's booth but I'm happy to talk about
like whatever not so much on camera
once I get off camera I'm happy to share
like more detailed numbers about how I
do other things thank you so much for
coming have a great time I'll be here
afterwards to chat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
