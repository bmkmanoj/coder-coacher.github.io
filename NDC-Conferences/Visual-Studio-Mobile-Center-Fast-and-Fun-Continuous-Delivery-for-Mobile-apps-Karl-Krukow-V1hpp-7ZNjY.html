simply asking you one question how often
do you guys release your mobile apps
okay don't worry I wasn't expecting an
answer I know this is Scandinavia so I'm
from Denmark no buns no-one speaks at
conferences so I prepared up front I did
a little research and and I'm going to
share you the with the findings of that
research and so before I worked at
xamarin and Microsoft I I worked as a
software developer as a consultant for
one of the Danish banks and in that
research I also been in that work I got
to see kind of the insides of house and
such an organization works kind of what
their release management process looks
like and I was kind of preparing for
this talk here also and I was thinking
about you wouldn't be interesting to
kind of look at the weekend banks and
try to figure out because you're not
going to tell me so I'm going to look
out and find some data for somewhere
else and so I started kind of
researching then the wait first I had to
look up what were the Norwegian banks
and and and then I started researching
kind of what are the major banks and how
frequently do they ship their apps and
in doing that research I came across
just by chance an interesting kind of
presentation and slide deck and what
that side peg is was essentially like a
survey a research done by Deloitte and
they were trying to figure out which of
the Norwegian banks has the best mobile
live experience so they were talking to
customers and gathering data and then
they basically did a score from 0 to 1
what is the best customer experience in
a and the region mobile banking app and
then you get a rating from 0 to 1 and
then I asked myself so for these given
the ratings how often do they release
and I found something which I thought
was interesting so unfortunately at the
bottom we had D and B is that I don't
I'm not from Norway I'm from Denmark is
it an Oscar Bank or is it just DMV
Moscow Bank and and at the top we had a
spa bank best I liked it
upon mr. and Niceville counter at the
bottom and the top and then I looked at
well how many releases that they do
since 2014 and DNP had had four releases
and spa banking had eleven releases okay
that's interesting then I looked at some
of the other ones
hence banking they also had four
releases and they were also carrying the
lower of this survey score and then I
looked at I forget the name of this one
I'm sorry scandi is its Kenya Skandia
bung okay and they had 90 releases okay
I thought this was really interesting
because it's backing up my hypothesis
data that supports your hypothesis is
always good day all right
but then I asked another question okay
so fair enough this is you know banks
what if we take the world's best apps
probably being built by the world's best
mobile app engineering teams okay what
they do so I just grabbed you know where
like some popular apps that I thought
kind of interesting so Google Maps
Facebook LinkedIn Twitter and then I
looked at you know these are pretty
major apps like they have very good app
store ratings and they have a huge
customer base user base you know
millions of uses essentially and they
have over hundreds of thousands in some
case millions of ratings and then okay
what what do they do right and then the
numbers look something like this
175 releases a year of their mobile app
well if you kind of convert this into a
release cadence and you take something
like hence banking well then they are
there at something that looks like a
yearly release Kayden's right scandia
sorry nuts Canyon spa Bank invest was at
a quarterly release capes based on those
numbers
Google Maps every two weeks and Facebook
is weekly okay so if you compare the
least frequent than the highest frequent
you're you're basically looking at 50x
like an order of magnitude and then
times like
that is pretty significant so I thought
that that is great this is really
interesting and because the content of
my talk is essentially this you guys
should release more often okay so if you
are at a yearly frequency you should try
to go quarterly if your quarterly you
should try to go monthly if your monthly
think about bi-weekly or even weekly
release cadence okay that's in essence
the content of this talk I'm going to
try to convince you to go and do this
all right but why I mean okay so I have
some data you know some scores there
from some random survey and and okay
Google can do it fair enough and you
know LinkedIn is doing it but why why do
you want to do this why do you want to
shorten your frequency so in case you're
not kind of already aware of the notion
of continuous delivery which is
essentially shortening that's release
latency if you wish and then the primary
benefit of that is reduced lead time so
the lead time is the time from someone
gets an idea until that idea is designed
coded tested and in the hands of users
now obviously if you're going to patch
up a bunch of stuff together and then
release a year from now your release
cadence is slow but if you could do a
feature and get that out immediately
well then you release cadence and
significantly faster and that's great
right because then you can ship features
faster to your users you can fix those
bugs they don't have to wait a year for
a bug fix essentially and what it
enables you to do essentially is get
faster feedback right so if you have an
idea for an feature you can go and
design it and build it code it and it's
essentially done but now it's just lying
around waiting for that yearly release
and if it turns out that that great idea
you had has not got such a great idea
well then it's going to take you a year
to find out because it's only after
chips you really find out right while
your competitors may be already aware of
this because they ship this feature
realized it was not great or maybe was
really great and they knew already you
know eleven months prior you
also your release process itself is
going to be more reliable because you do
it all the time right if you do
something once a year you don't know how
long it's going to take you know how
many floors you're going to find but you
can do this every let's say every week
well then you better document it because
we're not release guys on vacation
somewhere well someone else has to
release right so you better documented
better make sure it's a flow free
process and it becomes just more
efficient because you're doing more
often so you tweak it and finally you
just get higher quality we all we've all
done this like huge change better
together with a bunch of other huge
changes it's just you can't reason about
it right you can't test it to shift more
bugs we could do incremental much much
easier to reason much much easier to
test so this is a this is good stuff and
I have one more slide which I really
really like it's taking from Atlassian's
block where they had a blog post called
the business case for continuous
delivery and and it's completely made-up
but I love it anyway and so basically
like on the y-axis you have the
emotional state of the team so if it's
under the middle it's like the team's
not doing great and on the right ear
time so let's say you want this yearly
release cadence right you plan ok I'm
going to ship this thing in a year and
then okay you do your estimates whatever
and you start developing and after a few
weeks you realize ok we're behind but
you go yeah it's fine we can catch up
later right and as you get closer and
closer to the target date and you of
course you don't really hit that target
date as we never do and things tend to
begin more urgent right it's beginning
to be pressure from the ID side I
thought we agreed that you would ship
the state while you're not shipping it
manager is pressuring you you start
working faster you start maybe losing a
bit on quality and you're not feeling
great and then you kind of go down this
cliff of urgency and you hit the bottom
and then you actually ship the thing
being exhausted and and this graph was
not it wasn't built for mobile for
mobile there's an additional low here
just there and it's because when you're
building iOS apps you have to then
package the app and deliver it to the
App Store and then you have to kind of
pray to Apple and say please dear gods
of Apple can you accept this application
that I'll give you for your divine app
store and then maybe and maybe not they
will and then maybe seven days or two
weeks later it's published right so I
like to call that the abyss of Apple to
use the bottom that's the worst part of
it and I've been there I remember what
it's like to push and then go okay what
now okay let's see we ship it and then
we get relief right but you start asking
questions what is the use of thinking
right and what are the ratings what is
happening publicity wise with this
application but let's say that goes well
and you can finally have your release
party and do your peak of jubilation but
then oh here comes the second year
planning and we're into this again and
this is really how you feel
I get stressful and its release and then
you go the most of the time you can are
not feeling great and I think this
really hurts
team engagement then and just work
health and and I just love this graph
because have done this and I know it's
true even though it's made up all right
so I guess by now
what I've said is not super
controversial right I mean we can all
agree that that's true so if that's the
case then I want to ask you what's
stopping us so clearly we're not all
shipping week week after week right and
what's the reason for that what I hope
to do in this talk is to convince you
that the some of the reasons why you're
not doing it there aren't completely
invalid it's just not true it's based on
not fact and other reasons are pretty
valid but there are also solutions to
that so that's what I hope to do here
and you can shout out with other reasons
why why this is hard because it is hard
so the first thing that's stopping us is
this right we just talked about it the
big gated process basically we have to
give our application to someone
and then we can't do anything they take
control when it's going to be released
and if it's going to be released so if I
want to have a cadence like regular
sleeping every week but I have to have
this black box I can control how how can
I have a stable continuous delivery
process well actually if you look at
this graph it's kind of interesting so
on the x-axis you have time so it goes
back to July of 2015 and on the y-axis
you have a review cycle time so how many
days does a on average will take four
you have to get reviewed and it's true
yeah and in 2015 we're looking at a one
to two week cycle but if you look at the
graph it's definitely declining right
and if you look at the red dash or the
bottom you're actually looking at an
average of one day review cycle and in
fact there's now talk of the two-hour
review so being able to publish review
and get your app in the App Store in two
hours so it's not true anymore
further is an additional thing it's true
that if you build an app for a year and
you submit it for review this may be a
50/50 chance it can if you accept it
because it's so big that could be
something in there that's violating some
Apple guideline and they reject so you
don't know but if you ship and you get
approved and you ship Delta Delta Delta
Delta every time it's going to be
approved so it's not like it's this
dangerous thing and so this is not valid
at all this is not the case in the mall
oh yeah do you know what that is it's
not nice well it's probably nice for the
people because I think it's the
Christmas vacation of the people doing
the Apple review and then they come back
and that's this big workload so fine you
can do continuous delivery just be
mindful that around that time you may
not be able to ship as fast as they need
their vacation rate okay here's
something else complexity and just
novelty so if you're like many new to
mobile app development they're so you'd
love to learn right you may need to pick
up new languages Swift Objective C or
Java C shop if using xamarin some of
these language don't even
have garbage collection that is weird
reference counting stuff and new tools
IDE Xcode max code-signing
Gradle a lot of new technology and
really mobile comes also with a set of
programming idioms there are ways in
which you build those apps and you have
to learn those there are thousands of
API is lots of new things to learn
there's a lot of complexity around code
signing and distribution if you've ever
tried to do this on iOS
I mean I've learned it year over year
over year and four years in a row
and every year I learn something new
it's just amazing and just continuous
integration it's not really mainstream I
think we're getting there but it's only
kind of recently that there are really
good robust tools and and you might not
be able to run your CI for your mobile
app in your normal CI infrastructure
because you need the O's max right if
you configured Jenkins and get Xcode on
them so given all this stuff you need to
learn it's clear that we don't also have
the time and energy and capacity to also
set up all this sea ice bath and so the
first bit is completely valid you do
need to learn the stuff like you can't
just you need to learn mobile right
although with salmon obviously if you're
already C sharp developer and you can
keep using this or studio but you still
need to learn you know the api's and you
do need to know the programming ones but
the other two I hope to convince you
today that you don't need to be so
scared of learners quality like quality
and confidence and quality is hard and
mobile because you have all these
devices and they are you know thousands
of them and they're running different
Noah's versions have different hardware
and so on open screen sizes and and it
can be challenging to just test that it
will take time and your QA cycle might
look kind of like this so you write up
your test cases in a Word document you
set them somewhere outsource for an
agency that has you know the skills and
devices available then two weeks later
you get those Word documents back and
you go and convert those to issue
tracker items and then your team can go
fix it right but that totally kills your
QA cycle time
so I hope also to convince you that that
you don't need to do that but actually
the worst I think is kind of the
cultural aspect which is basically if
you're in an organization where they
used to doing two releases per year or
one per year then you're you're faced
with a challenge when you go to the
release management guys and you say
yelled we're going to do weekly releases
they're just going to give you a bath
and kind of kick you out of the room and
go back to the waterfall kind of program
well my program and development module
but here I have good news so I was
talking about when I was doing
consulting and at this Bank and and at
that time it was their first mobile app
and when I with the team and I we got
into this the management they didn't
know anything about mobile so they
basically just put us in a room so you
figured out here's some Macs and iPhones
and Android devices and do whatever you
need to do to ship us an application so
we were kind of on our own and everyone
else was envious of us because we got
all this hardware and but we didn't have
to follow any you know release process
dictated by this bank and so so that
really enable us to do this and I what I
really liked about kind of this slide
here is that if you take the research I
talked about the slide deck that was
evaluating mobile experiences well then
the bank the spa Bank invested with the
best experience they had the slide that
was kind of explaining well why how did
we manage to do this and I'm taking some
quotes from this year and I'm going to
read them in Norwegian so be prepared
mungus linka folks and brusett uncle
minute or Lehrer
Cannella is that good yeah all right so
I think this means lots of good
hard-working like people engineers that
care about customers and they learn from
customers right so learning continues
learning from the customers and then
this one it vague links media may
autonomy in night bumpkin yes
and that means basically that the
development environment for this team
was characterized by autonomy which is
exactly the situation I was in so I was
yeah I know that I've been there and
then continuously developing lots of
small incremental changes that's what
they say made them successful that's
exactly what I'm talking about here so I
think there's hope in the sense that if
you're in an organization where this is
not the way we do it
well then sometimes the mobile team can
kind of spearhead they can be the first
team that brings this process in to an
organization that's not thinking this
way so it's an opportunity if you think
of it like that all right
enough talk let's do something and
actually I did have another slide before
I do that so the demo have you seen the
my driving app that was released at the
build conference not this year last year
good that's good
Dennison ooh so my driving is pretty
interesting in its own so there's a
mobile app and then there's a huge kind
of assure backed infrastructure that
uses IOT machine learning all sorts of
cool stuff I'm going to just focus on
the mobile app piece and continuous
delivery for that but basically the app
is so what you do is you have this
sensor you can buy and plug into your
car and that will collect telemetry like
what's your mileage how much gas do you
use what's your speed what's your Indian
load and it will transmit that via
bluetooth to your mobile app and then
we'll ship that so azure and kind of do
analysis and compare your driver
patterns with other other drivers so it
was kind of sample app that was released
and so I'll just show it to you I've
kind of two step demo here and see so
here we go my driving oops
actually you wanted to go from scratch
go so you kind of you can log in and set
up your account I've set it up in demo
mode so I'm just going to skip this off
so we have some sample data and then as
you can see it knows that we are here in
Oslo and you can kind of say okay I'm
now going to go for Drive so I'm going
to hit record
and then saying you don't have your IOT
device thingy that's going to tell me
the data so I'm just going to simulate
and then we could drive around a bit and
then star and we can save a trip alright
then we get a summary of that trip
that's fine we also record our past trip
we're going to look at our past trips so
here James Montenegro was driving around
Seattle and you can see here a map and
then I can draw the slider around and
you can kind of see how much fuel did
you use how fast was he going
how much is 30 miles I think he may be
speeding 35 miles okay and you're going
to follow that around you can go into
your profile and and you can kind of
look at settings here you can switch
over and use like the metric system
rather than the stupid Imperial stuff
that's pretty simple app and one
interesting thing let me just shut it
down
one interesting thing here is that it's
built using salmon so basically you have
a shared code base where you can compile
this for iOS Android and Windows and
what I want to do here is I want to make
a small change and bear with me for a
second where I'm going to change so you
see basically this this blue bar at the
top I'm going to change that into black
and then I'm going to bump the app
version number here number five all
right looks like a pretty good change
let me check
diff yes that is what I wanted commits
black since push that up all right we'll
get back to what there's this in a
second that's the kind of sam'l that
move as I said get back to it now let's
look at continuous delivery pipeline for
iOS app development alright so when you
kind of read into continuous delivery
literature you may run into the concept
of value stream mapping and a value
stream is really just what are the steps
need to happen like all of the steps
that need to happen from an idea until
it's in the hands of the users like this
lead time and mapping just mean to draw
it out as a map so in your work there's
some some kind of process for which you
can generate an idea and get it approved
and give go into design and so on I
don't know what that is it's different
in each organization you need to go and
draw that out but if you look at it from
a technical perspective it's it's pretty
similar across organizations right you
probably have your source and I hope you
have your source in source control and
ideally you have a CI server which can
check that out and when there's a change
you obviously you need to build the
application and error out if there's a
compile error essentially basic stuff
right with what will you do need to
build for two targets so that's the
first piece of complexity you can target
simulator which is x86 or you can target
arm CPUs to vary complexity other than
that standard stuff like you do unit
tests integration tests is that it are
we shipping not really right if you're a
fence you might even do some automated
end-to-end testing of your application
so compile it run it on an actual device
automatically and you probably notice
I'm not going to ship unless at least do
one passive like manual testing some
things you just can't automate or some
things you just want to be absolutely
sure a human has been through it and are
we done no so go all the way to the user
you need to sign the application for
distribution in the App Store you
probably need to update your screenshots
in the App Store you need to update your
release notes maybe change the metadata
then you need to go and update this
binary sign binary package to iTunes
Connect and then submit for review and
then you've got your praying thing and
then two hours later you get you publish
your application right with the new
stats but even so we haven't still
shipped the user because the user needs
to go and update it's not like a web app
or just push it out using it to pull the
update down and then hopefully you have
some way of getting feedback on the
change you made right so and that will
generate new ideas for experiments for
features or just bugs really or crashes
you need to go fix so we kind of draw it
out
like this and this is kind of what the
that value stream is going to look like
alright so if you task you're the
developer so you task would give me this
give you this value stream thingy the
guy's talking about you're the developer
so what you do you go online and you can
okay I got to set up my CI for Jenkins
for Samer and you read and you watch the
video and you buy a Mac and you
configure the SDKs and you set up your
signing and you install Samer in and you
test your scripts and you said of I
don't even know you set up your plugins
or whatever like this is just this is
part one of the article by the way yeah
and if you make a step here something's
not going to work you need to create
users you need to set up email yeah I
did say buy a Mac kiss on iOS you can
only compile it on a Mac with Xcode so
already there's like okay so we have to
run our own machine what in the office
okay so it's pretty daunting right but
think of it in the same way like do this
incrementally what is the smallest
possible thing you can do which gives
you value and it's extensible in the
direction you want to go what is the
smallest possible thing well it's
probably you're getting that Mac and
getting it builds your application and
then you can start using that that's
value already you don't have to build
the whole thing do it incrementally in a
continuous way right so if you do that I
have maybe a slightly controversial kind
of thing here so if you starting with
scratch you have no automated testing
you just set up your CI and you can do
just one test should be a UI test a unit
test on integration test well I
unfortunately revealed my opinion so in
my opinion if you have you can only
write one test what gives you the most
confidence in the quality of your app
well one engine test is going to test
some part of some class essentially or
some behavior over unit but one spoked
sui smoke test into and smoke test it's
going to in
Abell you to test that your app is
actually working on real devices kind of
end-to-end right so if you're starting
now you just build one why not do that
all right so if you had that running you
definitely want to try and distribute
let's say the test is passing you want
to distribute that to some people so
they can do manual testing so you can
start small and then add things on top
of it and get value all the way the same
mindset of continuously doing things
instead of doing big things quick note
on automated UI testing how many are
familiar with that ok not so many that's
that's ok so automated UI testing it
exists for browsers like for for webs
and exists for mobile apps also it's
basically a test of a program that's
simulating a user using the application
right and useless they find controls
like buttons and they tap them they
scroll around the intertext they rotate
the device they move they go to Spain
and test application because you have
some sort of GPS functionality in the
app but you do that with a program so to
do that you kind of need an API right so
here's some example in Samer in UI test
which is a framework for this and where
you're saying ok app please tap the
button called
called help so just fine or just
anything really that has to text help
and we're kind of simulate tapping that
or app please wait until you see this
element which has the text Inc but if
taken 1 30 seconds there's something
wrong so I better fail the test and you
also need api's to launch relaunch
install reset the application state so
you can kind of start from a clean
application state for each test and then
you can add screenshots for for test
reporting essentially and now if you if
you have these tests you can then
obviously run them on devices and that's
kind of where test cloud which is a
system I've been working on for some
time now comes into the picture so test
cloud I'll tell you on how to get access
to it later but first out is essentially
a cloud of mobile real devices and what
it enables you to do is that the cloud
is paired with an execution
infrastructure so that you basically
give the cloud here's my app here are my
test binaries can you please run them in
parallel across these devices that I
want to test on and then gather the
results can I get the data into one big
test report and gather screenshots get a
performance data and and then that's
that's kind of one of the solutions to
having all these devices in your draw in
your office and develops are taking them
home in the weekend and you forget to
bring them back and they run out of
power and who has the Samsung Galaxy yes
if you put it in the cloud then you
don't have to worry about it thank you
and you might think well that's pretty
cool I'm a build one of those and I'm
just going to ask you to please nut so
this stuff is extremely hard we've been
doing it for I guess four years now and
we're not really done you have to deal
with this essentially so you know
consumer hardware devices running tests
and continuously batteries inflating
instability of ADB because you don't
want flaky tests right that's going to
kill your CI completely so make the test
stable but how can I do that with all
this crappy hardware and you have to
deal with Wi-Fi you have to deal with
setting up parallel execution gathering
the test results so some people try to
do this and then you go best decision
let me try to go back we're still
working on it
so don't DIY test cloud all right more
demo
let me check time it's good all right so
I want to show you a bit of automated UI
testing so remember this application I
showed you before and let me get this
and so remember the the thing where I
could kind of move the slider around and
the cow is driving well this case
actually has a automated UI test reader
so sorry this app has a order weighted
UI test suite associated with it I can
run every time you make a change so that
we don't have to manually
humans go and do that so I'm going to
run one of those here and so this takes
a bit of time to launch the first time
but then what you'll see is essentially
kind of simulation of a human using the
application it's going to launch the app
and let me just get the interest back
here oops and it's going to fail because
I didn't reset the application I was
cooking it you see skips off so here
we're dragging the slider around and
we're asserting that the car is moving
around so with every change we could
kind of automatically run this we just
plug in a device and kind of enable it
and I thought that was pretty cool so
let's kind of find this as the past
trips test so what does this code kind
of look like can you read this
barely check it out and set the font
with the fourth yes thank you fill this
up a bit
yes sir about that and so this was the
test we saw so we navigate to the past
trip and then from the past trip page we
pick James I'd be Bochy if you remember
here we take James to leave at you and
then we move the slide around basically
so this is phrased in a fairly
high-level manner it's using something
called the page object pattern to
organize the test so they're nice and
readable it's clear what we're testing
but if we jump in a lower level kind of
what's going on here like to move the
slider it's just like a symbol method
call I accept the slider value this is
the slider that's the query that targets
the slider and I want to set it at this
number here so it's pretty
straightforward code I'm good all right
so now we can build an application we
can run tests on it now I want to talk
about setting up a CI pipeline which is
essentially
vicious to do mobile send and so what
this product is first of all it's a
preview product and we're still working
on it
and but it's essentially the intention
of the product is make this super easy
and super simple and super fast and
pleasant to work with so you don't have
to deal with all these things I was
talking about before like setting up
Jenkins and buying Macs and all that
stuff so see I in the cloud if you wish
it's going to help you implement a
continuous delivery process that's our
mission
and so let's go okay go to page go to
page here so let's get started for free
so if you do this you you're going to go
to sign up page in here it's pretty nice
you can just connect directly if you
have a get up account
so you're basically sign up and locked
in if you have get up you can do
Microsoft other types of auth
now in my case I already have an account
so I'm just going to go ahead login so
what you see here now is the UI from
Wilson and are there's a lot of stuff
here it's because I have a lot of apps
because I use mobile Center all the time
but I've made an organization which is
just a grouping which is a bit simpler
so for here I'm going to create a new
app and this is like going from it's
actually just your source code to the CI
pipeline which is build unit test smoke
test and distribute to manual users all
right so basically I do add new app
let's call it an NDC 21 is at 17 minutes
and in this case I'm talking an iOS app
and this project is using Samer and
that's the platform you can also do like
just Xcode objective-c Swift or react
and I use a marine that's creating my
app now to get started I can set up my
salmon app to use these new cottages
mobile center and Linux and crashes and
then add these you know I guess it's
essentially a line of code to kind of
initialize it but you don't actually
need to go and do this yeah
this is once you do you want to use some
of the more advanced features we can go
ahead and set up the build part so this
is equivalent to the The Big Read Me
part one of the big the big reach me
which we only saw part one but running
in the cloud so my source code is in
github you could also use big bucket or
VST s and now it's kind of scanning my
github repos and I'm using my driving
just connect that now it's scanning the
branches of this github repo and I have
kind of multiple branches remember that
commit I did in the beginning of the
talk that was on the master branch here
this is 14 months ago I guess
essentially so now I'm going to set up
this branch for CIS interview I'm going
to target my Iowa solution in this case
I want to do a release configuration
I'll use the default mono and Xcode
versions I'd like to build for device
and I can either like man you just
trigger bills using a button or I can
just set it up every time I push it's
just going to automatically trigger
build and the whole distribution chain
so that sounds cool I'm going to do that
now as I said if you're doing iOS
development you're targeting devices you
do need to sign your applications
otherwise that's just out of the
security and models work so I'm going to
upload this to mobile Center to have it
manage that so I have a web man whoops
development provisioning profile dump
that here I have my certificate which I
used to sign oops I dropped it somewhere
around just go again
and dump that here and certificates are
encrypted so we do need password here
alright so that will enable me to build
now as a switch here which is I want to
also run a what we call a launch test
which is essentially like a super quick
smoke test it will just deploy the
application to a real iOS device an
iPhone or an iPad and just make sure it
doesn't crash like at launch that's
pretty embarrassing that sounds cool do
that and then I want to set up
distribution so essentially pick a group
of people I want to simply up to when
this is done and that's it I can go save
so that's been configured now I've kind
of provision the background look and I
remember this and you see if you jump
into this essentially what is happening
now is we're waiting to grab a build
agent essentially and we're going to
stream the log output of this build
agent so this is actually a Mac machine
with Xcode on it running in the cloud
that's building my application now you
don't have to buy Mac exactly that's the
whole point you don't have to buy that
Mac you don't have to I mean one thing
is buying it the other thing is actually
maintaining things and that's the thing
I really cost you you're going to need
max anyway because you need them for
development but not for CI well not you
don't have to get them for ok so
it's not like it's going to clone my
code now and restore NuGet packages all
that stuff and I'm just going to cancel
this because I don't want to wait for it
all right let's get out of here let's
get back here so I already set this up
for this application here you see I have
a bill that's running it's kind of close
to done we can kind of tag along here so
that's the change I made I guess it's
what 17 minutes ago so it's it changes
the color of this bar and since black
you see we're getting this morning that
I decided to set up this device testing
that's gonna take some extra time to
complete the bill that's why it's not
quite done yet I was hoping it actually
was by now
well it's only a few minutes and it's
done so in the meantime I can show you
something else which is cool so if you
remember the test I was running here
doing all that stuff the whole
regression test read but I've also set
that up to run in test cloud which is a
part of mobile center so if we go in
here we can kind of look at our test
runs this is the one that's running now
but I ran one kind of earlier and it
actually found a problem here so let's
click into this test room so here you
see all my tests the one we were looking
at was the move clip slider and what you
see here less left are the screenshots
so we said app that screenshot that
becomes a bullet here so you can
essentially see what does it look like
like on an iPhone 7 and you can trace
what was the memory consumption and CPU
usage how much time is this step take
and then you can kind of navigate around
here kind of look at what the
application looked like in this list
this ran in the cloud as an entering in
creation test you can jump into locks
and so on so it's kind of cool you're
seeing this across essentially i/o at
the latest iOS 9x and all of the mate
major minor versions of iowa's so 10 0
10 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 kind of running at the same
time well what about this crash thing
well I shouldn't said that what about
this test failure well that's the piece
that's changing the settings from into
the metric system and when we're on the
settings page and we tap this lets go
into use we can see we tap changed to
metric apparently this happens which is
not so good so it looks like the
application crashed and then the test
failed so now we know it was tested
automatically and we're notified
all right so we can go into the locks
here and kind of see the test log
essentially which is what is all the
stuff that happened in the test room so
I can go in debug at what point in time
does it happen what was the arrow right
let's go back for a second and go back
to test runs you see the built test the
launched test I did before it's done now
so let's jump in and see so it should
have a black bar here and you see it
actually did so the change I marriage or
I guess it's 20 minutes ago was building
the cloud tested in the cloud and what
else anyone
yes distributed
so we just need to update I want to show
you my email so I was waiting with
showing the device this is an email I
got just before it's saying hey release
number nine is ready this is the app
version do you want to try it out so now
I'm being a manual tester you know
within the organization that needs to go
and test the stage version so I can
click this link and I'm going to get to
an install page in a second yeah it's a
bit slow Wi-Fi bits okay we could do
install I know if you saw that with the
the release the the commit message which
actually the release notes in this case
so it says black tint we go install then
it says press the home button to check
progress you see it's installing not on
my device so we have the full like that
thing I talked about pretty much set up
and something like five minutes no max
no nothing and this is slow I'll show
you in a second alright so that was one
thing and let's see I had one hour right
which would give me at least 15 minutes
for so I want to say a few things more
and so now you have your CI setup
essentially which is really good um
but you might still experience crashes
like we're good programmers but we can't
prevent all crashes so for that once you
have the SDK enabled in your application
we're going to do a crash reporting so
essentially and this is going to pick up
crashes and in this case you see we have
one group of crash which is essentially
it's like the same crisis it may have
happened multiple times but this is
successfully the problem so I can see
and kind of crash for users and how many
crashes per day and I can click into one
of these and I get now after this is
intelligible but I get now essentially
the line of code which cost us problem
right and I got the system extraction
here it was supposed to be a reference
to it but monk
I guess that's out of context a bit here
but now I can go debug right and go fix
it
push the fix get it out there test it
again I know immediately it also does if
you if you know what's application is an
IRS that's essentially what it does it
converts the native crash into a
readable spec trace with lines and all
that stuff and in those analytics so one
thing is you have this application but
once it up there how do you understand
your user base how do you understand
what they do with it are they engaged
how many times did they open it per day
how long are their sessions what kind of
devices are they using what kind of
languages are they using apparently
Norwegian and English in this case and
what countries are becoming from which
version of the app are they using
another interesting kind of question to
figure out so that's tracked
automatically just by integrating the
SDK you can also set up a custom events
which essentially you can put in
whatever business logic you want to
track here or kind of business events
you want to track here and since how
many start recording events did we see
how many percent of users do it and so
on and you do this by essentially a line
of code for everything you want to track
and then it goes in here so you kind of
get your monitoring and then a final
thing real quick if I head back to
slides is also push
so once you've once you've figured out
that okay my users are actually not
using my application as much as I want
you kind of want to re-engage them and
one way to do that is push notifications
right they're not using the app let's
try to send them a push and get them
back in and do something now one problem
you run into for instance let's assume
that you're building an app that's
selling things at discount rate like not
all users want to buy the same things
maybe some users 120 percent discard on
Justin Bieber tickets and other people
want to go to the monkey museum right so
you want to somehow group your users
into audiences and then some targeted
push
to them so you can really engage them
and that's essentially what this is so a
service to send you need I have an
integrated SDK here but it's a service
to send push notifications and kind of
group an end to audiences so for
instance I've created an audience which
is Norwegians which apparently not known
regions are using this app but then I
can go and can send a notification to
this target audience I mean assuming the
app supports push notifications so
that's kind of mobile center at a glance
essentially continuous delivery and kind
of DevOps as a service and hopefully
it's really quick to get started and
something you guys want to try out let's
see I have I want to spend just a few
minutes maybe it's better through
questions actually and so let me recap
here it's essentially this that's the
message release more often if your
yearly quarterly if your quarterly
monthly your monthly two times per month
and maybe even every week and it's not
as hard as you think it may be with that
I'll take some questions if there are
any questions I can't see anything
yes it will be it's not right now
I don't she's asking as he's asking
about Adobe support cordova support
especially not Adobe used to be Adobe
now it's Cordova yes
yes it was it went a bit quick but in
the setup I had like create new app
select OS iOS or Android or Windows
reacts to support for Windows it's
coming for this cloud also it's not in
test out yet so iOS Android Windows and
then you pick your development platform
when you do native which is iOS Swift
Xcode or Objective C or Java Gradle
builds for android yes doesn't have to
be Samer and that's important yes yes so
we have SDKs for the various platforms
we're trying to so like every developer
you know every app every platform kind
of mentality here trying to target
everyone yeah yes so he's asking about
end-to-end testing if your app is using
some kind of Bluetooth you know let's
say I would see device something some
other device and you can when you're
running it locally like you can connect
that and do whatever you want in the
test cloud obviously we don't have your
specific device so it's today you have
to just you can use the automated
testing for free just run it locally
with your devices but obviously in Tesla
we would need that peripheral device see
yep this one here yeah so code push is
also part of this yes um please excuse
Yeah right so I think if I understood
the question correctly you're asking
about basically optimal optimizations so
for some JavaScript tool change you have
something called tree shaking which
essentially will get rid of code you're
not it can infer that you're not going
to use and it's not something that
specifically supported but you're going
to very soon you're going to be able to
put in like custom scripts so you could
add a custom step which is kind of
custom script which does whatever it is
you need to do
depends on what requirements you need to
be installed on the build machine that's
about it but it's it's not something we
support or don't support it's not kind
of it's something that you need to your
build okay I think we're pretty much
there I want to ask you one thing if you
guys don't mind I'm doing a survey and
the way I'm doing it is I have two
questions one is are you going to
release more often can you show me hands
yes half of the audience success and the
other is do you want to try mobile
center more than half even better so you
guys that we're not going to release
more often but you're going to try
mobile center you might end up releasing
more often yes okay fair enough
it depends on yes
yeah yeah yes there are definitely
industries where you don't want to do
this health care is one yep I mean one
of the engineers on my team used to work
in health care and there was like every
time they're releasing they were just
afraid of being torn apart because they
did not want change in our system
because it screws up their their work
yeah the work processes I guess all
right send me a tweet or an email if you
want to answer the survey or just ask
questions and good luck with mobile
Center you can sign up with ak8 at ms
flash Mobile Center also happy to chat
if you want to talk more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
