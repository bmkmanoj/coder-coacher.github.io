right I'm gonna get kicked off everyone
got a beer we good
excellent so CSP xxp STS pkp CAA et Cie
oMG WTF BB Q this is my talk today and I
can hear all of you thinking the next
acronym in there which is ffs so the
friendlier and more sane version of the
title here is probably modern web
security standards this is what I'm
going to be talking about and I can't
that the title is kind of on purpose I
want to kind of cut through this acronym
soup that we end up with and all of this
confusion around these different
technologies because a lot of them when
you allow them to be are really simple
and can help you an awful lot for close
to no input why is little effort is is
possible for some of these so you can
probably think of the talk more is a
series of whitening talks that introduce
you to each one of these different
technologies so you can learn you know
are they applicable to me could they
help me how can these things make my
lives easier because I'm a security guy
and this is a security talk but a lot of
these things can just make your lives
easier as developers and this is why I
use them a lot of the time so I'm gonna
get kicked off and I'm gonna dive right
into it and the first acronym from my
title is something called content
security policy now if you see me on
Twitter before or anywhere else or even
speaking somewhere else you'll have
probably heard me talk about CSP already
CSP is an immeasurably powerful
mechanism and it can do so many
different things for you and it was
originally designed to stop something
called content injection attacks and
what I mean by that will be that
something that perhaps looks like this
so you have your web page and you have a
lovely review section at the bottom and
you want people to click on the five
stars and type how awesome your product
is and they submit it but some sneaky
person will write their review and
include some patient code in there they
might put a JavaScript tagging like this
so you save their comment into your
database and then you render that
comment on to your homepage and say look
at this great five-star review we got
and that come
has the script tag in it now show of
hands who wants this script tag loaded
on their home page exactly right and why
don't you because we as humans can look
at this and say well we've got this
script tag here and it's been loaded
from evil calm which is probably not a
good start and it's also called
keylogger j/s which is definitely not
what we want but the browser doesn't
have that level of context and
understanding like we do the browser is
parsing the HTML it sees a valid script
tag and it goes and fetches the script
and places it into the page the browser
doesn't have the information it needs in
order to to make that assessment of
whether or not it should load this
particular script and we could make this
even harder for the browser because we
also have things like inline script and
these kinds of attacks are called XSS
cross-site scripting and this one's even
more difficult because what's the
example here is particularly harmless do
you know whether I is an attacker port
out there or whether the hosts put that
there themselves and it's supposed to be
a genuine script on the page that should
be there now we have no point of
reference we have no evil com we have no
key luggage is so in line scripts like
this are even more difficult to deal
with because we don't even have any
information to make the decision on with
what we should do with this script and
these two things are what CSP was
originally created to fix their their
content injection attacks they call
cross-site scripting but CSP is evolved
and it can now do so many more things
for you so we're going to look at what
CSP is and how we deploy it
so CSP content security policy is what
we call a security header it's a HTTP
response header that you use
specifically to configure a security
mechanism a security feature so you can
see it alongside all the headers here
that you're probably somewhat familiar
with you define the content security
policy header and then you put your
policy in the header so it goes along
with the page to the browser and you say
to the browser here is the page and here
is the policy that I want you to enforce
so we need to build a policy the
policies are built of what we call the
directive so within CSP there's a whole
bunch of directives this is a subset
this is not close to all of them but
these ones
for all different locations the browser
is allowed to load content from so if
you were to specify the image source
directive you would think if the browser
a list of domains and that means that
the browser is permitted to load images
from those domains so you say here's the
image source here's my CDN under
Facebook these are the two places that
we can load images from you could
specify the font source and say this is
where I'd load my fonts from and things
get really interesting really powerful
when we do the script sauce because you
say this is the place or the places that
I load all of my scripts from so you
take a policy you build the policy this
is probably the most basic example of a
CSP that I can give you so we've defined
the content security policy ahead of
here and on the previous slide there was
the default source now if you want to be
fairly relaxed and kind of laid-back
about it you can say by default we'll
load from these different locations and
that means any content can be loaded
from these locations scripts images
Styles everything self is a keyword in
CSP which means my own website so by
default I'm happy to load things from
myself hopefully you should be otherwise
you've got issues that I can't help you
with and we can load things from this
other website as well from CDN j-s com
so you send this to the browser and
already we've neutralized the two
attacks that I just talked about the two
cross-site scripting ones because the
first one it will look at the script tag
and it'll go into the source attribute I
say write evil comm we're trying to load
a script from evil com there's no
scripts or specified so I'll check the
default sauce evil.com start in the
whitelist and the browser will simply
skip over that script tag and won't load
it so we've completely neutralized that
first attack vector and the second one
the inline script one of the things that
you get by default with CSP is that the
browser won't execute any inline scripts
and this is because of the issue that I
said in that you don't know where it
came from you have no information to
make the decision on so what you do is
you externalize it into a file load it
from your own domain and then we match
on self so you can still have the script
in the page just not inline and already
we've completely neutralized the XSS
which is a huge problem on the web it's
a massive it's still one of the most
common
attacks that we see but I couldn't
deploy that on my website and I'm pretty
sure that you couldn't deploy that on
your website either because we all load
content from like a bazillion different
places so you need to fine-tune your
policy for your website so we go
defaults or self by default and fairly
happy to load things from my own domain
and then I specify the script source we
want to get more specific now when you
specify a new directive like this it
overrides the default you don't inherit
from it so if you want to load scripts
on yourself you need to specify it and
then I've put these two CDN domains in
there and what this means now is that I
can have script tags like this on my
page the browser will come through a
look at the size attribute and say okay
yep Google CDN that's good class class
CDN that's good we can load both of
these scripts so you do that for the
script source and then you continue
fine-tuning to your policy we call them
source lists so you say okay these are
all the locations that we want to load
scripts from this is where we load
styles images we can control things like
iframes who are you allowed to put in
frames inside your site and you can
start to build this policy you can start
to get really specific with that but
this is as I said this is a subset of
the directive so this controls where
we're allowed to load different types of
content from but you could also control
certain actions that the browser is
allowed to take as well because there's
more directives and there's more
directives and the ones I'm going to
show you in total and I really like
things like the form action so when I
was talking about the example of someone
leaving your review and writing your
script hang in there what if they wrote
a form tag instead we've still got a
problem
because the bad guy is probably gonna
write a form tag that looks a little bit
like this and maybe they could trick a
user into thinking you know this is the
the login button for the page down here
at the bottom well style it will make it
look good and the user types and they
username and password where is it going
the browser will quite happily send it
to this other website again because he
doesn't know that it's not supposed to
the form tag is valid we have the action
we'll send the user name and password
there and hopefully none of you one your
usernames and passwords to be able to be
sent to evil comm but the browser
doesn't know that so you can specify the
form action and say look this is where
you're allowed to post forms to on my
side
and most websites it's just self because
you generally only have a login on the
same domain or you can just specify the
domains that you want it to be able to
post to frame ancestors is another good
one this controls who is allowed to
frame you and we see a lot of attacks
like this especially on financial sites
where rather than kind of ripping off
your homepage and trying to make a
convincing looking blogging form what an
attacker will do is they'll get their
site and they'll load you in an iframe
so it is your website you're in an
iframe and then they'll overlay a
transparent form on top so in the user
clicks on what they think is the bank's
login field
they're clicking on the transparent one
overlaid on top of it and it's a really
simple attack called clickjacking and
it's basically just lazy people that
don't want to build their unlocking
forms so they'll just frame you with
frame ancestors if you try and do this
with my website you will see that it
doesn't work because I use frame
ancestors in CSP to say look nobody's
allowed to frame me my website does not
go in an iframe and that's it problem
solved things like block comics content
this is a really good one it's falling
out of favor now and in and it's kind of
been replaced with upgrading secured
requests but if you have a website on
HTTP most people are either on HTTPS
already or are moving will soon be
moving and when you go to HTTPS you need
to have all of your things loaded over
HTTPS too so all of your images your
style sheets your scripts your
everything has to be HTTPS otherwise you
get little warnings in the address bar
that says something is wrong so if you
would support this on to your HTTP
website you lose your green padlock that
you did all that hard work for and it
generally it turns yellow or maybe red
depends on the exact browser but this
will break things this will give your
users errors because you've somehow like
this asset slipped through to production
it happens you know we have the common
niceties like content writers and blog
writers just copy and pasting from all
over the internet into their articles
upgrade insecure requests tells the
browser to look at that and rewrite that
tag for you so the browser will actually
take that image tag and rewrite it to
HTTPS because upgrading secure request
says look if there are any used if your
requests on this page
just upgrade them like I don't want them
to break things I don't want my users to
see errors automatically fix it for me
and just don't pester me with this thing
I'm gonna look at all of these in action
I'm going to give me some demos of this
kind of stuff in action but the one
thing that we need to consider is that
CSP is quite powerful because what
happens if you forget to whitelist the
place that you load your style sheets
run and the browser refuses to load
style sheets on your website what's your
website into what like it's crap so you
can break things with CSP most security
mechanisms most features in fact you
can't break things if you deploy them
wrong so it's really essential that we
know how to test CSP before we deploy it
and you can do you can test the SP with
zero risk on your website what you do is
you send exactly the same policy that
you've built but we change the name of
the header so we changes a content
security policy report only and when you
send the header with this name what it
says to the browser is look I'm thinking
about deploying this policy tell me what
would happen if you enforced it don't
enforce it just tell me what you would
have done and the browser will pop up
errors in the console for you and say
right okay if I got this policy on this
page I would have blocked this image I
would have blocked that script and this
analogy over here would not have been
loaded eater and you can say great okay
maybe we've missed them
or maybe you actually have things that
shouldn't be there but you get that
feedback but nothing happens on the page
it's not going to completely tank your
website but this means that you need to
go to the page and look in the console
which kind of sucks especially if you're
a big website with hundreds or maybe
even thousands of pages you could have
localized content you could have got all
kinds of crazy stuff so this doesn't
really scale and there's a solution for
that as well it's called CSP reporting
now again it's very similar kind of
mechanism what we do we have the header
in report only mode and again we send
the policy but this time you add this
new directive on the end called report
URI
and what this does is it saves to the
browser look instead of just writing
this error into the console I actually
just want you to send it to this
location I want you to send me a report
and it will post a JSON payload to that
endpoint for you and the JSON payload
all of the information in it that you
need to find the issue and rectify it so
it tells you the document URI I know
that on this page of my blog there is a
problem they violated the script sauce
so I know there's a script on there that
shouldn't be there it gives you the
original policy so you can see what the
browser was working with and then it
tells you the blocked URI so I can look
at this and say wow okay if I go to this
page on my blog there's a script tag on
there trying to load from evil com I
should probably go take a look at that
now in report only mode the browser will
not block it so this is just giving you
the feedback and you can put this into
your production site and the thing that
I like about this is that you're kind of
turning all of the visitors to your site
into kind of your QA team and your
security testing team because each time
a visitor comes to your page they will
say oh I came to your page and this
thing was wrong here's a bug report and
it's nicely formatted it has all of the
correct information and you'll never get
that from your QA team I can say that I
was a QA it's ok so I want to show a
couple of these different things
actually in action because it's great to
talk about them but it's even better
when we can see them so I've got a few
different demos set up and if you follow
me on Twitter what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to tweet the links out to
these at the same time so you can
actually go and have a look at these
afterwards I'll leave them up so I have
a page here on my blog and it's got a
few different examples set up on it so
let's dive into the console and see
what's going on with this page so when I
reload that and straight away you can
see that we've got two errors in the
console just over to the side there so
if I take a look at this script tag this
particular one here is that big enough
on the screen so I've got an actual
script tag in this page this is like a
genuine real script tag you can go
inspect the sauce and it's genuinely
trying to load a keylogger
from evil calm into my website but of
course I have CSP deployed and that has
not happened because if we come down
here and take a look it says refuse to
load the script evil.com forward slash
keyloggers is because it violates the
following content security policy
directive so because I have this header
in place the browser comes through and
it parses the page and says okay we've
got this script from evil comm but it's
were not going to load that we're not
going to put it into the page
now the next on I'm going to skip over
the form for a second because you can
already see the second error in the
console and the secondary in the console
comes from this particular image here
and what I wanted to show was upgrading
secure requests in action so again
somehow somewhere
I have accidentally put a HTTP set onto
my page could be an image it could be a
style script doesn't matter but somehow
this thing got there and this thing
shouldn't be there so if I take that
though if we go look at the network tab
for the requests that loaded this and if
I can find it if we take a look at the
request that was made to fetch that
image even though the script tag said
HTTP just like I said it actually made a
HTTP request now it tried to make that
secure request they upgraded it to HTTPS
but they still didn't work because of
the image being blocked by my CSP again
so it now says refused to load the image
HTTP because they've already insecure
but still evil.com is still not in my
wireless
I still want a little pictures from evil
comm even if we're loading them over
HTTPS so this works this actually
happens and the one that I really like
and the one that bizarrely I see use the
least of them is this one it's the forum
action so if we take a look just here
actually they just dive straight into
the forum so you can see that I've got
this this is actually like a real forum
again I'm actually gonna do this the
forum action on my website now any
normal website if you could inject this
forum as an attacker as a bad guy I can
do this there's many different avenues
it doesn't really matter how we got
there if I put my username and password
in there do you want this to actually
submit and hopefully the answer is no it
doesn't matter what your website is
hopefully the answer to this question is
no boy if we try I'll actually put a
table that's put a real one in
so if I hit submit now we all agree that
normally this should just fire and it
would send a post payload with my
username and password but if I press it
and I ignore one password because I'm
not going to save that we can jump over
to the console and you can see again now
we've got another area that's popped up
and he says refused to send form data so
evil comm /eto password because it
violates the following content security
policy directive and as I said most
people hopefully it's probably it's
gonna be form action itself because you
generally don't really post data to too
many places but if you do you can just
specify them now there's no real reason
especially on your login form that you
want Matt to be able to send anywhere
else I can't think of any legitimate
time when you would want to be able to
send your login form to anyone else but
you but I really don't see that many
sites using this is very it's a very
rare thing and the last thing that I
just want to quickly show if I do jump
over to the network tab what we can see
here I talked about the report your eye
and that value where you could send that
report so if we look here you can see
that this page made a request to my
report your eye value file transparency
I run this service that i'm also using
myself of course and it sends that post
payload out to the address that you
specify in your policy so if i sit down
to the bottom you can actually see this
is the actual JSON payload that the
browser dissent so if you as a general
user of my site it came to that page and
you tried to actually log in not only
with the CSP have saved you and not
allowed you to submit that form but your
browser would then tell me that it
happened it would say hey look someone's
just come to your web site on this page
they tried to send a form action to evil
calm and it's the host I could look at
I'm like whoa we've got a pretty serious
issue on our website we need to go fix
this so having a CSP is great it's
really powerful it will help you do a
lot of things but I also think that
reporting is is just as important
because if you have a problem on your
site and your CSP and the browser is
taking action to protect you or your
users you should know about that you
need to know about that
so that's CSP and action as I said these
are kind of lightning introduction talks
to all of these different kinds of
technologies so have a look
CSP there's a lot more that it can do
for you
but I want to keep going I want to keep
moving forwards and the next thing that
I want to talk about is xxp the second
acronym in my slide title now X X P or X
X SS protection as it is called is
another it's another HTTP response
header and we actually use it to
configure the XSS auditor in browsers
now every browser has one of these
auditors built into them if you're
running any good or modern browser it
will do and what these auditors do in
these browsers is they try and detect
some of the attacks that we just talked
about and they try to detect them
automatically and take action to protect
you and that's good most of the time
that's really good because we want the
browser to try and detect these things
and we want the browser's to try and
save our users in the instance that
they're under attack but they aren't
always perfect we have seen instances in
the past where the auditors have been
abused they've been tricked into doing
things when they shouldn't have done
things and this leads to some fairly
interesting results now they've asked me
not to talk about the different audit
ISM which browser has the best one and
which one has the worst one so I'm not
going to do that and we're just going to
talk about what X XP is and again as I
said it's another security header so
HTTP response header you decide you
define the header you send the header
along with your pages and again you put
the policy in the header itself now the
good thing with xxp compared to CSP is
super simple I can actually just show
you all possible values that you can
send because the list is that short this
one turns off the auditor you send this
header with your website and it's nice
to the browser look I am so happy with
my defenses I don't want you to take any
action now this is really only for very
brave websites the only big website that
I found that uses this is Facebook
Facebook are so confident in their own
defenses they don't want to risk the
browser's auditor being used in a way
that it shouldn't so they actually set
this header you can go to their site and
see you then they say look turn off the
browser defenses we're happy with our
own probably not for most people though
the interesting thing is that most sites
don't issue this header and if you don't
issue the header we actually default to
this next value which is
where the auditor is enabled so by
default on all sites unless you
configure it otherwise the auditor is
running and will actively try and
protect the users of your site after
that you can then specify the mode value
and this is really interesting because
in the default setting what the auditor
will do is it will just try and scoop
things out of the page that it thinks
are bad so it's like okay we've got this
page this script tag looks nasty we'll
just take that little bit out when you
set it to mode block what happens
instead is it just refuses to render the
page and it says right okay there's
something bad on this page I'm not even
going to render it at all and this is
the value that I recommend that most
sites should be using and you'll see why
in just a moment and the last thing that
you can do again you can ask it to tell
you you can say to the auditor in the
browser look if you take action because
you think there is something wrong on my
website great take the action save the
user but also tell me please tell me I
have something wrong on my site because
otherwise use the host we won't know so
again I think that the reporting is a
really valuable part of of most of these
mechanisms so let's look at it in action
again it's it's nice to give demos of
these different kinds of things and I've
got a couple set up here for that so
this page here has a script loaded
inside it you can see an example of the
script tag is just that and it's just a
very simple alert script so if I just
reload the page it pulls in a script
file that just throws up a j/s alert it
doesn't do anything particularly fancy
you can see let's have a look at the
script itself so here is the script tag
and if we just have a look at that just
really simple doesn't do anything okay
there's nothing hostile about this the
auditor will have looked at this and the
order - how long has allowed this to run
as you would expect there's nothing bad
happening here but as I said we can
trick the auditor in the browser so what
happens if I let's take a copy of this
element what I'm gonna do I'm just going
to make up a get parameter and then I
paste the script tag into this get
parameter
now when I send this request I'm going
to reload the page where the get
parameter this is just my blog it
doesn't do anything based on the
parameters it literally doesn't care but
if I rerun this now where's my alert box
I have no alert box anymore and if we
take a look it is actually an error down
in the console if i zoom in on that for
you he says the XSS auditor refused to
execute a script in this page because
its source code was found in the request
is the end of that sentence and what
this means is the auditor has seen me
send a get request to this server with
this script tag in it and when the page
came back the script tag was also in the
page and the audit is like whoa if you
send the script the script comes back
lying you're injecting
the auditor things that I have put that
script tag into the page but the script
tag was already there but the auditor
doesn't know that I've tricked it into
removing that script tag from the page
if we go look at the source of the page
now the exact same page look at the
source of that script now the auditor in
the browser has stripped that script tag
out now this script was harmless it
didn't do anything but what if that was
part of your redirect flowing or what if
it was some fraud detection script that
would profile users and look for what if
it was functional the kind of the point
here is that we don't want people to be
able to choose what scripts we can have
in our site you can put multiple get
parameters in and just disable multiple
scripts on the page and then send that
link to someone and when they click it
their browser will do the same thing and
that all happens because this page
doesn't define a policy we've left the
browser in its default mode so what we
need to do instead is this page I have
configured a policy and I've configured
it into block mode now again we can take
a look at the page it's exactly the same
script tag in there and what you'll see
if we do on this page is some slightly
different behavior so exactly the same
script tag I'll reload it and prove that
it's there so it throws the alert but
this time I'm going to copy this script
tag and go through exactly the same
process to make up again promotor paste
that in there
except this time the page doesn't load
because this is what happens when the
policy is in block mode
it says here chrome has detected unusual
code on this page and blocked it to
protect your personal information and
the error message is error blocked by
the XSS auditor now again the auditor
was detected in an attack and he said
look there's something wrong in this
page in the previous example it just
scooped out the bad script tag and
loaded the rest of the page with it
which gives the attacker the ability to
control what happens whereas with this
one it's like look if we say there is
something fishy going on on this page
should we even really load it like can
we be sure that we can fix that with no
context than your information and allow
the user to continue and I think this is
why block mod is much more important
because the auditor can't be abused and
in both these scenarios I will have
gotten a report sent back to me to say
hey I'm the xs/s auditor calling in just
to let you know that on this page this
thing happened and here's all the
information that you need so you can get
this real-time feedback if you monitor
those reports they're literally sent in
real-time so you can sit there and watch
that end point any black pop there we go
some things just happened so if you want
that level of capability is there for
you to have them for you to use so again
another really simple one I like xxp
because I don't think we should just
leave the default it doesn't matter what
policy setting you choose but choose it
and be explicit don't just leave things
to fate and see kind of what happens the
next one up for the next acronym in my
title next lightning talk if you will
STS is strict Transport Security your
detect a very common theme because
strict Transport Security is also a
security header but again it fixes a
different set of problems for us a lot
of websites right now
are either already on HTTPS or will be
very soon moving to HTTPS the whole web
is driving towards HTTPS and it's
actually happening a rate that we've
never seen before in history I scan the
top a million sites on the planet every
day and I track how many of them every
day are moving and this this graph not
only are we maintaining the fact that
we're moving science the HTTPS this
graph is actually getting steeper we're
increasing the rate
which we move to HTTPS which is great
this is fantastic we should encrypt all
of the things but browsers were built in
an age when HTTPS didn't even exist at
one point on the web HTTP was the only
thing that we had and some of the the
behaviors and the bad habits linger
so without HSTs as we call these HTTP
strict Transport Security without HSTs
you open your browser and you want to go
to Twitter the thanks for coming be the
vast majority of people will open their
address bar and type in twitter.com and
if you type in Twitter com the blue part
here the browser needs to connect to the
site and to do that the browser has to
have a scheme we have to use HTTP or
HTTPS to get there and the problem is
that right now even still today in every
single browser that you can go and use
right now if you provide it Twitter com
it will prefix it with HTTP and it will
default to doing the insecure thing this
is still true absolutely right now in
every browser and what that means is
that when you type that enhancer you
immediately start talking over an
insecure connection you send a HTTP
request
now if you are going to a good site like
Twitter they will of course respond back
with a 301 redirect and say look we
don't do this HTTP thing we want the
HTTPS we want to secure and the browser
says ok great that's fine I will honor
that redirect and I will remake the
requests over HTTPS it's not a big
problem and it's a bit of a big waste of
time because you go to do this like
whole big thing around the whole
transport layer and then go get the page
properly but we end up where we need to
be we end up on a secure connection but
not always the problem is that the
majority of our initial connection to a
site is actually secure because the
request we send in the response from
Twitter is done on HTTP and that means
it's not secure people can see it people
can meddle with it
people can change it and the really
important thing here is that the 301
that we get back from Twitter to say hey
you're on an insecure connection right
now let's go secure we send that over
HTTP we send that over in secure
connection which means somebody can
meddle with it somebody can tamper with
it
so is it a good idea to say okay this
isn't secure right now let's go secure
the bad guys we'll just chop that bit
out they don't want the browser to see
that bit and we're not on the secure
connection right now and this is really
easy it's the most trivial attack that
we can do and it's called SSL stripping
and essentially what happens is when you
send that HTTP request to Twitter the
bad guy says hi yeah I'm Twitter here's
the page that you asked for and what the
bad guy does is they just proxy the
request on the other side so they see
your browser ask for the homepage for
Twitter and they go to Twitter on HTTPS
grab the page and give it to you so your
browser's like great I sent an HTTP
request and I got the page that I wanted
load the page and it never sees the
upgrade thing because it doesn't happen
and this is so trivially simple but if
you deploy a website with HTTPS and you
aren't using HSTs then we haven't you're
not finished we're not done because
we've got to fix this problem because
it's so trivial to do and this is
exactly the problem that STS fixes so
STS again it's strict Transport Security
it's a security header really easy to
configure and deploy you just set this
header on your site and deliver the
policy along to the browser and again
STS really simple there's only three
directives total and you actually only
need to use max age that's the only one
required for a valid policy now this is
the number of seconds that the browser
should remember that you have enabled
this for so you say okay look I want to
turn on this feature and I want to turn
it on for a month and the browser will
remember that and apply this feature for
a month include subdomains does exactly
what it says on the tin if you turn this
on for example com and that's your
website do you want to apply this to the
subdomains beneath it and preload that's
extra reading you should have a look at
pre loading because you can actually
have your domain name written into the
source code of every mainstream browser
on the planet using pre loading and
that's really cool so you should check
that out but this is an STS policy
that's it that's all that you need max
age that's a month in seconds and the
idea is that if the user comes even once
a week every time they come they'll top
the cache they'll remember it for the
next month again and again
and the protection that it gives you
that is so crucial is that with HTTP
with HSTs sorry you open up your browser
you type in twitter.com and you hit
enter again now Twitter already uses
HSTs and has for a very long time and
what will happen is the browser won't
actually send this request because HSTs
tells it you can never speak to me on
HTTP you change the default setting in
the browser from HTTP to HTTPS instead
so now not only if we save that whole
trip around the network where we do the
whole redirect and server 3 or one thing
your page loads faster we're now just
going straight to HTTPS and because the
HTTP request is never actually sent we
can just ignore it and just pretend it
doesn't exist
our whole connection is secure all of
the time so it makes your page load
faster and it also makes it secure no
matter what happens and there's a couple
of interesting things that STS allows
you to do as well and this ones are sure
to pull up those quickly so I may jump
over to a site that I know doesn't use
this not mine mine does I just want to
open the network tab so let's have a
look at this preserve the blog and
despite yelling at them all the time the
BBC still don't use straight transport
security so I typed that in there and as
we said you make a HTTP request it sends
it out over the network I'll just make
that a bit bigger Don if the guys at the
back can see and we send that HTTP
request out and then we get the 301 back
to say look you need to come back over
HTTP
now the BBC has like a horrible redirect
chain and I don't understand why but
ultimately after being redirected you
get to HTTPS at the end part of that but
all of those redirects were HTTP if the
bad guy doesn't want you to see them the
bad guy just throws them away because
they're not secure you can't stop them
so that's somewhat problematic and if
you go to a web site and again I can
explicitly try to go to HTTP on my web
site
now as the user I've told the browser I
want to go to HTTP on this website and
as the user you are generally the
without the keyboard you're essentially
got as far as the browser is concerned
you are like the most important thing
and if you type it on the keyboard it
happens what do you think will happen at
my site will this go HTTP and redirect
so if we take a look you can see this is
the initial request that I made as the
user it tried to go to HTTP but the
status code here is not 301 or maybe 302
as you would expect
it's 307 instead and it says that an
internal redirect took place and the
reason for that was HSTs now it then
immediately followed that up with a
secure request instead so the browser
didn't send that first request I didn't
go out we didn't hit the network he went
to make and it was like oh actually I'm
not allowed to do this because HSTs is
set on this site I've got to go to HTTPS
straightaway and a good thing with that
307 read/write you can time these it
takes less than a millisecond so that
means that that whole redirect loop that
would have happened on my site also
didn't happen so this page loads quicker
as well I like that we can get to things
from a security mechanism better
performance and the fact that we've
mitigated this whole category of
different attacks so STS is really
simple and the one thing that I would
say with it is start with your max age
really low it's one of the most common
problems I see people say oh let's turn
this on and test it and we'll set a year
in the cache you can't turn something on
and test it for you because if you turn
this on and it breaks your website then
you're locked in for a year that's the
cache value that's how long the browser
will remember it as I said I track those
top I'm really in sight so when Facebook
first introduced STS quite a while ago
now they started with the max age at 10
seconds and that's a really good idea
because you're like there's no test
mechanism for STS apart from a small max
age so you're like right I want to turn
it on I want to see what happens so
we'll go for 10 seconds so you deploy it
onto your site 10 seconds max age and
it's like oh my god like all of these
things break or our JavaScript subdomain
can't be secure whatever happens
something breaks the best part is you
just turn it off wait 10 seconds and
just deny any knowledge about what
happened because it's all gone
so that one was STS it's STS if you're
already on HTTPS this is essential you
cannot consider your deployment done
unless you are using STS it's just too
critical an issue and again it will make
you have pages load faster so why not we
have nothing to lose here next one this
is an interesting one I can hear people
chuckling in the front row because pkp
is the next acronym from my slide title
and public key pinning is a really
interesting mechanism because this is
basically the most powerful security
mechanism that you could ever deploy
right now for your website and was it
spider-man that said like with great
power comes great responsibility that
has never been more true than with
public key pinning because public key
pinning is the most powerful security
mechanism or if you use it wrong it is
the most powerful fought gun that you
all have ever seen
so I'm giving you this warning on the
way in because it's really important
that we understand this public key
pinning is designed to fix a very
specific problem that we have online
called rogue certificates if you want
HTTPS on your website you have to go to
a certificate authority and get
certificate that's how this works and
the idea is you go to this CA and say hi
I'm Scott how about you k you prove you
over the domain and they say okay here's
your certificate but who here has
perfect security no one great so neither
to CAS no organization has perfect
security sometimes they get tricked
sometimes they have breaches or we end
up with what's called a rogue
certificate and it's where somebody gets
a certificate that shouldn't have one so
if I get a certificate for PayPal com I
can tell your browser
I am PayPal calm and it will give you
green padlocks and secure things and you
will think I am PayPal calm and that's a
really big problem so all we have on the
screen here is one certificate that I
got as the owner of this website and one
certificate that the attacker got by
tricking a CA they might have hacked
them compromised them breach their
systems they may have just tricked them
socially engineered them doesn't matter
which one of these is the bad
certificate which one of them which one
of these should you trust and which one
of these should you not trust and this
is the problem this is exactly the
problem that pkp was designed to fix and
just you know that was the bad one you
were wrong
so pkp is another response header you'll
you'll be seeing like a really similar
theme through all of these it's another
HTTP response heading you set the public
keepings header and again inside that
header you set the policy that you want
the browser to enforce really simple
again
we've only got three directives max age
and include subdomains you should be
familiar with now the number of seconds
that you keep that for and whether or
not you want this policy to apply to
subdomains on your site and this pin
sha-256 directive is the new one this is
the the secret sauce of pkp because to
deploy a valid policy you need at least
two of these pin values and these pin
values are a hash of the encryption key
on your server so when you set up HTTPS
you want to do encryption of course
you've got to have an encryption key and
what you do is you take a hash of that
key it's actually a part of the key you
take a hash of that and put it into the
policy and you're saying to the browser
right look I've got my website set up I
have this encryption key and here is a
hash of it so when you come back and I'm
using this key again you can hash the
key and see if it matches and if it
matches you know that it's me and the
reason you need a second one is because
you've got to have backups in every kind
of part of IT and tech you've got to
have backups so the idea is you go
somewhere else and you generate a backup
key and take the hash of that so you're
saying to the browser look if you come
back to my website the key that I use
should match one of these two hashes and
if it doesn't it's not my key so it
doesn't matter who gives it to you
and who they say they are you know that
it's not me because I'm giving these two
values to you ahead of time as I said
the hash value itself if you are
technical and interested in this this is
a hash of something called the subjects
public key information or the spki
essentially if we don't care then you
don't really need two new hash part of
your encryption key and the browser can
check that every time it comes back to
make sure it matches and to make sure
that it's still you at the other side
because you've established some kind of
a greed secret and say look these are
the two things that I will have and if
you're really technical and you really
do care about this you don't even need
to hash your own keys if you trust your
CI you know if you can pin at different
levels and the only reason I bring this
up is that if you do go away and
consider this you need to understand the
different
ramifications of trusting your CA to do
this again it's a very complex and very
powerful mechanism and probably may be
only suitable if you're like a bank
website and government website maybe
financing you do a lot of transactions
large in commerce this certainly isn't
for you know Joe's pizza shop or you
know some kind of small-scale site and
again very similar theme you can deploy
this in report only mode if you look at
this header here you'll see at the end
it's public key pins report only so you
can deploy this to the browser and say
look if I gave this to you what would
happen and also send me a report again
to this address you'll get that nice
JSON payload back when you can recruit
all of your visitors to be part of your
QA team and file useful box like we're
winning so much at this point it's
really a valuable feature to have
so I'm not going to give a demo of pkp
and the reason I'm not going to give a
demo of PK Peas it would be a little bit
like me trying to give you a brief
introduction on handling weapons-grade
plutonium and if you accidentally touch
these two things together you're just
going to vaporize us all this is this is
too dangerous for me to demo and you
should really consider whether or not
you need this on your site are you a
high enough value target and the reason
I say that is let's say that you're the
bad guy right now and you've hacked a CA
and you can get a certificate for any
web site on the planet what domain would
you get a certificate for if you could
you're gonna go for my paypal com
maybe the Australian government me US
government maybe Amazon if you ask
yourself that question and you are not
the answer then you don't need pkp that
is the test that is the litmus test
whether or not you need it if you could
get a certificate for any site on the
planet any domain what domain would it
be and if you put your domain in the
answer then you need this if not you
probably don't the other reason for pkp
falling out of favor apart from being
really dangerous is that it's largely
being replaced by two of the mechanisms
you can achieve the same level of
protection but with much less hassle and
much less risk which is the more
important part and that is the next
acronym in my title
it's one of the two mechanisms that I
see over the coming months and years
replacing public key pinning as the
method of choice and its certificate
authority authorization and again it
fixes a very simple problem but this is
very serious problem when you want HTTPS
on your website you've got to go get a
certificate this is just how it works
you've got to go to a CA and apply for
them and when you do that and you get
one you get the pretty green things in
the browser you get the padlocks and
HTTPS now I use less encrypts as my CA
if you already on HTTPS and you're
paying for your certificates you don't
have to pay for them anymore let's
encrypt give them away free and I only
one less encrypt to issue the
certificates on my website but I have no
way of saying that like how do I say I
only want this CA to do that if you go
to a CA and say hi I'm Scott how could
it UK and you try and trick them you can
go to any CA that you want as the bad
guy you can choose now are you going to
go to like a really good strong CA
that's got good processes in there
secure are you gonna go to like a really
small CA that doesn't have very mature
processes or good security U is the
attacker get to choose how you want to
attack and this is a problem and this is
a problem because I use less encrypt and
that's not just less encrypt as a CA
there's hundreds of other CAS all around
the world some of them are multi-million
dollar companies with whole security
divisions never mind just teams and some
of them are just kind of like you know a
few guys in a shed that set up as an
attacker which one of those are you
gonna go after if you want to try and
bridge them you're gonna go after the
weakest link in the chain because that's
what the bad guys do we're lazy and this
is problematic because you can approach
this CEO you say right I want to try get
a certificate for Scott's website and
let's see if we can trick this year oh
no we couldn't trick them right we'll
try and trick these guys next No and
you're just gonna keep going until
either you run out of CAS or you find
one that you can get through their their
process so as a host as the owner of my
domain I want to be able to say that I
don't authorize anyone else to issue
certificates for me apart from the CAS
that I want and this is what CAA does by
introducing a new DNS record you can now
actually take control
who is allowed to issue certificates for
your domain so we're all familiar with
the kind of standard DNS records that we
come across we've got a records quad-a
tax records CIA is just a new type of
record that you can set and this is why
CIA is essentially free like you know
hopefully setting a DNS record isn't
going to cost you anything and what we
do is we set the issue directive this is
the first value you can set in CIA and
it says this is the CIA that I
authorized to issue certificates for my
website so now you is the bad guy you go
to the China post office is a CA you go
to the China post office and you say I
want a certificate for Scott helm Cody
at UK see if I can trick you see if I
can force you to give me one and they
look at this and say no sorry we're not
authorized to do that
problem-solve if you as the attacker
want a certificate now the only CA that
you can go and try and get one from he's
let's encrypt because they're the only
ones that are authorized to issue a
certificate for my sign so the attack
surface went from 200 plus days in the
planet to one and now use the attacker
of force to do that and the issue
directive let's some issue standard
certs so that contain actual domains if
you want wild card certificates they're
a little bit more kind of powerful
there's an issue wild directive so again
you can allow or deny a CA the authority
to do that and again reporting is a
really common thing that we see this io
def record here what this says is if you
as a CA refuse to issue a certificate
tell me that someone tried to get one
right yeah it's great that you've
refused it and not issued it but I'd
quite like to know if someone is out
there trying to get a certificate for my
website and that is what this math
because this method is for you say look
just send me an email here send me a
report and say hey look someone's just
trying to get a certificate for your
domain you should probably know about
this so we'll take a look at it I can't
actually show it in action as such but
with CAA being such a new mechanism
unfortunately it's not quite as widely
adopted as I would like yet this came
into action it was the 7th of September
last year
so all CAS are now required by their
governing body to check these records so
this isn't optional anymore this is now
a requirement so Google have this cool
DNS tool that we can use
to look at records and we can now
specifically look up CA records so this
might now is my actual CIA policy these
are the these are the the CAS that I
whitelist if like me you have more than
one CA just create multiple records and
say not only do I authorized this
particular CA but I also issue these I
also authorize these other people to
issue as well the issue while directives
are also in there so those CAS can issue
wildcard certificates for my domain and
that's it like we really can't get much
more simple than creating a DNS record
and I love these mechanisms where it's
essentially zero effort on the way in
and the savings and the benefits on the
other side are massive but it's not
widely deployed yet so let's have a look
I think Google have won Google have
their own CA so they just authorized
themselves and no other CA is allowed to
issue certificates for google.com and
who else have we got I can't think of
anyone that actually uses this eBay are
you baiting so there we go
eBay have locked themselves to some on
tech and they also have the i/o desk set
to get emails so if you go out there and
you're a bad guy and you try and get a
certificate for eBay com not only are
you not going to get it but they're also
going to tell you Bay that you try to
get it as well and that's a really
powerful mechanism again for sites like
eBay who it would be a really serious
issue for if you got a certificate for
eBay com
this is this is a really good mechanism
there's the reason the CAA is well is
much better than the previous one pkp is
that if this does cause harm if this
does break there's no kind of max-age
like there is in pkp if these records
are wrong or you've misconfigured it or
you need to change it you just changed
dns and as fast as you can change dns
you can fix the problem so there's no
kind of memory effect there's no lasting
harm or damage after you break it by
accident
so you need to generate your policy now
they look kind of gnarly sometimes and
they can be problematic but there is a
tool to do this and I would recommend
this on this is the tool that I use on
SSL may see a record generator seal it
should just go through and say look this
is me well there we go yeah and you come
down here and there's just a list of all
the different CAS and it's like right
okay who do we want um I want less
encrypt to issue non wildcard and wild
card
and we'll just have these people whoever
they are and then you scroll down to the
bottom would you like to get emails oh
yes I would because that's a good idea
and if you scroll down here that's your
policy they're that they're the records
that you need to go set in DNS so you
open up your I'm on cloud flight it's
really easy you just open it up create a
new record select CAA paste that value
in done hopefully that would take you no
more than maybe five or ten minutes and
it's not going to cost you anything DNS
records they should be free but you're
gonna get a huge level of protection
from that so I love these easy wins any
mechanism where you know I don't have to
do too much it's great so so anything I
was going back there's quite a few there
I appreciate that was like a really kind
of quick introduction and that was kind
of the point what I want to do is
introduce you to these different
mechanisms so that you can look at them
and maybe you've seen one in there that
you think oh well those other ones might
not be for us but you know that's ESP
things sounded really good so quick
overview of each one if you're on HTTPS
on your website you really want CSP with
upgrading secure enable reporting get
that real-time feedback that is a
massively valuable feature that you can
get when your visitors will tell you
about problems with your site in real
time what's not to like xxp please
specify this no matter what value what
policy that you go for you should be
explicit I don't think that we should
kind of rely on defaults because if we
rely on defaults and we're not aware of
it they can change they may change
between different browsers you know
Chrome and Firefox may diverge on their
agreement they may change what happens
so I think that we should be explicit
and make a conscious choice rather than
depending on defaults when we convey to
configuring the auditor STS another
essential one it forces HTTPS to your
website we get rid of any HTTP comes so
that default HTTP in the browser there's
been there since the dawn of the web you
can change that to HTTPS Reap all of the
security benefits save your servers from
issuing 301's all day long make your
pages load faster there's really a lot
to be had from a very simple mechanism
there pkp this is the dark one this is
kind of falling out of glory now because
a lot of people have
configured this one a lot of people have
broken their websites I've helped two
different companies try and recover from
Miss configuring this so if you do
answer that question with your own
domain if I could get a certificate for
any site on the planet if your site is
on that list then do consider this but
again be warned that is a very dangerous
mechanism if you get it wrong you turn
off your website and there's no going
back but then it's being replaced by CAA
we can get a lot of the features of pkp
from CAA
and it's just a simple DNS record as we
just saw if you are interested in the
second mechanism that I talked about for
replacing pkp something called
certificate transparency I'll tweet out
some links to that afterwards and you
can read up on that if you want but the
CT deadline for compliance is coming
this April and most website operators I
speaks you don't actually know that it's
coming in April so it's probably worth
checking that out actually and having a
look to see if your website is ready for
the CT compliance kind of impending doom
deadline that's coming but other than
that you know security all of these are
security mechanisms but often I find
myself not selling them all of the time
on their security value reporting is
great learning about errors on your site
fix things automatically that slipped
through to production there shouldn't be
there there's lots of benefits outside
of just security as well so take all
this away secure all the things make
your websites better and thank you very
much
now I did leave and I have got six
minutes for questions okay yes okay so
the question there was if you configure
the auditor to block and the user gets
that error message they might think it's
a result of a security compromised on
your site I guess the problem here is
and it sounds like a bit of cop-out
answer but it's not it depends on your
organization's tolerance to what happens
there because if you filter the risk is
that your website looks okay and your
user gets compromised whereas if you
block the result is that your user is
safe but it looks like something's
happened to your site now I can't answer
that question for you that's a decision
but this kind of comes back to the point
of making the conscious decision and
setting the value like right now you're
all just going with the default probably
most people are just going with the
default and don't actually know whereas
even if you stick with the default it's
still better that you've explicitly and
knowingly configured that to happen and
can explain that when it does happen
rather than just right now most people
don't second question yes that's a
really good question the question there
basically was if someone compromises
your site and they could set one of
these headers themselves like as the bad
guy yeah so piqué piqué peers are
especially bad one for this if you get a
bad guy in your environment and they can
do stuff on your website setting
response headers will be one of the
things that they could do and we
actually call this hostile pinning there
is a term for this and what happens with
hostile pinning is and we saw a really
great example of this just last the year
before at DEFCON in Vegas they called it
ransom pkp so bad guys get onto your
server and they set the pkp header and
they lock it to a set of keys and then
they deface your website you know you've
seen the defacements before
they write you know hacked by some kid
wall whatever and they send out a tweet
saying look we've just two-faced like
eBay's homepage
why is the first thing that everybody
does when they see that in the headlines
in the news they click it they all go
straight to the eBay homepage she's like
oh my god there's like funny cat
pictures on eBay's homepage let's go
take a look when you go to the page you
get the policy but the users don't know
that it happens in the background
eBay security team come along they fix
everything they put their website back
to normal and they're like ok everyone
we're good
come back to our website now but the
browser remembers the pkp policy from
earlier and then when it comes back to
the website the browser now can't load
the page and that's a variant of hostile
pinning called ransom pkp because then
the bad guys ring eBay and say yeah
those two pin values we set those two
keys if you want those keys there are a
million dollars a piece or you can leave
your website off your choice so this is
one of the reasons the kind of this is
this is one of the big reasons that pkp
is on its way oh I think in that it can
actually be turned around and used
against the hosts in a very bad way and
it can be used against you even if you
don't configure it because if I get onto
your website I can just turn it on and
you can't stop me because I'm in control
and it's not so much a problem because
if the bad guys get it of course they
can do whatever they want it's the fact
that after I'm gone it will stay there
in the browser and that's the really
dangerous bit yes I like fall forever if
you've got any modern browser that's
been updated and like sorry no I think
you have to be edge ie11 if you're like
super up-to-date with everything but if
you're using how you love and then I
don't know if maybe you've got other
things I'm sorry I do all the time I'm
just I'm just funning yeah
so the important thing to clarify there
is that you should still keep your three
oh ones in place so you should always do
that and always keep them because HSTs
is what we call a tofu mechanism it's
trust on first use which means that
until that browser has been to your
website at least once they won't know
it's there anyway so they're going to go
HTTP that first time get the redirect
then CH STS and from that point forward
they'll have it so you still need the
the 301 because the first time every
time
you'll be HTTP anyway that's what pre
loading fixes go check out pre loading
you get your domain name literally
written into the source code of the
browser so even if it's never been to
your website my domain name and I know
this my domain name is written into the
source code of every browser on all of
your devices if you've updated in like
the last two years so my domain is
literally written into all of your
devices if you've never been that's pre
loading and that's cool everyone should
check that out yep - why so if he
doesn't support STS yeah so this is a
really good thing with all of these
mechanisms is that you set these headers
and the browser looks at the header and
it's not compliant or it's too old it
doesn't understand them just ignores
them and carries on as normal so the
absolute worst case scenario for any of
these is nothing and that's what I
really like because that's why it can be
fairly broad when I say everyone should
deploy this because it doesn't really
matter the worst case scenario is that
nothing changes there's another question
yes I saw this that was really good
correct yes
yes yeah so there's a couple of things
if you haven't read that article I'll
tweet our link after the talk five
minutes because it is a really good
article the interesting thing that I
found about that is his problem was that
he was exfiltrating data and CSP is not
meant to stop data exfiltration it's
meant to stop content injection so there
is kind of a cross purpose there in that
he's he was kind of relying on CSP to do
something that he did but that it wasn't
meant to do correct yes and actually
what we have done now I pushed in the
standards body and we are actually gonna
get a prefetch sauce in CSP version 3
which will be out soon so you ought to
be able to specify things like prefetch
pre-render etc as well so there will be
another new directive coming and that
will completely neutralize the attack
that was in the article questions
there's another can't see I did I don't
anymore know the answer was I'm a
security guy when I don't do things
people ask me questions on Twitter so ya
know even I've turned off pkp on my site
now in favor of CA a.m. CT any more
questions oh yeah sorry yes I see great
value in pkp before me yeah so most
sites that do deploy pkp never actually
enforced it they deploy it in report
only mode and use it purely as a
monitoring mechanism just to see what's
going on out there because they might be
curious it's like they never actually
intend to enforce it but you can deploy
pkp report only mode and have it sent
you those reports and it just gives you
more data to work with and there's no
risk because it can never go wrong and
there's one more yes
so just from that question by I'm again
sorry make sure I understood it okay
yeah I mean I do use cookies and I in
all of my services that I run and the
sites that I work with we still use
cookies we have the secure flag to make
sure they're always translated securely
and the HTTP only flag to make sure they
can't be read by script but if you start
coupling that things with like CSP to
make sure that hostile script can't get
in that's another line of defense and if
you're interested in cookies and auth
tokens like that check out something
called same site cookies and I wrote an
article called tough cookies if you
google it it lists all of the extra
stuff that you can do with cookies and
there's actually quite a lot that we can
do to protect them so have a look
further my tough cookies article I'll
have to wrap it there I'm over time I'm
hanging around all night if there's any
more questions please come and find me
other than that thank you very much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
