all right so that's my name sorry I
better stick with the microphone
blog about some different technical
stuff and that's my twitter handle if
you want to grab me for any question or
any comments so I would like to explain
first by a short story so here we have
Bob who is a cowboy coder he doesn't do
any best practices he doesn't have a
build process he ships directly into
production environment I hope none of
you guys does I'm sure you do so we have
Alice Alice when when they comes and
joins a team she's a great developer she
loves CI server so she advocates for
team city and you see Bob loses his hair
because she just didn't stop so she
introduces team city it simplifies the
build workflow they start running the
test it simplifies the deployment create
a consistent bill John he was a graduate
developer a junior developer he's
fearless so he goes and experiment with
things he makes certain changes into the
build workflow and something breaks
everybody freaks out
obviously the build is broken that's not
a great thing so we need to fix that
John doesn't know what he changed
because the bill to fix and Alice
doesn't know what happened so she's
gonna spend half a day one day two days
to investigate so the point that I'm
trying to make here and you would
appreciate that I'm exaggerating a
little bit but this happens and it
happens a lot the point that I'm trying
to make here is that putting all your
eggs in one basket is probably not a
good idea it's never a good idea putting
the build pipeline and the whole
configuration into the build server is
not a great idea and the reason why it's
not because of these four reasons that I
have here the buildconfig when you are
putting the whole configuration into the
CI server does not have the same rigor
the same quality control as you would
have in your code so that's why using
build script that's part of your code is
always a better idea
portability if you decide tomorrow to
switch from team city to Jenkins or from
Jenkins to bamboo
you would want to have all your build
just take it and move it into somewhere
else rather than going and reconfiguring
the same thing extensibility say if you
want to have the ability to build new
solutions for new platforms or for new
targets you would want to have a pool of
plugins and things that you could grab
and use and ease of use how easy it is
for your developers to do onboard a new
tool and that's where fake and f-sharp
comes into the picture so fake is a
domain-specific language for building
build script for creating build scripts
and you use fake it's just an excusable
file that comes with the tools and you
create your build script as one script
file so there is fake and there is cake
you could build in a sharp or in c-sharp
so I assume people here would probably
using fake and f-sharp probably people
on the other side they would use c-sharp
I prefer to use a sharp just to give me
more reasons to learn F sharp but it's
up to you you could use fake or cake so
using fake you could create your build
script as I'll show you in a second
to create to build using msbuild x build
and other tools to run your tests using
any unit and X units and and other other
test frameworks creating nougat packages
and pushing in your packages
transforming configurations and a lot of
other things the other good thing about
using fake is it's just a nougat package
so you just install it as an Egret
package and that's it you are all set up
so you don't need to install all these
agents and tentacles and all these
jargons so let's look at a small 101
build skill for a for an f-sharp so here
this is nothing but an F sharp code so
how many people in the room have done
coding an F sharp
all right great okay so I'm going to
need to explain it's very simple
basically what's it saying there are
four four targets you can see
point three so here we're just saying
this is our solution file this is the
built directory and this is the version
that we are passing so you pass this
normally from your CI server because you
have a an auto incremented build number
and here we're saying this is our target
a target is nothing but you could think
of it as a build step so when I say
clean for my target it does the clean
when I say transform configuration it's
going to update the app setting and it's
going to change the environment name to
you whatever I'm going to pass in here
so I could pass it as a parameter when I
say build is just going to do the MS
build and this is the directory that oh
the the build configuration that's going
to do using debug and this is the
solution file when I say run test it's
going to do the same thing so the beauty
of it is that you can see your build
step can be just cut down into one line
because there is a lot of community
there was a lot of hard work that's gone
into it and it's simplified the whole
process for you the other good part of
it is that you could define this
hierarchy of build steps so you could
say when I say run when I say build it
would do the transform configuration for
me when I say run test it would do the
clean and then it would do the build and
then it would do the run test so you
could you could do that very easily so I
wanted to prepare a demo but because of
the short time frame I couldn't I
couldn't do the whole demo so I created
the demo I put it on github and I took a
screenshot of it here so you should
trust me that it works but if you don't
trust me girl I'm gonna download the
code and then use it so basically all
you need to do you just say fake
executable and then you give it the
build script file name that you have
created and you give it the build step
that you want to run whether it's clean
build run test configuration file
changes and you pass any parameters so
you could override any of the the
parameters this is this is very good for
changing the environment name or the
version number for example fake is very
extensible so it's great when especially
in today's technology landscape where
there are so
many framework so many platforms so many
tools so you would want to have
something that would help you and take
you further so you wouldn't want to be
locked in into a particular ecosystem
whether that's I don't know a sharp or
dotnet or JavaScript you would want to
have all your options open and fake is
great for that so everything that you
could think of there is there is there
is a tool that somebody has already
written there and the beauty of it if if
it doesn't have that you are already in
code you are in C sharp and F sharp so
you could you could write whatever you
want so a couple of months ago I was
writing this build script for
transforming some XML and I had some
difficulty because I have some complex
namespaces in the XML I couldn't find
the right step that would do what I
wanted to do in the plugin so I just
wrote it in F sharp just create a method
and that just works so somebody would
think okay what what's great about it I
mean okay you have you have a way of
creating your bills code but you could
already do that with gulp or PowerShell
for example now the the reason why it's
different because your developers are
not going to need to go and learn pour
shell and you're not going to need to be
great in in JavaScript to use gold most
of the people here on I assume are
writing code in in.net in F sharp or C
sharp so you already there you're
already doing your coding so that's a
great advantage you don't need to
install anything it's just an you gets a
new code package that's going to be
installed as part of your build process
and there is plenty of help there is
plenty of plugins and there is a great
community behind it so as I explained
there is fake and cake and there is a
great comparison between them on this
website that shows you in terms of
community in terms of engagement in
terms of plugins in terms of stars on on
github so if you are interested have a
look and pick what what's what suits you
best
but in terms of feature parity I think
they have very close feature parity
they're the two of them so I hope I have
convinced you of giving you a taste of
what it is to use fake and hopefully you
would go on look
they can k can start using them I don't
know if there is any time for any
questions any questions yeah great
