Meszaros and today i'm going to
about engineering for engineering sake
in the case we want to find me on the
web after the presentation here's where
you can find me
that's my github Twitter and sometimes I
blog on coding field Leslie calm here's
a photo of me dad in the background is
me if you can see it and this is the
office of the company that I work for
this is bended I have started at minted
more than four years ago as a software
developer and today elite engineering
vintage is on a mission to make second
hand the first choice worldwide to make
that a reality
we're building an e-commerce platform
for pre-loved fashion we were based in
Vilnius that's where I come from and we
have more than 12 million users
worldwide and back and we're back with
60 million euros by Excel insight and
Hobart boorda media in the four years
that I've been with wintered starting as
one of the first engineers I've learned
quite a lot and one of those things that
I've learned I want to share today with
you by talking about engineering for
engineering sake I'll do that in three
parts the first part will be about why I
love engineering why I think that
engineering is fun and the second part
I'll tell you a story about something
that happened at minted and in the third
part I'll try to draw some conclusions
from from aforementioned story so let's
start first thing so oh sorry
first thing who of you have ever written
code in your life that's all of you
right and who you are software
developers I think all of you too so
that's great I think that you probably
understand the sentiment that software
engineering is fun
I hope that you do for me
software engineering is a lot of fun
it's something that I enjoy quite a lot
and my journey toward software
engineering started at a pretty early
age the first computers that I
encountered were not pcs or made by
Apple
they were gaming systems gaming systems
that you probably don't recognize that's
in silicon any of you heard this name
before oh there is someone who heard of
a silicon before amazing so if you had
second Genesis this looks kind of
familiar doesn't it it's a hardware
clone made in China
that was quite popular in a couple of
countries including Lithuania it looks
completely like Sega Genesis except the
cartridge is completely different
so normally to a Nia had NES or Sega
Genesis we had stuff like that Zillah
tones and our family didn't have a
gaming system and I have encountered
these when visiting friends and and game
bounties the first real computer one
that has a keyboard and a mouse I've
encountered in my father's office my
father used to take me there and I would
plop there in front of a computer and
spend time gaming I remember only one
name of a game and that's magic carpet
exploring the file system itself was
also kinda a game for someone who knew
almost no English words finding the game
that I want to play was a challenge onto
itself
I would spend as much time as possible
playing around on that computer when one
visit would be over I would immediately
await the next one eventually we got a
computer at home
it was meant for learning and doing work
but somehow and edit it ended up in mine
and my brother's room and if you know
kids a computer that's safely put in the
and the children's room will not be used
for learning much we spend a lot of it a
lot of time on it just gaming one time
my father locked that computer with a
password and I hacked it and by hacked
it I mean that I spent a couple of hours
brute-forcing until I guess the password
now if I were smart I would have not
told it to anyone except my brother but
I had to immediately brag about it
afterwards so when it came time for me
to decide what am I gonna study what how
will my career look like you would think
that it was a nice choice that I picked
software engineering just like that but
it wasn't I was having too much too much
fun on the computer then the whole
internet thing happened I've discovered
software development and I've started
learning Pascal and that was a lot of
fun but I but because it was a lot of
fun I did not consider it as something
that I can make a career out of luckily
luckily I had a friend I had a friend
who was dead set on software engineering
and his example helped me when I
discovered that he's really serious
the software engineering business I had
to go oh wait wait wait a second this is
something that I can really do people
will pay me money to sit in front of a
computer all day like this is this is
real after that it it was an easy choice
so I ended up studying software engineer
at Vilnius University and eventually
became a software engineer there's
another photo of me that's me hard at
work trying to figure out that problem
secret is is that software engineering
that at work is not always fun if you
even Advent it sometimes we have to work
on projects that are not exciting or
interesting projects that require us to
solve problems that we solved many times
before and it's not interesting to solve
the same problem over and over again
projects that we maybe don't believe in
but everyone else does so we have to
work on that project but you know we're
we're software I think this is always
fun is at home because at home I get to
choose everything I make all the choices
I the project I choose the deadline and
I choose the technologies I'm the boss
please don't say to my girlfriend that
I've said the sentence so and I can I
can choose to not do software
engineering I can choose to play some
retro games like Castlevania bloodlines
by the way that was a really fun evening
and I can choose Final Fantasy 9 have
any of you played Final Fantasy 9 yes
I'm among my people
so Final Fantasy 9 is amazing it is I've
spent hundreds of hours playing Final
Fantasy 9 in my life so far
and I will probably spend hundreds of
hours more there's even a version of
Final Fantasy 9 for is so I could be
playing it on my phone it was released a
couple of years ago but I have not
installed it yet because I'm just too
afraid of what it will do to my
productivity so whenever I choose a
project whenever I choose a project to
do at home to spend my time on that
project has to be more fun than Final
Fantasy 9 because that's the benchmark
that's like so a lot of a lot of what
makes software development fun is the
technologies that we use technology that
we choose for further projects so let's
let's say I start a new project will
they pick PHP and positive SQL and both
of these are fine PHP is fine PostgreSQL
is fine but also boring so I will not
pick this let's look at something else
what about Ruby rails my sequin backbone
backbone what about this technology
stack this is the technology stack that
I've used for years advented this is a
technology stack them that I'm very
familiar with that I know inside out
which makes it all so boring so it I
will also not pick this technology stack
what about elixir Phoenix or think they
being react elixir Phoenix even the
names sound more exciting
I mean Phoenix let's all use Phoenix
more I want to say this four words more
often
these are shiny and new and interesting
and something that I have not spent
hundreds as far or hundreds of hours
playing around so this is the technology
stack that out that I did I would pick
for a new project because I can be am I
can be a magpie I like shiny new I love
to play around with technologies tinker
with them figure them out see what they
are capable capable off I love to do
excuse me hearing for engineering safe
because that's what that's what it is I
I don't pick elixir Phoenix because
they're the best tools for the job
I picked them because they're shiny and
new and I would like to play around with
them I think that's fine and I bring the
same mindset to work at least I used to
so at my first job I worked at a very
small company less than a dozen people
and we used asp.net webforms
for our web applications at home and the
evenings I was playing around with
asp.net MVC everyone or at least people
that I follow was talking about asp.net
MVC asp.net was new and shiny
and bound to take over the world people
were talking about how it's a better way
to do things some of the people are here
at this conference doing for other
presentations and I tried to try it out
asp.net and we see myself and I was
convinced it is it is the better way so
when when it came time for a new project
I've tried to convince everyone that we
should use asp.net MVC this time instead
of asp.net webforms
and I have spent hours and hours
discussing it and I eventually I did
convince everyone we ended up using
asp.net MVC and for that project and for
all the other projects that came
afterwards at the second company that I
worked for now a bigger company at the
time that I was there it was with close
to 200 people we were using SVN for
source control I was not using SVN at
home I was using git it was new and
shiny and everyone was talking about it
and I believed that it's it's the better
way so I was also using Sdn Gate Bridge
at work which allowed me to use get
locally but still push to the main SVN
repository but it was not enough have
you had to convince the whole company to
switch from SVM to hit gate so I
prepared the presentation I did that
presentation once then two more times
for other parts of the company I also
repeated that presentation in the local
user
another local conference have spent
hours and hours trying to convince the
whole company that we should switch from
SVN to get and eventually I got the
permission to set up a good server which
I did and on my own free time
and we our team got a permission to try
out get and we did successfully and the
whole company switched from SVN to get
and both of those in both of these cases
my primary motivator was not was not and
was not that get was somehow empirically
better than SVN or that asp.net MVC was
empirically better than asp.net webforms
in both of those cases I've spent hours
and hours trying to convince everyone
because it was new because SP donut MVC
was shiny because the community was
talking about these these these and
because they were exciting and now I
came to believe that that might not be
the best mindset to bring to work and
what I want to share with you another
story I called this story reducing feed
this is something that happened advented
it was 2013 and there was this
peer-to-peer marketplace that wanted to
build a feed and this is vent that we're
talking about here and
yeah we wanted to build a feet and you
all probably know what a fetus there's
feet on github on Twitter Facebook and
we wanted to build something similar
because we believed that it will make
our members happy and it will increase
sales
so we came up with these requirements we
want a tour fee to have pics that means
content picked our moderators as the
best that should be seen by everyone you
also wanted our feet to have content by
by brands and members that you follow
and you also wanted to make suggestions
in the feed have about what kind of
brands and members you should follow
next so these were the product
requirements and the development team
including me sat down and got to
thinking how do we build a feed because
none of us at that time have built a
feed before this was this was new this
was interesting so we looked at their
requirements and we got do you
researching because there are up there
were other companies even at that time
who built feeds we looked at what
Facebook has done Twitter Instagram
everyone we looked at what kind of open
source libraries and tools are available
available we took up we took our time
trying to figure it out
and we ended up among other things
picking Redis we decided that Redis is
perfect Redis has this sortedset feature
which is basically meant for a feed
because that's what the feed is feed is
a sorted set of things
so we picked Redis and we looked at what
kind of other technologies were using
and we had my sequel as our primary
datastore and memcache or caching and we
thought huh let's make to make sense
that Redis here yeah yeah yeah it does
let's iatridis did this technology stack
and then we got to building and we built
the feet successfully and a couple of
months I think how we deployed it we ran
a couple of AP tests we usually have
shown that members do actually like
using the feet and then we released it
to everyone and yeah our members were
happy they were happy about this new
feature that we shipped and they were
actually using our product more than
this led to increase sales
so everyone wins not so fast
what about engineers we including me had
the chance to build something new
something that we've never built before
a feat we actually also had a chance to
use Redis a technology that none of us
at that time were familiar with so
that's that's two wins right that makes
software engineers happy
there was one problem though this issue
called peak technical depth yeah the
thing is well it's called feet technical
depth it might as well be called
register chemical depth because almost
all the issues listed in that topic in
that issue are somehow related to Redis
those issues include stuff like well so
we knew that Redis stores everything in
RAM but we didn't actually spend time
trying trying to figure out how much RAM
will we will actually need and at first
it was okay but then we understood that
for feed to be really successful we need
to increase the length of each user's
feed twofold and that led us to
scrambling trying trying to rent more
servers because we host on-premise so we
didn't have the ability to just pop up
more machines in the cloud yeah we
actually needed to order those machines
our way and wait for those machines to
arrive also Redis at that time had no
solutions for high availability Redis
cluster and read the central Sentinel
were not a thing so we didn't really
have a way to make read the tile
available and because Redis was our only
store for storing feed we wanted to back
that up and to back that up
we decided that we'll just save save
everything to disk every 30 minutes and
that means forking
and that means we had a bunch of errors
every 30 minutes and all these things
are solvable and we did end up solving
them it just took a while so this issue
was opened in March 2014 anyone wants to
take a guess when it was closed still
open is a good guess it was actually it
was actually closed in September 2015
year and a half later it was closed
after me migrated to riders cluster and
made made it made our setup highly
available so this is kind of kind of a
success story but not really let me
share with you another story let's go
back even further to 2010 there was this
company peer-to-peer marketplace and
they wanted to build a feed and this
company is actually in 2010 they also
wanted to build a feed and their
requirements were quite similar to ours
and they also got to thinking and this
is I'm telling you this because I've
later read it all in their blog post and
they also got to thinking how do we do
that because at that time they also
never built a feed and they also looked
at Redis and then they looked at their
technology stack and thought let's just
make sense
no it doesn't they decided that doesn't
make sense and instead they chose just
use memcached so memcached is not a
perfect not a perfect fit in this case
because memcached only has simple keys
and values so what they did is they had
a feed
- user ID as a key and they start the
whole feed as a value she realized and
they shipped it that way they also an
a/b test etc and their members were
quite happy about the result and
engineers engineers just moved on to
working on some other stuff while we
were trying to figure out Redis and
solving all the problems that we
couldn't foresee their case you just
moved on to something else so these are
the two stories ours and Etsy's in our
case we chose Redis and in their case
they chose memcached and I think that
there are two aspects that need to be
discussed when making these kinds of
choices one of them is shininess the
other is stack and let's start with
shining us in our case we chose a
technology that at that time was quite
new and exciting
they chose something that's old and
boring
um how to make these chips what do we
need to look at to make this kind of
choices
what about trends so let's let's take go
lag go link is trending upwards doing
great Ruby for example this thing about
it the same level and PHP is trending
downwards so this does that mean that we
should pick golang and should never pick
PHP well not not really because context
matters and the context is this well go
link is gaining popularity it's nowhere
near the PHP so we picked a technology
that was written that was created in
2009 and it's a big forefeet use
something that's now 14 years old like
really old in technology terms and with
that all that old Ness and boldness
comes a couple of things one is tools so
when a technology had the time to be
accepted to build up a community around
around it try to build to build a
community around itself that that
community or those companies create
various kinds of tools for that
technology we had multiple cases with
Redis when we had to write something
ourselves in one case we looked for a
data migration tool for the problem that
we had we couldn't find anything so we
wrote
ourselves in Ruby another thing is
information and I'm just and I'm not
talking just about documentation there
are all sorts of information available
about memcached that you probably could
not find about Redis and I'm talking
primarily about information about
real-world usage problems that real
people
well real companies have encountered
when trying to use a technology there
were multiple cases when we had a
problem we wanted to solve it really
fast we went on Stack Overflow
we put in we wrote we wrote something
wrote our problems it will wrote our
problem into the search box and we found
nothing and then we had to figure it out
ourselves maybe someone else has and did
encounter that problem before but did
not decide to share it we'll never know
but we what we did need to struggle and
figure it figure those problems out
ourselves
so sometimes it's a good idea to that
bigger companies take care of those
problems companies like Google Microsoft
Facebook Amazon those companies do you
encounter engineering problems that
require to use or sometimes even create
new technologies in most of our cases at
least in and at least in all the cases
that I've encountered so far a software
engineer the problem could have could be
could be solved by something that was
written quite a long time ago and
technology terms so that was about
shininess
another thing is second part of it is
stack so we chose a technology that is
that was new to our stack Etsy chose
something that was already part of their
stack and with that they chose something
that they had a lot of knowledge about
already
we chose something that we had no
knowledge about and that's that's fine
learning is good but the frustration
comes when someone not on your team
Encounters encounters your technology
choice so at least most of my
frustration when I dig into some code
that I have never dug into before comes
from not bad choices there are rarely
bad choices
people are not evil they're not they're
not trying to do it in a bad way they
can because of different choices and
when you want to do something quickly
when you want to solve the problem
quickly that different can get into in
your way
and you don't really want to spend the
time to acquire that knowledge bond that
about a different way that someone
decided to solve it at that problem
because we chose Redis we also created
some new kinds of discussions so we all
right we had both Redis and memcached as
part of our stack so
there were multiple times when we had
new problems where we had discussions
about huh which one should we use
register memcached and those are fine
discussion but they're not very
productive we also when we choose Redis
did not consider consider this whole
thing called operations we didn't
consider that we'll need to set up
logging and monitoring and we'll
actually need to make sure that somehow
Redis will end up in production and be
highly available we didn't consider all
these things we also didn't consider
that by increasing the amount of
technologies we have in our stack we're
creating work for the future for the
future because the bigger our stack is
the more operational stuff we'll need to
take care of in the future - and who
also at one point in time we considered
building
fee 2.0 we had some new product
requirements and we got to thinking how
do you build this how mmm let's see
and this architecture has no Redis in it
it's it's nowhere to be found so all
that work that we put into Redis to be
our store for feed would have been for
naught we would have if we didn't
actually decide to build P 2.0 but if we
would have would have we would have also
thrown away Redis because we would not
have used it anymore so the idea here is
that I don't really want to add more
stuff to my to my technology stack
unless I really really really need it
because most of the problems can be
solved with the technology with
technologies that I'll read that we
already have in our stacks hmm so yeah
if if I could go back in time and make
this choice again I would most likely
make the same choice that Etsy did or at
least try to convince everyone to make
the same choice that that's a bit too
big memcache instead of Redis well it's
not a perfect fit it's it's a better fit
if you want to ship something so what
I've learned is that shipping is fun and
maybe I should use the word not learned
but recognized because when I look back
into my childhood and when I was playing
around with a scale programming language
and writing simple console applications
I remember how excited I would be to
show off what I've written I would take
that simple console application and I
would show it to everyone that would be
interested in seeing it so primarily my
brother and my mother and yeah so even
then shipping would be shipping
something and creating something would
lead to a lot of joy and excitement for
me also when I look back at various
projects that I've done and my own spare
time
or open source projects the moment that
I remember or the project that I
remember have nothing to do with Phoenix
alas I remember moments like when I got
onto Twitter and I've noticed that
someone in Japan actually used an
open-source
that I wrote someone in Japan did a
presentation about something that I've
written and earned their youth and they
used and they wanted to share with
everyone this is a moment that I
remember very distinctly because I could
I was jumping for joy for at least a
couple of minutes after I've noticed
that so I came to recognize that
shipping shipping cos is more fun for me
than just engineering for engineering
sake I don't want to spend my time
building these this does not seem very
useful I mean that's that's grass this
is not fire I'm sure that engineers that
build this bridge had a lot of fun but
yeah not something that I want to spend
my time on I came to recognize that
while working with exciting tools and
programming languages gives a lot of fun
it's even more fun to actually ship
something exciting and there's this
there is this phrase going around the
right tool for the job
and the phrase itself it's completely
fine but it's often misused to mean not
the right tool but the newest and most
exciting tools the tool that I want to
use I came to recognize that while
mentioning for engineering sake is fun
it's it's not what I want to spend most
of my time on
well only some of them only some of my
time and I came away we do two things
that I try to consider whenever I make a
technology choice so one one is I
consider using something boring
something that's been used hundreds of
times before bye-bye thousands of people
because because boring works and the in
the company context I consider
optimizing company-wide because
decisions that I'm that I make or you
make inside of a team will affect
someone else from another team
eventually so it's a good idea to
consider optimizing company-wide and had
for example having a much smaller
technology stack and there are example
from Venters history that where we I
think made the right choice so at one
point we we considered adding Hadoop to
our stack because we thought we need we
have a lot of data we need to be to you
to create a big data stack and use all
this new big all these Big Data
technologies but but think correctly we
decided against that we decided to just
keep everything in my sequel create a
replica and do analysis on that replica
and that worked for a surprisingly
surprisingly long time much longer than
we initially expected
so this is almost the last slide and I
know that this is not very excited like
it's not but what is exciting at least
me is shipping creating something
something meaningful thanks for
listening how did the questions for here
are there any
I guess not thanks for listening
