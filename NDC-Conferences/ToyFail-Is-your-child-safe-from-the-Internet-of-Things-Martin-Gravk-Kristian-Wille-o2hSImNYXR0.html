so many people have decided to attend
this talk and I hope that it will be
interesting my name is Christine I am a
software developer at booba where I work
together with Martin and there I worked
on variety of different projects I have
been hired as an export court case I
have tested positioning technologies for
the subway here in Oslo but lately I've
been busy working on Android using
coupling hi my name is Martin for the
past 10 years most of our project has
been writing enterprise software for
banks insurance companies and oil
companies that is of course not so fun
and interesting but sometimes we get
some of these small exciting projects
that really makes a difference for
instance doing a security review of
Internet connected toys first a little
about the agenda for this talk we will
start out by explaining the background
for the project go on to show you how we
did the actual testing go on to reveal
some of our findings and finish by
showing you what happened when we
published our results the customer for
this project was the Norwegian consumer
console it is our consumer protection
organization who works to increase
consumer consumer influence in society
and to contribute to develop to consumer
friendly developments so why with the
Norwegian Consumer Council be interested
in internet connected toys more and more
consumer products are connected to the
Internet and while there are strict
regulations when it comes to physical
aspects of our toy like fire safety
toxicity small parts choking hazards and
stuff like that there is a lot less
focus on information security and
privacy in the same toys these devices
are often produced by companies that not
necessarily have a lot of experience in
the field of information security and
their main focus is of
intership as false as possible rather
than to make it secure they had many
recent incidents including when someone
launched a huge denial of service attack
against Twitter and PayPal and it turned
out that the source of the attack was a
bunch of hacked web cameras another
concern is that it is often surprisingly
hard to fix security flaws in connected
Hardware once it has been sold to the
end customer in some cases the
manufacturers have simply forgotten to
add firmware update capabilities to the
product which result in that you have to
throw it away if you if there is a
security flaw discovered after it has
been sold we have also noticed that
there is very limited interest for
manufacturers to write security updates
for all products that are no longer in
sale and they are not making money on
even though people are still using them
and even if manufacturers provide
security updates Pro product many
consumers are reluctant to update and
while most people have eventually
learned that you should update your
computer regularly to keep it safe from
viruses and exploits very few do the
same to the laundry machine and to the
toothbrush before we go on we must
explain a bit about the scope of this
project it was a small project with a
limited budget
therefore we could not test everything
and we had to limit the tests to a small
selection of devices the devices we did
choose for this project was the top
sellers in Norway at the start of the
project ok so here they are
this is IQ and this is Kyla we have Kyla
Witter
we have Kyla with our heroes today they
are functioning almost the same and
their biggest difference is how they
look and their personalities if you
can't tell by the pictures which one is
marketed for the boys and which one is
marketed for the girls I can tell you
that while IQ prefers to make
jokes and parts a Kyla prefers to talk
about cooking and helping her mother
with their daily chores so in other
words for the gender stereotypes from
the 60s are well they're still here
these dolls are manufactured by a
company called the Genesis toys and they
claim that IQ and Kaila are the world's
best talking dolls
so both IQ and color represents what the
industry are calling smart toys they
utilize modern processing power
algorithms and the cloud to enable
powerful new features such as playing
games having conversations remembering
your name or maybe even your favorite
color furthermore they can answer almost
any questions including simple math
questions this includes stuff like what
is the potato
what is 2+2 or maybe who will die in the
next season of Game of Thrones to answer
these questions they searched the
internet for answers
more specifically IQ and Kyla's uses
Wikipedia Google and a weather service
called Weather Underground then a simple
text-to-speech function reads back the
answers so how do i cue and Kaila work
on a hardware level because even though
IQ and Kaila are smart boys there isn't
really anything smart about them however
your smartphone is smart the toys are
actually just a speaker and microphone
and maybe most importantly a Bluetooth
chip which enables them to communicate
with your phone your phone of course has
access to the whole internet by Wi-Fi or
4G so in essence all the logic is
handled by an application on a phone
which you can download on either the App
Store or Play Store and the dogs are
basically dressed up Bluetooth headsets
so let the testing beginning we started
out by examining the communication
between the iPhone or Android apps and
the internet earlier projects had shown
that many apps send huge amounts of data
including personal information to third
parties like advertisement advertisement
networks
so the consumer council was very
interested in if this was the case for
these dolls as well we also wanted to
check what information was sent and if
the information that was sent was
properly encrypted the easiest way to
examine the traffic between a mobile app
and Internet is usually to use wire
shark or web debugging proxy search at
Fiddler's for the initial tests we chose
to use Hitler because it is easy to set
up a noose it has great protocol and
four months support for team Slayer ika
HTTP JSON XML and so on and that helps a
lot when examining the data the ability
to manipulate requests and responses is
also very nice when testing the services
or the API and the client on how they
respond to unexpected data another great
feature is that it actually does HTTP
decryption which allows us to peek into
the data sitting back and forth even if
they are encrypted HTTPS encryption is
usually very hard to break but since we
control the client there is a simple way
around the encryption we generate a fake
root certificate which we install on the
client and then redirects all traffic to
our monitoring computer this is known as
man-in-the-middle attack or in our case
men in the middle attack we don't break
the encryption we just tell the phone to
encrypt using a known key much of our
motivation for doing this presentation
is to start to get you to start paying
attention to how much data you're a
panda voices are collecting about you
and since Hitler is very easy to get
started with we thought we could just as
well show you how to use it it has a
very simple installer and all of you
will get through that without problems
but to to collect to monitor another
device you have to enable that just open
options and allow remote computers to
connect you also have to make a note of
the port video is listening on
and to decrypt the HTTP traffic you have
to enable that and you also export a
root certificate and send it to the
device you want to monitor to install
this root certificate is very simple on
devices such as the iPhone or Android
device you could just email it open the
certificate and install it and you
should also remember remember if you get
an email like this then you should be
very careful with what you are
installing you also have to set up our
proxy server and use your fiddler
machine as the proxy server the easiest
thing way to do this is in the Wi-Fi
settings but you can also do it so that
its consulate listens through the proxy
if you want to see what information is
sent when you are on the mobile network
because of client isolation it is often
simply installed fiddler in usher rather
than to run it on your local computer
the only thing you have to remember if
you use Azure for this is to open a port
for fiddler so that you can talk to it
now when it's all set up we can run
feature as you can see there will be
lots of data coming in and much of the
data you will see the first time you
start figure out this is not from app
you're trying to monitor so make sure
that you close down all apps you're not
planning to monitor and if there is some
system services you should close them as
well but even if you do that it will
probably be some chesta stuff from the
operating system so you must probably
use some filters to get rid of rid of
that and then you'll when you have
filtered out what you don't want to look
and each line in in fiddler referencing
represents one web request and I've
marked one of them for closer inspection
this is the row view and if you have
really good eyesight you could probably
see that that there is a head there and
there is a birthday and there is
something that looks like Jason luckily
Hitler understands with Jason and
give you a much clearer view closer look
reveals that it sends the device ID to a
third party this allows for tracking
across multiple applications and this is
typically the things we are looking for
you're looking for device IDs user names
passwords email addresses GPS
coordinates and stuff like that and
generally things that are being sent to
places it should not be Center however
Hitler is not bulletproof
there are several race for the app to
detect or blocked the monitoring this is
an attempt at SSL SSL pinning that we
found in one of the apps we were testing
it's kind of crude because it only
checks the name of the certificate and
success it contains some string so this
is of course very simple to get around
but it does show that that you cannot
rely on fiddler alone when doing tests
like this because if someone is doing
something nasty and they want they are
really trying to hide their tracks then
it will be more work to find it we we
will explain more about the decompiling
all apps in a few minutes yeah okay so
in addition to filmer we also use the
tool called Wireshark which is known as
a packet analyzer and a similar has
powerful functionality such as being a
proxy server and the ability to decrypt
data Wireshark does not have those
features as we now now fimiliar is able
to pick up HTTP messages which exist in
the application layer however Wireshark
goes deeper in the network stack it can
read that from the transport layer like
TCP or UDP it can read from the network
layer like IP datagrams it can even read
link layer protocols such as the
Ethernet so why shark is be basically
able to see everything that's going on
in network and as long as you're able to
sum
funnel the traffic through your computer
running Wireshark you should be able to
see that traffic so in the User
Agreement of the dolls the users degree
that recordings made while playing can
be exploited by the company that made
these dolls because this the consumer
council wanted us to see if you could
find if Playstations we're indeed being
uploaded firm or if records were being
uploaded it was very interested to see
where the data was being sent and also
how it was sent like was it encrypted or
not and wheeler cannot find these kind
of data streams so we have to use
Wireshark please task we also in show
you a demo of Wireshark using a
previously recorded session with Kailah
on iOS but before we do we would like to
tell you about some of the difficulties
of using wireshark
well the biggest strength of Wireshark
is arguably also its greatness weakness
it picks up messages from all over the
network stack including including
messages from a low-level network
protocol such as the address resolution
protocol and because of this it is
especially important to try to filter
out data which is not relevant to you
and as indication using a new string
Hitler the operating system and other
background programs nice pollute the
network traffic in our experience the
best way to deal with this is simply to
use multiple recordings and look for
patterns between different sessions a
second method that helps lot is to use a
strict testing protocol this is helpful
for a multiple reasons it makes it
easier to identify interesting data as
you have an idea when to expect that it
will show up it makes it simpler to
compare sessions and look for patterns
and lastly it becomes user to reproduce
and evaluate results later on in case
that would be necessary so this is the
testing protocol which we used when
testing and as you can see after five
seconds of starting the recording we
start the application and at around 15
seconds we played we press the play
button in that application at around 20
seconds we ask the DOE
general question and at about 50 60
seconds we ask about the weather and
this process was repeated three times
for each show and operating system so
let's go into demo or one of those
recorded sessions animation emerges is
data recorded using the iOS iOS app and
Kaila so oh there you go let's see
so now we don't have to talk it okay so
this is how Wireshark looks like and as
you can see there's a lot of things
going on here and it can be a bit like
this encourages this encouragin they
look at all this there the first column
ere is the time column which shows when
a packet arrives the nest next is the
source and destination column which
shows either the IP or MAC address of
the message then there is the protocol
then there is the length of the message
as shown in bytes this includes headers
and then there is some other general
information which white shark might
think you find useful so at the top pair
we find and message from the ARP
protocol the address resolution protocol
which we is obviously not interested in
so what we can do is we can press this
filter and we can right now
ARP it's very simple and then we have
removed all of the ARP messages and then
at the top there is an SSDP protocol
which is oh yes maybe we should swim in
a bit so as I mention if everyone yeah
okay and at worst a husband that okay no
the network - okay we're not gonna do
that okay
that little X right yeah
the next protocol which you see at the
top is the message from an SSP P
protocol that this is a plug-and-play
vertical made by Microsoft to enable
plug-and-play functionality select
devices like printers and search over
the network and we're not very
interested in that either
so to filter it out to simply write and
not SS TP very easy so and we could
continue going through the protocols but
it's not very efficient because what
we're really looking for here is the
data going added to our phone to our
bone or either from our phone so what we
can do is write the and IP address
equals 1 9 2 6 8 1 point 7 4 which is
the IP address of our phone and now
we're only seeing data that are going to
our phone or from our phone which is
very useful of course there are a lot of
these acknowledgement messages from like
TCP and sync messages which doesn't
really contain any useful data for us
and the easiest way to filter those out
is simply to write and not just be
length less than 1 this simply means
that there has to be at least one byte
of data and message otherwise we're not
interested in it this does not filter
away 50 retransmissions though and we
can also filter those away we can write
and not be sorry all this starts
retransmissions let's see yeah there we
go and those should be gone there isn't
any particular field in the header of
the DSP messages which tell white shark
that this is a retransmission
retransmission message but Wireshark is
clever enough to figure it out for us
so at this point we have filter about
75% of the data and it's starting to
look a lot cleaner so another cool
feature of Wireshark is that we can
color code conversations we can just
press packet and we can press control 1
and it will try to color code all the
packets tadpole
together and if you do that with the
first message we can see that this is a
message at the NS query which go to G
static calm and then we see a couple of
messages which goes to that IP address
and this is very easy to see because if
you go into the DNS query we can open it
in a new window sorry
and we can go into the domain name
system response and we can check the IP
address and you can see the G static at
the IP address one seven two two one
seven something atomic something and we
can see that this is indeed IP address
we see here we see that there is a
couple of messages going even later on
and this happens at around five seconds
and this might the timing of this might
make it seem like this is coming from
application because this was around the
time we started it but this is actually
just a bit noise if you go into another
recording we made we can see that this
doesn't exist there so this is actually
just a bit of noise in the background
however I have between the close to G
static there is actually another DNS
call err this one let's mark it and this
goes to a company new and mobile feed of
net and if you google that name Newton's
you will find out that it belongs to a
voice recognition company that's a bit
more interesting in it so then it
doesn't really happen anything to fill
around about 20 seconds we see this huge
block of data and we can see on the
length of the messages that there's
quite a lot of data in in these messages
and this goes on for about 20 seconds
now I'm sorry 10 seconds and it ends
with a package coming back to our phone
from Nunes and then we see 1 2 3 4
messages and unfortunately you can see
the DNS request but this is actually
coming from Wikipedia if you're googling
the
IP address right here you will find that
it belongs to VT period so this is
starting to make sense
like we asked the whole question it goes
to neurons it interprets that message oh
and then it goes to the capito and finds
those answers and the DOE reads it back
because it around this time frame the
doll actually read back the answers to
us then it gets kind of quiet in the
network until not surprisingly around 60
seconds when we ask the doll about the
weather and again we can see that this
ends with a DNS request going to API 1
through ground calm and that is the
network address of the weather service
which was Weather Underground and this
ends with an HTTP request it's actually
not encrypted adult so we can go in and
look at it so we can show back the
network and we can see that it contains
JSON object this is a not as nicely
shown as in pillar but we can still try
to find some useful information air like
we can find that oh this is the weather
forecast for flow which might be
interesting so if you go back to the
messages testing included the voice data
we can see that it's using SSL it's
encrypted
we can't actually see this data that
data but of course we have pretty strong
indication that this is worse data
because when it was being sung but even
though we can't see the data we can at
least try to figure out how much data is
being sent and we can do that as simply
as pressing one of the packets sending
data to news and we can apply a filter
and add it to and selected now we're
only seeing messages that is going from
our phone and to news this speech
recognition company and we can copy this
you can go into statistics packet
lengths and we can apply our filter
because Wireshark does not include an a
nice method of finding out how many
packets or I'm sorry how much
information is going from one
my Peter holder but we can use this
statistics tool to help us because I
receive that there's been 60 packets
sent in Ian's and average size is about
470 bytes
this of course includes header herbs so
without the headers it's more like 400
bytes so doing a rough overview here we
see that this is about 60 times 400
bytes so this is about 23 or 24
kilobytes so let's just go back to the
presentation okay let's see so you saw
that 23 in bytes of data was transferred
unions a company that specializes in
speech recognition and if they had used
the mp3 file format encoding usually at
120 kilobits this would be about 1.5
seconds of recorded sound and that is
obviously not enough to contain the two
questions we asked them but mp3 is made
for music though it's not made for the
human voice and the voice band of a
human is about five times smaller than
what is necessary for music and
furthermore the recorded sound is in
mono not stereo and as it turns out one
does not mean more than about 12
kilobits
had to achieve a total quality voice
level when transferring human voice
inferred illusion of no topo2 voice is
roughly the same as the sound quality
would get on all analog phone so using
this new bit rate we find that the file
size actually contains about 15 seconds
of recorded sound which sounds a lot
more reasonable so just to summarize it
all up even though we are not able to
directly observe that those 23 2 bytes
are worse later we have very good
indirect evidence in terms so when we
saw the data and the file size yeah and
we also wanted to check the
communication between the doll and the
mobile app this communication is using
bluetooth and the Bluetooth protocol is
using something that is called frequency
jumping then it's
primarily used for to avoiding
interferences if there is several
Bluetooth transmitters in there in the
same area and it means that in contrast
to for instance FM radio which stays on
the same frequency all the time the
frequency of the signal we are trying to
monitor changes all the time basically
it changes between each packet so you
have to tune your radio after you have
read one packet to the next frequency to
wait for the next packet and because of
this frequency jumping bluetooth
communication is actually a lot harder
to monitor than Wi-Fi and even more
harder than the mobile networks to see
what is going on therefore we use the
opportunity to buy a lot of expensive
hardware to be able to follow the
frequency jumping since these tools can
be very interesting for you or you could
even use them in some project we will
explain a bit about them we'll start out
with a simplest one this is a Bluetooth
low-energy sniffer I think it's made
from made of Nordic semiconductors it is
specially designed for monitoring
Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Low
Energy has a bit less security than
Bluetooth classic and it also has a lot
less frequency jumping that makes it a
lot easier to monitor what this device
basically does is it starts off by
listening to the announcement channels
and then it will see the devices within
reach and once the connection is done it
the hooks off to the hooks onto that
connections and starts to follow the
frequency jumping and it will be able to
pipe the data coming in and directly
into Wireshark so this is perfect if you
want to look at the data being
transmitted for from things like
activity trackers or other IOT devices
that is using Bluetooth Low Energy and
it's also very simple to get started
started using
Bluetooth classic has a lot more
encryption and it has a lot more
complicated freakin frequency jumping it
has more channels and the way it's
jumping between channel between the
channels is a lot more complicated
basically you have to decrypt the packet
look at it and see what channel the next
one will be and it does this very fast
it does it 1600 times per second and
what that means is that you will need
custom hardware for doing the decryption
and tuning the radio fast enough to
catch them the next packet if you do of
course had very many radios instead but
the best is to tune your radio
so eBay this is an open source hardware
platform for doing this Bluetooth
classic gear monitoring it does come
with lots of open source software and
you can just download that from github
but it is a looked more complicated than
their Bluetooth low-energy spoofer so
you will probably have to spend a few
very long notes until you get it to
working as you want
so my personal favorite hack RF that is
a software-defined radio that basically
means that you can build your own radio
receiver or transmitter in software it
has a huge frequency range from I think
it's seven megahertz to two or three
gigahertz that means that you can
monitor signals from garage door openers
airplanes mobile phones and even
satellites and the cool and a bit scary
thing thing is that it also has the
transmitter so you can send the same
signals back so you can start opening
garage doors or unlocking calls or
sending fake GPS signals however since
hacker f is export controlled you should
be prepared to answer a few questions
from the US government when you buy it
and you will have to promise not
to use it to make weapons and not to
sell it to Iran or North Korea however
we were actually quite disappointed
after buying all this equipment we
realize that there were no need for
fancy tools Kano
did not have any authentication at all
you can actually use your mobile phone
to take full control listen to the
conversations and have a say whatever
you want and we'll try to do a quick
demonstration err I think part yeah so
that was just a quick demonstration of
things you could do with cater ah that
was which were just playing audio from
our mobile phone to to Kayla and you can
also do the same thing as to get you all
your back from Kayla exactly like a
business speaker and they already cheap
so they probably saved a lot of money by
doing it like this or like I said an
introduction it's basically a Bluetooth
headset dressed up and it's a Bluetooth
headset without any security now and you
go the next row yep of course to be on
the safe side we did of course picked it
off the park
we're already gotten quite a bit of
attention at the office going around
with kids toys but it definitely reached
a new level when we tore them apart and
took pictures of the remains out in the
hallway so when we open them up we found
the name of gluta ship and we went
through some of the documentation when
we found that the device enables
something called secure simple pairing
and that's of course sounds pretty nice
in their own words so it's useful
whenever project implementers want to
make the user experience easier and I'm
accepted increased risk of security
attacks and I'm not sure if the parents
or grandparents who bought these toys
for the child or grandparents
really have accepted increased risk of
security attacks
so there are multiple ways this could
have been avoided the main advisor is to
ensure that the user must have physical
access to the device during pairing this
can be as simple as there being a button
which needs to be pressed during the
pairing process or if you're a bit more
serious maybe a pin code that shown on
shown on the device itself
ideally randomize between each time but
of course the best thing is a common a
combination of the two so in addition to
IQ and Kaila we also briefly took a look
at a dog called Hello Barbie while she
doesn't use lights bluetooth pairing and
she shows yet another way to improve
security through simple hardware
solutions
don't worry though she has her own set
of security problems so don't buy her
either but well she's a bit different
from Kyle and IQ in that she is directly
connected to the Internet
she doesn't need a smartphone otherwise
she's fairly similar in terms of
functional healthy to talk to Barbie you
have to press the button on our belt
which is which enables your microphone
and when we open her up to try and
figure out how all this works we found
that what we suspected that the
microphone is connected to the button on
our belt by hardware this means that it
is impossible to listen through that
microphone unless that button is pressed
regardless what kind of software access
and attacker might be able to get and
this is really the best anyone can hope
to achieve so let's move on to the next
subject which is the application itself
because much of what the dogs talk about
cannot be found in the data streams in
filler or white sharks so we suspected
that some of these messages were
pre-recorded and that those will store
in the application itself so we want to
take a look in other words it was time
to do some key compiling and especially
when it comes to Android applications
this is surprisingly easy equity Google
search gave us an online D compiler and
it was as easy as uploading the apk to
the website and downloading the whole
source code and this is an example of
what other code we go back it looks to
be some leftover code
or maybe a unit test what I want to show
is that decompile code is very 3d
because the classes methods variable
acids folders and all the other names
are their proper names as the developer
wrote them and this might be a surprise
to you that the code can be both be
retrieved so easily and read so easily
and I think if you write writing codes
on the Android platform especially on
Java you should be aware that your code
is basically public and you should treat
it as such so this is a picture of the
folio Regal prac from the online
decompiler necklace switch places thank
you and if you're an Android developer
I'm sure that some of these folders
looks familiar but as we were looking
for pre-recorded messages we thought
that the asset folder was a good place
to start and every found a language
folder which look promising and inside
there were a bunch of text files
including some stories which Carla can
tell and however it was clear to us that
there were more pre-recorded messages
hiding somewhere because we had heard
many other pre-recorded messages which
we could not find in this text file so
we went back to the asset folder and we
found this strange pile of CD file we
quickly figure out that it was in sequel
Lite database and we of course decide to
open it up but it was encrypted but we
were not set on getting up so we decided
to try to look some through some of the
code to see if we either could find some
clues and how to open it or at least
figure out how it was being used so what
we did was that we actually did search
for the name database and then this the
first file that popped up was this
database helper dot Java looks promising
yeah and in here we have some you know
some imports class and of course the
database password and this was extremely
convenient we are aware that we have
just shown you how to find this password
but we at least blacked out some of it
if some of you want to fight yourself at
home so well back to the database open
it up enter the password roster your
fingers yeah and we were in
so and the database contains about
sixteen tables but one that really
caught our eyes and we're the one that's
called bad word because as it turns out
the database does not only contain
pre-recorded messages what the dogs can
say but made more interesting it also
contains what those are not allowed to
say
yeah yeah we had the phone of how they
implement that kids safe Internet yeah
so they have this cool logo to go with
it which is kids safe Internet which
they put on their packets of these toys
if this is how they claim that these are
kids safe intact so while this is kind
of funny it wasn't really what we were
looking for so we went back and looked
through the other tables and we found
thousands upon thousands or pre-recorded
messages which was more than we had time
to look through ourselves so what we did
was that we sent a copy of the database
back to the consumer council and we
asked them for help if they could look
through it
and they found some pretty good stuff
because as it turns out
kyla really likes this name actually
says things like that in the Little
Mermaid might be only 100 times it's my
number one blue-ribbon favorite movie
ever and this is not the only example
because Hilah really likes this name and
she loves telling you about it
I'm not too surprisingly it turns out
that Genesis toys the creator of these
dolls have a marketing deal with this
name now kyla is marketed as being your
child's best friend and for obvious
reasons it is not okay that your child's
best friends are a hidden marketing tool
for Disney we did of course write a nice
report documenting our findings it has
nice graphs and tables pictures and it
is of course available on the internet
for all to read unfortunately the URL is
this long but it's easy to find so if
you google toy same it will be able
among the top results we don't really
have enough time to go through all the
findings but the consumer console made
this most video explaining some of them
some of the the findings we did so roll
movie there are some toys to really
don't work in your home this is Kayla
and IQ unfortunately these two
internet-connected toys are not as
innocent as they left there's not added
any kind of security with simple steps
I can talk through the dog and listen to
other people
no one wants others to speak directed to
the role or usage is dropped what is
being said that it can happen from a
long distance makes it even scarier and
you may think that the conversation
remains between the child and the dog it
does not the conversation between the
child and the doll is directly sent to a
company in Burlington Massachusetts you
can practically do whatever they want
with the recording and if that wasn't
enough when you use the toy you also
accept terms that allow the company to
use the recording of the child for
targeted advertising it can share it
with practically any third party they
see fit and they can change the terms at
any time without notice to you this is
in our view a massive breach on many
consumer laws Caleb can I trust you
when they publish the reports the media
attention of massive newspapers s from
all over the world wrote about it
River in the Wall Street Journal we were
in both the Boston Globe in BBC and of
course often Boston and it was all over
television toys they claim for
children's privacy at risk one of those
toys of interactive doll my friend Kayla
hey-la hey-la Felix al Qaeda Kayla Kayla
da Hye is everywhere NSA CIA and now MSP
my friend Kayla with security gaps
allowing it to be potentially hacked
turning it into a monitoring device what
the doll should say is I'm recording
everything your child says and
transmitting it by a smartphone back to
my parent company private conversations
between your child and the doll are
recording and then used without
limitation poses a threat to your child
security appears that have bought this
also destroying a very play really
invasive surveillance BC that is
absolutely the setup for a sci-fi movie
about a dystopian future how do we get
there
my friend Kayla the smart toy band in
Germany Germany has banned the dolls
the media impact was pretty massive and
when the dust started started to settle
they counted 1720 articles or things on
television about day 8 and we had 152
million nine hundred thousand potential
readers or viewers about the stories
about Kayla the toys were withdrawn from
several markets big toy chains in United
States Belgium and the Netherlands
stopped selling the toys and in Norway
Sweden and Denmark be our toys and Toys
R Us offered the money back if you
handed in the toys also if you didn't
have a receipt for them in Germany that
always got banned and the parents were
told to destroy the microphone in their
illegal illegal dolls and the latest
development is that kayla has ended up
in the spy - museum in berlin alongside
the le enigma so i think this is a good
time for questions yep anyone know
didn't tear anything from them they have
been like crawling under a rock or
something and either not neither via
heard from them or the consumer console
now the consumer councils try to contact
them and they set out this kind of let's
call like a basic message standard
message but it didn't they didn't really
comment yeah let's think a few of the
newspapers will try to contact them
without any response so they are like in
very quiet
not in German in German it's illegal now
and for now it has not been any
regulations concerning stuff like this
all of these few regulations but that is
about to change yeah except oh yeah
that's what we're hoping to change I
don't know probably at least some parts
of it and there are regulations for some
of these things for instance many
countries has regulations against the
marketing against children
so this tolls are probably already
breaking regulations in Norway
concerning advertisements directed at
children so what can we learn from all
of this to skip on security to save time
and money can be a very risky gamble
that can or will blow up spectacularly
when you get caught so don't let your
next product become the next Kayla yeah
yeah Thanks okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
