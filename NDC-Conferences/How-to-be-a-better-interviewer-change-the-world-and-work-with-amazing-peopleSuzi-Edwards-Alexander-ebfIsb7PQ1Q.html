so people can take a seat um so I have
to sound when she's slightly surprised
there's so many people here because I
up against a bit of a big name at the
moment and I was slightly expecting a
sea of empty chairs a my talk today so
thank you very much for coming to see me
it means quite a lot my name is Susie
Edwards Alexander I am a talent
acquisition professional with over 20
years experience in the industry in fact
I was in talent acquisition back when it
was known as recruiting which is
significantly less strategic and
interesting sounding I'm standing here
today as a representative active my own
company apart Ania I'm just gonna pause
for a second because people are coming
in come to come to the front stone tall
hide at the back to make a quick exit
fun rubbish I won't be it's just
so to recap yeah I'm a talent
acquisition professional with more than
20 years experience I was the first-ever
global head of recruitment for a
software consultancy called thought
works and even though I'm fairly sure
that I am the least technical person I
couldn't have time that better least
technical person I can't even work out
the right a visa to the least technical
person in this room if not at this
conference and I have interviewed
literally thousands of developers in
fact some of them are even talking at
this conference and so I feel like that
can kind of credential ëismí a little
bit um I think there's a simple truth in
every single interview that that you do
that we do is an opportunity to make our
industry better it's an opportunity to
build your team to change your company
potentially to make an underrepresented
person feel like they belong in tech or
maybe it's even to teach somebody
something new if you can view
interviewing as a learning opportunity
and what I'm going to do today is take
you through some thoughts some mindset
changes some tips and tricks on how you
can become a better interviewer change
the world and work with amazing people
assuming that my tech works there with
me for one second John can you come and
help me please tell me everybody else's
slides have failed on the first one then
this is par for the course we did have
this problem earlier
but you can't wait to know what the next
slide is now but I learned this one
okay
well let's hope that doesn't happen
every single time I change sides I've
got 15 of them and my talk is gonna last
until about 3 o'clock this afternoon at
this rate um I've got a quote here Anil
- every industry in every sector of
society is powered by technology today
and it's being transformed by the
choices that technologists make I'm
fairly sure that every single person in
this room has their favorite story about
how tech accidentally discriminates my
current favorite one is about Louise
Selby a member of pure Jim in the UK who
was unable to use her membership purse
to get into the changing rooms she's
ready she didn't understand why did her
purse never let her get into the
changing rooms and there was a very
simple reason her title is doctor and
whoever developed their system decided
that dr. with a male term and so any
woman with the title doctor was unable
to use her purse to get into the get
into ladies changing rooms I don't use
snapchat but I understand that snapchat
recently had an Asian face filter that
was taken down very quickly when people
realized quite what a bad idea that was
and I'm sure you've all seen the video
of a bunch of Indian guys trying to use
one of those hand powered motion powered
hand dryers which didn't work on black
skin teams that reflect society build
products that reflects society and every
single time you step up to interview you
have the ability to make things better
if your team for your company if your
sector for the industry as a whole with
fast we first forwarded on here to a
quote that I love from Grayson Perry
he's not only a really great artist and
when actually turns out he's an amazing
feminist and an amazing thinker as well
and he recently wrote a book called The
Descent of Man we live and breathe in
the default malware
old no wonder he succeeds for much of
our society operates on his terms now I
was really quite taken with this idea of
default mail because it not only trips
off the tongue better than this white
heterosexual able-bodied middle curse
man but I actually think it invites us
to have a slightly different worldview
and I love things that invite us to have
a different worldview and I do you think
it's really important not to denigrate
that group of people the white little
curse able-bodied cisgender men who
actually only make up 10% of our society
but who in fact make up such a huge
percentage of the tech industry and so
actually what default Mel gives us is a
worldview for many of the people sitting
in the audience today to feel that you
could actually have a part in changing
tack but you're not the enemy that
you're not denigrated and that in fact
you can become an ally and so many of
the things that you do when you build
your teams give you the opportunity to
work with that I well question for the
room um how many people have read the
John Scalzi lowest difficulty setting
piece okay that's interesting too I
could I tend to assume the things that I
read are the things that everybody else
reads so it's a really great piece and
in that again he provides a different
model about thinking about what it's
like to be a white man in tech and to
help you understand the the privilege
that that brings and how perhaps you
might be able to use that privilege in a
different way my slides are not going to
work again
oh let me go maybe they do so you've
recognized your privilege what's the
next thing that you need to do stop
looking in the mirror
next time you begin an interview one of
the first challenges that I dealt with
when I worked at thought works back in
2002 it's very long time ago 2002
thought works was 9% women in the UK by
2004 we were 28% women now there's no
one thing there's no silver bullet that
can help you fix the diversity problem
in tech however one of the things that
we found as we actually began to unpick
some of our encoded biases around high
rank was that perhaps not everybody
needed to write open source software in
their spare time not a single person in
the team thought they were being sexist
or discriminatory but that was what they
all did and so that was what they all
looked for and it was only by actually
looking really really hard at ourselves
we were able to begin to understand some
of these things that have become norms
and find a way to change them I call
this the magic the people was not just
me call this the halo effect and it's
one of the things that you need to be
really cognizant of when you're
interviewing in my experience people who
would just like us actually cripple your
critical thinking in an interview much
more than somebody that you disagree
with oh yeah you run the London Marathon
too is something nobody's ever said to
me
but you know people oh we went to the
same university or we both like milk I'm
all of these things contribute to us
sitting across from somebody and seeing
ourselves in them and so what I'm gonna
invite you to do so that we can be a
little bit less default male
it's find a different tool now it took
me a while to come up with the right
metaphor for this partially because I
find it very difficult to say the word
binoculars and I was in fact 42 years
old before I was told I've been saying
it wrong for my entire life so forgive
me if I screw this one up and and I
really didn't want to have this be one
of the things that I talked about in a
presentation in front of group of people
but I needed I needed a different
metaphor I needed to stop people looking
in the mirror um and I thought well you
know I said it is it a magnifying glass
but actually I think that comes with a
sense of kind of looming over somebody
and kind of looking at them maybe it is
it is it a microscope but there's a
sense there for me of too much scrutiny
of somebody I know it's telescope
actually something that brings objects
that are far away closer to us but a
telescope only shows you something in
one dimension so the answer is that word
that I find it very difficult to say um
your greatest skill your greatest tool
when you go into an interview room and
it's to take with you a pair of
binoculars they give you a great field
of vision you can focus them yourself
and you control the view you control
what they look at and that for me is one
of those sort of first minds mind shift
changes that you need to make to begin
to become a better interview there's
another big mind shift change and that's
about shifting your mindset from the
person sitting across from you in the
room being a candidate or an applicant
and start to think about that person as
a potential colleague and I like this
because it makes a future relationship
explicit it suggests that there is a
long
t-too the relationship that you might be
building with them and I also think it's
really important to remember that talent
acquisition has changed gone are the
days when your recruiting team was
munging through people who'd applied my
a job surf or you know perhaps the the
queue of people around the block that
wanted to come and work for your
organization just picking people out of
that queue because I'm fairly sure some
people that I've worked with seem to
think my job consisted of an actually
talent acquisition has become really
quite sophisticated these days and I had
a really interesting experience working
in the US and switching a team from
primarily processing applicants to
beginning to headhunt people to active
source as we call it in the recruitment
world and and I ended up in a really
sticky situation that actually got
escalated to me we'd found a really
amazing african-american developer very
very experienced conference speaker just
really great profile and one of the
recruiting team had worked really hard
to get him interested and and start to
think about applying and then he came in
to a hiring process that was built for
dealing with people who'd applied via
job sites and he was so bruised after
his interviews he called me it got
escalated to me he said you asked me to
apply and then he came away feeling like
he'd been put through the the mill with
a hugely competent or colleagues rather
than candidates particularly if somebody
perhaps is an employer referral or
somebody who's who's been headhunted and
I think it's just a really simple mind
ship mind shift to change that you could
have even the next time you walk into
the into the interview room I'm going to
take this
a step further and I am a total hippie
and I default to everything kids
glorious and everything is good but how
about when we go into an interview our
default answer to that person is going
to be yes and instead of actually trying
to stack up evidence to prove why they
shouldn't go through to the next stage
we look for the good we look and we find
the positive things that we could say
about this person the things that the
person is in fact good at I have to be
guilty myself years ago I viewed my job
is that of a gatekeeper and I can
guarantee you that interviewing becomes
a lot more fun when you take off that
gate key perhaps and you start to think
about okay this could be somebody that
I'm going to work with this could be
somebody who can bring something really
unique and additive to the team and I've
seen so many people who live in fear of
the false positive from an interview
this fear of well you know what if what
if we let that slippery person through
and they're not very good and I get it
you have to be on the team with that
person but actually I think that the
false negatives are far more damaging
and are probably one of the reasons
contributing to why we have such poor
representation in tech at the moment
obviously we're all building teams here
some of us building companies you have a
tech stack that you've chosen that
you've polished carefully nurtured over
time you've got a set of capabilities
and the team probably got a business
that's used to working with you in a
certain way um
and so one of the things that I had to
think about was well actually how could
we reframe our feedback away from the
individual and position it a little bit
more organizationally and so one of the
things that I struck upon is as you
write your feedback on a candidate at
the end of
interview well what would we need to
change in our business for this person
to be successful here and once again it
fundamentally reshapes your relationship
to that potential colleague when you
begin to think about well what is it
that the organization would need to do
what is it that the organization would
need to change and you know sometimes
the ask may be way too big sometimes
there might be somebody that you think
if we could change a thousand things
about this company they could come work
here but you have to start somewhere
and starting to to think more about your
org less about your candidate less about
the potential colleague is it's a good
place to start
Patti McCord is one of my industry
heroes heroines heroes is a heresy
she built an absolutely amazing team at
Netflix and to me they've really sort of
defied a lot of our industry standards
about what does it mean to attract
talent they're solving problems that no
one solved before and so they can't rely
on just this person have previous
experience of doing X Y and Zed I think
it's great what what most people really
mean when they say someone is a good fit
Colten culturally is that he or she is
someone they'd like to have a beer with
I know so many organizations that have
the pub test or a feedback criteria
which is would you want to hang out with
this person and let us remember we're in
work here it doesn't matter whether or
not you would want to hang out with the
person and so I'm going to make a
request if your organization at the
moment uses a pub test shut it down it's
needlessly discriminatory there are so
many people I don't like going to the
pub simply because I don't like pubs but
I you know I don't not go for religious
reasons but there's a whole crest wave
of people
in our industry who for us to welcome
them in we need to find a way to change
some of our norms it was quite
interesting from it to looking at the
NDC hashtag and seeing actually how much
of the stuff about this conference is
about beer and kind of the meat that
everybody's gonna eat tonight
I don't want to be terribly critical but
if the hosts but it would be really
great if not only in our workplace but
our conferences we could actually find
some different ways to to make people
who aren't so represented feel like
maybe they belong I would actually go
one step further than getting rid of the
pub test and I'm going to suggest that
you stop doing culture interviews
obviously we're talking about kind of
major recruitment process change hers
probably not something that everybody
could just go into their team and change
tomorrow and but culture for interviews
are a fairly recent phenomenon and as
she begin to dig you'll find first term
really it's only since about 2005 that
we've talked a lot about kind of
interviewing for culture fit as you dig
however you discover that the the
research behind this isn't isn't that
great there was a piece of it was a
meta-analysis of research about culture
fit done by the University of Iowa I'm
going to read this because I cannot
commit this to memory but what they
found was that people who fit well into
their organization with superiors and
co-workers are more satisfied with their
job more committed less intention to
quit and their performed better overall
people who fit well are less inclined to
quit I'm not sure that this is
necessarily groundbreaking research and
in fact
the University of Iowa researchers did
say in their conclusion that every
single piece of research that they
performed the meta-analysis on had a
different definition of culture fit so
to me this kind of creeping tide of
culture interviews is no good thing I
remember you know I'm going to say fer
anecdote for later and we think about
this kind of concept of work hard play
hard
collaboration great team player
rock star developer and I think so much
of this phrasing has become so
ubiquitous as to be essentially
meaningless and actually I would define
most people to be able to show me a
cultural interview for your organization
that couldn't be used by any other
organization oh well we see how they
collaborate or we see what a great team
player there are raise your hand if you
work for an organization that doesn't
want people who are collaborative team
players so what can we do to change this
you'll be pleased to hear I have some
ideas and a while ago I was working on a
complete refresh of footworks employer
brand and it was really interesting to
understand the gap between what
marketing thought they're sort of cool
and groovy things about the organization
work and what all of our developers
thought they're calling creepy things
were and we found a really interesting
way to understand that we asked the
question what is unique about thought
works and what we found was that the the
huge number of stickies that had gone up
onto the wall was very very quickly
whittled down
by this concept of uniqueness now not
every organization is unique not every
organization has you know a bunch of
things that nobody else can lay claim to
so what I would propose when you're
starting to think what am I going to
replace my culture fit interview with
it's to answer three questions what
makes your team different it could be
what makes your team different to other
ones in the organization it could be
what makes your team different to other
teams that you've been with elsewhere
but I think that you would begin to find
is you ask that question across all of
your developers all of your
technologists you'll start to see some
things that actually stand out then
let's ask the big one just in case
there's something there what is unique
about this business and then let's start
to ascribe some behaviors to those
things so rather than just saying we're
collaborative let's think about what's
the most collaborative thing that
someone's done recently what behaviors
can you point to within your team that
say here's something different this is
something that we could in fact
interview against now I recognize that
this is big stuff this is big process
change and you possibly don't feel
empowered as a developer as a single
member of a team possibly even as the
CTO of an organization to make that kind
of fundamental change to your hiring
process so what can you do as an
individual to begin to be a better
interviewer I almost can't believe I'm
saying this cuz I am probably the least
organized person at least technical
least organized person but one of the
things that I've come to realize is the
more structure
that you can build in to your
recruitment process the better
so if we go from the top down let's
begin by thinking about your process and
what role everybody is going to play in
it up front and naturally let's get that
written down and let's get that agreed
so that everybody knows when you're
hiring for the same roles that you're
their role in the process is probably
the same as it was before but at least
it's got some definition then on the
next level down you need to define some
topics I once ran an interview process
with somebody hopefully they'd flown in
from Amsterdam for the day they've given
up qala their time to come be with us
when I was facilitating the worship at
the end of the day it turned out that
every single person had done the agile
interview and nobody had in fact
assessed the person's technical
competence so now one of the things that
I'm very very passionate about is okay
let's have a name for each interview
what are we going to call it and what
are we going to focus on the metaphor
that I like to use for this is by doing
that you're actually able to drill down
into a candidates knowledge potential
colleagues knowledge and begin to
understand probably 70 80 90 percent of
their their understanding around that
topic as opposed to what I think is far
more common just laving across the top
and everybody asking the candidate the
same questions and understanding the
same 10% about somebody so we've got at
a process level something that we change
then we've got something at an
individual level I would invite
everybody to spend some time building
out your own personal interview plan I'm
not suggesting that you use the same
questions for every single interview you
do
I don't mind you but I get quite bored
doing that quite quickly but actually
build yourself a model build yourself a
plan and know that every single time you
sit down in front of somebody where
you're going to go what your topics are
and what you're going to talk about so
much research at the moment is pointing
to this idea that structured interviews
are actually the best way to remove bias
how many people have done unconscious
bias training it's a small number out of
interest raise your hand again if you
thought it was amazing and it's
completely revolutionized your
interviewing okay all right that's not
bad actually I'm quite impressed it's
not quite it's 50% um I've got a
sneaking suspicion that actually all of
this unconscious bias training is
probably not a great use of everybody's
time I think that there are so many
explicit biases in tech but actually
getting people thinking about their own
Chi unconscious bias doesn't solve them
what does seem to work is creating a
shared set of expectations it turns out
we are in fact herd animals and knowing
what everybody else is going to do is a
far far better deterrent as it were to
the wrong behavior than being taught
that perhaps what you think and feel
isn't the right way to think and feel
I love this phrase I don't actually know
who said it I wish I had I didn't
there's a really interesting
interviewing platform called
interviewing dot IO and I love the fact
that they exist I don't work for them
but the reason I love the fact that they
exist is that they're gathering really
really great data on what makes a good
interviewer and it's actually proving
some of the stuff that I've seen in the
wild one of the things that somebody
said was that they viewed an interview
as a chance for two people to be smart
together and again there was another one
of those phrases that I think kind of
fundamentally changes the relationship
between the the interviewer and the
interviewer so if you were going to be a
great interviewer and if you were
thinking about how could you be smart
with somebody else what are some of the
things that I believe and what are some
of the things that the data from
interviewing dot IO suggests you need to
do and the first one is prepare we've
all been guilty of going to read in this
CV and the five seconds before we walk
into an interview and but actually with
interviewing preparation is very much
but the key to getting it right the next
important thing that you need to do with
the person sitting opposite you is lay
out the structure of the interview let
them know what is going to happen during
the course of your time together I've
come across a lot of people who like to
lay traps in interviews and they
probably would say well I don't want to
do that because I want to keep the
candidate on their toes unless
perpetually being on your toes and in a
position of fight-or-flight is a
prerequisite in your organization and if
it is I would suggest you leave you
don't need to do that
when they come see you and this is an
interesting one but you need to give the
person time to settle in and this is
something that I've been doing for years
without realizing it I actually start
every single interview with the same
question it's muscle memory for me it's
my way of getting started it also means
that I have built up a really
interesting data lake of answers to that
questions now probably do more
interviews than many people but as part
of your perhaps small talk or settling
in is there a useful question that you
could create that could become your
personal data lake the thing that allows
you to get into the mindset of that
interview the next piece of feedback is
from candidates one of the things that
they think differentiates a good
interviewer from a bad interviewer no
surprises is quality of question and
this is where I think collaboration is a
really great really great thing to do
how about if everybody who is in this
room today when you get back to your
workplace you start a shared dock of all
the great interview questions that
people ask and then immediately begins
to give you the opportunity to harvest
the knowledge to begin to redefine what
good look likes what good looks like
when it comes to interview questions and
perhaps give some help to people who are
less experienced of interviewing then
and this goes back to restructured
interview candidates really value
interviews that build so you don't start
in one place and then kind of zip around
and end up in another place not really
understanding how you got there real
life examples maybe problems that you
have solved in your workplace and an
interview that just builds and builds
and builds maybe going deeper into the
problem set or finding something that is
adjacent to it and this is a really
great interview technique really great
kind of star
to get yourself used to and the other
thing that candidates say they really
love hints and nudges if they don't know
if they if they did really well and they
didn't know that they did really well
that candidate doesn't want to come and
work for you
I once witnessed somebody interviewing
with a little stack of stickies to give
them their credit they did use a
structured interview they opposed every
candidate the same questions but as a
candidate answered they would go and I
saw people literally crumble because
they were getting in the moment feedback
that what they were saying was actually
painting the interviewer so hints and
nudges if so if you ask somebody
something and somebody really have no
idea how about instead of just moving on
to the next thing or shooting them a
look and perhaps you work with them to
find a way for them to learn that I
remember when we started the footworks
graduate recruitment process everybody
would complain at least grads they don't
know TDD what's wrong with the
educational standards in the UK that
well unfortunately my work remit doesn't
give me the ability to change what's
taught in the curriculum so actually how
about instead of complaining that a
candidate doesn't do TDD how about you
teach them how to do that how about you
take their code and you help them write
a test what it fail and go from there
and very interestingly I think that was
one of those foundational moments that
began to completely retool the Graduate
hiring process that thought works from
one that hired 10% women to one that
year-on-year
now hires at least 50% women in every
single country
around the world step away from that
whiteboard I did some interview training
in India quite a long time ago now and
we're about three hours in to a good
half-day thing and somebody said cz when
are you gonna teach us about the stress
interview I'm sorry
what's the stress interview we know the
stress interview where you put somebody
under a lot of stress and see how they
respond you might kind of get them to
whiteboard something really hard and it
was interesting because to me it's
actually a reasonably common interview
style I think it's only one step on from
good cop bad cop and but I found out a
whole group of people who were genuinely
expecting me to teach them how to do an
interview for somebody who can deal with
pressure I feel that the whiteboard
encourages that
now unless your workplace routinely
requires that somebody stands in front
of a whiteboard solving a very hard
problem whilst you criticize them in
which case have at it but instead I
think it's time that we found some
different ways to understand what people
can do it would be ludicrous to think of
hiring a juggler
without seeing him perform that's just
common sense I find the use of he's
somewhat egregious however people where
was written in 1987 and so I accept that
this is a relic from a different age and
but I actually think the remark still
spans and there's a lot of truth in this
you wouldn't let somebody tell you oh
yeah I'm great juggling fire and knives
without seeing them do it and I remember
in the in the early days of XP there was
actually a sort of move for us to think
about interviews as auditions
and I wonder if if actually there's
still some some mileage left in that as
a way for us to to have it be less of a
performance and more of an opportunity
to be smart together unsurprisingly
given where I have spent a lot of my
career I'm a big fan of pairing and I'm
particularly a big fan of pairing in
interviews and quite often get into
arguments with people on Twitter about
why pairing in interviews is a really
good thing to do is this something
people do at the moment I'm King don't
skip this slide for those of you who
didn't raise your hands though I'm
pairing in interviews for me the
metaphor for writing code works for
interviewing driver navigator it gives
you the opportunity for one person to be
maybe leading to be thinking and to
really sort of take that interview
forwards whilst the other person perhaps
can be listening really really hard
because one of the things that I know is
often conversation the hardest thing
when you're interviewing is to is to be
thinking really hard about what this
person is saying rather than what clever
question am I gonna ask next and because
I also recognize not everybody gets to
interview all of the time so it can be a
little bit nerve-wracking when you get
up there there are a bunch of other
things that I think pairing gives us
beyond better feedback by the kind of
technical results and that is I think
it's often an opportunity for you to one
to showcase the diversity of your
organization and people have said to me
recently all you know we would really
want everybody to interview but you know
it's something that only Bhasin you
people can do pairing gives you a really
amazing opportunity to bring somebody
who has less experience interviewing
perhaps somebody who is you know junior
developer that you've hired and have
them learn from the other person it also
gives you far more opportunities to show
to the candidate all of the different
people that you've got in your
organization now I recognize if you're
not very far down your inclusivity
journey it may be that the person ends
up seeing eight default men but for me
this sort of pairing paradigm really
gives you the opportunity to improve
capability within your team and just
sort of showcase what you've got going
on
yeah absolutely
and it continues to sort of audition
metaphor and it's why I dislike
whiteboarding so much to me really
important part of the hiring process is
actually to get the candidate either
potential colleague to either write
solve a problem for you write a piece of
code particularly for your recruitment
process and/or to give you some code
that they've written previously I think
either works I do worry that
organizations are setting fiendishly
hard coding tests and expecting people
to put hours and hours and hours into
into these problems and so you know I
think you need to have some flexibility
around what that coding sample is but
they need to be something that the
candidate has written themselves and
then I would look to extend that so to
spend some time either refactoring it or
adding some additional functionality and
then that way I think you have the
opportunity with three people in the
room so you've got the two people from
your organization and you've got your
your interviewee and you have the
opportunity there to maybe switch who's
driving to you know have somebody who's
sort of coaching and thinking about what
where the the problem set goes next so
my sense is you're pairing interview
paradigm actually opens up more
opportunities for everybody to get to
play all of the roles in an interview
does that make sense yeah I might wait
until the end if there are any other
questions no no it was good it's nice to
know someone's listening and that's
stopped working now as well
and so you just see how I'm doing on
time okay we're getting to the getting
to the end I just want to spend a little
bit of time thinking about what what are
we trying to gather in an interview one
of the outputs that we expect and I like
to think of your questions being split
into into four different groups so
you've got questions that you can ask
that credential eyes
what is how do you you've got some
questions that might elicit opinion
where you think how am i doing
you got some hypothetical questions how
might you how could you and then because
I have spent my entire career in nature
you've got competency based interviewing
which to me is really the way that
everybody should be framing their
questions and I'm just doing as a matter
of course when you're in the room with
the candidate how have you tell me about
a time when I think it's really easy to
get caught up in asking questions about
things that never happened things that
might happen and it's fine
absolutely fine to use some hypothetical
or opinion level questions just don't
mistake opinion for evidence that the
person can do the job so because there
has to be a summation slide 10 mindset
changes to be a better interviewer
hopefully I've hopefully I've talked
through these enough I I always feel
like I need to end on a positive note
and this last when you look look for the
good I cannot say how depressing it is
as a candidate as a recruiter as a
recruitment leader to hear about so much
combative interviewing and actually if
we could just make one mind shift change
from at stir let's look for the good in
people
I think we might start to find that
we're hiring some really amazing people
and it's a great way that we can make
our industry a little bit better thank
you very much for listening to me does
anybody have any questions yeah
and trying to hire specialists in a
broad field like modern suffer
architecture so the technical scope can
be quite broad so the technical
interview has my opinion become very
subjective it's covering breakfast
covering trying to cover that and it
does neither
this is specialist you know expertise to
people in victory we need two different
opinion of
and I think possibly a cage fight
between the two interviewers and whoever
no maybe maybe that won't work and
objectivity to me it has to come from
what are you setting out to hire and I
get that you're that you're talking
about breadth and depth I think there's
probably something about going back and
just beginning to understand what is
this person going to do and as a
foundation beginning to really
understand the nitty-gritty behaviors
around their day-to-day work and then
find a way to kind of feed that back
into the hiring process
I also for me there's a red flag when
somebody says we're trying to cover
breadth and depth in an interview it's
two interviews probably so you know I'm
not I'm not one for interview processes
that go on and on and on and on but I'd
go back and just begin to look at what's
that end-to-end hiring process within
the behaviors you see where you go from
there
what is the interview process in terms
of
interestingly Google have pulled some
data on this and they maintain that for
is the magic number or yeah I think
their analysis said after you start
doing more than that you don't beat you
don't get any better data points
what is interesting they do have
excellent talent but if you look at
their self-published demographics so the
teams that they have none of those
organizations have been able to make a a
great change a step change in terms of
the diversity of their teams I think and
I'm always nervous about giving an
example and so shoot me
it's either Facebook or Google who after
I think a three-year initiative to find
more african-americans they change of a
percentage above 1% so all of this work
is not changing anything and I'll be
honest I think one of the reasons why
things aren't changing where they're not
getting the results that they want and
I've not worked for any of these
organizations but I think it's because
they're still going through these
combative white board who's the smartest
person in the room I'm going to put you
under some pressure interviews they want
to change but until they fundamentally
retool their hiring processes to find a
different kind of way of behaving in
interviews I they can they can sponsor
Grace Hopper
a hundred thousand times it won't make a
change and because the people from
underrepresented groups who come through
will be put in that environment and I
think they'll self select out that's my
hunch
that sounds like a beautiful thing to me
and I'd like to see more often it's
actually I think quite often we when we
think about technical interviews we
concentrate on on coding and now it's
really interesting to think about kind
of notching it up a level and and
starting to think about how you might
build a system or you know the sort of
architectural decisions that you might
make and if you're an organization that
does that I think in the interview
process having an interview dedicated to
that is a really great way to begin to
understand you know is this person a
total despots their architecture rules
or are they able to actually kind of
deal with people at their same level and
and begin to understand things so yeah
I'm big fan of that
do it more of it maybe at the beginning
of every interview everyone should get a
sharpie or a whiteboard marker and you
can get up
I think if it's not something that you
do in your day-to-day job then it's not
it's not a candidate for part of your
hiring process so there you know I would
I'd begin to look for does your
organization use a lot of open source
tools has this person come from an
organization you know where open source
is prevalent I just I don't think you
actually have to build it sometimes you
just have to use it but I know that
there are many organizations that are
still kind of stuck in there's best
tools that money can buy thing and they
wouldn't dream of using an open source
tool or it may be sort of contributing
one back I just also think it so if
that's your first one and you know I
love this I did it you're going to go
back to your organization you're going
to make your team do this if that's the
first thing that comes up then you just
have to get rid of that and you have to
say no because we know that this
fundamentally discriminates against all
a bunch of people let's look again there
has to be more points of commonality
amongst a group than then what is it if
you've got ten people in a room
don't two of them share of birthdays and
there's nothing weird like I just keep
looking if you can if you identify that
your first cultural behavior is possibly
you know not as welcoming as it could be
look again
remember it's only my opinion that's a
whole different talk I'll be honest
I mean how hiring for potential I yeah I
could I could probably talk for hours
about that and quite often have I can't
even I'm trying to think how I even
begin to encapsulator
maybe we could have an offline
conversation afterwards and yeah I can I
can bore you with some thoughts on that
any other questions yeah it was
brilliant with the best bit
yes it's interesting as a former thought
worker myself and also was the wife of a
former thought worker I began to see
things very differently when I was on
the receiving end of my husband
commuting from Chicago to San Francisco
every week and just sort of beginning to
realize you know just what a stress and
strain it puts on the family and but
it's interesting one of the things that
I think we'll see
as we begin to sort of challenge some of
the norms about childcare which you are
doing and that's brilliant I think that
that will start to change
many organizations thoughts about
flexible working about you know
expectations around who does what and
for me that can only that can only be a
good thing the benefits of you know kind
of smashing that the patriarchy are
actually that men also benefit from this
that the yeah all these patriarchal sort
of norms that that hold down women I
think also hold down many men as well
Grayson Perry is actually very very
smart on that read his book
yeah hire me to come and do some
consulting and we'll chat about it I
mean I I've got a three year old and at
the moment I'm I'm just I get you know
the static white noise when I begin to
think what happens when she goes to
school so yeah let I'd love to chat with
you about that
yeah I mean I have to say that is that
is another talk there there's a lot of
there's a lot of stuff that you can do
and I think actually the tech stack
that's available for kind of talent
pipelining and sourcing now is making it
easier for us to do that but if I had
one thing that I would suggest people do
and it might get me some boos and hisses
here but I would say the first thing to
do is set yourself a target don't just
kind of say on what we'd like to find
some women what I found that thought
works it was only when we became very
very explicit about the demographic of
people that we wanted to hire that we
started to see any change and so in my
experience setting a target is the first
way to make your recruiting team
appreciate that this is something the
organization is serious about and
actually when we get to the end of the
year if we still haven't hired anybody
who isn't default Mel then you know what
are we going to do about it and then you
need to work with the recruiting team to
fundamentally retool how they sauce and
to approach people rather than just
waiting for them to come to you it is it
is 100% possible but again yeah it's
probably a two-hour talk oh wow
everyone's got questions now
that's one of the things I'm starting to
think about at the moment is this idea
of kind of diversity debt so akin to
technical debt like what point in your
organization's lifecycle do you really
need to start thinking about this
because actually one of the problems
that Google and Facebook and Amazon have
when you have that many employees
without sucking up every single female
developer in the world how can Google
ever really sort of change their numbers
so I think there are some really
interesting conversations to be had
about at what point do you really start
to put in a sourcing strategy that helps
you find people from underrepresented
groups forget I'm here
cool good Co alert thanks for thanks for
listening thanks for bearing with me
during all of my technical issues and I
hope you enjoyed it and I hope you've
got some things that you can go and do
