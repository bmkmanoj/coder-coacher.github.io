I'm on the committee agenda for picking
talks for NDC London and while I was
going through all the selection I
realized that I could help people avoid
some basic mistakes so this is a quick
talk about that so I've been doing I did
NDC 2016 I also run a one-day conference
called pipeline and helped talk
selection on Prague net and devs ended
so I've done a few of these I see a lot
of talk abstracts so I've already told
you why I'm doing it because it's
self-serving and I want my conference
our conferences to be amazing and NDC
submissions we get so many that if I can
I kind of want to make my job harder I
wanted to be harder to pick the good
talks I want I want to make the
challenges like you guys stop making the
mistakes that's why I'm here I want I
want to make it better so here's a bit
about the panel that's me Eric Niall and
Liam do the main tracks then we have
Brian doing the functional track and we
also have the conference organisers
Jakob and chasity who sit on both of
these panels to provide more information
about the conference as it has it stands
from an organizing point of view so
we're kind of subject matter or location
experts to help
kirsty and Jakob pick the right talks
okay so this is my excellent drawing of
what is out there this should look like
what you're familiar with and we have
roughly eight rooms I think yeah roughly
eight rooms and one of those rooms will
be taken up for a functional track and
one of those rooms this year is also
taken up with a C++ track so we have
seven tracks left sorry six tracks left
that myself
eirick Niall and Liam can pick talks for
so that's roughly about when I got here
a hundred and fourteen slots okay and
about a third of the talks are
pre-booked No
pre-booked talks because there are a lot
of speakers that you asked us to host
there are a lot of speakers that are big
names and they need a lot of planning in
advance so about a third yakov and
shares to go along in pretty book with
so in total we pick about 75 remaining
talks this year we had over 700
submissions about 10% is all we can come
up with out of all of that so we lock
ourselves in a room for two days this is
this year's and we go through every
single one of those 700 submissions we
do it in a couple of passes as you can
imagine with our first pass which is
kind of to get rid of a cute if we tried
to go through and remove a few that are
quite obvious like they're full of
spelling mistakes or all the submission
is really kind of short they've because
they know has made any effort kind of
thing and we just do that first basket
case through most of those and that will
take out maybe I don't know hundred and
then we do it and then we go through and
we go through a little bit more we give
them again a second pass and then go
again we group them into themes and as
you can see here we've tried to we've
got down to probably what is that like
300 I don't know so we started grouping
them into themes to enable us to go
through those and try to try to ensure
we're not covering a theme too many
times or we have all the themes that we
want covered so then we like whittling
them down to try and from that one too
because you've got like stickies in
there and lots of things to try and
figure out what what we have and then we
have to fit them into the actual
schedule the agenda so then there's a
second set of problems so you've picked
the ones that we'd like to have or
almost all the ones we'd like to have
and then we've got to kind of we spend
like a couple of hours just jumbling
them up yeah we cook like if we have
Chomsky on at the same time as I don't
know Amy at the same time you know is
that good thing was it bad think we put
them both in room one run room two you
can use a lot of time just moving a run
around and we tried to be quite aware
at the fact that some people need bigger
rooms some people we don't want to put
put women all against each other because
we want to keep ensuring that we give
them a fair chance at a good audience
and all this stuff we have to be aware
of and some people are not very good in
the mornings and we know that like Seb
you know anyway mind he won't mind
so yeah you can spend a good hour or two
just reshuffling so I hope that some
information about how long and how hard
it actually is to do this for you guys
but I have some sample abstracts okay so
have you ever wondered what your cat is
trying to tell you are you curious why
they show you their bellies only to
slice your hand to shreds ever wanted to
know why they run around your flat at
200 miles per hour at 3:00 in the
morning come to my talk is this a good
abstract what's wrong with it any ideas
I'm using cats because then I'm not
picking on one particular subject I'm
not particularly a particular theme
everyone loves cats
right right get out if you don't so that
way I can remove that there's cats all
these about cat talk okay we're running
cat Kampf
so what else Ivan cats potentially bad
about this one it's all full of
rhetorical questions my problem lives
abstracts like this is they don't tell
you what is actually going to be given
in the talk
there's no idea for myself as a as a
chew as a selection committee always you
as attendees to know whether you really
are going to answer your questions about
cats like what are they going to tell
your behavioural tips to improve the
cat's behavior problems with cats a
history of that like genealogy you don't
know we don't know so tell us what is
going to be in your talk don't try and
hide I know where this comes from this
is people thinking right I've got a
great thing to tell everyone I'm gonna
excite them and they're gonna come on
and know about my great big reveal
don't worry about the great big reveal
tell us it's not people come to the talk
to you talk not for your secret answers
maybe tell us up front okay
in this talk we'll discuss the best
methods for walking your cat though I've
never owned cats as a professional dog
walker this guaranteed method works
regardless of breed and chosen leash
okay this one is a controversial topic
by someone who may not be an expert in
that area that happens a lot this is
usually the person who's a hobbyist in a
particular area but their experience or
their professional experience is
something else and the problem is
they've probably picking the wrong talk
at the wrong conference like it's a risk
it's a gamble out of those 700 people
that are there would you pick the expert
or would you pick someone who's not so
pick something you you can prove to us
you have expert knowledge in before yeah
see so is a more satisfying scratching
material than cardboard that's good no
there's no content we get plenty of that
we got plenty where it looks like the
person who's just comes back oh well
what are they going to talk about can
you can you extrapolate from that
whether they're going to be a great
speaker they're gonna put some effort in
put some time into it we have a lot to
choose from so tell us why we'd pick
yours okay how I learned to stop
worrying and love catnip how I love to
love a domestic
you get the point right I call this the
shotgun submitter they just fired this
shotgun at you right we get a lot of
this we ask people if they can give us a
two or three one or two best talks when
someone does this to us we ask ourselves
what are they an expert in what are they
trying what can they tell us about it's
so varied as like they've literally just
that they're trying a numbers game on
earth and that just makes us hate you so
you know pick pick four you don't don't
make us pick your best talk out of that
if you are an expert in hair balls
send us your hair ball talk not not all
the others okay okay in this talk we'll
discuss the process for introducing a
new cat to a resident cat I've been
fostering cats for many years and have a
successfully introduced both stray and
abandoned cats of all ages to my busy
home of five cats with an 80% success
rate will cover steps the first few days
to successful integration from creating
a safe
face to a sentient room swapping and
more with these techniques you'll have a
happy cat eHome we're doing a this one
guys yeah this is a great actual
abstract submission this is brilliant
this is fantastic the comments on this
one is I would this is this is where we
would probably move on to the part about
you as a person
we then probably go through your bio and
find out if you are an experienced
speaker
we prefer on a conference as big as this
to have someone who's had some
experience if you are new at speaking we
suggest you try your meetup groups first
and then maybe do a lightning talk so
this one we probably be looking for
videos of your previous conferences we'd
be looking at some kind of maybe your
LinkedIn to find out if you are an
expert in particular area so to help
yourself get this talk through help us
to help you get this talk through please
send us all more information about you
and your experience we can find it
otherwise we go searching for it this is
a good one
sec to summarize tell us what you think
tell us what your talk about don't don't
hint
don't hint tell us why your experience
matters why you don't shotgun submit why
you should be talking about this provide
a sufficiently detailed abstract send us
your best targeted talks assume a
knowledgeable audience we get so many
that want to do like the 101 to AWS you
guys are experts in pretty much
everything you will try the AWS 101
assume a knowledgeable audience here
help us to find your presentation
experience and then I've gone ahead so
next year when you're staring at that
blinking caret hopefully there's a
little bit of information will help
that's it really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
