session on go if if some of you know go
ready it might be a bit boring it's a
base in my journey over the last year in
looking at go and the issues issues and
joy I had over that year so my name is
Paul bar I'm a technical evangelist at
Microsoft during during my day job I
work closely with the azure engineering
team and with global partners and we
focus on asia solutions this project on
the other hand is one of my personal
projects so it doesn't really have
anything to do with my day job but it's
cool nonetheless you can you can get
hold of me on twitter at p bar there's
my handle probably the easiest way to
get hold of me that's that's always on
so go is a statically typed language
that feels very much like a dynamic
language the thing that attracted me to
it was it felt a lot like the scripting
languages that I've used in the past but
it's very very powerful in that it
statically typed it has a huge
collection of core libraries it also has
a huge collection of the party libraries
and I utilized some of those the one
feature though that really sold me was I
was looking for a language that could
get me a binary across linux windows and
mac and go certainly fit the bull how
many of you have heard of go i'm
assuming all of you know used go ah good
yeah well i'll give you a gentle
introduction and hopefully provide some
interesting anecdotes along the way so
what are we going to cover so the open
source project that i'll be covering is
a project called script CS version
manager script CS is it's a way of
running C sharp as a scripting language
and when I was working with this I was
trying to run multiple versions on my
machine and anyway at that point to
install them was to uninstall the
previous version and installed a new
version so i sat down with Glenn block
who created scripts yes and we decided
to start on a version manager for
scripts yes so I'm going to cover off
sort of what what it is and why I
started looking at go as opposed to the
technologies that I wrote it in
originally and that's that's what the
considerations are going to be I
considered a number of options but I
finally landed up and go and I and I'll
explain why for those of you who've
worked with go you know it's a bit
opinionated like a lot of other
languages sometimes they can bite you so
I'll walk through how you should
organize your project if you're doing
something non trivial hello world works
perfectly once you move beyond that some
things start to bite you if you don't
understand them package management is
also a hot topic if you come from a
world like node or C sharp with new
get-go might be an interesting place for
you which which languages typically are
you guys using node or C sharp C sharp
okay and then i'll also look briefly at
some of the language aspects that i
really enjoyed and also some of the
tooling that i've been using to to help
me with go so let's dive into the script
ES version manager first of all we need
to start with what script es as I sort
of alluded to it a bit earlier it's a
way of writing C sharp you don't even
need to write a package or a namespace
you can literally write code fragments
of C sharp and will execute like a
script under the hood it uses rosalyn to
actually generate to omit the DLLs into
memory and then we'll execute like a
script on the mac and linux side we were
using mono to do the same thing
now svm or script CS version manager I
did a plural cycles on script CS and
while while I was busy doing the course
there were new versions of scripts es
coming out all the time and as I said
earlier this often led to me having to
uninstall and reinstall and sometimes I
want two different versions I'm the
machine because each of them had
different side effects and I wanted to
demonstrate that there was no way to do
it easily so i started the version
manager this allows you to not only
install multiple versions on your
machine of scripts es you can also link
to a a dev build that you're running so
you could check out the script CS code
compile a new version fix the bug and
actually linked it and run it as a
version on your machine so let's have a
quick look at Scripps es el SVM so I've
got powers over here and if I just do an
SVM list that's going to tell me that
I've got two versions of scripts es
installed on my machine and the little
asterisk next to zero 16 1 means that's
the act of one I can also can also then
check all the versions that are
available for me to install so these
this actually reaches out an API and and
does a list and gets the available
versions actually need to remove some of
those they bit old and then if I do
scripts es- version you'll see this is
actually now running scripts yes and
that's actually 0 16 1 which is the one
I showed you so now just this is showing
it running on Windows so now to show you
running on on linux and make sure just
going to fire up a docker container so
this is running I'm running doc and
native on my machine so it's effectively
going to spin up in a bun to image so
again I can just do an SVM list you can
see that's now running and I can do
and again now that's so that's running
on Linux so you can see it works exactly
the same across both platforms now how
this actually works just come over to
the github repo can everyone see the
writing it's a big enough everyone good
okay so as as I mentioned earlier to get
this cross-platform capability initially
what I did I wanted as minimal impact on
the the person installing it as possible
so I've got this concept of a binary
which is the SVM binary and then the
shims are a shim that gets called that
rap scripts yes so when you execute
scripts yes it can check some logic to
figure out which version of scripts yes
it should actually run so when I was
writing each of these the windows
versions are all written in PowerShell
and the Linux versions are written in
bash and then because on Windows you've
got to console type environments you've
got the command prompt so there's a CMD
which is actually just a bootstrapper to
run the PowerShell and then partial you
could run from a PowerShell command but
the I came up against an issue where if
if you have a if you have a script so if
I'd named the partial script SVM and I
was in a partial console I couldn't hook
into a bootstrapper so I needed to
actually call it something else and make
sure that even from PowerShell the
command that CMD file was being run it's
actually bootstrapping so in the windows
case it's a little different so I'm not
going to go too much into detail here I
just want to give you a brief overview
but the the bash I don't have ever
written this much bash in my life but it
actually became a large programming
language well a large program written in
bash and then the partial one was also
getting quite complicated as I mentioned
earlier most of my power shell looks
very much like C sharp because i
instantiate all the C sharp objects and
to get the capabilities now some of the
issues that I came up against her on on
the Mac I think bash at that point was
bashed three and on Linux was bashful
and bash three didn't have associative
arrays so some of the programming
constructs started getting a bit
complicated in bash and also some of the
sorting that I was capable of doing like
in PowerShell because you can create
objects and sort on properties some of
the capabilities and the PowerShell svm
were lot more they were lot better than
on the bash version what I could
actually do and this started to show up
in the issues i'll just show you all the
bugs they came through so a lot of these
was it works like this in Mac but
doesn't work like this in windows and
work sucks and windows but it doesn't
work like this a mac and at that point
it became really difficult maintaining
two separate code base is almost an
analogous to in the mobile space where
you running and Android and iOS separate
code bases for the same app so I started
to look around what potentially could I
leverage to move beyond this and have
one code base where I could actually
write both these things so my first
consideration was no Jason NPM here
we've got a cross-platform language
cross-platform runtime and mpm gives me
the package management which is awesome
the azure CLI the cross-platform
interface has also written a node which
is why I started here this was very very
attractive but then I started thinking I
think dotnet core was starting to make
noise at that point was still very early
days but I thought maybe this is worth
looking at so started looking at dotnet
call it also had nougat so the package
management was catered for but it was
early days and
I say I then started to look at all the
artifacts that were come along for the
ride so you wouldn't just get a single
binary you would get all these
assemblies and multiple folders and
would be this proliferation of assets
between this and node that started
driving me to look to another solution
so this is why I ended up and go and go
was originally written in Google was
created in 2007 so it's almost 10 years
old was created as a very lightweight
statically typed language but it feels
like dynamic language and it generates a
single binary with all the statically
linked libraries pulled in so you may
have multiple libraries but it spits out
a single binary and that binary you can
target at different platforms so you can
target at different architectures x86x64
powerpc a whole whole bunch of them and
in different operating systems so how do
you get started with go let me just pop
over to the go lang website so it's
really easy go to golang org got some
very nice tutorials you can just run in
the browser if you go to the
documentation down here there's a learn
page there tons of books to get you
started and and to get you on your
journey so if you just getting going
definitely have a look here the other
great thing as I mentioned is that the
core packages that come with go are
impressive so this is a list of all of
them so there's actually a lot of them
and it gives you a lot of capability
once you sorry I wanted to show you one
more thing there
on the downloads page so like node you
can actually install go for each of the
different platforms you've got windows
mac and linux that installs on on each
of those oasis so once it installs on to
your machine to actually find the
binaries your path is set up with each
of these different paths in the
different oasis so on windows you have
sigo bin and the actual go executable so
that's similar to the node executable or
the dotnet exe and the new net call and
then in linux and mac you've got the
burn folders go route is also very
important environment variable the sets
up to the installation path of where
goes installed this is important because
all of those packages is that the core
libraries that I showed you their source
code is sitting in a source folder in
this location so if you want to see how
each of those libraries is created all
the source code comes along when you
actually create it and those are used to
to generate your code this is probably
the most important environment variable
and go it's called go path it is it
defines the workspace and this is a
source of much of my frustration in my
journey which I'll elaborate on shortly
so go path defines the workspace that
all of the go tooling works around so in
your go path or your workspace there
will be three folders that you need to
define sources where you write your
source code packages are where
intermediate libraries are compiled
before they are statically linked and
then bin is where the final executable
gets dumped so think of that like the
debug folder in in c-sharp or.net so as
an example I've got a source source code
called hello duck goose that's the file
it's in a folder called say hello and
it's in a namespace folder
called NGC Sydney demo2 and that the
resulting binary will be say hello dot
exe it takes the namespace it takes the
name of the the package similar as in
c-sharp so if we have a look at hello
this is what a go package looks like
package main means this is going to be
the executable and then function main
means this is the main entry point and
importing if in T which is the format
library the core library and that's how
you just print so it's a printf print to
print to the standard output so that's a
really simple program that's generating
a single binary and say we want to do
something more complicated we want to
potentially reverse reverse the string
we're going to build another library so
in this case we would still have our
hello go but would have a library called
string util it would be just reversed go
when this compiled it would create a
package so this is the library binary
that gets statically linked and then it
still generates the binary on the output
so if we have a look the hello doc go
looks pretty similar we're just now
importing our string utility so that's
the full path to to that location of the
string you tool and then we're just
going to do a reverse on them on the on
the string don't pay too much attention
to the internals of this that's
complicated ruined stuff in Ingo but
this is just showing that if you don't
name your package main then it
automatically becomes a library that
that's all I wanted you to take away
from that this this is also a little bit
confusing when you want to build or
create your executable you run a command
called go install what this does is it
builds your packages and then installs
the exe into the binary folder into
their bin folder I think if you used to
always if you used to commands like dock
near build or dotnet run or something
build it gets a bit complicated
these these two environment variables
are also really important particularly
if you're looking at the cross-platform
stuff so go OS determines the operating
system that the binary will be compiled
for so if i change the go s variable
environment variable i can actually spit
out a binary for a different platform
and the architecture go arch is exactly
the same so you can spit it out for AMD
for Intel for powerpc and arm I think
there are there a number of them yeah so
those those are the main ones we're
going to be looking at in this demo so
let's have a look at a demo
you
okay so here i have created on my
machine my go path variable is set to
see projects go workspace so this is now
we're all of my go code is going to be
written so i'm just going to show you
those two files again so I've got the
hello file and I've got the reverse file
so now I'm actually going to compile
this and run it and show you
we do go install you'll notice here that
I don't need to go down the the source
folder I'm targeting the actual package
in in that source folder so that's to
say hello it's going to generate a say
hello binary for me now
you know
it should work
wrong slashes okay so essentially what
this is done now is it's built the the
binary so in the binary folder I've got
an exe and it's going to print it back
to front so now just to show you I'm
still running on windows I'm going to
now set the go OS variable to linux now
I'm saying I want to spit out a linux
binary run exactly the same command go
install what I should have now
I know
so now i have a linux binary and what i
mean i should just push that top of the
screen for you what it's actually done
is put it into a linux amd64 folder
which is the operating system and the
the architecture so just to prove that
that is actually a linux binary
so this is ubuntu bash on Windows this
is essentially a linux shell I'll run
that and it it's spat out exactly the
same thing so now we have exactly the
same code base and just by setting
environment variable we can actually
target two different applications I mean
two different two different os's and
architectures so that all seems really
easy I did mention that go path provides
pain if we have a look at the source
folder you'll notice that not only is my
the project that I've just shown you is
in there but a whole bunch of other
projects isn't there if we go to the
package folder its proliferated with
tons of my experiments if we go to the
binary folder every single output of
every single project has been shoved
into the one folder so this now creates
a problem where you if you used to being
able to segment your your projects into
in two separate locations it becomes
kind of tricky because everything is
shared with them within the workspace
that described the feeling that I had
the first time I experienced this I'm
not happy so I started looking at
different approaches I wasn't the only
person who had started and go who was
moaning about this or looking for
alternatives the the solution i
eventually settled on was called gb it's
actually written by Dave Cheney and he
is actually from Sydney and he I think
he is a Co Co Co coordinator of the go
user group in Sydney if you need to
learn go read his blog posts and start
using these tools because they there are
actually amazing I'll just show you what
get gb what gb is
so since you're a nice build tool for go
so this now allows you to run your
entire project in folders just like you
would with node with C sharp it's no
longer it no longer uses your workspace
as a common place for all of your
applications you can actually have your
your project and your application
segmented in a folder so the easiest way
to install it is with go get go is the
binary as I said that's installed in
your bin folder we looked at go install
go get gets packages it can get them
from github or any URL and we'll
actually install them in the source
folder in your workspace so this this is
where it starts getting complicated
because every single package you install
was go get is being shoved into your
workspace so it's conceptually similar
to node where you have a global space
but you don't have a private space to
store the node modules anymore this is
all in one place so what I've started
doing is all the tooling or all the
project all the machine wide type of
libraries I want to use I use go get and
that will go into the workspace but I've
started using gb to actually segment all
the project related libraries into a
separate folder so in gb projects do not
live in go path it's actually all
segmented which actually keeps your code
alike cleaner so the the top of the
hierarchy is project with a net we've
got the familiar bin package source it
maintains the same layer so do you
familiar with it what it adds though is
something called vendor source is anyone
used Ruby before no there was a it was a
concept with the Ruby gems around ven
during which at the time I didn't really
like because we were using real package
management like new yet but what this
does is it actually takes it will take
one of the packages that you get off
github or wherever
and actually put it into this vendor
source folder so we'll take a snapshot
again this is not something I've liked
in the past because their package
management sites that you can actually
go get packages from you don't want to
be committing packages and that's what
we always told don't commit your
packages into your source control does
anyone did anyone hear of the left pad
incident in the node world yeah so
someone there there was a discrepancy
well there was a disagreement over a
name in the MPN repository and one of
the packages got pulled and there were
thousands of other packages that relied
on that and they all broke overnight so
based on that I'm becoming more likely
to actually store external dependencies
in here and that's essentially what this
is doing so gb makes really easy it's
got familiar familiar language like
build gb build bullet rebuild your
solution and put stuff in that project
folder it's no longer pushed into the
workspace let's have a quick look how
this works
so this is what my folder currently
looks like it's the same example we've
been running all along if i run gb build
build all that will build everything i
can actually target individual packages
and forestry compilation of individual
packages so it's actually quite a
powerful tool going to build all and it
actually shows me the packages that is
rebuilding so it's built the string you
tour package and it's built the hello
say hello binary for in their tree view
again you actually see just push it up a
bit for you right at the top we've got a
binary again packages say hello and
string you tools so those the
intermediate binaries that are compiled
and will be aesthetically type
pathetically linked and then they're the
packages so now this is all outside of
the workspace and it's clean and i can
actually wrap that whole thing up into a
repo so it's nice and segmented which is
exactly what we're after and then just
to prove that it still works still are
familiar backwards say hello
so now that you've now that we've
figured out the workspace problem the
next thing in a cross-platform solution
is typically certain functionality may
work on specific OSS and on other os's
you want to target different
functionality so this is where
conditional compilation comes in and you
leverage this via build constraints so
it's as easy as at the top of your go
file you put that command it's a comment
plus build and then we'll go through
what you put after it there must be a
space and empty line after that just
that the the build system knows that is
a build constraint so if there's commas
between two words it's treated as an end
and if there's a space its treated as an
all so you can build up complex boolean
logic the top one says this file should
only be built for 386 architectures of
Linux and any darwin which is mac OS and
this bottom one here you can actually
have multiple lines top line is saying
Linux or Darwin and it can only be amd64
their targets a specific architecture
another very interesting way to do this
if that is not sufficient for you you
can use file suffixes so if you use any
of these patterns on your file names if
will actually target the build system as
well so this is actually an example of
something that I'm having to do within
within the version manager I need to do
some linking of the versions to specific
folders now on linux and mac i can use
the ghost some link library that same
library on windows uses the some link
functionality in windows which requires
elevated privileges so what I what I
used to do in the PowerShell versions i
use junctions with make link which
doesn't require elevator privileges so
that's a better solution so what I do
here is on windows I'm using exact or
command which affect
we just i shell out to the the junction
command to actually create a junction
not a symlink and on linux and mac i use
the the standard go library so here i'm
using a combination of these two things
in there simulant go file I've got build
tags to say for mac and linux compile
this for their functionality and on here
i'm using the simulink underscore
windows so this file will only be pulled
into the Windows version of the binary
they run understand that yep an in
package management as I said this
happened again to me because the package
management is a bit of a mess so go get
as i said this command puts everything
into your workspace which is fine if
you're looking for a global workspace
like a node but if you're not everything
is messed up well everything is pushed
into a single space so I started looking
at package managers and I started
looking at forums a lot of people were
complaining about the same the same
thing the last time I looked there were
20 different package managers that
people had attempted to start because
there was no industry standard for for
go so lots of people were writing their
own but then the problem you have is the
library is you're looking for may not be
in the package manager that you want to
use yeah there's one of the one of the
ones that you may see a lot is called go
dep they're copies that copies
dependencies out of your workspace into
your vended folder but they still in
your workspace when i heard about this
week was glide which was also gaining
momentum it looks really good but again
it's quite tied to the the go path which
is I'm still not comfortable with that
so since i was using gb already gb has a
fantastic thing called gb vendor so go
build has a plug-in architecture and
they have a vendor management so it's
the party library management utility you
can fetcher to update it listed deleted
purge etre storage so it's really
look at the script seus version manager
so this is now my we were looking at the
one that was written in partial and bash
we're now going to look at the one that
is has started rewriting and going just
a little branch let me just get that
checked out
so that's just the GV vendor command as
you can see for the GB vendor list those
are all the packages that I'm using in
in this version of svm as you can see
they're quite a few and those are the
actual packages with in gb list will
actually list the packages that are mine
so the vendor list will list all the
vendor packages and the list will list
all the packages that are mon just to
show you what this actually looks like
pull it up and code again
so we've got our code in here and the
source the commander is with the
packages I'm using command the package
I'm the libraries i'm using expect the
exe to be in command so that's why this
structure has been in force that's not a
go-go standard and then all my scripts
es libraries are inside there does all
the functionality I'm writing and in the
vendor folder those are all the third
party libraries I've pulled in the way
it manages all of this is with a
manifest so it will actually show you
all your dependencies show you the link
in github that are pulled it from and
the actual revision and the branch so
this is still not proper package
management with versioning but it's
getting close where you can actually
restore and rebuild and actually have a
fixed point in time and it's separate
from all the other from all the other
stuff in your workspace
if we go back here I'm just going to do
a gb build all on the sum and thus go
project you can see it's rebuilding all
the stuff get this to the top of the
screen if i run the svm thing it's
looking a little more tidy you can see
we've got it there and then run a
command this is just showing that I've
just compiled the binary and again the
environment variables work so if i set
it up to be linux Dorjee be bold again
and see that's actually created a svm
not an SVM exe go back to you you've
been to the other one
here
this some so gb actually does a bit of
naming it's no longer in a folder called
Linux AMD it actually renames the the
binary just so it's clear all the
binaries that is better which
architecture they they're related to as
you can see it's exactly the same
so some really cool things around the
language that i also found along the
journey if you look at go code that most
well it is idiomatic everything has
multiple return values so if you've come
from a scripting background I come from
a long time ago from a pill background
and their everything had multiple return
values in c-sharp most thing is a single
return value you can emulate this with a
struct or an object but ingo you will
always see multiple return values coming
back so an example of this this is one
of the functions I've written in svm is
to check if a path that I'm given as a
directory and see here the OS library
status give me a file info object I'm
getting the file info and the arrow back
so if there's an error error won't be
null if there is an error it won't be
known so we can do that check in return
there's another way of looking at this
if you're not interested in the one of
the parameters you can use the thing
called the blank identifier and that's
the sense you just swallows swallows the
variable so you don't have to create a
variable to contain it another
interesting concept is something called
defer the defer keyword what this does
is behaves very similarly to finally in
c-sharp as you can see here we've opened
a file and defers often used to close
file handles closed network connections
so the thing I really like about this is
that you put the defer right next to the
open so it's not in a finally block
where you might forget about it you put
it right here and when this is compiled
defer will always be called when this
function exits so if it exits here or
here if there's an errand it exits this
will always be called but the fact that
it's close to the actual open means it
makes your code more readable and then
you'll hear that go has no parameter no
exceptions as I said the guidance is to
provide multiple return
Early's so most of the errors come back
as part of that multiple return value
stream within packages you should only
return errors you should never throw
there is a way to throw and that's what
the panic keyword is panic really just
means die there is a way to recover from
that using the defer keyword so if you
panic it will essentially just exit the
the function walk up the stack and call
the defers on any of the the functions
all the modules above it as I said the
guidance is do not panic do not leak
panics across package boundaries you can
you can use panics within your your
modules or your packages but the the
guidance is a package should always
return a value return an error just just
that everything is consistent this is an
interesting use of defer here which can
actually behave like a catch from Java
and from C sharp so this defer function
will always be called before this main
exit so you can actually catch all your
exceptions and then chillin you may have
noticed though i was using vs code so
everyone everyone using vs code or
visual still there awesome it's a really
really great like way to editor so
there's a vs code go plugin and it gives
you everything you need gives you some
tax highlighting all the tools you'll
very your mileage may vary because most
of this assumes go path is set and the
workspace is there so most of it works
for me I get syntax highlighting it and
a bit of functionality but a lot of
these utilities may not work if you
don't use go path or the the workspace
you can also configure it as there's a
whole bunch of settings typically what I
do right on the bottom there I'll always
put my project path into go path so go
path what I didn't mention right in the
beginning is go path is not
single it doesn't only need to take a
single a single path it can take
multiple paths but that's not how you
mean to use it it's always mean to be a
work space but for this this utility i
put into vs code settings which means it
stays with this project it's not vs code
wide and i actually add the project path
in the beginning of the go path just so
that more things work within the
application i'm not sure if you notice
some of the fonts or i might show you
again shortly Fira code is also a great
thing if you're using go or any other
application that uses interesting fonts
like not equals to greater than the
comments what what this font does it
adds ligatures so it'll actually
re-render the fonts underneath the s key
is still the same the ASCII codes but
the rendering is different and you can
use us with Visual Studio code there's
there's just a selection of what it can
actually give you it makes some of the
content actually more readable and it's
as easy as that in Visual Studio code
and your settings your user settings to
add the font family fairy code and font
ligatures true and that will actually do
that for you so just to wrap up some of
the important takeaways from this are go
is incredibly incredibly powerful
language it generates static binary
statically linked binary is a single
binary you can target multiple platforms
multiple operating systems it's really
easy to use but the the things that you
really need to watch out for is the
workspace if you have a single project
probably won't bite you as much but as
soon as you start having multiple
projects the the pollution within their
starts becoming a bit overwhelming thank
you
any questions nope yeah do you want the
mic I'm new we saw go could you just
explain a couple of what was the the
benefice to use go vs like dotnet or
Java what's the occasion why so that I
mean did you have to look at your own
use case for for me my primary driver
was to have a single binary so with with
Java would have still had 'old well you
may have had jar files but I wasn't
interested in writing and in Java with C
sharp i would have had all the
additional packages all the nuget
packages coming out actually did
consider dotnet native at one point but
it wasn't quite right and it wasn't
quite ready at that point i'd still
don't know if it quite is when I looked
at it you could literally only compiler
hello world and not much beyond that
once it is ready i might actually
rewrite this again yeah does it does
that answer your question yes mr. kids
by kids I yeah yeah exactly yeah
anyone else
well good cool thanks thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
