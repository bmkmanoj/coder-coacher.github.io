my name is David today we're talking
about Microsoft Azure which is
Microsoft's cloud compute platform owned
and run by a Microsoft but we want to
talk about Microsoft Azure without
Microsoft my name is David I'm a
Technical Evangelist I from come from
the united states of america from the
great city of chicago this is some
contact information for me follow me
online these are pictures of my last
trip to Australia in 1998 I'm very
excited to be back here are there any
Australians actually in the audience
right now about a dozen in the back
there thanks so as you're how many
people using Azure today most of the
audience is so you know the compelling
story around Azure it is cloud computing
it allows you to rent hardware and said
buying it so that results in lower
capital caustics and you know but more
than that it provides hyper scaling the
ability to scale your application out
almost infinitely very rapidly and then
a scale it back down again when you want
to save some costs that kind of
elasticity can be a real cost savings if
you have demand that goes up and down
for example if your serum selling
concert tickets that are really high
demand the day of the Klingon sale but
drop off after they're all sold out it
provides redundancy provides automatic
distribution around the world and it's a
really a nice solution if you want to
reduce your expenses but it is Microsoft
Azure and what what happens if you're
not using Microsoft Technology is it
still relevant this is a conversation
that I have a lot with startups in
America I talked to because I want to
start they're not using Microsoft
technology they're using Ruby other
using Java or their writing iphone apps
they're using open source software or
node and I'll talk to them about
Microsoft Technology I'll talked about
Azure and their immediate responses no
no I'm really not interested in that
because we don't use any Microsoft
product and so I have this conversation
a lot to say you know what just because
you're not using any Microsoft products
does not mean as arisen telev a--to
there are a lot of pieces of as you can
take advantage of so you can have that
high scalability and low cost of
elasticity and the result in redundancy
even if you're using open source or even
competing technologies they all work
within Microsoft Azure and I'm going to
talk about that now so I had that
conversation so many times that it
started to turn it into a talk and share
it with the hundreds of people that are
here today these are some of the things
that we're going to talk about here I'm
going to just skip over the slide
because I want to get right to them the
first thing is virtual machines on
virtual machines aren't new they've been
around a long time and they're a more
efficient way of using Hardware there
they allow you to make machines portable
move them from one to another and to
make copies of them very quickly they're
great for the cloud so the cloud allows
you to clouds like Microsoft Azure allow
you to spin up a virtual machine and
then this is a machine just like you own
it except that's hosted by Microsoft and
there are templates there are templates
to make this easy for you so when you
create a virtual machine you're asked
questions like what size machine do you
want what how much memory how big is the
hard drive and what operating system do
you want on that machine not
surprisingly you have an option to put
Windows Server 2012 over 2,000 what is
16 i think the latest one different
service packs you also have the option
to put windows with sequel server or
various microsoft technologies there are
templates built in to make that easy
that's not surprising at all but what
you might be surprised to learn is that
there are various distributions of Linux
that are available so if you want to
create an open sous a server or a red
hat server or in a bun to server there
are distributions of the next pre-built
for you to quickly deploy these virtual
machines to Azure if they're not there
you can of course install your own it's
your machine you can install whatever
you wander so here's a screenshot it
took a few months ago of various redhead
and Oracle Linux and things that have
nothing to do with Microsoft there are
machines that actually have oracle
installed of them some on Windows some
on linux and there are some that have
machines that have open source software
so if you wanted a virtual machine that
had the mean stack of Staub what is that
mango Express angular and note I think
or the lamps
jack is open source software there are
machines that are pre-built that you can
start using right away with this
software so let me create show you how
to do this I hope that the Wi-Fi or the
my internet access cooperates here this
is the azure portal for those of you
that are not using Azure to get started
I'll show you right here the thing to
remember is Asher com just go to Azure
com it's actually a jerk microsoft com
and if you don't have it yet you can
create a free account right here and
start playing around there you a 30-day
free account and then I click on the
portal and that brings me up to here
this is the portal with something open I
wanted to show you the very top of the
portal here before I open anything azure
com
and here we get a nice dashboard it's
very html5 issuance it's actually pretty
responsive here though the Wi-Fi here
I'll say it again it's not the best but
even given that as much does this is
actually pretty snappy now I'll close
that up and you can see things like the
health of the various regions around the
country and I can pin things to the
dashboard here if I want to if I want to
create a new virtual machine I could
this a big plus new button right here
and right here my virtual machines now I
go into virtual machines you'll see
there are some popular templates windows
server 2012 r2 datacenter of course as a
Microsoft thing but right below that is
a bun to server and I can grab that and
it asked me a few questions one is just
click create and it'll ask me things
like what size machine do I want to do
its basic stuff what's my authentication
mechanism what's the name of this
machine so I'll create a machine here
i'll call it DG test Oh 804 which is
today's date what kind of disks do i
want i don't want solid state drives
they're more expensive i'll skip that i
could put user names i'm gonna log in
with i'll use my first initial last name
not going to use a ssh public key or a
password I'll go with the password here
oops
and resource groups this is a way of
organizing your machines if you want to
manage them all together I like to put
these into a resource group that I can
because the demo that I can easily get
rid of let next time i use this so i
have a resource group that i created
yesterday called DG test oh aight there
it is Oh 803 rg4 resource group for them
Oh 803 RG right there I could put it
where I want to in this case East Asia
is the closest one there isn't a data
center in Australia but there is one of
East Asia so I'll grab that one and I am
I must be missing a piece of information
oh there is it's waiting and then i
click ok i'm just gonna let that run
it'll take about 10 minutes to spend
this up I'm sorry I'm there's more
suppose there are a couple other things
here that I want to add
this is not awkward silence for me it's
only awkward for you
here we go I can select a size the
larger machine the more that I will pay
there's an hourly rate quoted in here if
you click at the on the pricing it'll
tell you what that is but I'm going to
delete this tonight so I'm not going to
pay much forward at all come out here
into settings that i could change things
like where do i want to store this
machine if i want to create a virtual
network i could do that all this stuff
is it's not really necessary or some of
it is not necessary and i'll just take
the defaults and click on ok and once
I've done that this next screen is
read-only tells me what I've selected I
can really quickly review to make sure
it's all good and click OK and at this
point it'll take about 10 minutes I
won't show you the I won't wait around
for this to happen but they don't have a
virtual machine that's running ubuntu
and i can ssh into that i can use it
it's just like my machine and in fact
about thirty percent of the servers that
are running on azure today are some
version of linux so this has been a
really successful tool for a lot of
people that have no desire whatsoever to
use any other Microsoft Technology but
they want to take advantage of the
strengths of azure all right next to
talk about is web apps whether it's a
really popular way of using Azure
because they're so simple they're simple
and they're they're very um very
inexpensive web maps of course the
Microsoft web technology is asp.net and
asp.net core just was just released we
saw a few sessions on that and that's
fully supported runs on top of IAS but
is is a very powerful tool and it will
support running java applications it'll
support running node applications it'll
support wearing python or PHP
applications so all those things are
available to you if you wanted to write
your own node application and deploy it
to Azure you can do so and if you wanted
to take advantage of some of the things
that are built on top of these other
platforms in languages like wordpress or
drupal that are built in PHP those are
fully supported and there are templates
to make that easy so if you want to go
in and select for example a joomla site
zoom lie believe is built with PHP and
it has my sequel on the back end there's
no técnicas know Microsoft Technology
and that at all but there's a template
inside of azure and there's a wizard
that'll just walk you through creating
that
for nodejs you can create a an empty
nodejs if your permission with no they
probably want to do that write your code
and then deploy it it'll take care of
importing any packages automatically for
you but it's also a starter site so if
you're new to node it's a really nice
way to get started with this nodejs
starter site or even if you just like
the way they've done the starter site
you want to use that as your own started
to save you a bit of the plumbing that's
available as well so let me show you a
quick demo of some other languages that
are supported in Azure I have created a
web app here called demo multilang and
if I browse to this you'll see that I've
got some links here to some asp.net
sites in classic a classic ASP is
actually still supported on Azure and
but here's is anode side right here
that's running some node here's a Python
site here and this PHP side were at work
yesterday but I rather just a few
minutes ago and it didn't work i'm not
sure why it's not working today but the
source code for these are all written in
various languages so i have here we go
right here this is the node code right
here does a very simple node application
because see it's running JavaScript on
the server it's fully functional inside
advisor I didn't have to really do
anything special to make this work
here's the Python code I don't even I've
never written a line of Python my life
but I can see that here we're just
yielding out the message hello world in
Python and here's the PHP code right
here which again I'm a novice as far as
PHP is concerned but I can see that it's
here and it's just echoing out a hello
world and so the language itself is
supported on Azure if you want to
configure that
in the portal we have under application
settings we can turn this on or turn it
off we set the versions of python that
we want to use it's all set here under
application settings and right here this
is where we set the dotnet framework
version but you also have the OS
probably problem is is my PHP version is
off and set that right there job I've
got turned off because I'm not running
that I want to save some resources
Python is version 3.4 then maybe
breaking changes between these two
versions so I might want to fiddle with
that and I don't think they they were no
no just works out of the box so it's all
available in here also also I can do
this if I want to create a new
application that's pre built using
something like WordPress so WordPress is
built with PHP and my sequel to popular
open source technologies but it's fully
supported on Azure so if I say new web
and mobile right here are some popular
thing as the web app and API a button I
got to cover those today but I can click
on see all and in here I actually have a
template for wordpress and I select that
it'll actually walk me through creating
a wordpress application so in here I can
give it a name DG test Oh 804 I like WP
for WordPress in my research group I put
them all in the same resource group
makes it easier for me the bandage later
on DG test Oh 803 my sequel database I
think I have one created i cant rember
if not i can create one here looks like
i don't have one created so i have to go
in here at DG test Oh 803 mysql i'll
name it and i've got error here why do I
have an error i have your database name
is a reserved word include it i'll kept
put the word my sequel in there so
I didn't know and Brazil seems like an
odd place to put it up with some where
each stage is five
and click on create please fix the
errors oh I didn't scroll down on out
there a couple of questions down here oh
I have to say I accept this make sure
you read the end user license saying
thoroughly before you select agree to it
they did this so oh here we go this is
the is a free version and there's the
350 per month so I must have used my
free version already so i'm not going to
select this here i don't want to pay
even 350 some kind of cheap that's even
for me that's too much to pay but you do
get a free version of my sequel what
some people will do is they will instead
of installing on my sequel don't stall
it on sequel server and there is a tool
that's because project nerea or
something like that that basically
changes the data layer of wordpress the
point of sequel server because sequel
server on azor has more scalable options
so some people do that as well if i go
through here and accept these legal
terms then it'll create a wordpress site
for me i'll fire it up and then it'll
ask me questions about what's the style
of your wordpress what's the title of it
what things like that things that are
just automatic for wordpress wordpress
is great because you can hand it off to
your Aunt Mary who wants you to build a
website for her flower shop and then she
won't be calling you all the time
because you can use WordPress and
configure without knowing a lot of HTML
or JavaScript or coding of any kind okay
these are some great technologies for
web applications let's go back here
automated deployments so if you're
working with open-source technology
chances are you running to get and get
up there the deployment tools that are
the source control repository that our
most popular for open source
technologies and Microsoft is migrating
a lot of our open source technologies on
to github plus we're integrating git and
github into our deployment processes and
so if you're using it to store your get
or github to store your source code
getting that to deploy to Azure is very
simple when you create a new application
you have the option to tie that wire
that up to any source control you want
the whatever we don't all right any
source control you want so supported our
visual studio team services this is the
online version of TFS that's Microsoft's
source control repository or in fact is
the microsoft entire application like
cycle management tool and that's of
course supported if you want to use that
that's great go ahead and feel free to
use it but if you wanted to use any one
of these other ones onedrive local git
repository github bitbucket even Dropbox
not sure who would use Dropbox for
source control repository but it's
supported there and you can do it and
there's a click external that you have
some more configuration options so I've
already done that i have an application
that i'll show you how to automatically
deploy from gift in this application
close that close that close that
so in fact if I go let me really quickly
go to an application I showed you
earlier for this one right here if this
one isn't tied to any source control at
all I it's a really simple application i
just copied some files up via ftp but if
i wanted to do automated deployment i
can tie that to a source control
repository right here under publishing
deployment source you can see the
options that are available right here
right here right here and so I've done
that already with this application right
called demo as your deploy and if you
look at this one I'll bring it up in the
browser it's a web app this one happens
to be built with asp.net but it's not
really using a whole lot from the
asp.net and if i look at my demo as
you're deployed if I open this up I've
initialized to get repository where this
is stored so I can make changes to it
and automatically publish those changes
to Azure simply by pushing those changes
it get so when here here's my page it's
just got one page in it get an azure are
awesome and so is Sydney how about that
save that there is my major change and
if I open up a command prompt and go to
that right there then I could do get and
dot what does it get commit Sydney demo
about that I don't have to spell it
right but I probably should demo right
oh I'm sorry damn right you get people
in the audience did I do it whether i'll
git commit dash M what'd I miss I
spelled it wrong okay thank you all
right and then it's always a git push
origin master I'm do this Y else to do
it have to do it get in it and tie it up
to the repository about my repository is
just the files on Azure and so it knows
that when I push the origin master
master it'll automatically push to my
Asher account so I only change one file
shouldn't take very long as long a bill
that can connect
here we go
ordinarily actually the real word he
probably would not push to master you'd
probably have a staging slot and as
you're fully supports that's not really
part of this talk but you could set up
as many deployments thoughts as you want
so if you wanted to deploy to a staging
slot do some testing make sure it's okay
and then from there manually push the
production that's what most
organizations i think would do but in
this case for demo purposes we're going
to push it directly to production there
we go and we're done and if i open up in
the browser i should see my change
automatically displayed
yeah all right and this is I'll show you
another nice feature of azure is that
when you do this then you can look at
the deployments in Azure and see the
deployment history so down here we're
publishing deployment source diploma
credentials I have where am I here does
evolution sittings
they're the publishing I think not
source idiots here
yeah here we go so here I see this is
the the deployment made the city demo
that's my recent push to production but
if I want to roll that back you can very
quickly click this and redeploy and say
redeploy and in a matter of seconds
it'll just automatically roll back
changes so really really fast changes
and that'll work exactly the same where
they're using github or visuals to your
team systems or bitbucket or codeplex
all those are supported right out of the
box so we're in here I should have see
some of these things that that world
might changes back to where they were
about 10 minutes ago should have been if
i clicked it right ctrl f5 did I not do
it right here samples change so I didn't
do it right click here this is the cliq
redeploy I probably hit yes is why and
redeployment in progress takes a few
seconds and once that's done
and I should be able to see my refresh
this page and I should see them I
changes or roll back their go so I think
it's so you'll see that there's some you
can you can do this manual like I did or
you could tie it into your continuous
integration scripts and it'll work just
as well what else the SDKs so there are
a lot of SDKs that are available on
Azure essentially what a sure the way
that a juror is managed is there are
rest ap is that are available for just
about everything and asher so if you
want to create a new virtual machine you
can call a REST API and you can do that
you write your own code it'll be just
HTTP code sending up some JSON if you
wanted to store something in Azure
storage the same thing uses REST API but
a lot of people don't like working with
rest and so Microsoft has built these
SDKs these tools these libraries to make
it easier first ones they build of
course we're for.net so if you want to
write C sharp do some of this stuff that
was really nice but then they went and
built some for other languages as well
if you go in here you will see that
there are SDKs for ya Media Services
that's something i want to see down here
they're SDKs for java their SDKs for
Ruby my hero and source framework its
licensing the wrong spot here's some
there's a ruby SDK this in PowerShell
SDKs there was some for xamarin some for
java here and all sorts of some of these
are libraries some of them are sample
codes and they're all available I
thought there was some of this as well
web jobs all the rest I think these are
sample applications that that you can do
here we go this way I was looking for I
didn't scroll down far enough so here's
the SDK specifically designed for a job
all these things here so if you're a
Java developer and you want to work with
as you want to automate things that's
all available in here you're working
with javascript or nodejs here's some
tools for doing that if you're working
with Python there are two
here for doing it Ruby every time I come
back to their there longer and water I
don't number two golang being here
before but there it is there's SDKs
available for go like under the hood all
these things are doing is they're just
calling rest services because rest is
cross-platform anything any platform in
a language that could speak HTTP and
send receive text can make a rest call
and so these are available for making it
easier to interact with Asher from all
these other different languages these
right here these a lot of these are
utilities and sample applications there
are a lot of them these are published by
the azure team and so if you look down
here there are 14 pages of them and it
looks like there's what about 20 per
page so this list also is growing really
well this is part of Microsoft's
commitment to get more involved with the
open source community and share our
software with other folks so there's
that this is the github com / address
when I just showed you this is the azure
teams github repository posit Ori and
encourage you to take a look at that as
well many of those are written in C
sharp but there's still open source
software you can use them you can even
make pull request if you wanted to
contribute to that read the fine print
on there and you can make a pull request
yourself you want do a bug affects bug
fix it's available to you next one talk
about mobile apps mobile apps are a tool
for building back in data stores for
your mobile phone applications so if you
have a mobile application you want to
share information between all the users
of your application let's say you have a
game and you want to make sure that ever
you know every time I get the high score
that everybody in the world knows that I
got the high score or maybe you have a
business application when the salesman
enters an order on their phone you want
that order to appear in on the tablet
that's out of the production floor so
they can fulfill that order well one
probably the simplest way to do that is
to store that data in the cloud have
everybody access that through the cloud
and that's what as your mobile apps does
is it's a simple way there's a menu for
doing it to create a rest webservice
that exposes back-end data store stored
in Azure and because it's a rest service
and because rest is HTTP and JS
and those are standards we can then call
that from any platform the one we can
call it from an Android application or
from an iOS application or from a Java
or Ruby or Python application those are
all available to us here's a quick
drawing edit of the mobile architecture
here I got one phone I've got some data
out in the clouds somewhere and I expose
that through a web service through a
REST API then I can read and write that
data through this API I don't have to
talk to the database directly the
database calls of course there they tend
to be proprietary rest is open I can
call that they get responses back and
HTTPS of real rich which responds a
messaging system where they can say you
know tables not found be a 401 error
unauthorized to login be a 404 not found
40 won't be authorized things like that
there's a speck and server error 500 and
something with the air and then I can
share that data among other users as
well they don't have to be windows users
they can be iPhone iPad Android Java
Script whatever platform that can speak
to this web service it can do that what
mobile apps does is it makes it easier
to create these rest api sneeze back-end
databases so let me show you how you do
this i'll go into my azure portal here
and i'll say new
whether mobile and mobile app right here
mayor I'll give it a name I'll call this
one DG test Oh 804 na for mobile app put
this in my new social group DG test Oh
803 RG that's why they're put it in the
u.s. East even though I'm nowhere near
there right now give it a second deploy
this no more than a second but not more
than a minute it'll create a new web
service or a new web application that i
could add web services to now a lot of
the code that this does you could write
yourself you could create a web
application and you could create a put a
web service on it and you could add
security to it and you could tie that to
a back-end database and write and grab
JSON and turn into sequel statements but
it's done for you this is stuff that
lots of users have to do is plumbing
code your time is probably better off
spent doing something else so I've done
this here I've created this application
and let me go down here rabbits I called
it DG test Oh 804 search for
app services
did you just oh you look at there is
mobile app right there I can come in
here and there's some nice tools to get
this up running on a hurry so if you
want to use create the simplest way to
do it is there is a quick start down
here which will create a sample table
and I would recommend it is the first
time you use it to start doing that so
in my quick start right here I'll say
grab that come on guys to some room down
front here
right here um what I select here is
going to tell me is it what at some
point in this is going to actually
generate some client-side color this
will be the code that's used to call the
mobile applications call the web service
whichever when I pick the web service
itself will be the same the only
difference is how was that client side
code generated so I'm going to grab one
I'll just do a c-sharp on here because
those are the tools that I have on my
laptop here I can connect to a database
I can use an existing database or i can
create a brand new one so i'll add a
data connection and i will connect to a
sequel database i won't i won't have
until use an existing database i'll grab
this one right here okay select that and
my contraction string out to tell it
credentials to login they're just about
their own
ok
looks like I spelled it right click ok
and this will connect it back to a
database here and in a few seconds I
should see my data connection up here in
this area this is ten percent Felipa
that it jumps to ninety percent complete
so it's just the crazy time that we use
in here at Microsoft and from here I'll
create a table API actually have a
choice I can write that in c-sharp if i
use brighton c-sharp it uses a tool
called web api to write it but because
this is an open source talk i'm gonna
write it no Jas and I will acknowledge
that i'm going to overwrite this so if i
had done this before if I did this demo
twice in a row it would overwrite any
code any change that I did and then
right here I can create a sample table
it's a to-do item table so it's a list
of things to do it'll have an ID it'll
have a task you know to do fly to
Australia and I didn't flag a boolean
flag is complete true or false so the
real simple table that will expose as a
rest webservice and what would I say to
expose we're going to expose the basic
crud operations to create read update
delete there'll be different methods to
do that and rest if you don't work with
recipe for rest actually works with HTTP
verbs and verbs you probably work with
the get verbs before whenever you click
a hyperlink a request gets sent to the
server with the get verb and usually
when you fill out a form online or
request get set to a URL on the server
with the post verb and whatever data
isn't that farm gets sent along with it
but there are other verbs as well that
you might not be familiar with there's a
put and a passion and delete verb and by
default with rest those are mapped to
the crud operations so whenever we post
data then by convention we expect that
we will be creating some data on the
back end if we get so we set up with a
get verb we expect that we'll be
receiving day we're reading day to the
back end and the delete verb of course
will be for deleting data put verb will
be updating data
so that's what we're gonna do we have
one URL and will change without
functionality via whatever the the verb
is we're sent to that so in down here we
can so now we've got a web service
connecting to a back-end database we
have a table in that day two days and if
we want to actually call that the code
to do that is right here i selected
c-sharp originally she's going to show
me some C sharp code and there's
actually a library here to make it
easier you could write rest code to
create HTTP objects and send data post
data or put data or get data to that end
point or use this library the library
has things like a mobile service client
and in the constructor we pass it the
URL of our end point so I called a DG
test Oh 804 mas as your website's net
and then every table then they can use
that to send data so here's a class a
to-do item class with an ID a text and a
complete and I can just new up one of
these things and send it this mobile
service that i create up here has a get
table i can pass in my model which is
right here and has methods like insert a
sync and update a sing and delete a sync
and if I just pass in some data it'll
send that to the server and do inserts
and updates and deletes and you notice I
didn't actually go in there and tell it
what the columns were in the table the
by default as your mobile is smart
enough that it says if it sees these
columns ID text and complete it will
look in the table and it will match them
in this case if I did it insert it will
look for it'll insert whatever this
value is in the ID column it'll insert
whether the text is in the text column
and let's remember the value of complete
is in the complete call and if it
doesn't find that column it'll create it
so it'll actually dynamically update
your schema so you can copy and paste
this code in your application or if you
want to leave it easier click create new
up and just download it'll give you that
application for you it'll right all the
c-sharp code in this case
and let's open that up and it's a zip
file saw I'll extract it to the folder I
have called test c backslash test right
here and open this up and it's saying
this came from the internet do you trust
it and I'm like yes I trusting it or not
it's full of kittens that's not the
trust
so let me really quickly build the sea
and I was like to build any dotnet
practice that I download because
sometimes there are new get packages
that have to be updated but while that's
building i think I'm go over here and
look at Omega can't there we go and look
at that code so in here you'll see code
that I showed you earlier for example
here is this is the startup code for a
Windows application this is a universal
Windows platform application and did I
get arizona bill that is that the
squiggly lines over there for a reason
but you can see right here right right
here that here I'm instantiating this
library is mobile service client just
coming in through a new get package and
it's telling it what's the endpoint DG
test 08 04 ma dot as your website sign
up that's the rest service that i'm
going to call and then i have in my in
here i can take that that object that
mobile saw a shadow called get tables
and pass in a to-do item and i'll look
at the to-do item this is my model an ID
some text some complete is complete true
or false and once I have this this to do
table then that has methods to do things
like insert a sink or I can use a link
in this case to do a get and filter it
so if I just call to do table that will
return all the rows in the table if I
add this lambda here dot where this will
return only the ones where complete
equals false and we'll still have doc
here there's an update a sink this
example doesn't have an option to delete
but you can imagine what the name of
that is of course it's dad delete a sink
and that's there as well so these things
are all available here and there are
there similar libraries for iphone &amp;amp; 4
cordova and for android fact there's one
for swift and for objective sweet see
oh you know I see what I do around I'm
trying to deploy to a phone here let me
actually deploy to my computer let's try
that a local machine it's trying to
launch an emulator they don't have
so here we go there's a way of adding
new items the list down over here it'll
refresh the list Ne eyes of course they
had tables empty right now would just
created it but my first thing on my
to-do list I'll wake up and
automatically upgrade i guess i did that
i was playing with yesterday so there's
a table there with a couple of tests in
it i'll say wake up get out of bed there
we go and as it is a there's a guy from
the UK here you know what the luck text
line is it is drag a comb across my head
which is a line from a band called The
Beatles and you guys that aren't old
enough to know who the Beatles are they
were a band that Paul McCartney was that
and if you're not old enough to who Paul
McCartney is he is the guy that Kanye
West sanguine so i can update it right
here and change it from true to false
because that's filtered as it's coming
down let me get rid of these two here i
don't care about those i gotta refresh
it but there's an auto refreshing on in
here and if you don't know who kanye
west is he's married to kim kardashian
and if you don't know kim kardashian is
she's the one who's stepfather is
turning into a woman so no matter how
old you are you should know somebody on
that list so this is all happening here
just it's the libraries are just making
this rest call and because the rest call
you can call from anywhere and I only
did in dotnet because that's the tools
that I happened to have it's easier for
me to show you that but let me show you
if I went back in here and said you know
I don't do windows let's do I OS let's
do swift code here and we don't have to
connect your database anymore we've
already got that we don't have to create
the table you already got that let's
just download an iOS app right here I
don't have any of the tools from editing
in this but I can there just txt file so
let's grab them oh do I need to their
therapist okay
and again it's just going to open this
thing up and I'll unzip it too I like to
put everything in my test folder
anybody here an iOS developer ok we're
going to i think the code booze and let
me see based project assets like a model
ID i think it's in here story where now
grab this here i'll tell you what let me
let me do it android i look android
yesterday to jump right out at me so I
grab this here download an Android
application if you dig through that if
you open it that up in whatever your
favorite iOS said of your Swift editor
is then you start looking at the code
and modifying it in here this is an
Android application question to do it
extract all and this will be some Java
code that does exactly the same thing
cause those same web services here's the
source code main job example right there
there we go so in here if I open this up
see if that I think that open on Visual
Studio code what's going to ask me yeah
let's open in Visual Studio code
and if I scroll down here I think you'll
see things like here we go here's my
mobile service client right here being
declared there's my table being declared
and down below its going to get
instantiated and the code looks really
similar because this is also a library
that's built specifically for Java that
abstract away those calls to the rest
services and makes it easy for you to
make right Android applications and call
them from and use them to call these
back-end services so right here you know
I'm not a Java guy but I can read this
look is a new mobile service clan up in
the constructor I'm passing in the URL
of the web service endpoint and once I
have this M client here then I can do
something like get table and pass in my
model right here the to-do item so
somewhere else that should write them as
define and then now this M to do table
should have things to do update and
delete and inserts and so on so into
there we go right control f into do
table a betta far there you go this
introduce table that update so again it
makes it very easy this code was all
generated for me by as your mobile apps
and so this would be if I was writing my
first android app this is where I would
start because not only do I not I might
not know about the services but I don't
even know Java code that well now of
course you're not going to write a
application has a to-do table you're
gonna write your own application so
you'll change your model to be customers
or game scores or whatever it is that
you're a business application does but
the same code this this is a really good
guideline you can either take and modify
this application or you can use it as
guidance when you create your own
application and that frees you from
having to write all that code that it
calls the West service sends JSON to it
grabs the JSON on the on the backend
turns it into a sequel statement you can
declaratively do a Content occation on
here all sorts of things you can even do
a automatic authentication or automatic
single sign-on sending users to either
Twitter or Facebook so if you want to a
single sign-on you're not limited to
active directory and windows live
accounts you can also automate to have
them authenticate through google or
facebook or twitter and as your mobile
apps fully supports that
alright um what else do we have here
I've already been here before why am I
going back as your mobile apps there's a
good time for a quick review Mughal
architecture blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah there we go demo um so
you can do this there's also push
notifications as reported Google and
Apple and Microsoft they all have
services through push notifications down
to the client so if you want to send a
message to your Android device or to
your iPhone device then they're api's
for do that and there are tools inside
up as your mobile apps that will support
that so a lot of things that are
available even if you're building
Android and iPhone apps that you can
still take advantage of Asia and store
your back-end data imager for automating
for DevOps things you want to automated
deployments or managing of resources
there are again there are rest tools for
doing that automatically you could write
rest code for do that most people don't
most people would write scripts through
something like powershell PowerShell has
been available for a long time and the
Azure PowerShell command let's were
released with wenwen Asia was first
released and so since as it was first
introduced that was the recommended way
of managing Azure at least in a large
organization write some PowerShell
scripts and then run those as you see
fit powershell is great it's a lot
easier to work with that than it is to X
to make rest calls but it has one
disadvantage powershell will only run on
windows so if you're doing all of your
management from a mac or from a linux
machine PowerShell won't work however
there is something that will work there
is the CLI tools and the CLI CLI tools
the command the line in interface
lincoln's called those are available for
mac and for linux and for windows so you
can download them all there are three
different versions and go right here and
download them and they have a whole set
of commands that they do the same thing
the PowerShell commands they wrap these
rest calls and in there you can
automatically create a virtual machine
you guys add them to virtual networks
you can set security deployment you do
auto scaling pretty much anything you
could do through the portal and some
things you can
through the portal are available through
these command-line interface and you can
see some examples of the sin tax here
it's full documentation on here as to
what you can do I have it installed the
windows version installed here so if I
just go in here and just type asier it
brings it up and one of the last
examples really good ascii art is
available there that's a lost art I
think but in here you can do things like
as your account list and see whatever as
your accounts that have registered on
here I don't think I've got any
registered in here yet but as your
account I don't have to memorize real
well but um options option account dash
H will always tell you what the options
are from here you can add an account and
once you have an account then you can
start doing things like creating virtual
machines creating virtual networks
deploying web applications and doing all
your configuration here store them in
text files and you can run and you run
them through bash scripts on your linux
box that's really the advantage of this
here is power cells still fully
supported and if your environment is all
windows I'd recommend you stick with
that but if you're managing it through
some windows boxes and some linux boxes
or all the NEX boxes CLI is the way to
go all right oh and one nice to hear i
mentioned the virtual machines before
there is a whole community creating
virtual machines for azure templates for
virtual machines for azure so you're not
limited to buy just the VMS that
Microsoft has created here at vm depot
vm depot ms open techcom there is a
whole I mean there are hundreds of
virtual it's we have 300 pages of
virtual machines that are listed here
different flavors of Linux different
applications installed on them different
versions of software installed on them
and for each one of these the deployment
script is written in c li so right here
I'll tell it I want to install it to
eastern US and this is the script for
this as your vm create DNS prefix blah
blah blah blah you want to replace the
username and password with your username
a password but other than that
everything else should be the same you
can grab that and run that in Azure to
create a new virtual machine do the
devil already okay um couple of things
i'll just mention if you anybody you're
doing big data you are of course so you
work with dubai bad so Hadoop is an open
source project and it's very popular in
the big data world's fully support of
the Lazar has been since day one and
it's tools like pig and hive the tools
that people that work with big data are
used to using they're all available on
Microsoft Azure so rather than create
recreating the world with our big data
solution we built it on top of
open-source tools that are already
available people are already familiar
with anybody doing machine learning a
little bit all right machine learning if
you wanna get machine learning on your
resume you'll double your salary
tomorrow it's it's a hot field right now
it is there are tools and machine
learning that make it a lot easier it
used to be that right a lot of code to
do machine learning and now there's a
graphical interface inside of Microsoft
Azure that takes care of again the
plumbing that you have to do so rather
than writing a lot of code to say here's
where my data is and here's I want to
filter it and do some declarative things
you can drag and drop and set some
properties and that makes it a lot
easier to get it either if you're new to
machine learning it makes it easier to
to get a new project started up but even
if you're if you're no machine learning
well it just takes care of a lot of the
repetitive stuff that you're better off
just letting it take care of and then
you can write custom code to do the
things that are specific to your project
and that custom code is written in
either are or Python so those are the
languages are supported inside of azure
machine learning tools and then once
you've created one there then you can
deploy it as a web service once you
deploy what a service then it's
available to any platform at all so your
iPhone can call on or your java
applications could call it doesn't have
to be a Microsoft platform so all kinds
of open source and compete technologies
available in Azure machine
learning these are some tools that are
really popular in the linux world
they're starting to come to windows as
well docker is a big one docker is the
as a platform that supports containers
and containers have been huge in the
windows were in the linux world they're
just starting to come to to windows with
Windows Server 2016 the next version of
Windows but even even before they came
to Windows doctor was available on
Hatteras if you wanted to have
lightweight containers instead of
virtual machines you package them up
using docker on on Microsoft Azure and
chef is on a management tool that's
really popular Linux world that's also
fully supported on Azure as well if I
haven't mentioned anything that doesn't
mean it's not there there are a lot of
things the things that I mentioned are
mostly the things that are available
from directly from Microsoft but there's
a lot of things that are in a sure that
are produced by third parties and I
would encourage you to look at the
market Microsoft marketplace so for
example if you wanted to do a raven
database I saw Raven was out there they
have their databases of service there's
Mongo as a service there is things like
twilio if you want to do text automated
voice response or texting things like
that there are all kinds of services
available to Azure marketplace and they
are they're supported on address they
want on Azure so even though they're
being built by somebody else they still
could take advantage of the scalability
and reliability that as your offers now
when you do this I would encourage you
to look at the pricing just look at the
fine print because sometimes there's the
cost is very different and sometimes you
may be in a program where you think
you're getting free stuff and the free
stuff tends to be just the microsoft
stuff so if you're using some
third-party things in the mic and like
like my sequel for example you might not
that you might have to pay three dollars
a month for that it just just
double-check and read the fine print
it's different for everything but but
but still it's still you know backed by
these companies that are you know Oracle
is backing you these are big companies
are back yet and it's deployed on
Microsoft hardware so it's a really nice
solution for whatever you do I hope
don't over time I think we're just about
through it here with about three minutes
left I hope what made my message clear
here which is that this is really part
of the new microsoft six or seven years
ago this would have been unthinkable to
say here we have a Microsoft platform
that supports all of this open source
technology that supports all this
compete technology that supports some
and that we've got teams that are
actually pushing software out into the
open source world this is just one piece
of it Microsoft is becoming a much more
open company we're doing things like
open sourcing our languages we're open
sourcing asp net we're accepting pull
request from the community and as you're
just a part of that here the days when
microsoft was one a monolithic company
that would kind of push out software
every three years with little input from
the users those are gone this is a very
good time to be looking at Microsoft
even if you're not using our
technologies there's still something in
here for you I hope that's the message
that you've got friends that's what I'm
trying to tell you if you want to get
more information my first slide had my
blog on it that's my name David gr com
there's a 30 day trial on as you can
sign for Asher com the second link here
is Microsoft Virtual Academy there are
dozens of courses on Azure you can look
at their the last link is the slides
that you just saw here and this one
right here this is a blog post that I
wrote a while ago which has a lot of the
content that's in this and I'll bring
them up with it quickly giard ma WM
that's Microsoft Azure without Microsoft
and on here this is I've articulated a
lot of the thoughts that I've given you
today and here and listen to them so
without the dentals it's about two
minutes left i'm going to say thank you
very much but i will stick around for
any questions thanks a lot for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
