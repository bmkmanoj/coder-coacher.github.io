a talk that is replacing Simon Jaeger
Starkey does apologize
you can't turn up and enlighten you what
about stuff that I don't know anything
about so I'm going to talk about
security and this is me I'm a managing
consultant in Capgemini in Stavanger in
Norway MVP for the last seven or eight
years either is lots of things normally
in this slide I have likes whisky a lot
if you're buying and it's hidden for
good reasons today
now you can tweeting it at Merrigan I
have an email address sometimes visit my
company because they let me out and if
you're a bit masochistic just like visit
my website for weird stuff right
security is hard often questions the
audience right there would be a quiz you
didn't know it tough I like you you
laugh why is security hard Jesus Christ
on raise Algeria raise your hand the
ones I'm guessing that you guys don't
know why security is hard that's why
you're in this talk and you're like God
Christ Niall it's my talk come on
ok security is hard because all I have
to do is find one single mistake you
have to figure out all the different
attack vectors that I can use and I only
have to find the single one that you
forgot and it's really easy to do now
this is probably my favorite photo to
explain security of all things because
it just illustrates you know that guy
that poor elk probably made one single
mistake and I will Scott it's nice piece
of lunch now I like taking the make of
Io out of IOT mainly because IOT is hard
to spell but also because it is the
brand new tech in internet terms it's
only like six eight months old maybe a
bit more but it has like two other
things big data and machine learning
which perform an amazing triad a
buzzword bingo so if you mention all of
these three things people usually go
bingo now the thing what I want to show
you is that IOT is evolving and I try to
explain IOT to people and people like my
mom now my mom is in her 60s and she's
sitting down in a house in our house in
Ireland she has a glass of wine in front
of her I'm sitting officer not a glass
and she just casually in but
Queen telling me who died goes I don't
know Irish mommies do this the first
thing they do is when you pick up the
phone you'll never guess who dies hello
to you too so I'm there and she goes
now what IOT why so your dad wants to
buy a smart TV oh okay fine so he wants
to watch netflix on inside living room
that's fine well an IO and she goes I
said it's fine it don't worry about it
it's just a TV that's connects to the
Internet just but seriously I've heard
so much about IOT what is IOT I said are
you really sure you want to know you
know I can't stop once I start she goes
ok hit it with me said IOT is connecting
different devices the internet that are
normally not connected such as a fridge
and she goes why on earth would you want
to connect a fridge to the Internet
I said reasons no I said seriously you
imagine you're there you're standing up
you look inside the fridge you can't
find the butter but the fridge tells you
where it is
it's brilliant imagine ality it says it
knows what's in the fridge so it can
tell you what you can make or you
realize you don't have butter and you
want to send a message to your father
and who will not read it and not bring
home the butter because your fridge
senton it doesn't he doesn't understand
why your fridge is sending him an SMS
because well I suppose it's kind of ok
yeah that would make sense I said but
man these devices share data she goes ok
and I said I'm Majan you had an
internet-connected toyless and she goes
oh gosh I don't like where this is going
don't I said imagine when you flush it
figures out what you need to eat and
then your fridge goes and orders us all
right and she goes oh sweet Jesus that's
horrible I said that's why the
Internet's made of tubes anyway so she
was like ok this makes no sense I think
but this sounds really clever and people
are doing this and I said yes they're
connecting IOT to everything and then I
said I think that this is what will
see in the future you know you need to
reboot your fridge to use the latest API
okay because we are programmers and this
would make sense now I thought what is
the most insane thing I've ever seen
that has attracted funding for being an
IOT device and I you know after seeing
troy's talk I had to take out a ton of
things because I was going to reuse them
and you know it's a bit early in the day
for that so I came up with this this is
a mattress it is a smart mattress cover
it was funded to the tune of 1.2 million
dollars you have to recharge your
mattress before you can sleep okay now
the thing is what is the business
proposal for us mattress it's this this
mattress sends an alert to your mobile
phone whenever somebody is using it your
bed in a questionable way think about
this little Timmy's bouncing on the bed
Timmy get off the bed wife's bouncing on
the bed not too sure about that
you know if that is if this is how
you're going to fix things you may not
need ass mattress you might need a
lawyer it really is a case of shut up
and take my money now if you ever ever
wondered how to find ass mastress on the
Internet by not going to Kickstarter you
can use a search engine known as a
showdown showdown is a search engine for
the Internet of Things how long do you
think it takes to scan the internet for
an open port all four billion IP
addresses how long do you think would
take seconds that's a really nice vague
answer try again
any mouths minutes two and a half
minutes on 10 gigabits switches to scan
the entire Internet all right to figure
out if something go down now that if
you've ever done if you work with like
AWS Amazon all the way spin up VMs think
about you have two and a half minutes
before someone will scan it to figure
out what its vulnerable for all right
now if you ever thought about trying to
scan the internet what would you go
looking for so I'm Irish
so the first
I went looking for was beer and I found
this this is a brewery in Boston now if
you look at the top it says five
thousand nine hundred that's the port
number it scanned and took a picture of
what runs on toward 5900 it says wood
underneath does anyone know what port
5900 is all people in the audience mice
it's called VNC virtual network
computing it's remote desktop before
remote desktop was baked into Windows
now the thing is a lot of people still
reinstall VNC as a support tool but they
forget that usernames and passwords so
they don't they don't enable that
because passwords are hard so this is
enabled and out in the Internet right so
after finding beer I got a bit hungry I
thought I'd go look for a kebab right so
I found a kebab shop in Spain now the
thing was I paid 735 for something I
don't know what I was going to eat but
then I thought I need to get home so I
thought I'd get a bike problem was the
bike wasn't too good after a few drinks
in the kebab so I get a bus the bus
broke down so then I had to go get a
taxi I eventually found my way to a my
Yas now this is where in the talk I
figure out what side of good and evil
you're on okay three o'clock in the
morning you've drank a little bit you've
had your kebab you're home and you find
a businessman Yas on the Internet you
can control specifically the alarm
button do you a quietly close the laptop
go to bed think nice thoughts or be
figure out if there is something close
to you by pressing your arm button a one
person you are the two people okay
you're not good enough to Hydra I'll
show you 10 minutes and be all the
rescue thank you for restoring my faith
in humanity you're all lunatics if
you're going to do this hide yourself
behind the VPN otherwise they'll track
you anyway so you have now woken up a
businessman at 3 o'clock in the morning
and he's a bit annoyed or businesswoman
however so they decide they're going to
get a massage
and this is a hydromassage system now
can do you notice what I noticed the
first time round there's a control for
pressure this is also unauthenticated M
is right now imagine you're inside and
you're getting your nice massage and
some 15-year old lunatic all of you find
this we all know that you're not going
to go up close this it'll be fine
you're all going to be going and there's
God that guy is going to have a
colonoscopy or he's going to be very
clean on the inside so how do we fix
this we talk to this lady the internet
which anyway I love it as you can see
the people like oh look there's
something on the screen now I thought
okay no this is life-threatening and
dangerous but I thought I'd go show you
what else I found I found this it is a
composter you can do kind of remind them
things with it but this really isn't
lethal how about this this is a pool
control system do you notice the two
giant barrels of chlorine and acid that
you can control from the internet
without any authentication do you think
this is a good thing maybe not so I
found this as well and if you're
wondering what this is this is brand new
found today does anyone want to take a
guess of what this is it's a fire
suppression system I kid you not that
you can log into and literally start
spraying people it wouldn't that be fun
don't do it
okay I all you B people there's two
people mark Simon and you are very
pleasant you won't do anything but now
this is another German control system I
have no idea it looks very efficient
very German but I found this in the
Netherlands it allows you to drop 1.7
tons of animal feed down a tube if you
want to you can do this which has lots
of buttons this is where I kind of tell
you that all engineers are nuts
they start putting lots of recreation of
buttons on screen now we have this this
is from Estonia it's silos now when I
first saw this I wasn't too sure if it
was a really good Russian toy of hiding
the ICBMs okay I honestly think it's
actually grain silos but I had to
two or three times to be sure because
you never know they could be hiding us
this one is something pump Ã¤j-- I don't
know
I found a Bernie thing and swirly thing
again online you can play with you can
have this Bernie thing it's written in
Polish I think and I found this one in
Sweden
all right again on Contenta cated you
can join in play with it do whatever you
want nice and big and Bernie and then I
found this which is my one of my
favorite images because this is a
control effect a control panel for a
factory so there you are you're sitting
on your front lawn they fire up the
smokestack and there's smoke coming
across your lawn and you go screw it I'm
going to turn off the factory next door
because who else would need to do that
so I found this and I kind of was like
putting this in because it had a thing
like an acid pump and a caustic pump and
I didn't know what to do is this is
probably one of the most beautiful
design screens I've seen I don't know
what it is but it looks lovely and this
is a little bit terrifying this is a
sawmill control panel in Finland running
on Windows XP now you can go in and
remote control a Finnish sawmill if you
so wish I don't recommend you do it the
Finns get very annoyed when you do these
type of things all right
this one is designed by engineers so
first thing I that I notice the MSN
Messenger logo right here okay there's a
hazard symbol there's a bumper collar
don't know what that is and it connects
this is a eyes eye sauce nuclear control
panel it's actually a control panel for
a home heating system
I think but again these are all online
no authentication you can remote connect
to any of them without being stopped all
you need to do is go look on show down
for port 5900 and you will find most of
these okay very simple the question is
why are we doing this why are we doing
this because people think that passwords
are hard people think that security is
are people also put in requirements that
it will be allowed to access
without a password don't do that
now when I say GC C james van der beek
crying a little bit it makes me a little
bit happy because he was part of this
train wreck and I like to put in a small
breather point for me sucking a glass of
water and this is where I honestly think
that CSI cyber is it's perfect
highlights Cupid
we need audio please the first five
devices are clean now if moms comes back
the same way we struck out it - oh
there's no way so there is malware how
do they find malware it turned red so
ladies and gentlemen if you want to hide
your coat light and green boss next
point if we take what the code that it
popped up at the ends I honestly I
didn't know what it was this is where my
wife usually gives out to me because as
you've seen I am you've seen the latest
Bourne movie there's a line that we're
going to hack the database with sequels
okay and this is like first three
minutes in the movie and sitting down
nice life there snappy out and I go oh
and she was if you start I'm turning it
off put go I just suffer inside this I'm
fairly sure that's how doctors and
nurses think through Grey's Anatomy and
and house and things but anyway so every
so often after finding all these
different controls as soon as you find
people doing wheel work and you can find
all mad sorts of things so I found this
person doing Facebook and so what we
poor Timothy is having a really bad day
and it's minimus
but he's a I'm fairly sure where he is
right now you can this is remote
controls by accident because it struck
me that this is happening so what can
you kind of guess from this streem
someone's browsing Facebook we got that
but what else can you see
it is looks to me like a team urine salt
it also looks like to me to be an
internet cafe or one of those things you
see on a you know the when you go into
an airport and they've got all the rows
are you pay like a dollar and you can
use the internet and they have the
really crap metal keyboards it's like
one of those so that this is one of
those reasons why you shouldn't use
those devices because you can't trust
that there's no one watching or
intercepting your communications so
please don't use those now I found
another person and playing Facebook as
well and they were open chat windows
this was actually a person in the UK
this person was having really fun times
I have no idea what they were doing but
I found them too and then I started kind
of getting a little bit talking about
backgrounds and every so often I run
into something I'm not too sure if it's
someone playing a joke on me or I've
actually found something really cool
I'll leave it to your imagination of
what I've just found here anyone know
who Marvel are they're a semiconductor
company now what kind of struck me is
that you've got have got all these like
secure connections here and this is an
open remote VNC that I can connect to
and then run my way in I'm on your
network and pivot okay so I found this
and I was like okay this is a bit mental
and then this guy made me laugh because
this is someone else's desktop I thought
this is really cool but what I noticed
on top was they were running as ruse
okay so that kind of made me go cool
every so often you find people doing
email and as we know changing any mail
is kind of fun and I found this poor
chap who is sending out logisitics and
then there's this Thai banking this is
actually someone logged in using banking
software and we can probably do
something there but if you found
someone's remote connection enabled what
would you do
how would you warn them think about how
would you warn them to put up a text box
yeah very good you could do this random
person to here yeah well anyone can
connect
it's this is this is a very Irish virus
yeah it's happy it lets you go it's fine
boss if you were malicious what would
you do
install virus would you think about
ransomware pull down some ransomware
runners and now you've encrypted the
disk and if they want to get their stuff
back they've got to pay you you don't
even have to buy ransomware software you
can buy a full-on control and command
structure complete with ready package
software for you to use and all you need
to pay is 10% of the take there are a
couple of new variants coming on one is
you can get a key if you pay the
bitcoins two you can get the key if you
infect two of your friends or three the
social engineering one which is
absolutely criminal there are other than
these but it's not it's probably the
most lethal of them all is what they've
done is they've got a new version what
it will do is will encrypt your disk it
will leave one space of your disk open
and they will inject kiddie porn on us
and then they will send you a message
saying we're going to notify the
authorities if you don't pay because
that stuff does not go away so that is
the social engineering aspect of it
there everyone's going oh they are ok
ransomware it's a bit of crap but the
thing is they are out to make money and
believe it or not ransomware is based on
an element of trust so in other words
you pay we give you something and if you
don't do that that's usually where their
business model breaks down so they are
they do even have support channels for
this so after you've kind of done you're
screwed up your house you kind of think
you're better stay at a hotel so these
are different hotel business centers
where you can log-in so if you ever want
to know which hotel is the cheapest to
stay at for like businesses and services
you can probably use one of these at all
by the same vendor the different costs
whatever and I did say I would show you
toilets on the Internet so here is one
from Singapore so this is a toilet
screen as in you know those little kind
of screens you as you go out of the bog
and you press the bottom you say I'm
happy I had a good time and I didn't
have a good time but I like to put at
the bottom the screen is sanitized
regularly however their network is not
and but that's only a toilet kind of
like information panel what about
actually controlling a physic
toilets this one now these are the ones
that you know when you go in you put in
your kind of money and you go in and it
opens and you could do your business you
come back out it stops and it entirely
rinses the whole device right this is
one of those where you can control the
doors you can open the doors change the
basins whatever you want to do and then
because it's not bad enough that you
have this version you've got the Seaton
jumbo 2 and this also has a big start
VNC button because really it's not bad
enough as it is which leads me to think
that when IOT evolves to the point you
will start seeing this like error
messages in your phone now toilet humor
come on anyway how many of you got kids
excellent for those who have kids this
is the very dark part of my talk this is
this is where I stop being funny I start
trying a funny ish and this is why I try
to be serious okay so for those who has
children there's amazing devices called
baby cams okay originally there were
little two-way radios where little
Johnny could go inside this in this crib
and play and sleep and we would
understand that you know every burp and
fart we could they weren't dying because
there's new parents babies have this
amazing tendency to go and stop and then
you as a new parent I don't know if I
broke it and it will start an in the
hood now someone came up with the idea
wouldn't it be brilliant if we post a
little webcam in this device so we could
see if little Johnny is messing with us
trying to do interpretive dance are
trying to escape okay
so this was a really clever idea and
people bought these by the millions
unfortunately some of these devices
support UPnP universal plug and play
meaning it will contact the router it
was then configured and allow it to go
out online so that you can monitor
little Johnny from your phone from any
place in the world sounds fair except a
lot of these do not have passwords and
it is very easy to find them so here I
have POS room Co doesn't understand that
he's on the Internet Co doesn't
understand our Theo's parents to
understand they've made of
crucial mistake in their security in NCO
security Co doesn't understand why
people are shouting at him in the middle
of the night making sexual noises Co
doesn't understand that his image is
being shared around the web we're still
we will just find cops this is as you
can see 11 to the 1st 2017 this is in
recent time this is another crib based
actually in Ireland which I've reported
the ISP to this person here you can see
another crib as well and it gets better
because you have filo and you don't know
what happened and every so often you
will find the child asleep in there
we're still there are more than one of
these all around the world you can see
here all these children are now
vulnerable because some developer some
system admin some person said the
requirement for a password is - god damn
difficult for our users so every is we
continue finding more of these things
online I found this today this is a
probably a camera installs to keep an
eye on an older person as they're
recovering whatever I found this poor
gentleman in a sin I have no idea where
this is but you can see here it
continues I find this type of crap all
the time and every time I do I report it
back to the ISP to say listen the person
at this IP address on this dais let them
know they've made a mistake now this
leads to kind of things like this
strangers hack Family's baby monitor and
talks to a child at night video I'm
going to run a video here which will
explain a little bit of what's happened
this is no doubt gonna send shivers down
the spine of any parent if you use a
baby monitor camera in your home there's
an Indiana couple that says theirs was
hacked and someone was watching their
two-year-old daughter Charlie de mer
from affiliate W Xin has their
frightening story the smallest one was
Madeline safe and secure in their
Southport home the Denman's put their
two year old Gracie to sleep always
keeping an eye on her with this video
monitor our privacy was just invaded
Wednesday Gracie was at home playing
with mom when all of the sudden
someone was playing music and stuff like
that every breath you take by police
music started playing from the baby
monitor at first mom thought it was all
a joke but quickly realized someone
attacked the camera he started doing
like sexual noises and stuff like that
on the camera Jarod Edmund did a little
research and found out the person who
most likely violated his home camera has
done it before posting videos of similar
hacks on YouTube playing that same song
and bragging about the breach on Twitter
it adds taking me a lot because I mean
who's to know those people don't even
know about it
that are on the videos we kind of felt
violated like we didn't feel scared all
over at PC Help services David spoon art
says don't make it easy for hackers it
tends to be quite easy especially when
there's a hole found in a particular
device and somebody publishes some
method online the Denman forgot to
change the preset factor a username and
password that came on the camera
allowing relatively easy access you can
make sure that you have a strong
wireless network password in case
somebody haven't seen nearby and wants
to connect them to your network and
bypass your firewall completely the
biggest thing is just changing the
username and password now police say
there have been an increase in a number
of baby monitors that have been hacked
recently so those are some good tips to
follow right how many of you spotted
what the default password was blank so
ladies and gentlemen stern warning to
all developers all product owners all
people in the audience if a requirement
comes across your desk where they say
the security is often tell them it's opt
out do not allow your users and your
users of your products to be prosecuted
invaded whatever violet in this case by
your single simple single mistake of not
giving a crap whether they have a user
name and password it is not that goddamn
hard change your practices do not end up
in my slide deck now we're seeing a
little bit more of this as well here
with this
saying basically in like air BnB s
because air BnB are in a different area
under law a hotel can not in put a
surveillance device in your room you get
privacy in your room however Airbnb is
not in that case so what they are people
are allowed to do is actually put any
camera or whatever they want up and
there's been a lot and increase of cases
of where people are standing up cameras
on Wi-Fi networks live using raspberry
PI's Raspberry Pi zeroes leaving hidden
cameras and then start trading all these
videos online so there's a thing called
plug on plug it's a device you can buy
you've literally plug it in its sniffs
the entire network and nooks everything
that looks like a camera off the network
that you're on ok it's a very simple
device you can build one if you want off
github to go nuts
but because we start seeing more and
more of these type of things like I
found this poor gentleman in Greece like
it's not exactly brilliant for this man
to be on the internet but it is nothing
compared to what I found today what is
this
anyone trying to figure it out it's a
doctor's office doctor's table this is a
doctor's office on the internet open
think about it how many times you go to
the doctor and you're there and I can
listen this has remote and remote access
and video and audio how hard you think
it would be that it would have a default
username and password that would be
complex don't do it so Google is coming
up with a scenario where it's trying to
get a devices like this where it will
have little kind of stuff figures and
they will build in remote control baby
monitors this terrifies me so let's move
away from very bad baby monitors to
trying to hack fuel tanks now fuel tanks
this is where I have to change gears
because I find that exceptionally dark
that part of the talk it generally feel
the mood going so let's do something a
bit more fun now fuel tanks are awesome
because they store fuel highly volatile
highly flammable but what if you ever
work in oil and gas one of the most
difficult problems is getting the fuel
to the location at the right time in the
right volume okay
so someone thought wouldn't it be great
if we had a gauge that was internet
accessible that would report back and we
could check to see when the tank was low
or would report and we would actually
send us a message saying I need fuel so
these are actually running on port
10,000 n1 and you can go search them via
Showdown now you can find approximately
about three or four thousand of them
worldwide this one for example here if
you notice on the bottom says jet a1 and
we want to take a guess of what jet a1
is jet fuel well done so jet a1 is very
badly playing what you can log in and do
stuff with us the thing is this was
found in Norway but it's actually a
honeypot because I doubt they're running
a bit torrent tracker on my local thing
however this one is not this was found
in total aviation DRF looks like station
Heil open now as you can see here it's
got twelve and a half thousand liters
it's 43 percent full
this was remote remotely accessible and
I found this one in Ireland this one all
it shows me the different manifolds for
unleaded and diesel it's based out of
top Intel barrack in Dublin I can go in
and adjust things if I want and this is
a control panel for more fuel as in the
other one it goes to pling pling pling
when you're trying to actually fill up
your tank so then I found this one now
if you're going to run a honeypot which
is called con pass for example please
don't run this in Amazon I doubt my
local staff oil station will need to be
running in the cloud okay so if you're
going to if you really want to see how
much people will will actually mess with
your systems stand up a honeypot like
this on a local ISP and you'll see all
these different things trying to connect
and mess with your fuel manifolds now
this is a Coriolis gas and well control
system again found online no security
whatsoever and it controlled things like
gas static pressure gas temperature gas
today gas yesterday etc I need the
dollar person has excellent good and if
you use MongoDB oh you're about to get
screwed right this is MongoDB MongoDB is
a fantastic database system it's really
clever allows you to do web scale
allows you documents you don't have to
have a schema it's a no sequel based
database really cool however
unfortunately a lot of people who stand
up a MongoDB do not understand security
because tell me how do you enable
authentication on MongoDB you start the
Mongo demon with - - off in other words
MongoDB is not secure by default the
problem is it also had previous - about
3.2 bound to all open ports out bounds
or sorry bound to old open IPs outbound
meaning you would set requests from
anywhere means you get things like this
this is a database service in England
which running had 32 gigs of data on it
and a couple of different things like
Clarendon Enterprise Centre census of
anta and unfortunately the last couple
of days we started to see things that
I'll talk about in a minute but I can
show here we've got this particular I
wanted dev dot one SAP comm was pointing
back to this I want a database so why
bother hacking the front of it when I
can hack the back of it because it's
open and taking I can take all your data
now I found everything ranging from 4.3
gigabytes to 387 all the way up to 1.1
terabytes of data stored without any
single form of authentication which led
to a thing back in about the 20th of
December last year a group figured this
out and wrote a piece of code and it
started going along and going on to your
database listing all the collections
dropping all the collections inserting
their new one with one single document
in it which had a ransom note saying
please pay - but point to Bitcoin to
this address and send us an email which
your server IP and will restore your
databases okay and this was going on as
her occur now what happened after that
was a couple of other people in a second
this is kind of cool and there was
copycats and we ended up with about 20
different actors in play all doing this
the following they would list sorry they
would look at your database they would
check to see if their ransom note was
there
if your write their ransom note wasn't
there they would drop all the
collections pop in their own ransom note
and then leave except they didn't have
your data and you would end up with a
trail of different of six different
ransom notes
from different attackers and you didn't
know who had your data they made 22
thousand US dollars from single
transactions not a single piece of data
returned want to know the funky thing
with us other than the fact that we had
like for example 22,000 databases by
this particular actor all leading up to
thirty four thousand five hundred and
five hundred and three different
databases at the time of writing the
attack code was written in c-sharp
now for some of us in the room that's
like so for other people the room that's
holy crap because I have yet to find
attack code written for this type of
thing written in C sharp which either
means a couple of things one dotnet core
actually works that you can run on Linux
oh sorry I didn't know why I said that
shouldn't said that or it's like the
thing is evolving people are looking at
this and it was a very easy hack I think
it's a segment the problem is is not
just Mongo that's getting pwned right
now we have Hadoop elastic memcache ryuk
and couch all are under attack right now
because everyone's on a gold rush all
that these different services are
accessible externally Hadoop imagine the
amount of data we wiped out from that
couch TB has less users ryuk is let's
use memcache even though it's a non it's
a transient data store people can
investigate the slabs and actually try
and query data out of us to see if
there's kind of kind of juicy passwords
or whatever elastic was getting pwned at
the rate of a thousand instances a day
stealing data god knows what so I'll
move from that over to house control
systems now this one here is a control
system for a house where you can control
things like the camera the zones and
different areas around and you can turn
things on and off but there's one here
for example here where you can select
the rooms control so you can get all the
different ones in room linking and you
can also decide if you want to turn up
the temperature change the entrance code
or you can even do things like check the
time you can do other different bits and
pieces here is a it was the music
control panel for a house so imagine
you're there at 3 o'clock in the morning
again all right what music would you
play
the music to the shining buys the
Valkyries you know clowns come in the
heart character I've noted but we have
things like this I found this particular
one here in a motel and this is a
geothermal control panel you know the
ones where you spread out all the pipes
underneath the ground and it starts
taking a heat from the ground and heats
your house this is one of those here is
a house control system where I can do
things like low flow handling which is
air control and listening is also for
external it's the carport where I can
check in and out cars now it would be
kind of different if we want to go on to
do medical systems as well wouldn't it
do you think people put medical systems
online yes this is high foo high intense
frequency high frequency ultrasound now
funny thing is when I googled hi food
for the first time right - it is used
elimination of prostate cancer there is
no way my prostate is up there unless my
head is up my ass okay boss this thing
this poor woman here will you could
literally nuke under her eyeballs and
melt things using high-frequency
ultrasound now I thought that's pretty
bad what about this this is a pharmacy
control panel it's a back office
pharmacy control panel where I can in
France where I can see what's going on
I can see the different pharmacy bits
and I can also see who's going to be in
who's I can google things but then I can
write my own prescriptions this is a
back-end software system for writing
prescriptions in a doctor's office or in
a pharmacy so I can get like for example
beta's 20 milligrams CPR 30 and how many
I want now if Walter White had this
breaking bad what I mean a little
no so this is just an example of where
you can go in and do things and I can
actually change or I could do I could
figure out what type of drugs I'm
actually on because this is a drug
identification control panel now it's
really odd that all these types of
devices are accessible online but they
are so here is another one
it's
refill you can change the refillables
you can change the Oryx memo and all you
can also find out what the different
patient data
who's got was so I said okay let me show
you some of the random stuff that's
evolved around here this is a control
panel for a login and then I found this
particular one which is has 5000 watts
of power I don't know what it is but
it's kind of weird it's got 5,000 watts
of power this is one of my favorite
things of all time
what's this sorry
it's a rat's token yeah it's to a fade
on right because he's got a webcam
pointed his RSA token so he can go find
when he's got some we gotta login he's
just said there's my control arm right
as my number he won't lose it it's right
because how many of you think that this
actually is clever I think it's
brilliant well done you now this is a
son as our bitch control panel no idea
why it's here and I will end my tour of
V and C with something crazy what is
this
it's not a nuclear power reactor and to
be honest that's what absolutely
everyone says I would like to highlight
one thing it's a crematorium it's a
crematorium control panel at this point
usually everyone goes crematorium infant
buttons yes this is a medium sized body
100 and 200 pounds cardboard box mail
fourth case of the day online remotely
accessible you can connect to it think
about this ladies and gentlemen who in
their right mind would have an bloody
crematorium online now does it make
sense that usernames and passwords
should be involved in your design
process very early on have I shown you
the type of crap we can find now I have
shown you about a hundred different
slides of things I have found I have
over 4,000 images of devices I have
found and these are just some of the
ones that just make the most sense to
show you because they are absolutely
lethal this is found in 2012 it's
offline thankfully because when the
person found that they literally went I
think they feed themselves and run away
as you can see here the date in 2012
boss this type of device should never
been online you can imagine that the
type of horror and the type of misery
would cause people so let me show you
another difficu advanced hacking tools
that you can use today and this is
Google ok Google is one of the few
things you never lie to it knows all
your search history but it also is a
fantastic resource because it indexes
everything so when I'm going to normal
people when they're looking for things
to do things like this recipes for
chicken recipes for kids which is a
really cool thing because recipes for
chicken is trying to cook chicken right
recipes for kids not the same thing and
so we have I love how these are this is
what you do so then you get like this
this is what I Google when I'm bored
okay now I read I had to put the D in
because otherwise it gives me a whole
lot of Donald Trump stuff I had pretty
mental but if you want to know a really
cool interview question why does Donald
Duck wear a towel when he comes out of
the shower come on why does Donald Duck
wear a towel when he comes out of the
shower he's wet exactly so stop his feet
getting wet it's all dribbles down but
it was really because when the animators
had figured this out man we better not
do this because well you can imagine
every child likes gone but Donald Duck
doesn't have pants and I can go outside
you know that's why that is it's also
kind of one of those things why does
goofy versatile have different things
anyway
it's another thing that I the only
Disney character have had sexes Cluedo
or goofy sorry she's the only mom the
kid Goofy's had a goofy as a little kid
give he has a son I'm just we haven't
seen Goofy's mom yet do we just not too
sure if it's Pluto anyway it's sorry
okay this is another thing sorry the
completely warp your current
sensibilities right there
anyway if t who really want to screw
with people you can do things like this
this is an in URL prefix which means I'm
looking for URLs that match certain
things so I can go looking for things
like in url index.php ID equals this is
a precursor for looking for sequel
injection attacks you can also go
looking for things like AirWatch login
which is a for a remote webcam if you
want to do something you can find
different things and these are all known
as google dorks and google hacks so you
can so let's let's think of something
here does anyone work with asp.net D
like 4.6 edition MVC or whatever do you
know what the web.config is can the
web.config be downloaded over HTTP
no good everyone can guess that can the
web config be downloaded over FTP yes it
can
now what does the web config contain
passwords config data etc so if you want
to go looking for web configs you do in
your L FTP in your L web config right
and you can go and find different web
configurations that have been uploaded
to open FTP sites which you can then go
and download and examine and
these things you'll find things like
this alright this is Sitefinity from
telluric which has the actual ID and
password and the location of the
database you have for example here mail
settings to Yuma insurance but they left
the test in the comments because that's
always handy alright so I found other
things like for example here Twitter
access tokens to take over Twitter
accounts sitting inside in the
web.config very simple to find so you
can then go and say well if I can read
the web.config
alright what else could I do
squeezing write it that's like you're
thinking I honestly thought I could
probably just go look at the entire
structure of the website because if I
can find the web.config I just go up one
level probably and find things like here
now if you were here and you found the
website like this what would you do look
at the private directory Evan once look
at the private directory I like your
thinking but no you go looking for
things like like the admin or the other
things and if you wanted to harvest
passwords a very simple thing upload
your own version of the ace admin code
so we'll just tale out so funny story
Facebook have a bug bounty so they go
looking they ask you to go try and hack
facebook and to get different bugs now
so what happened was a guy went and he
did a quick DNS scan he checked all the
different subdomains of Facebook had and
he found files facebook.com/ which was
allowing people where they could upload
files internally from the Facebook
networks to do stuff so he looks at he
saw it was a file control system that
had a version say 4.2 he checked and
found that that particular version had a
vulnerability so he used the
vulnerability against it and logged in
is a quick run around found a shell and
then he discovered that someone was in
there for the past six months had upload
their own version of the login page
which just tailed all the usernames and
passwords to a text file which then
streamed out every 24 hours to a random
endpoint for six months all in facebook
Chloe's credentials are being leaked out
behind the scenes so you could do this
you could just literally upload your own
version of the code and then say look
I'll just tell the tale all these names
the passwords I don't crack anything
right now if you're thinking Nile I'd
love to know more about this that's
great I'll show you something it's
called the Google hacking database
gah GB okay here is contains a list of
google dorks that you can use to find
different things on the internet for
example foot holes all the way to for
example files containing passwords and I
love the descriptions passwords for the
love of God Google found passwords ever
Google things like passwords dot xlsx
right you will find a ton by the way
don't ever Google a credit card number
because Google gets a bit funky for you
it really starts giving out you're up to
something no good because no one types a
credit card number into Google and
they're looking to help granny you know
if you go looking for credit card
numbers it gives you out but you will
find as soon as you try a lot of these
Google dorks all of a sudden Google's
protection and captures kick in so it
becomes a bit awkward and slower now if
you're thinking oh well you know what
now I don't really like command-line in
the browser
you know typing in URLs it's a bit too
complex for me right it gets a bit
easier you can use search diggity it's a
thing from Bishop Fox it integrates
Showdown it integrates the google
hacking database it means creates
different malware databases to allow you
to craft very complex queries against
Google to go looking for particular
files and folders you can find things
with so if you have like I do this with
a lot of my customers I say show me what
version of software you're using and let
me see what I can find online that
mattresses and sequa it or we can find
if there's vulnerability the exploit DB
for example contains a list of different
things that you can find where
applications have been owned and try and
find the version number so you can find
the remote exploit if you have to do it
so I'm going to have a look at something
else which is more interesting to find
things and it's called github everyone
heard of it here the very big now github
is a fantastic resource for developers
is where code goes to live right how
many of you ever upload
a secret to github by accident one or
two weld on you like the rest of us now
github allows you to store documents but
if you go searching and github repos for
things like SMTP Gmail calm right you
will find usernames and passwords in
configuration files hard-coded in
different repos that you can use to
download and do stuff you can find you
soon as possible there I found this
particular one which I really enjoy
because with spring security login and
registration and it gives me a username
and password in for sea turtle 4405
percentage okay now if I was to do
something like password equals I get 5.4
million results if I do for example file
name config passwords I get two hundred
and forty-eight results soon in forty
eight thousand results if I do file name
web duck config pass one down to one
hundred thirty four thousand results
where I can start playing with things
I'm getting to dig out passwords I found
this particular one here where it
literally had all the different than
dynamic DNS with the username and
password in the web config that you
could just stream out Amazon have a hook
into every single kid github commits to
check if you're uploading Amazon keys
which they will then disabled I think
Microsoft have something similar maybe I
don't know but the thing is that people
do get commits and all of a sudden you
guys kind of you want to go find things
use get robbed get robbed is a tool for
doing reconnaissance on your own repos
to see if people are uploading secret or
valuable information that you can use to
that could be used against you it's a
very cool tool it makes it very easy to
be ads just pull it out and off you go
and it gives you a different types of
intelligence against your organization
and you can allow you to slap your
developers for being silly now here are
some resources that I showed it today we
have showdown we have Google we have
Google hacking device or dignity get
robbed
yep now yes I really want to put up a QR
code here for sometimes just to see what
people do do you have any questions
other than why the hell did you show us
this crematorium
yes sir
very good question is there anything you
can run on your home network to see if
your camera is not giving up free
dentals what you can do there's a couple
of problems with theirs there was a
thing called was a black ice that was a
remote access trojan that would a remote
access web cameras and allow people to
take over them scan your machines
watch for dodgy like run wire shark or
run like something internally if you
have there's a thing called needs
network intrusion detection system you
can run arch linux with a on a Raspberry
Pi and connect it to your network and it
will watch for dodgy stuff going over
the wire and that will then start
bringing back and logging about and
saying what it can do it's a very it
look for building your own needs network
intrusion detection system or have
there's a couple of things like Canaries
and things that will do it for you but
if you want to scan your network to know
our scan your external IP just type the
external IP into show then it'll show
you what it can see from there maybe
there's a for example a web server
running that you know with externally
accessible FTP port whatever if you have
a nas Seagate Iomega
Western Digital LaCie all these
different ones right
they sometimes enable UPnP and ftp
externally and have to pull the
credentials a lot of people have masses
exposes on the web and they put a lot of
personal data out there and using
extreme lot Asus Reuters and Netgear
Reuters had a vulnerability where they
would automatically enable FTP and a
this was very specific to that and
Renteria clout so just make sure you
haven't got any of those update the
firmware on your ruther make sure it's
up to date and just kind of play
cautious any other questions
do I think is piece should do more to
house the average user yes and no
there's a this is a hard choice about
this because the simple reason is ISPs
are literally providing you the service
and up to you it's like whether you
should get car owners to kind of ensure
you drive safely our sorry car
manufacturers students are car dealers
sorry to ensure you drive safely what I
think should happen is that there should
be a simpler mechanism if we find things
online that shouldn't be there that we
can importantly I speak wicker and they
can escalate it internally because a lot
of the time that just goes into a health
channel somewhere and they don't know
what they're looking at it's a very
tricky kind of I do I want my ISP to be
kind of overlooking everything I'm doing
definitely not me but and you know maybe
good question oh yes oh yeah so have I
committed have I committed a crime by
showing you all of this new I'll show
you why I use show done so showdown as a
search engine what it does is it crawls
and then brings back all the screenshots
and then I'm just reading the
screenshots so I'm never connecting to
them so I'm isolating myself like it
could could criminal I'm isolating
myself out of cut out man out there the
reason is if I was to connect to these
illegitimately or whatever yes I
probably would be committing a crime by
connected them if I connect to myself
what I'm not so what show done does is
it uses like standard connections it
opens the pores it uses like the VNC
screenshot command sends the screen
starts either back in hex into the
database and then shows you this
afterwards so I never actually connected
to a live system ever yes people
do I have to get the permission I've
never actually got the permission to
show their pictures I just because I
found them already I it's a fairy yeah
it's a very good question should I have
gone off and got like 150 people where
they've kind of got done something
stupid that probably wouldn't answer me
until it was crazy to say can I show you
why you're an idiot
I really have a really short talk so I
could I'd like to show you stuff but no
one said yes so it's all I imagine you
can see at sawmill it's very good
question dude yeah I probably should but
I probably have to can the talk it's all
there for free anyway it's on the
internet which means it's good okay any
more questions yes sir
they generally do I have a lot of look
when I'm reporting open cameras and open
stuff with lights please
yes I know with depending on the ISP
Germany is actually quite good Ireland
not so good other ones they depends on
the size the ISP it depends on what you
found and how you reporters either I my
favorite one is Nando's so Nando's had
one of their HVAC systems online right
where I found it was a control panel for
one of their London restaurants and it
had the Lando's logo etc and then I sent
a tweet Twitter a twit
tweet tweet to Nando's and said by the
way I think I found something that
shouldn't be on the internet belong to
you and I meant that's awesome we don't
know what to do with that we'll send it
to our engineering department and
they'll freak out so the engineering
department replies back thanks very much
we found out we shouldn't done that by
that and then the Nando's guy replied
back dude thanks for helping us out we'd
like to send you some chicken I did I
said I'm in Norway annoyed Oh will you
be in London soon as like so I brother
got to freaking - free chicken dinners
out of me finding weird Nando's stuff on
the internet you get varied results
depending on that on what you find if
it's very critical infrastructure you
definitely saying we notify search for
loss especially the MongoDB and other
things we've done that so any more
questions yes sir yes manufacturers and
people are definitely turning to make it
more seriously after the different
breaches we had with MongoDB and other
kind of things of that day they started
kind maybe we should kind of change that
opt-in to being opt-out Troy's back the
room there and he's probably got the
same kind of thing pressure on thing
from from this type of stuff social
pressure generally forces people to
change like I can guarantee you ask your
puppy after the Ashley Madison hack a
lot of people had kind of invested in
password managers another startup OPSEC
another different things or they
probably stayed the same in couldn't
care less I know my mom I said to her
you can't do this and then she offered
to send me her credit card number by
email and I you know there's only so
much you can do a lot of people just
have this whole idea that it's not that
valuable to anyone else why would they
want to steal us as an Irish person I'm
always going well if it's there and it's
free I'll probably take it see something
so there you are in you know in the u.s.
you've got their little the papers you
can buy you put your 25 cents in they
open it you take the one paper right so
when I was there first time I asked
seriously why wouldn't someone take all
the papers and the yank beside me went
what why would you need more than one I
don't know it maybe it's just my
mentality for this so yes our growing
pressure I think the security is now
becoming a stronger stronger thing that
we need to integrate because we realized
that stuff is being stolen and sold and
people are seeing the consequences
before you might see stuff being stolen
and might not be released for four or
five years now it's out in the wild in a
couple of minutes so yeah any more
questions going once going twice go get
some coffee thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
