yeah you can I have sound all right
thanks for coming a bit spread out
because the room is quite wide so I'll
try and make sure I include all you but
it's kind of hard when you on that side
but I'm sure we'll manage
have you noticed my my beautiful graphic
I'll just do it again
you ready I didn't do it again
PowerPoint um hi so first things first I
don't have a whole lens yet right and
that's okay
yeah well that's that's what I'm saying
it right I don't mind but it doesn't
matter because I'm guessing neither do
you
right and I want to show you how you can
develop for it so if I was showing you
how to develop it on an actual hololens
what were you gonna do right so yeah
sure it takes a little bit of the wow
factor off but I promise you there'll be
lots of goodies all right I have ordered
it I have used one it just hasn't
arrived because there's a whole bunch of
stuff of you have to go to the US and
have us address an area yeah so there's
a few hoops to jump through but let me
just make clear that I don't work for
Microsoft I have nothing to do with the
hololens team so any questions you might
have around what's going to happen or
that it'll just be speculating because I
just don't know but I love the
technology and I hope you will too in
about now because it's absolutely
unbelievable
so I get these stickers that says MVP
because I'm really loud about this stuff
because I love it and that means that
Microsoft likes usually what I'm saying
that's all that means
I do some curls like causes if you
haven't heard a plural site please go
out and talk to the girls out on the
stand get a free trial or whatever it is
they have it's a massive amount of
training resources just unbelievable
4800 courses now or something so I've
been doing a few of those not as much
lately because I cloned and our website
if you want to know more about any of
this stuff as well so please bro please
don't be this audience okay please don't
just sit there and go oh right I'm
rather you were these guys right you
know pick me I got a question hey hey
hey I love questions
please do ask there's no stupid
questions and if I don't know I'll tell
you I don't know I won't just make up
stuff no just give me a sec and I'll get
to the questions I will be doing some
tweeting throughout the session so if
you follow me there there's more
information about some of the stuff that
I'm talking about and it's all done
through magic just like the whole lens
sure time tweets you know so the current
status right because how many here riots
software awesome fantastic that's cool
like that's pretty much everyone does it
now
is there any managers here that don't
write software right because you were
going to get thrown out now you want but
that's cool because we all live in the
same space yes I might write you know
functional programming on Python or Ruby
of knit or whatever it is your thing is
but we all write software to some its
extent right so currently what we do is
we either write these so they're like a
mobile apps there's lots of those
whether it's a web app what's a native
app or whatever it is you want to do
there's tons of them right
use it I'll be up to a billion apps yet
I don't think so couple of millions at
least right or we do this we do desktop
software or websites that people watch
or view and use on a standard monitor
right or we might be doing gaming does
anyone here do games or that sort of oh
do you develop games oh yeah you should
it's awesome because if you do you do
have a bit of an advantage in doing
hololens development and I'm not a 3d
designer or a gamer so I think we're on
the same page and you even might be
pointing in the same screen as in
collaboration right you sit and you sit
around the screens on me my partner this
is it's all 2d all this is on a flat
surface did you go somewhere and you're
looking at other there's a computer over
they'll just walk over here and I'll get
it right and it just gets little bit
tedious right it's just a little bit
monotonous if you've been doing it for
20 years long I have this new stuff
comes out all the time and there's now
no js' every day comes out right and you
can track are we right but it's just
it's it's more the same thing
so just to to give you an idea of where
all this fits in there are different
types of what I've decided are called
digital realities
does anyone here has like an oculus or a
vive or yeah okay cool so there's some
virtual reality guys here that's good
because you you will probably have a
better sense of what I'm going to talk
about it's a virtual reality is a
complete virtual world right so someone
has designed the world are you going to
look at it's all of it there's not
nothing of that is your real world and
that is great for prototyping or for
scenarios where you want to display say
a location excuse me or you want to have
a I've heard of a forklift simulator for
learning how to drive a forklift those
scenarios are really good right because
you can look around you go there's the
buttons and you know there's there's
really really good scenarios for it it
is limited physical movement because you
can't see we going so there's there's
always no there's always pros and cons
right so that's your virtual reality
then you have augmented reality and
augmented is the best design exams I've
seen sort of one-off so you go out
there's a thing that I recognize and
when I point my phone at it I can see
something on the screen right so it
really really cool exam I saw was of a
boat a brochure for a boat and you point
your app or whatever it is add that
brochure and the boat pops up and starts
floating around on the on the brochure
right
through your phone looks amazing
absolutely magnificent right there often
very simple they're often very sort of a
lightweight app if that makes sense you
know we're talking bits of bytes but and
it's in its overlay of data so it's
different for virtuality is that you
have your actual reality but you see it
through a device usually like a phone or
something like that and very often it's
it's that there's a trigger point that
needs to be seen in order to do this
sort of interaction and then there is a
term that Microsoft has coined which is
mixed reality and I kind of like it you
know it's it's not like this is where
hololens falls
it's not really augment is not really
virtual it's a mixed sense of well you
have Holograms that you place wherever
you are and that's the key you're not
you're not limited to a virtual space
you're not limited to having a trigger
point it's wherever you are right so
it's in your space that you place these
Holograms that interact with the
physical world and often what you get is
that you get virtuality looking like
this right because you get it so
immersive virtual-reality it just
consumes all of your reality and you get
these reactions to these you know or
you've seen I don't know you've probably
seen the video with the guy that tries
the roller-coaster and someone goes and
he's just worried just loses balance
completely and for about 30 seconds he's
trying to stand up because you're in
arrears and all you your physical
functions of your body can't relate to
what you're seeing and that's the
challenge with virtual reality but it
can get kind of cool actually you know
see there are some really good scenarios
for right there's some really cool stuff
you can do so you got sunny right and
and but by the way I actually found out
why how they did Holland's Oh does
anyone know what the technology is
that's inside of Holland no no it is
pure magic it feels like this when you
when you put it on it feels like magic
because you could how did that nevermind
it's just it blows your mind and I've
spoken to guys I've had the whole and
since the first waves for four months
there abouts they still get their mind
blown right and both socks goes off and
everything is it's really quite
impressive also I was sick with this guy
now so this is the bit that the more I
got into hololens looking at a more
compared with VR and era my main
question was when is it hololens app
right because it's really really easy to
get into this trap of saying okay I have
this really cool idea I'll overlay this
data on everywhere you look like that
building will show you how many people
are in it neural stuff stuff but there's
no reach
you couldn't do that with a much smaller
cheaper device as augmented reality so
at what point do you get to this is a
hololens
experience and the last time I did this
talk I actually got in trouble from
another hololens developer because i
kind of said that his wasn't in my world
hole its experience beautiful app and I
kind of I just did it again didn't I no
it was just it was a good part of what
in my world it is you know so it doesn't
matter what you what it's up to you what
you think of Holland's experience is but
to me it's important that it interacts
with the real world for example if you
put a holographic ball on a table and
you lift the table the ball should fall
off right the hologram should interact
100% with the real world in a way that
you can't do with augmented or virtual
reality so that's kind of my definition
of it this is cool because that's the
first one of the earliest prototype
picture I could find of the hololens and
effectively do you know what that is of
there it's a Kinect it's an Xbox Kinect
he's got on his head right because
that's that's it there's a spatial
mapping of of the device is so powerful
that's that I guess that's where they
started out I just you know people see
the whole is they go wow that took you
five years really and then you just kind
of see where they started right okay
before we look at how we code for it
let's just look at some of the specs for
it so it runs Windows 10 full version of
Windows 10 hololens edition obviously
because there's polar and specific
things in it but this means that you can
run universal apps on it are there
anyone here who does WPF or you know
sam'l apps in general there's a few okay
oh cool so all the skills that you have
for uwp you can reuse here it is just a
universal Windows platform app or uwp
app which is very cool
so if you create a 2-d app that works on
your phone well you can launch it to
Hollins as well as a 2d image in space
granted it's not what we just talked
about as a whole experience but it does
work on Hollande's has an Intel
processor
32 bid which I was a bit surprised about
but I guess it doesn't matter too much
usually 64-bit just takes longer because
there's more stuff to process it has a
HP you never heard of that
me neither a holographic processing unit
and and I'm guessing is some sort of
graphic accelerator it that's what it's
called
specifically designed for this device
and I have heard numbers like a trillion
exit calculations a second or something
like I don't know if that's true but
it's supposedly extremely powerful
because you know Holograms is rendering
3d in real time and you can have an
enormous amount of Holograms to
gigabytes of RAM again that's seen not
very much but ok 64 gigabytes of storage
which is obviously installing all your
apps and the OS it has four mics and
four speakers so we'll get more into the
mics and the speakers but it is it's
super-accurate the microphone with
Cortana is super accurate and it has
bluetooth and Wi-Fi connection but see
those are all just yeah we put that in
the device you get well the main thing
for me that puts this apart from oculus
and from vive or any of the other mixed
reality or digital real live devices
it's the fact that it's untethered there
is no wire coming out of this thing it
is completely a standalone device that
you have in your head right so that is
important because I can stand here I had
one and I could walk out to the earth
near to the foyer and put a whole room
there and walk back again I walk out
there again in the hologram still there
right I'm not limited by cables which is
what you get with virtuality which is
okay because you can't see where you're
going anyway but this is a huge
differentiator in my book anyway okay
one sort of disclaimer this is often
what you see this is a holland's and the
guy goes oh it's sharks must be
Australia but she's getting eaten by a
shark or something
and there's like there's a seafloor and
it all looks cool what you actually see
is more like this right your field of
view is not very big it is kind of like
having a box in front of your head
which is why when I'll show you some of
the demos the guys sort of do this right
they look like a bit robotic because
they can't see they're trying to look at
everything so that is important because
that has a big impact on how you design
your app because your visuals might not
be there but the sound of the visuals
might be in that sort of stuff but that
often catches people up because you see
all these glorious marketing images of a
full world of holograms which is there
you just can't see them all so that's
that's important to bear in mind now
with the feel of other the viewing
through the hololens part of creating
this amazing camera i just want to share
this video thinking i have to click play
here somehow into a 3d minecraft world
right on the wall even though I don't
have a hololens I'm able to play
together with stacks from my surface are
you gonna come join my game Lydia I see
you jumping around one of the cool
things about hololens is that it lets
you display Minecraft virtually anywhere
that's okay we can get different
perspectives on your Minecraft world
it's awesome to play with the controller
but could we show them something new
that sure let's take my experience off
the wall and then put it on the table
over here create world
see Lydia way up there run around play
sax can easily navigate and manipulate
the world using his voice and his hands
he can walk around the hologram can
around four different viewpoints and
even look inside that's pretty cool I
like that's that gives you an idea of
what is possible this is actually quite
an old demo but it still is super
powerful and who doesn't like Minecraft
right we all geeks so this is the kind
of scenario that with the budget was
trying to push not just in terms of
gaming but this collaboration
I don't you noticed but Zak's was
actually using a lot of the the
interaction points that the Hollins has
which I'll go through in a minute so now
we sort of set the scene of what this
device is there any questions around the
hardware or the idea or anything
yes mr. VR VR asked you said yeah oculus
sorry
so the question is that did they build a
special camera yeah absolutely
I would imagine there's only one or two
of those cameras - to showcase what the
hole has looked like but they had to I
guess in order to sell the idea to an
audience yeah so I wish I had that and
you know they want anyone all right cool
so building blocks cuz this is the
nitty-gritty of it right we want to know
how we actually build these experiences
and it is really that the base they the
basics of it is really quite simple
the idea of it is not difficult because
there's so much work put into not you
not having to worry about all the
details of people throwing up and
getting motion sickness and all that
stuff so first there's gays the gays is
kind of like your mouse cursor so if you
think of your head as the mouse I know
that is the idea and that's why there
takes a little while to get used to
wearing holland's because the paradigm
is slightly different so god is creepy
the gaze is the center of your head so
it's not your eyes it's not tracking
your eyes the center of your head is
where you're looking right and it has
says here a cast that's the object we'll
look at in a minute the raycast
is where do I wear my gaze Landing where
which objects am i interacting with
right so let's have a look at that I'll
see we can find some so first let me
just show you there's a oh wow that
looks interesting does anyone here use
unity okay a couple of people you have a
huge advantage because you cannot
develop for hololens without unity it's
just not possible now I think Microsoft
will tell you you can use any editor you
want but the fact is the unity is now so
heavily integrated with Visual Studio
and the whole holland's experience that
you not seeing that come on tell me days
okay
that's why I said don't be that North
Korean audience right and alright anyone
wants a coffee oh okay let me just do
this because all these projections
always different okay here we go
so you need unity right and this is I'm
using a Microsoft example on purpose
because I want you to go out and do this
as well but this is a tutorial you can
do right now on the whole lens developer
portal so this is called origami because
there's some paper things there right no
I can't and these are the objects that
come with it so these are 3d objects
that have been created in some other 3d
program right so unity is very good at
manipulating 3d objects and showing them
and giving them motions and scripts and
all that actually designing the objects
is more like here's a block right so you
need some 3d designer or some form of
help if you're not capable of that
yourself to create an experience that is
convincing and this looks really scary
when I first open unity this one can't
hear me all of these values here just
looked like oh god my brains about to
explode
and the trick is to just ignore it all
and then you say oh I need that bit and
then learn what that bit does right so
don't be too scared this essential issue
your solution you have some assets down
here there's your workspace and here's
the properties of whatever object you're
pressing right so it's kind of like
visual studio if that's your tool of
choice it has some similarities and that
helps your brain not explode so I'm not
gonna go through unity because that
would just be boring but just know that
it's there and there's full integration
in visual studio so you can go something
like file build settings and that shows
up on this screen that's brilliant and
you get something like that and you're
gonna choose universal apps and all the
right settings some whatnot right and it
exports a tool into Visual Studio and
off you go so that's not difficult
even though it looks very scary so now
you can't see that one either there we
go yeah let's start over here so I was
talking about gays right and they're
always so these are scripts that are
attached to the objects in unity and
these scripts always have a start and
they always have an update start runs
when it's initialized update runs every
frame so that's how you interact with
your objects every frame is 60 times a
second if you have frame rate lower than
that you're doing something wrong and
you will most likely make your users
sick the frame rate is super important
if you don't get 60 frames a second you
get vomit pretty much this case here we
just have so there's our ray cast and
every every frame we get the head
position and the gaseous gaze direction
so the head position is where your head
is right and whether you're turning it
it's super super accurate and the gaze
is you know we're in 3d space are you
aiming your head and then all you do is
you get the raycast with those
properties and then you go in and you
say if Ray Kassar yeah as I hit and if I
have hit anything if I have hit an
object in my world in my space mm-hmm
then we do all this and we find the hit
point display the cursor so enable the
cursor that's your mouse cursor which is
your head remember yeah so this again we
can sort of good similarities there and
then this I don't you know how to say
that
that just means that it's actually
hugging the 3d surface so it looks like
it belongs so it's not you know in this
case actually it's show you the so this
is our cursor
okay that's the curse all right so it's
a ring 3d ring that's our mouse cursor
so that's all you have to do that's how
you get a cursor that shirt yes a
virtual yes virtual no sorry
you think both yeah to get that right
anything both because the whole lens
does spatial mapping as you move your
head it Maps the room in real time right
so it doesn't it doesn't know where you
are but in those where you're looking
and by that event it Maps the space
you're in and places the Holograms
accordingly yep yeah or someone stood in
front of it yeah if you have a hole in
hologram here and I go in front of it
you can't see it anymore
correct yep yep and then I'll show you
that in a minute you mean so hard when I
can't get my screen right so here is the
emulator right because we don't have a
whole ends so we're using the emulator
and it's surprisingly accurate actually
so I'm just gonna run this five okay yep
and the only there's some tricks but the
life cycle or the development cycle I
should say of producing these is a
little bit tedious because you've got to
go into unity is why I only do this once
you got to go into unity and you got an
edit u.s. world
you got to compile to visual studio
project open that in Visual Studio again
then compile it then deploy it to the
hologram so if you do changes with your
five times it's a minute like I do
sometimes Oh God
but there are ways around that with some
smart scripts and whatnot there's some a
little hole and developers have come up
with yes
so what is limiting the field of view
why do we only have that little box is
the question I actually don't know I'm
guessing it's it's combination of
processing power you have to you know
magic magically come up with all that so
again that's the 32-bit process as well
as the HPU
and it probably has some relation to ram
as well and it might just be the
hardware just can't show you that much
there's multiple reasons I'm sure
they'll improve on it no doubt it could
also be that if you had a 180-degree
view you would have a battery life of
eight minutes right like something on
that so there's there's multiple factors
that would play into this so here's our
whole hololens emulator and all I'm
doing is with my hands is I'm using the
arrow keys and the good old gaming WASD
for the 3d space here right so I'm
moving in 3d space this is where yeah
and so you wanna go over here the center
and it's hugging the surface so that's
how we select things and it is that
simple ray cast got hit what info or
whatever it was that's it
that's how you get your cursor to do
something and then in a minute I'll show
you how we do events and all that sort
of stuff right the other thing I just
want to mention to make sure I'm on time
here is that there is this which will
open this window yes it will
so this is the hololens portal and this
also works for the physical device if
you had one as well but because the
emulator is a hyper-v instance it runs
his own IP and machinery and you can
connect to it like any other machine and
you get this portal and I won't go
through the whole thing but this thing
here 3d view so this is what you're
seeing out of the hololens emulator yeah
the really cool thing is i have rooms
right so I can go update and it builds
the room I mean for me so these are
rooms that comes with the emulator I
think it's for and these are actual data
collected by a hololens at some point
did they put in so you have a room you
don't just have black space there are
ways of showing the space but it
really because of spatial mapping it
shows all the polygons of the room and
it's quite confusing if you see it for
the first time so I won't do it but
there's a way to see what's in the room
so let me just go back here actually yep
so in here I'll do the same thing again
I can use my mouse keys and whatnot and
I can use scrolling just go out and
we're in the room rip and now see if
this works on the screen I move this a
little bit here and then I move in the
emulator I'll go forward you can see
that that correlates to that right so I
work with three screens I don't work
with one so you put this on a different
screen right but you can see where you
are as if you had the whole lens on and
granted it is not like having a hololens
it really isn't
but it is as close as you're gonna get
and he actually works quite well for
developing there's no way I would put
out an app to the real world if I hadn't
tried it on Holland's first of course
but you can get 80% of the way right any
questions around that yes
huh so is there a limit to the room size
or where you walk with it uh huh I don't
know what the limit is obviously there's
always a limit because we're dealing
with a physical device and by the way
there's no such thing as infinity okay
infinity doesn't exist because then it
would blow your mind I've talked to one
guy that put a hologram in a hotel room
in London and traveled to somewhere else
in Europe Switzerland maybe or something
came back to the same hotel room and the
whole Graham was still there yeah
basically remember it's called world
global positioning or world mapping or
something like remember the exact term
but it remembers exactly where you put
everything right and that's one of the
issues they're dealing with right now is
that people forget so you have this
enormous library of things that where
people have put Holograms right so I
don't I don't believe they met they've
just come out with an update that might
fixed it but there's no way of knowing
where they are without walking there
right but the idea is that you put
something on the wall you go make a cup
of coffee and then you come back and is
still there right that's the scenario
you're not meant to travel between
continents obviously yes is this if you
out
some people I did see I don't think so
why why all right yeah I'll sure the end
why it's probably isn't okay alright so
that was gays I got to move on hello
everyone run on time the next thing we
got its gestures right so gestures are
really important because I like that one
gestures are really important because it
it is the way that you interact or one
of the ways you interact with your
hologram okay I'll get rid of you have a
gesture space and the idea is that you
comfortably should be able to do this
and that's your mouse click right that's
your gesture that's the tap which is why
it looks like that so if you it doesn't
one of the other things you got to move
like a robot because if you move your
head over here and go tap the Hollande's
can't see that you're tapping alright so
your hands gotta be in there so it takes
a bit of getting used to but the idea is
you have the tap gesture or tap and hold
as well and then you have the bloom
which is loosed up menu so you go what
did I just do so let's just start menu
you cannot override that that will
always work right you start menu you can
always get your start menu up which by
the way looks like a Windows 10 Start
menu because it is more demos ok you
still see that very good so just so we
can see what's going on here was running
so in your gaze gesture manager again we
got start and update just like any other
script that's attached to an object or
to your whole project for that matter
and then we have here we have a gesture
recognizer that's you're a master object
that handles all your gestures right
again all the nitty-gritty of figuring
out when it's a tap and all that stuff
has all been abstracted for you you
don't have to worry
and then you set up a tapped event and
you do a you give it a thing to do in
this case we're sending an event message
so on select we're sending that to
whatever object you're looking at right
so if the focus object is there it's not
know then we give it a unselect event we
send that to it and then the update it's
just again the raycast and every time we
just look if we're hitting anything and
we set the focused object so we know
what we are tapping to send the event to
right that's it
so and go back to our emulator now
obviously I can't tap right yes oh look
at that did we get sorry can you
register it yes you can but I wouldn't
recommend it as such because you can use
voice as well which is much more
accurate the tap is really meant to be
here's your mouse click right or tap and
hold yep yes that is the tap and hold
yes will you tap and you tap and hold
right yeah so do that and then with your
head because that's your mouse you move
right
that's the tricky bit that's where it
gets confusing when you're used to
having a mouse and keyboard so you oh
yeah oh yeah absolutely and you can
implement different actions for that for
the tap and hold it could be zoom as
well right zoom that way or this way you
can actually do that but in actual
gesture while you can I probably
wouldn't do it because it's how do you
teach people what that gesture is how do
you make sure it's different enough so
it doesn't get confused all these sort
of things right like you don't want to
sort of go huh speak okay so I think
this just died but that's okay and if I
press blue so that's just your start key
in this key and then I have to
my head at it here and enters your tap
and I just got to my origami thing yeah
cuz now it's installed heyy
and I was tap again yeah and we wait
ya know but that doesn't matter because
there's already one in there you can
live stream from a whole lens to a
screen and you can record it as well is
that we meant so you can see it you can
get the video of what you're seeing in
real time if you want yeah oh sorry okay
I'm with you can you use a webcam to
project the real room here no that
wouldn't make any sense because your
spatial mapping will be way off right so
maybe if you had one of the like my
phone recognizes my face because it got
the IR whatever that Intel technologies
like I remember maybe if you have some
of that or you'd hope to connect up or
something but not currently No so here
we go and my gesture right my tap is
what we looking at so now I'm gonna send
an olive on click event or unselect
event to this object I'm just about
tapping it goes and the reason it's
doing that is that we have the smear
commands here and we have our unselect
here so when I select an aperture with
the tap it gets the on select event
right and then if it doesn't already
have the rigidbody which means it has
physics then you apply the physics and
then you set a collision detected mode
detection mode and that sort of stuff
and then it falls down because it has
suddenly it has physics it has gravity
right that's all we're doing again super
simple right and yes I know as soon as
you do your own thing you want to do
something else that isn't documented and
it gets hard yeah I get that but right
now it's simple yes just went mark one
of the limiting factors of the uptake of
virtual reality
been the motion sickness all right and
you mentioned that anything less than 60
60 Hertz yeah would you know heard that
scenario is that the only frame rate the
only measurement of yeah I mean what
about the perceived weight of virtual
objects and so forth weight that I
haven't thought of wait I must admit I
haven't considered that but there are if
you are if your object suddenly start
floating off the wall or moving slightly
when you walk around him all those
things will make you motion sickness
kick in as well most likely and there
are small small percentage of people
like 2% or something that just cannot
use a hole in their body issues not set
up for it and they just they get sick or
they get uncomfortable or dizzy or
something and that's just it's
apparently that's documented yeah good
question uh good question all right I'm
gonna have to keep going here so that's
two of the four base things we want to
look at oh that was good yeah thanks
well now you saw the animation
this is really important as well right
voice is a big part of hololens because
anything you can see anything with a
word you can say right as instead of
selecting it and tapping it you can say
it and it's super accurate it is really
really good sorry you have to select
word so anything your your gaze is
looking at you can say select and it'll
tap it for you
you can't overwrite that either and then
obviously we have Cortana so I'm a
Windows Phone user I'm that one and but
katana works brilliantly she's always
listening on the device and she'll help
me launch apps and interact with apps I
do another talk on Cortana integration
with apps and you can do the same thing
with hololens as well so I'll just
quickly here just come on yeah so the
voice in this is speech manager right
again start an update you're gonna see
that a lot so we have a keyword
recognizer this is the cool thing you
can give it any keyword you don't have
to train it nothing you can give it a
sentence as well and it will recognize
it however if you have two senses that
are almost the same you'll get in
trouble right there's a big part of it
is your speech design how do you get up
how do you find out commands or come up
with the commands that are unique enough
or different enough from each other so
you don't suddenly launch an action that
wasn't intended so that's probably the
hardest part of this but in this case we
just have a keyword recognizer and then
we said about dictionaries that have our
keywords and in this case we have reset
world which we'll just broadcast the
message on reset so everything gets this
event if you happen to handle it you can
do a thing right and then the other word
will have is drop sphere and the
difference here is that you need to have
a focused object right because otherwise
doesn't make sense and then we have on
drop which is another action I know they
get sorry
and then you set up the keyword
recognizes they're on here
on phrase recognized so again you can
use any phrase you want which is very
cool
this is speech recognition works really
really well and then you have
unrecognized you find out is there a key
word is the word that you said is that
in the dictionary and then you invoke
that at that event that was on there
that lambda function we saw up there and
that comes out like so now we've dropped
one of these balls or spheres and
beginning see what if doesn't work right
reset world no no ha that's hard work
and there now because let's just we'll
choose the other one it's feel a bit
neglected right lose a drop sphere and
it goes down alright and I don't have a
particularly you know well spoken
English like I'm Danish in my Australian
is like weird and anyway so gets it
right that is how simple it is to do
keywords or to do speech recognition
it's really powerful and obviously you
can have much much more complex things
that will happen
you know things pop up or you start
calculation and as you in the background
or whatever it is your thing is right
but just for the user getting the user
to that point is super simple
yeah okay so there we go left from your
left okay so that was the custom
commands okay sound
sound is really important it is as
important as as the gays getting that
right and getting your frame rate right
because I've mentioned with the field of
you is so limited so if you place a
rocket over there and you plays you know
an elephant over here and you look that
way and you can't remember what's way
and suddenly the elephant starts
charging you or whatever it might be you
can hear that it's coming right so the
whole and sits on your head and has two
microphones on either ear soup tomorrow
two speakers on either ear and they
simulate what is called the head related
transfer function it sounds very fancy
doesn't and that is a way of simulating
real sound so you the way that I know
that if someone said something over
there these that they're over there is
that the sound that they're making from
their voice reaches this EF before that
year right that's why I know it's over
there so obviously I don't think about
that but the whole is does the exact
same thing and it changes volume and has
directions up and down and you know 360
degrees directional sound and using that
in addition with with all the other
things makes for a much more complete
experience and people are less likely to
forget where they put the Holograms
right which does happen a lot um so
we'll just try and look at that again
so sphere sounds again there's a start
this is where you set up all the sounds
in this case we have an impact so that's
when the sphere hits something and then
because you don't know what it's gonna
hit it might be on a slant or whatever
there's a rolling sound as well and then
you have this on collision enter which
is an over which is a house that sit-ups
no I've got my code wrong
I've got my code upside down now yeah so
these events you have all sorts of magic
with setting the volume to what you
think it should be and it has play and
then conditions stay you keep playing
and if it's rolling fast enough then you
keep playing the music or the sound of
rolling if it's about to stop then you
stop it and then when you and you have
on collision exit then you stop the
audio completely right so it's it's a
managing the audio and how you want it
to relate to the object much more about
much more than where is the sound coming
from because that's already taken care
of you are attaching the sound to that
object right and I would demo it for you
but I did this last night it was fine it
is about 20 minutes before we started
and there was no sound and I wasn't
gonna go through and debug it because
then it would just break something else
but you get the idea right so I
apologize that there's one demo fail but
you just attach a script to the object
with the sound saying audio start and
you can set the volume you can sit the
different events for it does that make
sense any questions on those four so
those are the four main building blocks
of a whole lens experience right we have
gaze yep hang on we've got gaze we got
the gestures we got the voice and the
sound right those are the four main ones
that you need to know that's it yes
fantastic and what
you should google that I don't know
Princess Leia demo I'm not sure I get
the reference I mean I know Star Wars
but sorry yeah that's a good I don't
know I don't think so there's been some
interesting things done with helicopters
flying around you and it's just for demo
purposes so you can get the idea where
things are are you do that sound
yourself though yeah absolutely you can
there are demos now that have objects
that projects Holograms as well I don't
have it in this presentation but as a
demo I'll go look it up of a guy playing
a robot game so there's deadly robot
spiders that break through the walls
where here is and jumps on chairs where
were that so holographic experience
right and then you got to shoot him with
your laser it's pretty cool but he has
an actual thing in his hand sorry no I
made those for them so that's what
you're here
so yeah I always make noises yeah yeah I
got a question sorry so just about the
gaze and like that spatial global thing
that you were talking about so the
example you said is if I go outside and
I see a hologram now or some kind of
image that I've created I come back in
and come back out and then I'll see it
again how can I sort of distribute my
application globally to everyone so I've
got something on a specific wall that
can be shown but obviously their room
will look very different to mine so how
how can I get the same object to show
for everyone that you know in some place
for them so you asking how do you create
the same experience that you have in
this room for someone else in another
room yes I could distribute my
application pretty man well if you do
that I would say you've you've probably
kind of raped the idea of a holographic
experience because you want them to use
whatever location they're in with your
app
so your app should it shouldn't matter
what room it's in it should just be well
I have this thing I'm gonna place it in
this location right so so every app you
create is always specific to the exact
location that you're building it for no
no no it's never this exaction no
location okay yeah does that make sense
yeah you don't want to build for this
room because what happens when people
take the hall ends and go into the next
room right you're creating you're
creating things that interact with the
world that they're in just like if you
happen to sit on that chair instead
right it's the same idea so if I've got
like five chairs in my room and I put
five different looking objects on those
five chairs yep so I've created it for
that environment do I have to get them
to set up five chairs as well no no no
you're not creating it for that
environment you're creating a whole so
extreme distance between the actual
glasses and like the lens itself and
what have you projected I think you
think you're thinking too too much about
the problem you need to understand what
people are trying to solve rather than
what you're going to give them because
it feels like you're saying hey I have
these really nice red couches and it
will look awesome if I put this yellow
blanket on it but you have green couches
so you need to get red couches to make
it look good right that's not the idea
you're gonna say oh you need blankets
sure what color would you want and you
just put it on there right it's you've
got to change the paradigm of what
you're trying to solve I think it's
probably the best way I can answer that
well god there's lots you got the mic
you choose how does this work with the
speech recognition and they sound when
you have multiple of these in the same
room isolated how much can you hear what
you if you stand next to someone who's
using Holland you can hear the sound
that they're hearing just faintly but
you can't you can't do speech
recognition for them unless you're
really close like it has to be really
close the whole collaboration idea of
multiple whole answers is still quite
new and there's some bugs in it but it
is possible to collaborate because
that's the whole idea I'll show a really
cool example a minute
collaboration yes um what would you be
able to like take two whole enza's and
put them on to other people but would
one person be able to like put something
down like they were playing Minecraft
and go on + and put something down and
the other one sees the same scene yeah
that's possible
absolutely that's its collaboration I
guess is the word that I was trying to
say but yeah if you have two people
seeing the same thing and having the
same experience you yeah absolutely
again this is very new and that's there
are some bugs I've been told I mean I
don't even have one hole as little and -
right but people that have to say you
can't do it but there's some bugs in the
way that you actually create that
collaboration still so it's still very
new take what's the mic okay another
couple of questions on - just do the
last bit yep what's the resolution can
you see the pixels you can't see the
pixels no the resolution oh god I
actually don't know I think it's 1280 by
720 maybe or that sort of thing I might
be different ratio but you don't notice
pixels you notice polygon shapes more so
if you have a rough object that with
less polygons you see that you don't see
the pixels no for the world persistence
yeah is it based on GPS and how well
does that work indoors then when you
leave the country said yeah leave the
country and come back how does it know
it is based on GPS I read this the
darker one I can't remember if I'm
honest there is very very detailed in
documentation on how that works but it
is GPS and it I'm not sure they did work
again I think it's magic
yeah all right I've got to have to keep
moving because otherwise we'll run out
of time yeah okay that's the demo so
what's next right because this is super
new like I don't even have a hololens by
the way you don't need a developer
application invitation you know loop to
get a whole as now you can just buy one
it's just three grand
us and you have to live in the North
America but no you can't they've open up
you can buy five at a time
if you want it to and for large
businesses there's now no barrier for
them to actually buy them and and start
developing for them so that's cool but
what's next for me there's a huge social
question around this because I don't
want this to happen if I'm honest you
could see like that could be a lot of
social issues with this because you're
seeing things that no one else is seeing
and are you overlaying things on people
and I you like are you you know privacy
issues moral issues all that sort of
stuff
the other thing is that you do lik look
like bit of a jerk it's not the best
look if I'm honest I probably should've
put a picture of myself here I had tried
one on yesterday as well and yeah it's
it's hopefully they get a little bit
less star trekky x-men type thing
because I'm not sure people walk around
with that even with Pokemon go sorry
like well we're geeks we probably would
right I mean I probably would but but
understand an older person's gonna hop
hop Wayne that crap hell no you know I
don't care if it cost 4 million dollars
yeah yeah sorry yeah well then you know
there's a hole in Google glass hole
right experiences so far have been very
elaborate right because they're selling
this device Microsoft is trying to show
what's possible I don't have all of mass
data that I can play with right I don't
have it as a visual thing I don't have a
3d rendering of the Mars rover right so
don't get you know don't get sucked into
this idea of oh I have to create you
know Star Trek in the real life type
thing right because it's it just gets
really overwhelming very very quickly
this is probably much more what I had in
mind
there are Maker kids maker toolkits that
comes as apps and you can actually you
can build there's a good example someone
building a rocket and then he's painting
and doing things with it in the hollow
as a hologram and then you can you know
you can imagine exporting it to a 3d
printer or something right or you'd give
it to designer and say ah put our logo
on this and this is gonna be awesome you
know give away her swag thing in a
conference those sort of things I think
are much more likely to be a first
generation app and then there's the
whole collaborative if I actually I
probably shouldn't tell you about the
ideas but I spoke to a potential
customer yesterday about hallo hallo
graphic application and they had an idea
that which is really quite thinking
beyond the whole dashboard thing and
right here basically how do you how do
you set up a room like if you go in here
how do I know how many chairs can fit in
here right like be out getting out
measuring tapes and chairs and
everything right so I mean it's not much
more elaborate than that so there are
certainly applications that are not the
master or project I want you to do this
but if you think what I just spoke about
is interesting and mildly interesting go
have a play whatever you do though don't
download this over the hotel Wi-Fi
here's a few gigs and worth of stuff but
it's readily available you can just get
it get it today and start playing with
it and it's free that should have said
wave six but I never imaged I said wave
six I'll just tell you they are shipping
waves now lots and lots and lots and
they are now shipping to whoever right
if you have spare cash or you can
commute your company that has an address
in the US you can buy them right and
speaking of developers doing cool stuff
here's the most simple idea so that has
probably the biggest impact I've seen so
what I think I'm going to do I think I'm
going to just simply put a sphere in the
middle of the bush
and then just go around and see what
areas are outside the sphere so he's
dreaming them it's through the hololens
his and capturing the video I don't know
let's see what happens I'm gonna try it
out and show you guys
whenever I get it done so this is what
it looks like after Timmy I think I did
a pretty decent job let me show you
without the sphere which by their ways
no polygons so it's not quite spiracle
so I it's not that great and I could you
know keep going if I wanted to that's
good enough so this is what it looks
like I think it's pretty good I just
needed to grow a little bit more so I
can trim it a little better but I'm
pretty happy with it and that's how
hololens can help you do gardening all
right how simple is that
ah he's obviously no designer cuz he
just found out there's a sphere clunk
right but I there's no way he would have
done that without the Hollande's or some
sort of sisters right that was that
would be like years of practice and I
would imagine and it's just such a
simple idea so why try and reinvent the
wheel when you can do something as
simple that just because he's thinking
as a holographic experience right I
don't know if my mum would run around
with the hole and stuff to do cutting
still and then you have the other end of
the spectrum if you are Microsoft and
you have lots and lots of cash and you
have access to really cool technology
you get to do something like this hi
today we're gonna show you an exciting
new technology that could fundamentally
change the way that people will
communicate in the future imagine being
able to virtually teleport from one
space to another in real time hey Sergio
how does it feel like to be Halle ported
it is created in quartet so so chose to
wear his hololens device
and I'm gonna wear mine we can see each
other in full 3d in real time we can
interact and communicate as if with
co-present so Joe can you walk around my
space
you were crying this chair so we're
doing everything to give the impression
that Sergio and I are present in the
same space so do let's just do a
high-five that's great Thank You Sergio
we call this technology hala plantation
so obviously you need millions of
dollars to do this right now right
because it requires 3d cameras it
requires not having a hotel Wi-Fi you
know it requires lots of stuff did you
did you don't we just don't have but
this is this is the future this is an
idea of what is possible right if you
did follow my tweets there will be a
link to much longer version of this it's
really interesting right it's a five
minute video and how they explain how to
do it so that was pretty much what I had
I hope I've sort of peaked you
appetizers for this and again if you
don't have a Holland's no big deal you
can still play around with it and
develop for it right
is there any final questions you have
eight seconds no yes I have two really
three really quickly battery life hello
about three hours cool second one is
where can we play them in Australia
where can we play with them in Australia
nowhere okay cool bo buddies can you
catch sorry can you catch can I catch
yes I can catch oh good catch thank you
okay one more
yes does any official wording or like
hardware revisions or hardware revisions
no I don't know the question I always
get is when is when are we going to have
a consumer version and I don't know I'm
guessing end of next year something like
that like it's not now for sure but yeah
I just don't know
again I don't work with Microsoft on
this at all I just have a keen interest
in it just I just want to mention this
pub hunt is on tonight I think there's
no more tickets left I don't actually
know but dear
ignite talks five minute talks slides
rotate every 15 seconds and they're
super funny mainly because people forget
what they wrote so if you want that's
somewhere
in the CBD in a hotel and I'm doing one
as well on a straight Internet that's so
much material that's all I had thanks
