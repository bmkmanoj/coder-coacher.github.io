guess this was the subtle sign that i
should start right oh yeah i have the
sign from the back okay cool guys really
really welcoming this beautiful evening
in London I'm again impressed that you
made it it's afternoon and as I said
like slightly before before a few other
people joined oh yes please some other
people joining so nice so as I said
usually the time when people just depart
work not necessary sit and listen to the
conference talks I am really really
impressed and feel privileged that you
are here also know that the competition
now it's stronger I've seen the other
talks which are in parallel so I'm
really really happy that you are here I
feel welcome this dog will be about
delivering software surprise so not
necessarily delivering unicorn because i
think that the indian our goal is to
deliver something working and nice
unicorn our industries and synonym of
some game changer gamebreaker that
basically is amazing not many of them
unfortunately and sometimes our reality
is less colorful than the tail of this
beautiful p she pushing i have on them
on the screen may only because you know
we keep adding and adding stuff you are
keep changing our minds and basically
it's everything's a bit blurry so who I
am my name is kasia and i'll be your
host today and how many of you have
twitter perfect feel free to tweet the
slides are handmade i draw them myself
so some of them are hilarious there is
my twitter handle as well and also i
took care to put it on every slide
because i know that my cernan and my
name so my twitter handle might be
challenging as you may guess I'm not
from England Arjun I am from Poland
however I'm london-based and a bit of my
background I'm Adele person so and when
I was back home
croco I was running Quranic adrenaline
enthusiasts amitabh I was helping to
corrigan eyes agile in Europe conference
in Krakow and also in other places and
I'm part of agile in Europe community so
I'm agile person but during this talk
you'll see a bit of the bitter size of
agile as well especially in the
corporate kind of dimension and here if
you want to contact me feel free to
tweet me you can try to email me however
myself and emails he I have a bit of a
lag in responding if you tweet me I
probably will be faster and may only
because Twitter had character count
still it's like limited so it's easier
to from the question and grabbed a quick
answer i also have a blog so feel free
to reach out ok so a bit of my history
and what I'm actually doing so I started
my work in IT department internal one as
a software engineer administrator
basically technical person and then
because the project were really
demanding they try to find some product
manager business analyst who can
understand the software under the
business and tada they found me so I
transit us to the more product role so
the adventure in the internal IT
department I would say nice in a sense
because you can reach out their business
you basically see the people right you
can reach out and go to the coffee with
them you can arrange lunch you can
basically interact so even the agile can
be easier for you because the thing
around the communication collaboration
you know all those things that we should
be over it's actually by the reach of
your hand so this experience was a
pretty nice hunted from that perspective
then my career progressed and I switched
and I moved to the software house so
software house again really really wants
to be agile because it's trendy this is
one thing another thing
if you are not advertising yourself
other agile the client companies are
think oh no they are not doing it right
we don't know what agile is but because
everyone in the industry does it and
this software has doesn't it means that
it's something wrong there so what
happens big companies software houses
want to really really force agile and
they have for instance beautiful Gump
chart until it oh yeah yeah we have like
one year plan ahead or five years plan
ahead but we are a job so this is the
reality cooperation as well it's not so
easy and reaching out to your users or
to your business partners also heart
because suddenly you have the whole
karaoke like salespeople marketing
people product managers project managers
and summer in the end you have
development team and in order to read
your client or your user anyone
basically you need to pass all those
silos so again communications more
challenging so what was next so after
having experiences in here and here so
in like both kind of realities I moved
to the consulting so what can tell don't
do well we deliver slide we've advising
what you can do better right and here I
have small disclaimer those opinions are
my own even though I am a consultant and
I hope to not only show you okay what
are the wrong things because I think
that nothing is wrong we are trying we
are trying to adapt and sometimes we
have constraints right so we need to try
to operate in those constraints and try
to make things better in the our small
word so i hope that i will show you a
bit of a journey when you were just go
together and see okay where are the
troubles what are our scenes and where
is the hope so how we can fix it and
where are the point where we can
actually add a bit of the value by
changing small habits
and basically one important things
contacts attacking so before even I
progress I quickly want to ask you guys
how many of you are from London I mean
like working in London ok few more hands
ok so there's a few of travel is ok how
many of you are working in the corporate
world so I mean like them company bigger
than 500 people ok few hands bigger than
100 ok any startups ok anyone who is not
working in finals two hands three ok ok
so a bit of context as well as from my
perspective I will move to this model
connected with more like not really
working directly with the customer or
client or user so basically we are in
software house or we are in some
external company that built something
for that people who are then buying it
and using it it might be also a vendor
so even if it's like outsourcing model
so we are a vendor building bespoke
software for some other company those
interactions are similar ok so again
before i move forward how many of you
have the direct contact with your
clients or users or customers or however
we call them perfect so hopefully you'll
find some useful tips here as well to
how to reach out so we'll see but this
is basically there than the main focus
ok so what are the troubles with the
project with the companies that are
basically doing the software so first of
all sometimes we just don't realize the
statistics that are pretty brutal big
project by big I mean oven over 1
million pounds and basically scope
written down for longer than a year are
failing more frequently than
smaller one those are the research that
was done in 2012 but I've seen recent
ones and they were exactly the same what
this indicates so first of all when we
need to manage complexity we are simply
failing if something is small complexity
is smaller and it's easier to deliver it
in time and budget so what those colors
means failure means that it was the tool
or applications wasn't deployed on the
production of all if we have changes it
means that we change the scope budget or
the timeline so green l three components
are were mad at least in theory so also
what it says that okay if we are
delivering website probably will be on
time but if we are rewriting ERP system
for our company and we have the really
huge time really huge project which is
not the couple for smaller phrases we
probably will be late again this is
statistics we may hope that we are the
lucky ten percent in my career I haven't
seen project that was sculpt for longer
than a year that actually didn't have
any changes again why because also
environment around the companies that
were working in is changing so sometimes
it's not our fault it's basically the
words if this is how its functioning
registration changes requirements
changes there's a lot of stuff happening
what else can actually go wrong in the
model when we have the big projects this
is the thing that I call watermelon
watermelon reporting so what we usually
have obviously whatever it is agile or
water for or whatever people want to
have visibility so they want like status
reports maybe some showcases other stuff
that basically indicates our progress to
the goal so let's say that we have this
lovely project that takes a year so this
is still I would say reasonable because
I've seen usually that projects are like
five years scheduled or three years or
something like this and
we are having some progress stuff right
and we think okay we are fine right so
we are like running with lovely
watermelon and then suddenly we are like
week before the deployment and we just a
cover that project is ready so we are
dropping the watermelon and basically
even though outside was green surprise
it's not finished surprise something
some stuff are not working as they
designed and there's a lot of stuff that
we don't know that they are not working
happen frequently and it's a bad wheel
basically we are failing in managing
complexity especially because we are not
working as a in the void right we have
another projects and other integrations
and other applications that need to talk
to our application so there is a plenty
of other stuff that we are not taking
into account and then suddenly there's
delivery date in we discover that we
have nothing or maybe we have only the
documentation which is not necessarily
the aim of the project again another
thing that's why this happened so while
we have the green watermelon and then we
are suddenly right we are basically
afraid why because if we just say that
we are not on track maybe someone will
stop investing right especially if we
are in the model that we are like
something external so we are software
house vandor or even IT department
because really frequently is the center
of costs not the center of basically
profit right we frequently are not
revenue generated and surprisingly even
if we're in the software house and we
are revenue generated also our project
can get killed if we will be honest and
say sorry we are right sometimes I would
say like not really real threat because
if we have transparency we can mitigate
the risks it really depends on the
company culture again there is also
another viewpoint of this
even though it's hard sometimes you need
to admit okay this process is going to
nowhere so instead of investing we
should kill it or shall chops it for
smaller things or do something right
it's not easy decision because first of
all you have plenty of people working
there right so we as a human beings feel
really attached to the stuff that we are
doing at least I hope that we do i
usually do so I just assume as well as I
engineers I always was working with they
were really connected deeply with the
software that we are doing so it also
can be a bit personal so that's why we
need to apply to abstract it and say
okay those are the boundaries where we
need to say stop also what happened is
we have forced agile by the first agile
I'm saying development team is at your
hands and everyone else is working in
the old waterfall manner and no one
actually cares about the springs and the
one basically understand us and they are
not really even able to understand why
we are so reluctant in for instance
giving estimates right and on the other
hand we also don't really understand why
they are pushing us for estimate if it
doesn't mean anything because we will
change the scope anyway right so why to
bother to estimate so in order to
understand both sides we need a bit of
empathy right because well business
needs some kind of predictability they
want to know when they will get the
stuff and working and on the other hand
we also need a bit of flexibility in
order to be able to adapt because in the
end of the day we just want to shorten
our time to market right so if we are
having this long term plan this means we
did not have no visibility so they are
pushing us for estimates if we try to
release earlier so this is also
connected with the structure of our
project if its planned for five years
and relief is on the end of it
we will have a lot of push around okay
give us the estimate give us the future
least give us whatever and even if we
have some small scram things that
pretends to be agile and pretend to be
basically fully flexible we are actually
guessing that the end product will be
good because we have no visibility again
if you are working in a sector that is
for instance finance i sometimes can't
understand of delivering of only half of
the product because for instance is
checking calculating the interest or
something really important and then it's
really hard to decouple it but maybe
instead of putting everything we can
make the modules and deliver the modules
instead of the whole product so again
this is the conversations and trying to
figure it out how to shorten this in
order to provide the visibility and
transparency so we don't get the push
from the business about the estimates
timelines scope and basically
requirements written down five years
ahead so this is usually addressing
duration okay and what are the scene so
frequently we have no product vision
what I mean by this is not like trying
to be innovative right because again
people say that okay we if we ask our
users what they want they will lie to us
surprisingly sometimes that is the truth
and obviously we need to innovate I'm
not saying now but sometimes you also
need to do some research and try to
figure it out they feedback loops to see
what we are actually building and what
is the end goal of our application to
basically not end like something not
usable so if we start to build a
helicopter and then figure it out maybe
they tank in the end we can end up with
the product that actually does nadir of
the things because it's too heavy to fly
and too awkward to be dt right so we
have something that no one can use
and again if we try to switch our vision
constantly we are changing the dream and
we cannot reach the end goal which is
money we are not the charity right so we
need to deploy in order to have the
basically feed bag and then maybe more
investments of the different new
features if we keep changing our minds
and experimenting without clear goal its
heart okay if we are startups there is a
joke that started the trouble begins
when they get the customers because
before when they have only founding it's
fun right but in the reality we need
funding to basically get our salaries
done so the longer we are switching our
opinion and longer we're shuffling the
ideas the longer we just postpone
getting paid so this is also important
and that's why we also should shorten
time to market and if you speak with
business people and they have the
travelling understanding you can show
them this okay the shorter the time the
market is the quicker you get paid so
this is also another advantage of agile
because it means that we can start
building quicker and may be a bit tough
especially as we are usually speaking
energy in the context of oh my god how
cooperation important is right on the
other hand we also need to remember that
we have business partners who are
obviously generous and they care about
the cooperation communication and other
values but they want to get paid they
want to get their revenue and this is
brutally speaking even more important
than the values so if you want to
convince something someone this is one
of the methods okay another thing is so
once we are not really decided or even
if we decided we have a lot of black and
we have like a huge backlog five years
ahead one of the backlog I've seen had
10,000 user stories and they also
claimed that they are agile
so what's the trouble with big backlog
is you have no transfer and see what is
in it people think that if something is
written down it's safe and it will get
delivered if you have too many user
stories Ike warranty you that it's not
working and people don't know their your
priorities as well because how to get
the priorities out of 10,000 user
stories you can do like army of product
people who are actually doing only
dislike managing the user stories trying
to quarrel between each other but it
doesn't actually move the scope forward
and again I've seen the product that
helps sorry it's a bit farming to
developers and maybe you can guess how
many of product managers they had 42
developers okay I'd I felt somewhere for
for any other guesses and a tie it
wasn't that bad it was seven so you were
the closest but again this is like
hilarious raesha the project was planned
for five years to developers and
physically seven product managers which
is not the right balance right so if you
want to deliver something and even you
know that it's big just first think
about how to maybe chop it for smaller
bits employ more people who can actually
code because this will bring you more
success than actually shifting to user
stories and again there miss of agile
that we have no documentation guys if we
have 5,000 10,000 or even a thousands of
user stories it's like documentation
right it's just different formats so
basically it doesn't solve the issue
okay next thing so if we have the clear
vision which you are happy with what
frequently happens we put it in the
linear manner and we have roadmap and
suddenly out of the road map starts to
be like commitment and other people
expect that our features will
be delivered certain time line again in
on the one hand it's really good to have
clear direction but there is a bit of a
trap that if we don't deliver another
project we'd get late so I'm not saying
that we shouldn't have the road maps I
will show you the trick that we can have
that makes the road but not in error
linner oh so it's harder to put the
exact date and again even if you don't
put the date there will be the project
manager or someone from the business set
who see during your stress one by
another and they will figure out the
magical formula in Excel apply it the
other dates beautiful things right okay
another thing is gold plating we just
believe that we are able to do the stuff
better next time and basically you just
keep building and building and building
right because we can do it better well
surprisingly and not necessarily
especially we have no feedback loops it
might have sense if you build something
one show it to customers make some
research try to figure it out how to
improve it based on the feedback you get
and then improve if it just basically
asked trying to iterate of the stuff
that was never ever deployed will get
nowhere and again I was working in one
of the companies back home that had the
project which was like only five years
old and they were just rebuilding the
features without even deploying to
customer so if you have enough money you
can invest but again it's not the
variable state because the patience of
the business also will end at some point
and they will cut the investment and it
will be painful for everyone okay so
quickly before i move to the next part
let me recap so what are the main things
that we should focus on and try to
communicate also to our business
partners so as of all if you see big
projects
you can refer to the statistics i am
sharing the slides and inside there is a
reference to the article with activities
so smaller projects are easier there is
less complexity and there is
statistically bigger chance that will
deliver it so if we can cut it for
smaller pictures it's better again what
happened with the complexity we are bad
as a human being to manage the
complexity and usually win the end up in
water mother water molar sorry
watermelon reporting so it basically
means that we think that we are green
and in the end of the project we have
suddenly red and no one knows why again
we also need to think especially at the
beginning of the project that we see
that it's big when to say stops if at
the beginning we agree that after
reaching certain level of investment we
are stopping or disco king or doing
something with the project it will be
easier later on to make this kind of
decision if we don't build in before
security checks later on it starts to
getting personal and it's getting more
and more difficult to do anything with
project that is too long again I'm
speaking from my own experience because
we were rescuing project to which had
like five years old and didn't have any
customer right so you can do it but
basically it's getting harder and harder
with every day and next one basically
trying to figure it out how to shorten
this week but sorry time to market
because otherwise we just continue
investing and try to figure it out the
road them in a way that it's not literal
so we are not going creating
dependencies and commitment as well as
trying to reduce the size of the backlog
so these are the scenes of the corporate
world you can see them also in like the
smaller companies in my first company
are working in internal IT department we
have actually seen our issues it was a
bit easier to solve them because we can
talk directly to the customers here this
whole piece you need to
I talked with multiple people also you
can start with your own team in order to
improve the situation also we frequently
forget that in the end of the chain
there is like real person who is
actually waiting for our software
because it solves the oil business need
a real issue and it is something that
someone is looking for so we need to
discover this person to find the proper
vision what frequently happens
especially if we have like blank page
and can't figure out what we actually
want to do which I don't know what is
actually worth being having like the
situation of too many ideas and pulling
a different direction having blank page
those are pretty bad but if we have the
blank page there are the ways to
basically find they need and find the
person and we can start by doing
research by doing some heuristics
connected with asking people for the
opinion okay what is the best approach
what would you like to see you can try
to reach out to the users and again in
our industry that I would say that it
divided opinion okay shall we exit speak
with them or maybe we should only ask
key users or our business sponsors I
would say the do we need to diversify
internally if we have the blank page and
we don't know what to do instead of
having ridiculous requirement only to
make developers busy mega hackathon
maybe we'll figure it out ourselves and
brilliant feature that will help us to
bring something nice to our product so
there is multiple more manners but again
there is a question if we are generating
those ideas how to avoid this because
those things may be pretty random and if
we don't have sense of direction we may
end up with again having troubles so my
advice is try to do a bit of stuff
called product free this is taken
expression is taken from the book called
innovation games eh
We strongly advise because there is a
lot of good ideas over there then we can
take abstract Emma just our Alamo usage
I actually adapted this one for them few
companies I worked in so what you can do
here first of all you try to sit out
with people and talk fast in order to
produce the high level ideas which need
to fit into the toasted maybe i will
quickly show you and put them on the
branches that means that you need to
structure your thinking in a certain
manner so you can later on the couple
and say okay I'm delivering only this
and this is one module or maybe I'm only
delivering this which is like outside
this is not visible here I doubt this
time box those are inside the time box
and then I'm tackling the next things
this also helps to say okay what are the
modules how we can separate things
especially when we talk with business
people would not necessarily understand
our code dependencies but they
understand the tree they know that tree
has a branch and branch can't suddenly
merge together because it's not how the
nature designed it so if you want to
basically described okay why you need
microservices architecture and why you
need to the couple things you can use
this analogy and it's easier to people
to relate to because they know it and
they see the nightly basis if you try to
abstract it a bit more it's getting more
challenging because people don't really
understand our language okay so how to
prepare it effectively again branford
the ideas before maybe how he shouldn't
use the name brain stir because I'm not
really believing it this method but ask
people for ideas write them down and on
the session just discuss and put them in
the correct places make the homework
make pre-requisite make the tree
yourself take the stakeholders into one
room and discuss why that much in that
manner instead of generating ideas in
the room it's faster if you have
business people who really don't really
want to spend time with the
allotment in for various reason either
will be easier to convince them to spend
an hour with you rather than whole day
of generating and ideas also you can see
overall view of the application and
easier to create this vision out of it
rather than doing it life and then you
can refine you need on this kind of
session business stakeholders and
technical stakeholders and security and
all other people who are involved or
their representatives to again have the
understanding but it is like them one of
the acceptable basically go further so
basically quickly recapping if we have
no product vision and we are struggling
with this first thing we can try to do
the research heuristics and in order to
not to suffer from pulling the different
directions and having them timeless of
other stuff with your roadmap product
tree which is nice way of structuring
your ideas and taking only stuff that
are in the current time box and leading
the stuff that are outside it for later
again the next trouble was too big
backlog and if we have this this is like
the first step to do the minimum so how
we can actually do it so first of all
understanding what we are building so
based on the stuff that is in the
current steinbach so inside the tree we
can try to figure out what is the key
business process and this is
surprisingly new LT for a lot of people
because they have no clue what their
application is supposed to do it does
plenty of things but they don't really
relate why people are buying it so
sometimes if we discover that current
manual processes I don't know taking in
this case ages and our applications help
us to cut the time very half and only by
doing automation of few steps it helped
us to see okay so we need to deliver our
neediest we don't need another things
and also will help us to understand that
if we break something here so this
timeline will
longer again people won't be happy so
this is also like universal measurement
and understanding what we need to build
again especially as when we are at the
beginning of the term journey we really
want to find only game changers and do
you now brilliant stuff but sometimes we
need to think okay maybe when we are
doing the first thing and first scope or
even like the next releases we should
think more about okay what is the
showstopper when we cannot really deploy
without the feature and focus on
delivering them first it's a bit hard
especially that we have a lot of plenty
good ideas so finding out what actually
brings the diwali to the application
again in strongly connected with
understanding the business process and
how people are working again another
painful thing especially if you were
like and our application has a plenty of
beautiful features but we can't deploy
them because they are not finished and
we love them but basically this is
something we really really need to do so
if we have a lot of stuff in progress
again or hide it or just remove it and
there's still a lot of temptation
especially i just notices on the project
management side and basic product
management side oh you know we need only
five days to finish finish this we need
only two days to finish this and maybe
three days to finish this but then it
adds up and we never finish so again
that's why we need to try to basically
reduced work in progress another thing
that breaks the heart of a lot of people
is accepting that we won't be perfect
for the first time this is the trouble
with the gold plating as well right so
we really want to do it right and we
again have this assumption that if we
will be right for the first time we'll
just concur the market and everything
will be good
surprisingly there is well no
application that was perfect for the
first time people love to put the iphone
as an example of the device that was
perfect from the beginning guys I don't
know if you remember but iphone couldn't
send the picture of a message on the
beginning and all other smartphone could
so it's not like this we really need to
eat right and the sooner we start
iterating and getting the feedback the
better because you will be closer to the
perfection again reducing backlog sighs
it's scary and it's so scary because
then we lose the confidence that we
actually remember about the features and
this is the thing that also products you
can help us so again tackle only
disturbed or inside the time box that we
are referring to the tables can be two
weeks a month a year even and put as a
high level ideas everything else don't
detail it down why because you lose the
time the requirements will change and
you just lost a couple of hours to write
down requirements groom them and then
estimate them right so this is waste and
business will also see the difference if
they also notice that okay we are
remembering because we have the sky
level idea somewhere but we are first
tackling the most important things okay
so how to create the dream backlog
because again we have those stuffs we
just discussed which are in the middle
of the tree and this is the car at
current time box but not necessarily
means that we should take everything in
and this is the matrix I really propose
loss versus ROI ROI is basically man you
return on investment because we are not
charity love it's something that refers
to our application I'm recently billing
building a lot of heavy mass algorithm
and the allocation and jeans and this
kind of stuff so for me performance is
the key we are measuring everything
against the performance of our
application if we lost one second
somewhere it's crucial and we cannot
afford
right so every feature that we are
taking we are trying to put on this
scale saying okay if we can have money
of it and if it pays how it influenced
our performance is it not influencing it
in the middle if it improves its towards
our heart if it's getting worse we just
push it here so then we are taking our
idea from the type of that we have from
the business and stakeholders
conversation and try to basically try
like really roughly estimated again
don't waste time on it because this is
something that only help us to figure
out where are our features again we are
detailing down first this then we need
to apply a bit of a common sense if we
have security requirements here because
doesn't actually bring any ROI and it
doesn't improve any performance then we
also need to take it why because if
someone tells our customer data and God
forbid we are working for a bank right
and someone will steal the passwords of
the online banking accounts of our
customers we are just dead so we need to
have the common sense applied here as
well and how we can look again posted so
at this level of the ideas are high
level so we haven't yet waste of time to
detail them down whatever I can we do
because frequently this is a lot still
and we cannot Delhi very quickly we can
also use really high level metrics in
order to try to measure stuff but
without numbers so again if it improves
or is it not improving our situation how
it's working we are taking the backlog
and tricky business processes that we
recognize in application so again in my
case it would be performance of them
maybe allocation algorithm performance
of the rendering algorithm that helped
us to show the outcomes and maybe query
time so I'm taking each of the each of
the cards and let's say that I'm
actually having them and in which
calculate the ticket prices for airlines
right so if I'm focusing on the
performance and a half like brilliant
idea maybe people want to query by the
color of the aircraft it's new trendy
feature our marketing people said that
it will basically make our customers to
love us and then we discover okay in
order to deliver it we need to connect
with some database in China which is
pretty dodgy and basically makes our
software take longer to respond with the
prices because we need to connect and
break the Chinese wall and maybe it's
not the best idea but maybe it influence
positively on another thing and why I
actually suggested three things to check
because then we can measure the first
thing will tell us if we are taking it
or not if we have for them if we have 22
it's hard to the side one frequency is
not objective enough and basically if
you have more we are increasing
complexity of the whole exercise and
you're wasting time again all the
fingers keep it high level he look like
our duck filling just to have the first
indication what we are taking and what
we are delivering first then you can
have the proper measurement trying to
figure it out the performance
assumptions everything once you have
picked their key things you want to
deliver and this is the the easiest way
to actually deal with the backlog that
is already too big so we are taking the
stuff from it trying to rationalize it
in a sense taking the stuff that
improves your current situation and
gives you money applying a bit of the
common sense and taking also de
important non-functional requirements or
functional requirement that makes your
application stable secure and so on and
keep those things really lights touch so
gut feeling and basically things more or
less and again I met few people who are
really keen on estimates saying but you
know we are so good at estimating that
we can forecast the future and I really
really
I'm really impressed I didn't have yet
the ability of having the crystal ball
and being a scooter destinations so
that's why I'm actually advising this
one again why if we have the study team
that is able to estimate fine but again
it's takes time so why to weigh very
driven wasted maybe once we have
detailed requirements we can try to
residual estimate especially that
business usually feels more comfortable
when they see the estimate no matter if
it right or work estimate but on the
other hand wasting time over it it's not
necessarily the best idea okay the last
thing basically what we can do if we
have reversed things so we have like too
many features but basically still no
customers right so we have this crazy
loop that no one used the product so
let's try what we can build next I'm
surprised still people are not using it
why because we have too much cost a
complexity and i love the example from
the microsoft lync this was the instant
messenger that microsoft a bit and it
was integrated with all talk right now
they have skype so i am not really
certain how it's working but there was
like brilliant feature that they did it
was synchronizing your link with deck
also calendar south brilliant but what
happened outlook slowed down so instead
of clicking and being able to add the
meeting so what this is what out of
users do send emails and spam you with
the meeting invites right so they really
want to have meeting invite sent
instantly because it was synchronizing
with link and asking link for response
it took like two seconds and it was not
acceptable for standard out of user who
were used to just clicking and standing
right so this is the example of the
feature that actually broke something
else in the different
system maybe it was nice but again
sometimes we need to validate and think
okay what was the core purpose because
maybe the think that we are doing now
it's not really related with our
application and breaks other stuff okay
again 30 date and this is something that
we tend to forget to do and I have to
say in the item that they don't know if
we're the only guilty one or maybe other
industry does the same but we just
assume that we are right we have the
most brilliant idea ever we are
deploying it also this is the disease of
the big companies we have the self
people marketing people or whoever else
who might do the research but not
necessarily share reasoning behind it
with our booth us with our colleagues in
the IT department and we don't basicly
see the validation happening so instead
of having this cycle that it's known by
agency right so this is basically okay
these are people when they're doing
their management courses they always see
it so it's not new it's Deming cycle
it's basically something that we should
also incorporate but in our industry
sounds argan oil tea we have multiple of
articles people discovering this all
over again maybe having like slightly
different names and then the reality is
that we built sometimes we check our
users because the 21st century we just
applied like the Google Analytics so we
track but we forget about this piece
like learning and applying anything i
would so that i would say that measuring
is already a success but again measuring
frequency is not because we want to
learn we just want to have more data in
order to the sophisticated customer
tracking not necessarily improving their
life so basically we should actually
think how we need to design our feedback
loop in order to be
productive and be able to improve our
software in the manner that helped us to
basically better on the market so each
time when we are we are designing our
new features let's ask ourselves again
what's the key business process and
built around it okay maybe some
prototypes different ways of supporting
the same business process let's try to
figure it out okay watching it to
observe in this business process and
what we actually need to measure and
basically ask people okay whoa what are
your showstoppers what you don't like
our application because again if we want
to measure something we need to answer
the question okay what we are measuring
and frequency measuring just clicks and
where people are clicking clicking
doesn't gives us an answer because we
even didn't answer the question right we
can you know I'm also working with the
big data and we are a bit of guilty of
like finding the patterns right so
before even thinking about asking
questions you are just jumping and
thinking yes big data gives us an answer
but we don't know the question so even
if you've read the hitchhiker's for the
galaxy but this was the famous answer 42
but no one knows the question so this is
similar thing we may measure stuff but
we if we don't figure out what is the
his business process what is the key
things that we are doing we are not
having the right questions and basically
these leads as well to gold plating
because we just read you the stuff
without even understanding what we are
doing ok so quickly to basically figure
out what we can do better with type of
getting rid of the Nura doing stuff s
understanding what we are building and
building on top of that measurement and
learning system so we can incorporate
the feedbacks and again a lot of people
are saying about a lot of methods how to
do measurements
but not necessary speaking the context
of the business problem itself so I
think this is the missing link we need
to think about okay being mindful of
time that we have like 10 minutes left I
quickly wrap up and give you a chance to
ask some questions or run away because
it's right your choice okay so quickly
wrapping up how we can improve our
situation so first of all instead of
having linear roadmap try to have
something fun product tree for instance
it can be also simple mind maps anything
that is not linear there's a plenty of
ideas around try to figured out of the
stuff that we want to build what are the
must-haves again there is this magical
MVP I would say that this is the one of
the ways you can create it again use a
bit of the common sense just to not get
to the trap of building only the
required thing and forgetting for
instance about the security remember
that feedback loop is something that you
need to also design and think about it's
not just applying google analytics to
your tool and hoping that all yeah it's
enough you can have plenty of other
ideas remember to find out what actually
your sister is supporting so what of the
business call you need to achieve with
your tool and find the show breakers
first to deploy and then try to innovate
more my favorite one remember that at
the beginning the best way of getting
somewhere is just assuming that we are
wrong and our estimates are wrong so
don't waste time under ok this is
quickly from myself I hope that you
enjoyed and I hope you put the green
card on later on do you have any
questions yes
okay so may I ask one a health question
so one is so are you doing something for
your IT internal IT department or you
are like software vendor company okay so
you are in house so the question was how
to convince business partners to
hackathons if you are in that in the
context that you are building something
in health okay so advantage of people in
house so first of all you can prove that
you have a bit of a business knowledge
yourselves because you are building the
financial things for your company for a
certain period of time and also you can
try to convince ok we can disrupt a bit
because we have the business knowledge
already because we work in this industry
for you so we are internal people and we
know the technology so also times put
few examples from like clean tech
startups that are doing in the rate of
things that won't be possible in the
traditional environment mainly because
you have plans and other stuff so this
can be additional value added for the
company because all day to innovate
phloem from the technology perspective
that it's not that business people
usually simply are not as advanced as we
so this could be one of the things yeah
any other questions see that everyone
wants to run away for a beer okay so oh
no we have one question okay control I
delete the question was how I saw the
10,000 item I think so this was the one
of the projects when I went actually I
think I have a bit of the bad luck bad
luck because
the first project i joined was four
years late than another project i joined
was five years rate the first project i
joined was only two years late so i
usually was phased basically facing this
kind of issue so really huge backlog and
already late projects so then when i was
doing more consulting and discomfort oh
my god there could be also like small
projects it was so nice and refreshing
and i discovered yet you can do this
stuff as well they're turning to your
question and they need to trouble with
the huge backlog is lack of trust there
is a plenty of people speaking about to
trust as well so we don't have trusted
if we delete all the stuff it will ever
get down and we have this nice thinking
in the business partners but if it's
written down and if a practical number
will ever do it and so what we did
particularly with this we just assume
that everything is one story point even
it wasn't and put the estimate that
something so if it let's say the
development team does one story point
per week and everything is one story
part and you have one 1,000 or 10,000
items you can say oh yeah this will be
done by 10 years do you still want it
and then people usually say oh my god I
needed tomorrow and they start to
realize that if they have this big queue
it's simply impossible to do this number
of staff with the current capacity of
the team they have maybe it would be
different if we have I don't know a few
thousands of people but then another the
complexity and basically is better to
divide the project order to do it in
that pic matter right so this was the
first thing another thing was also
convincing people that okay if we have
this backlog and plant and commitments
we cannot basic you react to the market
excellent example was when few years
back Apple introduced them fingerprint
login so a lot of customers including
myself I switched my online banking to
have fingerprint login because I
couldn't remember my password and all
the security things were so hilarious to
do an apple introduced it and there was
like one
on the market that had the app with
fingerprint login I just switched back
out especially that if you are like
individual consumer you go to the places
where the staff our easier for you
because the products are not that much
different right so the same is for
whatever you are doing people will be
lazy and we'll do the stuff that is
easier for them so if there is a place
for innovation and putting something new
to the backlog new in the time serving
appears on the market and you have
enough flexibility to switch your
attention and plans you just do it and
you are keeping your retaining your
customers or users even in the corporate
world right from future few years where
every few years people are validating
the tools and unless you are a safety so
the tool that you come up your place
then you are in endangered that someone
will think oh yeah maybe we should
switch the vendor right even the HIPAA
would say in modern word with the
startups and all the destructive manners
it's not totally safe for long so again
this is the one of the examples I'm
really using so being able to be
flexible another thing even the stuff
which is in the backlog and we'll be
done in 10 years brings no value so
control I did it yeah any other
questions ok so thank you for your
attention you have contacts to need you
in case you have some questions and have
a lovely evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
