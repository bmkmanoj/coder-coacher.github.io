Andrea mag norske and I've been a
developer for like a ridiculous amount
of time in my experience and you know
what because I suffered being a
developer for a very long time like
maybe fifteen sixteen years which is a
significant part of my life you're lucky
I've done the same exactly that's more
or less what we're going to talk about
so and in this picture you see here this
is a party with animals and this animals
are like oh great we're in a party and
it's great and so why am Wyatt why do I
have this picture here you know it's
very confusing well we're going to be
talking about the paradigms of
programming languages and the problems
you see when you when you use two
different paradigms in the different
programming languages and I kind of
equate this to a party because there's
all this you know in a party you
generally have like a friend that is
like one way a friend that does reg X
right that we all have a friend does reg
X and you have some other stuff or
friends that like like pressing up so
it's kind of like very diverse thing we
started the programming languages so
there's some disclaimers and when you
see when we talk about any of this stuff
generators that you know when someone
says something like FRP is definitely
the tool for doing GUI programming there
is a bunch of context attached to that
and obviously based on your context
you'd see different things so in this
typical elephant example you know all
these people that are touching the
elephants are blind and are looking at
this and going like ah this elephant is
kind of like a tree if you don't have
the context of that person everything
goes to this value so really important
and everything I say here so basically
if you catch me saying something that
you don't agree this with this because
probably I have some different context
another problem this is all the
disclaimers before I actually start I am
Irish and so I say a bunch of things
that are sound weird sometimes so I just
thought that I just give you the heads
up so if I say ask for the crack I don't
mean the drugs I mean you know
anyway now that we're all ready I think
and this is bacon I am really really
happy that bacon was actually able to
join me here and bacon is a developer as
well he's been delivering software for
like 15 years and it is really
interesting he's very excited to be here
and bacon has delivered production
software in Delfy this will basic dot
net and be v6 c-sharp Java JavaScript
when jQuery was new remember those times
right and so he did some GWT as well he
did some F sharp this is when he started
learning about functional programming
and he got really excited yeah because
it's like oh my god all these problems
that I don't I'm not going to have
anymore and and it's great then he did
some Scala right so it's like he had to
learn all these new JVM stuff and you
know it's slightly different but kind of
the same and very excited so he started
learning about this things that you get
with with functional programming right
you get like oh I'm now thinking about
referential transparency and which is
that thing that helps make basically
makes you think great I'm going to
replace this expression with a value and
the program still works the way it used
to so when you start thinking about that
there's a bunch of side effects that
come out of that which are for example
writing concurrent code is easier and
stuff like that and with functional
forming you tend to do stuff with
immutable data structures meaning that
again a lot of problems kind of just go
away and it is a little bit of a trick
to learn how to do it but it's really
good so no exceptions for pro kleh prop
for row control and so basically what
you do instead of garlic I have an error
no we don't do that anymore
we deal with it with types or maybe we
deal with it in a different way
and there's all this stuff so bacon here
this is not me obviously this is bacon
this world that I just introduced it to
it
and so bacon is really excited about the
stuff and he starts tweeting about the
stuff and he tweets sometimes just like
this you know and the things like bacon
has a few friends and the problem is
that bacon friends didn't feel very good
about this because well that's you know
from their point of view
bacon is kind of like a beautiful in
Egypt right he's kind of doing this
thing of like saying hey this new thing
is great which implies a little bit of
like hey you think that I was doing
before that you're doing is not and that
that is not good so let's let's try to
dig deep into Bacon's thing a little bit
right so when bacon says SP or
functional programming and he talks
about pipe functional programming so
because his experience comes from F
sharp and Scala right so that has a
bunch of context about that right so
that means that you have the safety of
types and you want to prove things and
bacon wants to do SP everywhere none of
this you know half-baked using of some
aspect of a piece he wants to all the
way through the whole program the whole
system should really this is what he
wants and he aspires to the purity in
functions so purity means that for every
every time that you put an input into a
function whatever that input is the
output would always be the same
so no side effects and he also wants
total functions even better than purity
that's a you know something that is
completely constrained and he doesn't
always achieve this purity and or
function totality because it's actually
quite hard you know a lot of problems
lend themselves to this and and also
when you're doing it dealing with
functional code and and you're dealing
with a language or a platform that
allows you for two or more paradigms
these things tend to not work really
well together
so the way we generally deal with us is
and by writing wrappers and examples of
wrappers there's a cut net that works
really well Caesar and it's one I use an
inept art there is a bit of a wrapper
there the wrapper is really good trick
is to write a really good wrapper is
difficult so what we can we know about
that is so if you need someone really
experienced in the language in something
that is highly used and the thing with
this is that it doesn't actually scale
right because well it's just you know
this is one library what about all your
libraries you know the reason we're
using F sharp or or Scala and it's
because oh great I'm using this
functional language and I get the
benefit of for this libraries already
working
but and sometimes we need to use this
language for example if you're doing F
sharp and you want to do web stuff you
have Henrique suave and frameworks love
it right and then but the things like do
not always have a native way to do this
and that's you know how the cause of
that works so that's that's one what
Bacon's context off I see is now bacon
doesn't didn't actually word this up
correctly he didn't tell a bunch of his
friends about this but this is what he's
thinking do you think that there's some
problems with history and especially in
Scala for stuff like dependency
management you know trying to get your
dependents we said and you know actually
having something running it's a little
bit trickier that you'd like and it's a
little bit easier in F sharp I think and
put in Scala you have that I know at
least eight different dependency
management libraries and they approaches
ranges from a reader Mona to constructor
injection and it feels like a little bit
too much and effort why do you have to
do this this thing is something that
will all the time who does some sort of
dependency injection you think who needs
dependencies in
programs literally everybody right so
why isn't that will been to the language
and then he has to do a lot of type
battery so most type SP and the all
these languages have higher or slightly
more complicated type things right so
you have to think about types a little
bit more
this means that eventually you have to
kind of play a bit of Tetris because
it's kind of nice to think of types and
some sort of by those things they have
sometimes they have a nice shape and you
kind of need to you know plug them in so
you kind of wind up doing some types a
trees and that can be complicated
inventor with some all complicated
concepts I'm totally trying to sell you
a three by the way but it's it sounds
like I'm not it there's a trick and also
this is Bacon's version right so M
there's a more complicated concepts once
you started learning about f-sharp or or
Scala or M or Haskell there's some
really really complicated concepts and
the more you think there's more because
this thing comes from months right okay
and so for example Moloch transformers
tweet so we actually need this to write
some programs and you know it's kind of
complicated in reality the only reason
why bacon came into all this stuff into
trying to the FB and why he is so
excited about it is because he has this
ring it's worth structure software and
it turns out that it's not easy to write
what structure software and because well
you know good things are not easy and so
this if you if you I'm going to be
putting a bunch of papers as I go and
this is this is a very nice one then
this is by John Hughes and the papers
all by functional programming matters
and John Hughes is the same guy that
wrote quick checks with some order that
if you miss out on Romeo talk you can
watch it online here's a token property
testing probably really exciting and
good if you like
so that's bacon this is what he thought
about stuff but now you get to meet it's
an own right
so I was also very excited to be here
aren't you hey
oh and bacon are good friends and they
work together
however for oh well I mean for her
performance is the reason why she coat
she learned to program and see when she
was like minus three years old right
it's like she was born and goes like oh
my god I love this stuff and at the same
time she's been you know working with
bacon sometimes let's go to suffering
bacon and then she's kind of curious
about this stuff but it she doesn't buy
any but maybe because they can never
told her about these problems but and
this problems that we talked about a
little bit before still you know
something doesn't click something didn't
really work so and boom and that's
that's the noise I got her name and it's
been reading this really cool a a cmq
magazine where others keep the creator
of Scala was talking about functional
programming and I'm assuming you're
breathing so I don't have to read up and
so you know when I put something there
readers and which is nice okay
and it's like oh you know you can get
this parallelism and distribution kind
of for free and it's like oh okay that's
for oh this sounds great because they
have to write a lot of stuff that runs
in many computers and no errors and
everything's cool and especially for the
Scala this this disparate programming
language philosophies right now this
anticipate the the impact there is like
please please please PLEASE persons so
others keeps promising us we're trying
to buy into this amazing thing with in
one programming language you get the
power of oh and the power of the Spirit
power and which which is kinda
interesting so you know who is listening
and
also who knows what solid soli de novo
okay so let the solid principles in our
single responsibility help open closed
principle someone else is not fair
dependency inversion for nearly there
what interphasic relation we have to be
list of substitution principle great so
and when you do all of those things in
something like C sharp or Java right and
you splint this kind of start totally
looking like that functional programming
because when you do when you get SRP all
the way to the end it kind of looks like
a bunch of functions so that's kind of
interesting you cannot get on over there
the reality is that oh and break another
the good friends you know out of work in
work sometimes they really want to kill
each other and so that's one tension I
don't know if you've seen it but when
you for example went to live here in the
keynote Dylan said something like and it
don't feel bad if you don't know if
sharp or something along those sounds
because it's like difficult or something
it's like you know there is business
attention it's like you know why are we
even doing that so that's one thing this
is one bacon now let's see what do the
creators of color and f-sharp actually
think because it's like this is their
life and their reality but don't sign in
2009 which is it sounds like really
really long time ago basically said this
so basically he's saying oh there's we
created Scala to replace Java because
you know up until very recently Java was
not been updated at all and replacing it
was a an extremely good idea where when
some time was creating f-sharp he was
like okay the net is actually pre or
write a component management so what we
can do is do as
f sharp as in functional first in the
small and objects at large so one you
have to do component sizing things the
doing it in a dotnet way is totally ok
and it's direct the way that I see it
working so this is some time creating
f-sharp and saying this so he's saying
multi-paradigm programming totally cool
so what about other ski well we know
about stuff because I just put this a
little bit before the key lesson in
peace philosophies is that these
philosophies do not need to contradict
in practice at the same time I don't
know if some of you have done C++
exactly okay so you recognize this may
be a little bit this responsibility
thing and having people actually know
and you know someone novel to the
language might need some guidance and
this statement is something that we
probably need to come back to because
the thing that I'm interested here is to
this ability to implement the two
paradigms and today overlap with each
other or how do you actually deal with
these two things because if you're
writing kind of Scala or f-sharp oh how
does it work when you need to also write
Scala or F sharp FB how do you make it
work within yourself and what do you how
do you make it work in a team that's
even harder so probably we need to do
something about that generally the way
you deal with that at least C++ as a
bunch of idioms so we have those in
these languages so basically other
schemes I'm agree that multi-paradigm
programming is the way to go and that we
can live together in some sort of
harmony the reality is that these guys
have fights so we have to fight that
they have and the fact that they fight
with kind of you know and I'm doing air
quotes fight with the Simon anarchy we
have another tension in this which is a
tension that was born as per second C
very long time ago and this is Alonzo
Church the creator of the
lambda calculus and steering has been a
Turing machine so the first time I in
about 1928 Hilbert had a he talked about
a kind of expose the bunch of problems
and then one of those problems caught
what called the nth item problem sorry
to people that speak German and this is
like the decision problem and when he
asked this question a lot parentheses on
history because I can tell you about it
later at that time these two people came
up with something to try to help answer
that question and church became I sorry
came with the lambda calculus a little
bit after Turing came back with a Turing
machine now these two solutions feel
during solution fields even though it's
well reasoned and you know very good it
feels like more pragmatic more hands-on
more grown and I love the church I
answered feels like more reasoned more
sciency maybe more engineered that same
kind of tension is something that if you
think about something like and Alan Kay
Smalltalk would be on the
organically-grown
based on experiments and trying to come
up with something new and fresh burns do
something like Dijkstra again very
reasoned etc I'm sure maybe that you
have your own friends and people that
you think about and you see these two
things you have your hacker friend that
does this crazy thing and you're kind of
done really agree with what the way they
do things but maybe they come up with
some amazing solutions that you pull and
thought so of Parros we have Lou your
super nerd friend is going to go and
find out and actually read over the
fifty million papers and actually come
up with like this or think that maybe
you didn't think about so it's like
these two tensions so now you have three
threats of how things are working right
you have the practitioners the academics
and actually just people being
themselves which is kind of confusing
but
at the end we're all running softer and
we need we need languages we need tools
and we need people that will either
writing software - or writing software
with or for and those people give you
like loads and that context this kind of
that thing that makes everything kind of
make sense
that is if we don't have that it doesn't
matter who you're talking to so with all
the problems that we have we might have
questions about you know how should we
interact with these paradigms and this
part of them shift right so you know
bacon spin here for a while and while he
was doing F sharp and C sharp things
were a bunch of people discussing this
thing and talking past each other if you
go back to school and you say similar
fights - the same text problems and so
maybe we have some sort of historical
thing where this happened before for
example like a few years ago doing
object-oriented programming was a
terrible idea and we all know that right
and before that there was something else
it was terrible
before that it was like to science you
know so people believe that there it was
thought that you know there was a thing
called global strong or something like
that that oxidize things so you know how
though I was going to deal with that and
maybe this history can teachers about
what are we going to do which is nice so
I proposed this right now I'm going to
show you this paper or a bad bit of this
paper which is called programming
paradigms for dummies and from Peter Pan
Roy so in this paper he went over and
concealed how paradigms relate to each
other in this amazing diagram now I
don't know you but I always kind of
thought that there was like a handful of
paradigms but there is like 37 and
and that's quite more than I expected so
if you examine this diagram in detail
you will find that you know they are
organized from more declarative to less
declarative and then there is like are
they more deterministic or not
this is a great way to think about this
and and when you see the diagrams you
know the way that there's little arrows
on the side what it says for example
plus cell state you get one cell so if
you if you just do SP like at the very
top which is like functional programming
first-order and you do plus cell state
you get imperative programming right so
I don't know why that state thing is
there by the way put and what I'm trying
to show you the way - okay so the way
this came about is he organized the
programming language is based on records
lexical scope closures independence
which actually means concurrency and
name state so what I'm trying to show
you by this is that basically
Peterborough went under long supported
programming languages and removed a key
element which is the people to copy or
to come up with this as a way to
logically organize this in the mill of
stone that he say he found what his team
obviously and stuff like this we
actually need many paradigms to come up
with solutions I mean we couldn't have
all slightly lesser solutions but you
get a lot of bang for your buck when you
look at this different paradigm he also
found that I really and a language to
support many paradigms and and that it
shouldn't be encumbered by the others so
you know when I was saying about Scala
and how we don't have idioms yet maybe
for doing multi-paradigm programming
languages you think that we should
probably have a way to deal with us
there is a little bit more organized
most importantly there is certainly not
best paradigm because solutions are you
know when you're doing is free for a
while and you can get maybe like bacon
you're like a sweet only the best maybe
want you start doing a low you were like
oh well totally the best and and next
time what do you do something else you'd
be like just everything totally the best
we we always want super Pulitzer
developers and I I'm totally guilty of
that myself when I get excited about
something but it's good to cut yourself
up and go like okay I just come down so
that is the thing about paradigms of
programming languages condensed right so
this guy over here in the back of that
picture his name is Thomas Kuhn he wrote
the book called the structure of
scientific revolutions and this text
here is the description of the crisis
right so in this book about the
structure of scientific revolutions he
basically explained how some community
changed from how he used to think to how
he's thinking how this they think now
that thing doesn't just happen it's like
it's not like hey I discovered you know
faster than light transport whoo and
everybody goes like oh my god I totally
believe in practices pray that's not how
it happens the way it happens is there's
a bunch of work a bunch of people get it
totally wrong and a bunch of people I
finally say a little bit a little bit
people are kind of thinking it's about
time we have faster than light travel
and then someone actually finds the
ultimate bit of the thing that was
missing and then certainly everybody
goes like right but for that to happen
you need it some sort of crisis people
don't like to wait are we doing
everything wrong you know we need to
philosophize about this and you know
find ourselves again and then someone
does it and then it's like oh but
actually it wasn't him or her it was
like this or guy at the same time and
then there's this thing about how we
love having one person discovering
things and not how it happens anyway
generally there is a momentum and stuff
so
this description this crisis is
generally resolved by a revolutionary
change which could be in this case
faster than light for my obviously
psyche example so this is happening now
right C++ the quintessential
longest-running saying and that runs
systems everywhere and except for
Fortran actually and it's having lambdas
in fact right after these doctors took
on as functional features for C
proposing in version 17 you should
totally go to that and so we're getting
all the stuff linked wonderful thing
starting like started added to c-sharp
like many years ago who who doesn't love
link and it has so many aspects of
functional programming and it's working
so are we in a functional programming
revolution yet and I'm asking this
question because this is where you see
this reaction right you can overlap well
when you accept that some when your
revolution happens you need to switch
your mind to believe this order paradigm
is better as a human you have a trip
unlike before you believe something and
then you believe something else and that
is a thing that you do as a person and
want the moment you realize that all
were saying is better air quotes better
that moment you also kind of go like oh
I can't believe the previous thing that
I believed before because it doesn't
make any sense right so we went the
multi-part and program is all well and
good according to what it should be
without the people you as a person
contradict this because that's human
nature I think and so we start thinking
about this which is philosophizing then
the most important thing here I think is
to think that once you change your mind
about oh you know using functional
programming maybe or logic programming
or in fact you have water functional
programming and discovered Oh
Oh totally happen and suddenly you can't
talk to each other anymore because
you're talking about slightly different
things you kind of go like ah but I love
oranges things like no apples are the
best but you're literally talking about
different things which is not great and
this happens so and this is all from if
this is not something that you know that
which is kind of thought and it's nice
this is a guy that went wrote the book
about history of science and this
happened like a million times right who
likes Battlestar Galactica great you're
gonna like this for those of you that
don't watch Battlestar Galactica and
this is a really good series on
obviously sci-fi and there is a
philosophy that you haven't watched it
and you will hear this quite a bit if
you do watch it and if all of this is
happening again right if it will keep
coming over and over this similar thing
and then we find and we dedicate all
this time to fighting or like reconnect
now I'll put it's an apple and it's ours
maybe we just need to get better at
changing right I mean all of us know as
programmers that the best thing we can
do when something is faithful is doing
quite a bit and once we look quite a bit
we automate it right so let's try to
kind of get on the boat of like we need
to automate how we think about this a
little bit more so that we can change
faster and with less pain which is good
I think it's a good idea anyway you know
it's like this is this is me actually
thinking this would be nice and we have
a unifying thing in all this change no
matter what would think about and we all
struggle with this stuff we will suffer
releases we will suffer other people's
codes like literally the worst our own
bugs past selves terrible and
there is no perfect program programming
language even if you make it and it's
perfect today is going to be terrible
tomorrow so what I'm going to do with
the thing that kind of unifies all of
this is the fact that we will build
something and it will run in a computer
and that's all so the first time that we
ever heard of a programming language
paradigm was in this paper by Floyd he
received the Turing prize award in 1978
and he had a point of advice about this
paradigm and I really really like some
of some of these pits and this first one
that you see here is about familiarity
he's saying please please please if
you're writing a new language there is
like thousands and thousands of
languages make it
give me some patterns that I can hold on
to I need some familiarity if you want
me to do something useful with this so
we're trying to find patterns you know
and not necessarily its patterns in the
sense of like don't think about the kind
of formal parents although they are
parents too it's like these are just
like repeatable steps that I can use so
that I can get something done okay I'm
totally on board on that when it comes
to doing something that actually it does
something he's saying hey if you're if I
need to teach something you know what I
need I need patterns because when you
don't when you're learning something you
need to fake it until you make it right
because the language will change not I
mean very few people in our field get to
write the same language for like 25
years or 30 years I don't know how long
people's programming life output let's
say 30 years ish you're not going to
write the same language in fact you're
probably writing many languages at the
same time right now so might as well
actually learn what is this patterns
that are repeatable owner on a paradigm
by paradigm
his last bit of advice which I totally
subscribe to and would be this learn
something every day
cool doesn't comport with that you know
what he's trying to do when you learn
something every day if you're learning
the same programming language for like a
while but you know what to find patterns
because you keep repeating things it's
alway well we could do this is our way
and it's like maybe you'll get some
surprises or not reader people to find
their own patterns to say do something
different and interesting so I'm going
to hurt all these cuts right because I'm
kind of throw a bunch of stuff with you
like this listen to this this is the
paradigm pieces of stuff right so
remember have we had a party of animals
well we have a party at first so the
people are really really important in
this context and so make it your context
when you're writing something and the
people that you depend on and the people
that you depend on you are really
important and get them in this probably
the best advice I heard ever is if you
study the past you will learn something
about the future because we don't live
in isolation and the best thing you can
do is learn the Artic programming learn
assembler learn any kind of different
things that you've never heard of
because you will learn something for
today it doesn't matter that you don't
use it you just learn it because it's

and more people will be coding more and
that means they they'll come home and
come to programming with their own sets
of crazy ideas that we completely

awesome will come in the middle of all
of that and
so that's that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
