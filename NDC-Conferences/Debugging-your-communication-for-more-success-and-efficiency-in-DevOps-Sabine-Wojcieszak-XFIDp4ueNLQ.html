more success in deficiency in biz dev
ops my name was the bean abanico
bendixen and perhaps you have read some
of my work in the internet or so now its
Charter but not easier its water shocked
but when you google for me please use
Bernick appendix and because this name
is brand new only one and a half week
old so you didn't found anything about
sabina vishesha at the moment but this
will change after this conference um you
know some links you can find me in the
internet if you have questions or want
to connect with me about me i am chief
consultant at get next IT now we do all
the stuff about communication leadership
culture change coming and besides that
i'm working on different companies i'm
writing some articles there's already an
e-book but in German so I think it's not
very interesting for you and I'm
speaking at different conferences all
over the world and I have organized them
upstairs keeling with a great team and
it's interesting i found another demo
Upstate's organizer here so it's a big
community yeah I'm the lady from the mob
on part of good old Germany here we are
placed here close to Denmark close to
Sweden and yeah it was a long way here
to Australian was the first time for me
and I just told him I have no problem
with jet lag because I couldn't sleep at
the plane I'm sorry to say but at the
moment I don't like any crying babies
anymore we had six in our Kevin and they
were crying 14 hours from Abu Dhabi to
Australia six hours from Dusseldorf to
Abu Dhabi
and I don't like crying babies at the
moment I think this will change again
but now it's enough so what do you know
about Germany okay oktoberfest that's
not Germany that's Bavaria yes Moses but
but what you said is to most of the
people when they think about Germany
most thing about the very it's just this
house of Germany it's not whole Germany
and I am NOT anadolu here so and I would
never ever where I download in place
with harsh line that's the part of
Germany I come from so um when you see
this glass who thinks this glass is half
full of you when let's guess this is
half this is the heart losing is half
full who thing is the glass is half
empty welcome to Germany most of the
Germans when you ask them would say it's
half empty we are never ever satisfied
with our work when you have done a great
job and you ask your colleague and he
said oh it's okay yeah it works and when
we get to countries like England or the
United States or so yeah and everyone
sells says awesome your urgent excellent
thing what's going on am I wrong here so
it's a little bit crazy about us German
but we are I think we are kind people
most of us some and one is here so let's
start um since my early years I have
problems with zippers not because I'm
not able to close the zipper but because
when someone comes close to me and I see
that the zipper of the trouser is open
it's always me who recognizes it and I
think I'm fair enough to say hey close
your super make a sign or something like
that no problem it always works with the
one who zippers open the worst thing
which could happen is that a third party
recognizes our communication what do
they do they serve hey Sabrina where are
you looking at don't look all the time
at the pants of somebody you try to make
it or they try to make a job at me but
what happens the other person who
suppose open feels embarrassed by the
situation and it's a thing why I felt
that they have not enough empathy in
such as a communication situation so I
will come back to the zipper later and
show you why the zipper could be a
symbol for a good communication here you
see this guy has an open super and
perhaps it was me who has recognized
let's talk about DevOps all the time we
talk about DevOps we talk about the
great wall of confusion different
departments different silos different
ideas different goals and when we talk
about DevOps and when we talk about two
companies who want to implement them ups
we have to talk about how we can rebuild
this wall of confusion and come over it
so that it is not some kind of the
border and people can work together in a
better way when we bring the best into
game this wall of confusion becomes even
higher because more silos are included
and yeah the situation is different
stakeholders different behavior
different goals
and with the biz more different
stakeholders multiple behaviors and lots
of goats and they all should work
together and bring out the best they are
able to so one big problem is who is the
best and you know all perhaps those
pictures of wealth world or where's
wally the best is everywhere everyone is
the best they all look the same but they
all have different ideas they all have
different goals and you have to identify
the part of this which is necessary in
the special project who the is the
base now let's imagine a developer meets
the marketing people why are you smiling
interesting idea so that's the board we
have a head of marketing we had a head
of sales and the developer and they are
talking about the project who else
should we target they have the man and
all the female and the question of
marketing who else should we target we
want to get a bigger target group the
head of sales said that's a good
question because they have in mind money
money money money good idea men women
who else whoops he says huh when we have
the male and the female we have
everything what should we do so to bring
all those three together is hard stuff
sales and marketing could work perhaps
yeah but when we bring deaths and the
office and so into the game it's getting
harder it's not that I know don't like
deaths and ops please get it right it's
because the way of thinking
is a little bit different and that's
okay so because everyone has to do his
job so but when we talk about DevOps or
biz dev ops there is one important goal
faster better and continues so now you
see we have a group of multiple
characters multiple people with multiple
ideas and multiple goals and they should
work first are better and continues they
have to discuss a lot but time is the
limiting factor in actual IT project you
don't have endless time to work on stuff
so we have to look what we can do to
avoid avoidable mistakes just to save
time because time is the thing we
shouldn't waste yeah it's a limited
resource and it is a bad idea to waste
it what's the solution for some
companies many companies think hey great
let's implement a tool okay let's try it
but they soon will discover it tool is
good but it's not there's only solution
so some of them think we need modules
okay let's do it spend some money on
more tools and ok but they were also
soon discover that's not the solution ok
because perps this have been the wrong
towards now let's do some different
tools but what if people in the team are
not interested in using this towards
they are not convinced that these tools
are very good for them they are not
convinced that they have to change the
way they work so tools and not the
solution and not the first thing you
have to do when we talk about biz dev
ops we have to talk about communication
because communication is the link
between people so here's the zipper
again let's see one on one side of the
tape tape is the Deaf side the other is
the ops or the biz the ops and the biz
or the deaths and the best side whatever
this is where all the people are put on
the until like the t's in a zipper all
the individuals every individual is one
piece of this chain the tape is the
organization they are putting on too and
the communication is the slider body the
thing with which you bring those tees
together to connect a chain and then you
have the pull tab there's a little small
thing you can grab with your fingers to
pull the pull tab up and down this is
the tool the tool is just there to help
you with your communication it to it
could never ever replace communication
it gives you help for argumentation it
gives you help to remember things you
want to do it visualizes things you want
to explain but it should is never ever a
replacement for communication and when
you want to implement new tools to a
team you have to communicate it and you
have to communicate why they should use
it and how and what are what is the
purpose of it so when I say to people in
company we have to improve your
communication most of them at first
think we want to improve
quantity but in most companies quantity
is not the question perhaps sometimes is
it is too much communication there this
could be but only a few companies have
to come to less communication most of
the people communicate enough the
question is the quality of the
communication quality over quantity
Peter Drucker once said the most
important thing in communication is
hearing what isn't set and there's a lot
of information in between the lines and
when we talk about communication we do
not only talk about the words itself we
talk about so much more and we will now
look what is all combined and
communication Paulette Slovak one set we
cannot not communicate sounds a little
bit crazy but it's right whenever at
least two people met communication
starts at once even when they are saying
nothing because communication is more
than just the word who would see it
later and when we start to communicate
we have to face that misunderstanding is
everywhere around us and that we have to
realize that we have to deal with
problems but misunderstandings are
sometimes demotivating misunderstandings
often costs a lot of time because they
have to be cleared up misunderstandings
often other reason for failures and so
misunderstandings could really be
expensive for a company because of the
payers because of the invested time
because of the bad atmosphere and
because of the motivated people so why
don't we look what
can do to avoid some of those
misunderstandings yeah I guess it is
because we sometimes think we are some
kind of masters of communication we
learn to communicate from our early
childhood so why the hell should I now
start to learn and improve my
communication I don't see any reason for
it I'm communicating all the time and I
most of the time get what I want so if
other people are not happy with my
communication it's not my problem I
think we are more like masters of
disasters in in communication because we
know that there are misunderstandings
and we do don't we don't do anything
about it we just accept it happens
so I've said what I want to say and now
it's up to the other one but when we
want to improve ourselves when we want
to have more success and work more
efficient that's not the way we should
think but communication is a part of us
it's a part of our behavior and as we
are all humans we are some kind of
trapped in the web of patterns and
behaviors we have adopted of a long long
time and we want to change anything it's
really a hard job it's not so now I
improve my communication I go to a
one-day workshop and then I'm better
than ever no the workshop is just there
to show you away and then afterwards you
have to train it and to change patterns
needs time more than one day believe me
but if you do it you will be very happy
about it at NDC Oslo i am at jeremy and
he had a talk about how to become a
social developer and he said that the
tech industry attracts introverted and i
think he's right and the interesting
thing about is that most of those who
are working in the tech industry starts
to into interest for computer stuff at
the age of 12 10 or 12 or 13 something
like that a very very important age in
our personal development of social
skills the introverts stay at the
computer look at the computer and do the
stuff there and it's great it's a really
great job to concentrate on one topic on
one problem dive deep into it yeah but
the other one once went out and trained
their social skills and so the gap
becomes bigger and bigger and bigger
perhaps not all but Jeremy also told in
his talk they love to communicate there
are a lot of people say developers
cannot talk they cannot communicate
that's wrong I'm not from the technical
side I've always trained about trainings
about communication and so on but when i
discovered developers for the first time
what I discovered was that I really like
to communicate they communicate a lot
when I come to someone some developer I
don't know and I start a conversation
just a slight conversation Oh tomorrow
this morning it was bad weather outside
here in Sydney it was raining and when I
am the lucky one to meet one developer
who is interested in whether I have
triggered point and he would start to
tell me everything about whether on the
third August because he knows everything
yeah when the developer is interested in
some stuff
he knows every detail and he likes to
share his knowledge to people he trusts
or she trusts sorry so that's very
interesting I like this but there are a
lot of people who feel a little bit
educated in such a situation and to try
to get away as soon as they can and what
is the experience for the developer all
the time he starts to communicate with
foreign people they try to get away from
him they don't like to communicate with
him just an example you but I think you
understand what i want to say you have a
skill to discover problems to discover
topics very detailed and it's a
necessary for the work of a developer
when you are interested in other people
often I'm not so interested in all those
detailed stuff they just at the surface
and want to do a little bit small talk
and so different behaviors meet in
perhaps for both sides it's a strange
feeling and the experience could be not
good if one of the side is not
interested in changing the point of view
so they love to communicate when you
have the right topic but he also said
because he has experienced by himself a
behavior can be changed hard work but it
could be so it was very interesting to
talk to Jerry now let's do some basic
stuff about communication this is a very
simple simple model of communication we
have the sender was sending a message we
have the receiver receiver receives the
message and then reacts with his own
message very simple and you know this
from your computer
it's the same idea behind it but that's
not how it works with us we have many
different components of communication
the first one is the verbal
communication it's the grammar it's the
wording the syntax the logic the
language itself let's if you're right
program that's nearly the same just the
words but this is just a small part of
our communication the bigger part is the
nonverbal communication and this is
divided into two parts para verbal and
body language the power of verbal
communication this is my volume the
speech rate am I too slow or too quick
when I'm too slow at ceridian boring
when I'm too quick you can't follow me
so the speech rate is very interesting
the intonation when I speak all the time
at the same intonation you will be sleep
it will be sleeping well as soon so it's
very interesting the voice itself we
can't change our voice we have it but
the voice itself is an important factor
in communication the articulation when I
was weak industry and can't understand
doesn't matter if I say anything go and
the speech melody this is the power of
verbal part of communication you can
train most of it and this is what is
done in communication workshops of often
done communication workshops then we
have the part of the body language
really important part my face what I do
with my face affects your expression all
the guests rests am i standing here or
am i working with my arms and so on the
German people mostly tend to stay this
way and when the German people come to
the middle range Mediterranean countries
where all the people are always speaking
with their arms we felt a little bit of
hand and say hey what I like doing
they're arguing that they have to prep
their problems or what and they are
talking about nice weather yeah with the
arms so that's the guess chur body
posture my whole body am I upright or
more races this way I contact when I
speak with people do I look to them the
clothing the clothing is a part we
really can decide by ourselves what we
want to wear and it could be a sign
therefore that we belong to a special
group of persons until we have a part
which is very important but we can't
influence it's the body chemistry the
body chemistry is the oldest part of
communication on the world older than
the people are the humans are and body
chemistry is often the reason why people
who haven't met before came together and
like them and within the first two
seconds or hate them within the first
two seconds its body chemistry most of
the time so you see here some
percentages seven percent seven percent
is the impact of words in communication
only seven percent impact of words
thirty-eight percent is the impact of
voice of the power of verbal
communication and fifty-five percent is
the impact of your body language be
honest to yourself how often have you
thought about your body language but
it's fifty five percent of the impact on
your communication misunderstandings
often appear because what you say does
not match to what you show
and this is called the inconsistent
message you say yes I want to do it for
you until tomorrow but you do this yes I
want to do it for you to tomorrow now
the receiver has a problem you say yes
but you show no what should he trusts
55-percent or not why should I trust
seven percent when i have fifty-five
percent of information so i choose the
fifty-five percent and so he or she
wouldn't feel well in the situation said
oh yeah she said yes okay I should trust
her but inside of me it says no I think
it wouldn't work and i think the
receiver will have a bad night until it
tomorrow and to see what will happen so
what's going on with a message when we
send a message we encode this message
and it this happens automatically yeah
we think about words but this happens
then we sent what we send it and here
the receiver starts to decode the
message and the message the information
run through filters these filters are
very individual this could be
experiences the receiver has made before
this could be special special knowledge
about the sender or the topic this could
be the actual mood or biases or
prejudices whatever those filters are
very individual and sometimes they
depend on the situation so no one knows
which filters are at work at the moment
not even the receiver himself
because it all happens in our subs
conscience if we have to do all those
things now our conscience but would take
too much time and our brain is not able
to process all those informations who
come in every second so we need our subs
conscience the worst thing about our sub
conscience is we often deny it no I'm a
very conscience guy subconscious no yes
there is most of things we do in
communication happens and other sub
conscience so the informations run
through filters they were interpreted
and amor causes emotions and on these
emotions the receiver reacts that's what
happens and now we have another circle
of communication this the sender or
initiator centers message it's run it
runs through the filters the receiver
receives us and reacts and becomes the
sender himself that's just nearly the
truth because most of the time sender
and receiver are both at the same time
because when I speak to you you are
sitting here and listening to me but you
are still sending messages to me with
all your body language so I'm sender and
receiver and you are receiver in sender
at the same time that's complicated and
there are a lot of parts where
misunderstandings can happen so action
is required to start to think and talk
about communication first step we have
to do is to change our mindset we have
to
except that we are not masters of
communication we have to accept that we
all should improve our communication or
examine our communication so
communication really makes the
difference and we have to learn about
our communication how do we communicate
how does do other people feel about our
communication and what when can we do to
improve it when we speak and talk about
improving communication the single steps
could be different for every person
because everyone communicates in
different ways and there is not one
received this is a receiver improve your
communication do it no that won't work
because we are all different and when we
want to improve communication we have to
find individual ways into individual
points to improve parts of our
communication written we have to think
about our communication communication
should not happen suddenly it should be
thoughtful communication and we should
ask for help to improve our
communication because we just have an
idea about how other people feel about
our communication but it's better to ask
them and when I want to develop to write
a program I asked a specialist someone
who knows what he is doing when you want
to improve your communication your team
communication or your individual
communication ask a specialist and do
don't do it because you have read some
books yeah
but because of the reason that most of
our things we are think we are all
masters of communication they think they
can do it on known just reading one book
is enough to to change people's behavior
and I promise you this won't work listen
with all your senses you have seen the
impact of body language so this is why I
choose the picture with this young one
with a big eyes I have two children two
boys they're grown up 22 and 21 but when
they were in this age at his age I
always told him when you listen to me
look at me and my younger my youngest
son has a real problem he got up very
early in the morning and when I say very
early I mean very early four o'clock in
the morning he was wake mom Here I am he
came up to my bedroom hopped into my bed
and wanted to tell me something I say
huh enough stop telling me mom you have
to listen to me yeah my fault I told him
you should look at me when you are
listening and so he asked me to do the
same and so every morning had to open my
eyes at four o'clock in the morning to
listen to his stories very interesting
stories but very early so listen with
all your senses and when you look at the
people you are communicating with you
will discover a lot of information about
them important information you can use
to ask questions helpful questions and
you will see when you on the way of
misunderstanding and you can clear it up
right from the first or second step and
not when you have done the whole way so
listen with all your senses could save a
lot of time I met Torian the Maria berry
at lk c in munich and yes she talked
about multitasking
you have seen those pictures about
communication how complex communication
is and now let's look at actual
situations and offices he come into the
office of another one he said son at his
desk in front of his computer and you
start talking to him and Sheila's looks
at his screen and hacking on his
keyboard yes yes yes no when we talk to
someone and it is important then we have
to stop doing something else and
concentrating on this communication and
as we don't know in the forint if the
communication is important or not we
better stop doing other things I'll say
please let us talk later I have to
finish my work that would be a solution
but not hacking hacking hacking and
communicating at the same time I promise
you some information of this
communication will be lost and you don't
know if this is the really important one
what happens later the other one who
came in is sure that you have listened
and you have heard everything but you
haven't heard anything everything and
you forget about what he said and
perhaps you didn't do what he asked you
to do so he starts worrying about you
because you haven't done it and he said
well I've told you no you haven't yes I
have and you start to argue about the
thing which is not worth arguing about
but it's up to you to concentrate and
communication and not to do other things
besides multitasking is stressed fantasy
our attitude about on the other person
it is about on on the other person my
attitude against you my editors about
you towards towards you thank you my
attitude towards my communication
partner is very important because it
influences my way of communicating
Thomas a harris in estrus transactional
analysis had four different attitudes
and they're only useful for successful
communication is I am okay you are okay
because then we both are on eye level
and we can we communicate face-to-face
without biases and prejudices when I'm
of the opinion I am okay and you all you
are developers or ops and you are not
interested in communication and you
can't do it anyway I would talk to you
this way and you would feel it I'm
saying okay let's talk about
communication so I know you all are here
because you have to and i have to tell
you some stuff about it but yeah you can
try it or not so this would be the way i
would talk to you if I have the
impression I'm okay and you are not okay
but that's not the way we will get a
solution and we will find a commitment
so I'm okay you are okay is the best way
we can talk with each other and get
results all of it believe me or not
especially when we talk about
constructions like DevOps biz dev ops
this is the first thing we have to
achieve
the ops Oh death my god is with this
attitude it won't work and you first
have to learn to accept the others to
accept the other skills the other ideas
the other way of thinking and CS it as
an enrichment for the work I am okay you
are okay the only attitude to make
collaboration successful when we talk
about DevOps biz dev ops one important
thing is to change to be able to change
the point of view this does not mean
that you have to change your opinion
just to change the point of view the
point from where you look at things
because it's easier to understand other
people when you try to get into their
shoes and look from that position and
you are able to find better arguments
for your discussion and whatever and
it's important to have the empathy to
recognize that it's now time for
changing point of view to look at the
problem from another side feedback is
always an important thing in
collaboration especially in develops or
biz dev ops but most of the people think
about giving feedback yes for sure
giving feedback is important but it's
also important for debugging your
communication to ask for feedback yeah I
said before when we want to improve our
our communication we have to learn how
we communicate and we have to learn how
other people feel about our
communication so we have to ask for
feedback ask actively for feedback and
people will love to tell you what I
think about your communication context
matters
communication is always depending on the
situation and on the context when
perhaps we both met again and we are
talking only be to face to face and
we're talking about DevOps they say oh
come on don't be sad that's Cupid it
would be okay I guess sorry but when we
have the same conversation in this whole
room and you were telling me about your
ideas about DevOps days and in this room
I would say hey come on don't be that
stupid it could be not okay because we
are not on there our own and many other
people were around so context matters
the words I say can be okay in one
situation but another situation that can
be totally wrong so and that is the next
problem of communication not one
solution none not one guideline lot of
different situations that's so hot about
it email phone face-to-face and now we
can right beside the percentage 738 55
when you write emails you have only
seven percent of the impact people tend
to communicate problems via email with
only seven percent of the impact
problems will appear suddenly because
the other one just had the word and it's
very hard to interpret how do you mean
it that's the reason why it's so hard to
make jokes via email and some people
started to invent these emotion cons but
they are not a replacement for you
perhaps they work but
not sure about that so phone call is
better because you have the voice you
have thirty eight percent more but the
Westway is face-to-face and hey you're
in the tech industry most of you have
been your chat so when we have to
discuss hard problems why not doing it
via video chat when the other one is not
right at the office now so the more
senses we address the better the
communication will work email is just
for fixing things we have talked about
to write them down but not the first way
of communication not for problems
appreciation when we want to do back our
communication when we want to avoid
misunderstandings appreciation is a very
good tool for it show appreciation
though the other one knows how you value
him or her how you value the work and so
you can better talk about problems when
someone knows how you value the person
or the work appreciation very important
I don't know how it is in Australia but
I know how it is in Germany and in
Germany appreciation at work is not the
thing we do yeah always there's always a
better way to do what you have done so
and when share a boss came to you and
say hey well done say oh ok he shows
appreciation what does he want what's
coming up so we are not very familiar
with appreciation and it's important
responsibility you are responsible for
your communication no one else and you
are responsible really to avoid mistakes
not
throw it over the wall and the work
finished no you are responsible when I
want you to do something it's my task to
communicate it in a way that you can
understand it and it's my task to ask is
everything okay do you know what I mean
and if I see if I have listened with my
eyes and I see that you are not sure
about it it's up to me to explain it to
you again perhaps and other words it's
not the responsibility of the other one
and when you want to improve your
communication please do not expect that
all the other people around you have the
same idea of improving their
communication so you are responsible for
yourself for your communication and for
your improvement it's up to you this is
a team at mobile systems and Q and a few
month ago they had a new situation one
of the local workers moved away and now
he's a remote worker and it was a new
experience from there for them because
all the time all people were in the
office sunday they do some homework but
most of the time they were at the office
and now one of them moved away and
nearly at the same time they started to
do can burn when you yeah come on board
yeah this side and then all standing in
front of the Kanban board and
sebastian's it's the guy who moves away
had to be part of the stand-up meetings
and so after some sessions without him
they had all bad idea not to have
Sebastian on the stand up meeting and so
they had to video chat
and Sebastian just looked at the wall
after a few days one of the guys said oh
that's bad that Sebastian could only
look at the wall and day he implanted
implemented a camera which the bastion
can move from his computer at home so he
can always look at the people around and
at the board like he wants to and now
everything is fine some days later I
talked with a the leader of this team
and he said for him the situation that
one of his guys moved away and wasn't at
the office now was a very big problem
and he had the the feeling that he had
no control over what he is doing because
they were always communicating via email
via email and after they implemented the
stand-up meetings with the video chat
and so on all the time they are now
communicating they're communicating via
chat or video chat and now all sides had
a better better better impression also
the bastion he said he had the
impression that he's not part of the
team anymore and now he is part again so
distributed teams are the next step are
in communication another important thing
in communication is meetings who of you
has the impression that he wastes time
in meetings yeah that's right and I
think it's yeah the impression is most
ly right because meetings have so much
potential to be improved they are
important we can't do our work without
meetings but we can do the meetings in a
better way and so communication in the
meeting is a good point to improve to
start to improve communication
commitment over concerns fine
commitments not comes anvils consensus
is often combined with compromises and
compromises and not the best choice
not entirely work commitment means i am
not of the same opinion but we have
decided to do it this way and I will be
loyal and follow it let's give me an
example this is Horst Seehofer he is the
minister president of Bavaria and you
know her it's Angela Merkel she is our
Chancellor most part they are from
different parties but they have to
collaborate now we have a big problem in
Germany and all over Europe we have 1.1
million refugees in 2015 that's a lot
lot of people come over to Germany and
want to stay there have lot of problems
because of the problems in their home
country but they find it comes in this
they say okay all those people come can
come to us and we will help them we will
look what we can do then we had now some
terroristic effects in Germany and
France all over Europe and all people
say oh my god all those refugees and
what can we do and they are the reason
why this happens and when we don't have
old people the foreign people in our
land we won't have any terrorism you can
think about if you want but I don't know
ng ng we called her AG yeah so Angie
stopped her holiday and gave a press
conference and she said no we will
manage the problem no don't worry we
will do it we do like we have decided we
will do it they both have a consensus
but what did horse do he said no we
won't manage it consensus is over now
yet he got out of the consensus what he
could
get and now he said no we won't do it
anymore and we have a big problem and
angela is not right we won't manage it
that's really bad for us because a lot
of people in Germany are scared about
situation about what's going on when you
look at our press there's always next
terror attack or whatever and our leader
says something she is the boss and
there's another one who wants to be the
leader and he puts his personal goals
about common goals and for those people
who are unsure about the situation it's
very hard when the leadership does
communicate in this way and doesn't
follow their consensus commitment in
this way would be a much better thing
but here personal goals are not the way
to find a commitment so are you ready
for openness and how open and honest are
you and your team it's open
communication sending you to hell our
offer you new opportunities not all
teams are really ready for an open
communication because there's something
missing that's trust and open
communication should bring you to new
opportunities and not to help you have
to get rid of all those elephants and
Elks in their room all those big
problems everyone sees and no one wants
to talk about because i'm not sure what
happens afterwards and you have to
implement a team culture of trust
when you have trust as your team culture
you can communicate in an open way and
elephants and Elks all those big
problems won't be part of your daily
work anymore to implement trust
nonviolent communication could be a good
way nonviolent communication invented by
Marshall Rosenberg says that I am NOT
the measure of all when you sit there
with your phone I could say please stop
playing with your phone you are not
listening that is a violent offending
communication because my opinion is
above all Marshall Rosenberg would say
it in a different way so please could
you stop playing with your phone I have
the impression that you are not
listening and I think what I have to say
is very important so please stop it so
that's just that I say I don't feel well
with you playing with the phone sorry
about that and that's the problem when
we gave feedback in the daily work we
often do it in a violent or offending
way we have an impression and we put the
suppression above all and we wonder why
people step back and react them in a bad
way another tool could be the
appreciative inquiry it's an open source
project by David Cooper rider so you can
find about it in the internet and you
can contribute with your personal
experience about it the appreciative
inquiry is that you ask a lot of
questions when you want to change things
when you want to improve things how do
you feel about it what do you think can
we do next step what do you dream of
being in five years and so on all those
questions which bring people to talk
about ideas and feelings and so on and
measure they are feeling
is very high so this is very important
when you want to improve communication
in your team so the takeaway is start
it's never too late and never too early
to start to improve your communication
start now it's better than start never
start tomorrow start two days after
today whatever you want but the
important thing is start to improve
communication every one of us can
improve it so thank you very much for
listening and if you are interested in
further topics of this on friday i have
talked about quality because quality
starts on your head and their
communication is also a very important
part thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
