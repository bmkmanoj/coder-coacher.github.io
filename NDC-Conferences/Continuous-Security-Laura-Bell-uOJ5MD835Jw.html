called safes like you've never heard of
don't worry too much about that bit
today my job is to further my career by
speaking at a conference isn't that good
my career ambition is both I'm I'm 40 I
want to have given everything that's in
my head to other people because turns
out this security thing doesn't really
work when there's only like 20 weirdos
in the world doing it we have to try and
convert all of you like some kind of
strange religion into making your life
more difficult and doing more to earn
the same salary for everyone on board
good fantastic so help me with my life
goals today and listen carefully now I'm
not just a consultant I also make tea
and I wrote a book well I wrote a book
with friends always do it with friends
it's very lonely on your own my mom is
very proud please don't buy the book
necessarily because I wrote it I also
built a product now security companies
are very rarely stupid enough to go and
go you know what it'd be fun I'll build
software as well as doing consultancy
this is a terrible idea but between
these two things it means that all of
the advice all the guidance all of them
random disconnected thoughts that appear
in this talk today come from places
where I've actually been knee-deep in
somebody else's code where we have tried
and struggled and figured out these
solutions ourselves now I think you
should know we're not perfect at all we
are 10 weirdos based in Auckland New
Zealand who write code and because we're
relatively poor a Kanban board is a
window with some poster post-it notes on
it and occasionally they fall down
because they're really cheap post-it
notes that's our world we're Python
developers but don't judge us I know you
will speak net and it seems like a very
fun language I live and breathe security
in software that it's probably I feel
like I just kind of confessed to a
really terrible life choice but how many
of you have ever written software please
raise your hand because if not you're
the wrong conference good fantastic how
many of you are super awesomely proud of
everything you've ever written those two
people with someone yeah yeah I'm
rocking this how many of you have
written code and put it on the internet
that you know probably has issues yeah
awesome
absolutely me too now this is a dream
state right this world we're living in
now where you know it's all sane bows
and kittens and and all of this code is
working perfectly well in this utopian
state and the hacking thing only happens
to other people that's kind of what I've
heard
especially in this hemisphere but the
truth is that's not what's going on
what's going on is there is an
increasing number of people attacking
and exploiting the applications we're
building today not because we're stupid
not because we're malicious not because
we missed some kind of magic wand step
but because security is really freaking
hard what we're saying is that you've
got to protect every single person every
part of every system in your
organization from bad people from an
undisclosed army of bad people the may
or may not include a nation-state and
you have to do this continually for the
rest of your existence
does this sound fun not really cuz
that's not why we became developers we
became developers because we want to
build an awesome thing and see it work
and then we decided you know would it be
fun it's kind of cool we wrote this
software thing and it took us a few
months let's do it faster let's do it 10
times a day let's do it as continually
as we humanly can how many of you have
caught DevOps there is a cure I have
been told as a cream just apply daily so
we'll do it faster now went wonderful so
security which was already hard and
already expensive and already took a lot
of time we're now gonna try and do that
continuously - fantastic let's build the
dream but that's the thing right I I'm a
bit tongue-in-cheek you will note from
already meeting me for these first few
minutes we're gonna be friends by the
way but I don't take security too
seriously it's a very big very serious
problem but you know what happens once
you
people take security really really
seriously we all go and raise cows
somewhere in like Northland in New
Zealand we go and open some kind of
honey restaurant because you would go
mad if you don't see the beauty and the
wonder in the software we're building in
the online world's where we're teaching
our children in the self-driving cars
that are going to revolutionize if you
hear the hype how we drive and commute
to the scientific equipment that is
either diagnosing cancer or is trying to
answer questions about the universe if
you're not excited about software as a
security person you're in the wrong job
because this is why we do it how many if
you're excited about what you work on
every day ok if you're not on your sat
in this room you are literally the
engineers of the future you're the
people building the new technology there
is no reason to sit in a job that bores
you to tears because there are hundreds
of other companies building amazing
things so how are we going to keep these
amazing things safe well I'm going to do
two things in this talk we're going to
talk a little bit about some common
misconceptions and some principles we
need to do to continually do security
and then I'm going to give my brain to
you and I'm gonna go through for each
stage of a standard lifecycle and I
don't care whether you've caught DevOps
Kanban scrum I do not care what religion
or Dogma you are following whatever
stage you're at I'm gonna give you a
whole raft of tools you can go and put
into your lifecycle today how many of
you would like to impress your boss
fabulous how many of you feel like
getting a promotion or passing a
reformatory is an awesome thing
especially if you get a bonus wonderful
top plan for you I'm going to share
these slides afterwards you're more than
welcome to wait till then but I am
giving you the list of all of the tools
you need to weave security through a
fast-paced life cycle there are probably
only 12 companies in this Hemisphere
doing this right now
so top tip I'm gonna give you like the
paint-by-numbers guide to doing this if
you choose to get promoted that's your
call right other side mink we have the
strongest sticker gamer
NDC yeah I am kind of arrogant about my
stickers but they are kick-ass
so if you stay to the end if you ask a
question then you can come claim
snickery prizes because I know
developers kind of like that well who
doesn't list occurs right so common
misconceptions firstly it's not my job
we have a security team for that raise
your hand if you have a security team
keep your hand up if you know their
names Oh wonderful
are they here today okay right can you
see why we might have a problem these
these conferences are amazing I've been
sitting and learning about many
wonderful things and all of the security
people who are supposed to be doing this
with you are somewhere else feeling
angry and sad about the world
I had developer conferences in our
security conference is a completely
separate places you'd think we were all
kind of not able to play well together
you can play well with humans right good
well in fact the other problem is that
on the attacker side we have an
undefined number of people gonna do us
harm that includes all of you by the way
so congratulations now there's only a
finite number of people defending and
that's called asymmetry and wherever
there's a symmetry we have a problem if
you've got less people defending than we
do attacking you're always going to lose
which means as of today congratulations
I've just kind of waved my Linkedin wand
upon you and you can now say security
professional on your LinkedIn profile
you should see the fun spam you're gonna
get next up border devices will save us
how many of you have a Web Application
Firewall that is gonna save you from the
end of the internet yeah some of you do
I know you do because the vendors have
been at you have seen the t-shirts and
the swagger and border devices do have
an importer role I'm not here to talk
about them today what I'm here to talk
about is the code you build because
regardless of what vendor device you put
in front of it it's all gonna be
vulnerable that's just how the internet
works so please don't go well you know I
bought a web application firewall and
therefore I don't need to care yes are
you do it's impossible so why try
thankfully this is a room of engineers
and you look literally thrive off
somebody saying you can't do that
that's impossible how many of you would
then go yeah let me
that to you yeah any of you been that
jerk at 2:00 a.m. who's gonna yell show
you not gonna sleep for three days but
I'm gonna show you yeah it is a really
hard problem for as long as there's been
humans we've been jerks to each other if
you had a shiny pebble and I didn't have
a shiny pebble I'm gonna hit you with
sticks until I get your shiny pebble all
we did was change the shiny pebble to be
personally identifiable information and
health records and the stick to be sadly
mainly pearl but it's always been a hard
problem it's in your nature is in my
nature so we kind of have to do
something about this we've always done
it this way and it's never been hacked
um II think you've never been hacked it
takes on average 287 days to go from
being hacked to knowing you've been
hacked so even if you think you've never
been hacked chances are that you just
don't know it yet and you know fun fact
you don't like those ants where the
little plant drops on their head and
they grow plant out their head and then
they eventually have a painful crew
shooting death yeah well attack is
actually a slightly symbiotic with their
hosts on some occasions so you could
have been hacked they'll get in clean up
after themselves patch a few things kick
out the other people already in your
system and kind of make themselves a
cozy nest that's nice of them isn't it
too little to fail how many of you were
for small companies less than a hundred
people yeah yeah I work for a 10-person
company we have more freakin security
controls than you know what to do is
because we're a security firm and that
basically says kick me to attackers
doesn't matter how small you are none of
the tools in here are going to cost you
money so you don't even get to wave your
I've got no budget stick at me I don't
care how is your compliance organization
so HIPAA FISMA APRA I can name buzzwords
for days PCI DSS yeah a lot of the time
we say what we complain that point must
be secure that's not true
compliance is kind of saying yeah I even
pressed an auditor and they were really
happy with me but it isn't gonna stop
you being attacked so what is continuous
security how
we going to do this let's get on with
that because that's why you're here
right let's talk about the world is
screwed we knew that we want to know how
we're gonna do it now full disclosure -
Troy hunt did an amazing talk earlier in
the week about I wast B type things and
she'd just go and read all of his stuff
for like the rest of the history of
forever this is not that talk I'm going
to assume you've been to that kind of
talk
this is actually how you build a life
cycle so this is kind of the more of the
how we build software not the nuts and
bolts of actually writing code so as we
should all know software is built in a
fairly standard way dependent on you
know your team but we get an idea we do
some design we code some stuff hopefully
we do those in the right order we test
some stuff if we're being really super
well behaved and then we deploy onto the
internet and good things happen we all
make blue Delille dolls and money and
we're great now traditionally we put
security in between these things so
every time you stop on your little
cadence my part of the world jumps in
and does something like a threat
assessment or a code review and Rachel
hand have you've been through one of
these processes with an outsourced firm
probably yeah bank employees normally
definitely the finance people and that's
fine kinda if you have lots of money and
lots of time because each one of these
things takes time right penetration test
might take two to three weeks and if
you're deploying ten times a day this
isn't gonna work
so how do we speed this up let's get
onto that well firstly what we're doing
is dependent on where you are now this
is choose-your-own-adventure
you could be at the absent stage of
security which is the yellow ops version
of it's fine my framework probably does
this for me PS hackers don't even know
exists so we could be there
you could be ad hoc so you know bits and
pieces so you know a bit about what Tory
hunt has been talking about maybe you've
read a blog post or two you're doing
gentle things as you go along you could
be gated so the more traditional way so
you work for a bank or something and
they bring in things at certain stages
and do it for you or you could be agile
you can be continuous and that's where
I'm trying to get you today I'm trying
to get you from wherever you start to
the bottom of list so what are the
principles of getting there how are we
going to get for
ad hoc or absent right the way down to
this well here's the principles we're
going to add ear to before I give you
the tools we want continuous security to
be automated autonomous integrated
repeatable and scalable now lots and
lots of buzzwords let's actually talk
about what they mean automation is the
best best tool for most jobs when you're
going fast
humans are not good at scaling their own
activities if they have to do them by
hand and doing it manually we're just
terrible at it all so how do you you
have a bit of your job you find boring
yeah the rest of you you super lucky I
everyone has a bit of the job that is
boring or tedious security jobs I'm
gonna give you spoilers they're not all
exciting you don't like galavant on the
internet looking for people in hoodies
who might want to do your harm you know
you're checking DNS records or your
check-in vulnerability listings these
are kind of tedious if you know your
world is tedious and you don't want to
do it then create a robot that has to
suffer through it for you
my favorite mentor taught me that I was
always going to have boring jobs if I
didn't automate myself out so here's the
kinds of things you should be automating
from a security point of view deployment
provisioning now if you're looking at
some going yeah but I already do chef
and stuff awesome fabulous you're
already on your way what you're talking
about is tweaking what you already do
not inventing a new thing testing how
many of you do testing and do you have a
lovely team next door that you throw
your testing at any of you couple you
yeah it's alright be honest I know how
this works
testing is a great thing to automate I'm
gonna give you tools but you can go and
do that tomorrow if you wanted to if
it's a Saturday I don't recommend it
static analysis so going through your
code and looking for common
vulnerabilities vulnerability management
which is our way of saying you've got
lots of holes in your space you should
at least know where they are even if you
can't patch them after being automated
we need to be autonomous so that means
every single thing in your environment
every person in your coding environment
needs to be able to get on and do their
thing there needs to be no bottlenecks
no breakdowns no ripples there can't be
a place where everything stops just
because
Barbara's taking a holiday or because
Mary hasn't shed her key with someone it
doesn't matter who you are or how long
you've been there you should be
autonomous how many of you have the word
principal senior or some kind of
management Tirol you're the grown-ups
yeah okay if you're the grown-up in your
space you might be used to being quite
autonomous but for the people who were
younger in that career so in the first
couple of years this will be quite scary
I'm actually a security person telling
you to give your juniors autonomy let
them go nuts they're not gonna go feral
I promise but they need to be able to
defend themselves and you and they need
to be your eyes as much like meerkats
really every team has to have those
skills the authority or Atonement nummy
and the accountability to do stuff if
you have just one person in your team
that does security it will fail because
that person a will be the most
employable person on your team and we'll
get snooped up by Google and go and live
in some kind of Silicon Valley heaven or
they will be so burnout and stress and
tired that they're just not going to
function and then you're not going to
have anything so making everyone
accountable it's kind of like what we
already do with UX a little bit and
performance and scaling these are just
bits that developers have taken on to
their existing load so that's what I
want you to do has to be integrated I
don't want you to have to go down the
corridor down the stairs to a basement
to find the security team to go and do
the security thing that come back to
your desk I don't want you to have to go
to a new tool or a new dashboard that's
pointless how many if you think you have
extra time in the day to go check new
tools yeah no didn't think so if you do
there are plenty of people here
recruiting for much more interesting
jobs we want security BTT tiny bits that
are woven into everything I want you to
not even know it's there
I want it woven in so that you don't
know it's there but at the same time I
want it powerful enough that it can stop
you it can stop your build now stopping
bills is not a good thing I'm not saying
security should stop your build all the
time but when we say no we need it to be
powerful enough that you listen
from integrators we need to be
repeatable we need to do it the same way
every time how many of you've ever had
that day where you're kind of you're
driving to work and you've got your kid
in the back of the car and next minute
you look around and their shoe is on the
highway and they're giggling is that
just me right those days
you're not going to repeat your jobs in
the same way you did the day before
where you'd had a very calm morning
because the child was somewhere else
repeating tasks when you have a life and
other things in it it's really really
hard
so creating repeatable security things
can be hard too we want to make sure we
do it the same way every time so that
way it's predictable in fact we want to
work together while we're doing this I
want you working together with the
security folk with every technical bit
of your organization to be like the best
defense horse known to man it's kind of
like a vengers but less cliche ridden
finally scalable like I said earlier
we've got an asymmetric problem there
aren't enough security people now if you
want numbers on that in New Zealand
right now there are 162 security
professionals according to our last
census 162 of that 35 for penetration
testers now if any of you work for CBA
you should be giggling slightly at this
point because I'm fairly certain you
employ more penetration testers or
almost as many penetration testers in
your company as we do in our country so
give you some scale we can't just throw
more people at it you can't hire for
these roles it takes on average eight
months to fill a qualified security role
and you will keep your staff member less
in two years and that's depressing so
what we need to do is we need to take it
from being some kind of crazy special
where we've got a guru and a cape and a
hat and we need to turn it into every
day I'm about to tell you how to make it
as boring and a repeatable as possible
so you never have to do it again but
that could be a good thing because you
want to focus on building that exciting
technology we talked about now if any of
you are in environments where security
is still in this blue sky kind of
innovation space please raise your hand
any of you got that high yeah
be very careful scaling out from blue
sky innovation spaces safe little
laboratories
really hard because the world works
differently there nothing scales out
into the complex mess of legacy code and
systems and irritating personality types
that is the rest of your organization so
are you ready to do the how-to yeah
let's get going what time we're we're
doing well we're doing okay let's start
with design your code has to come from
somewhere I don't care about the process
before where the business analysts and
the marketers did their thing you know
whatever I'm gonna give you tools that
are for developers for engineers so
we're going to start off with security
persona so if any of you have an affair
done behavior driven development which
is kinda like the hugs a love part of UX
where we define a people and what they
would look like and how they would
interact with our systems that's this
but kind of from a security perspective
so this is the idea that you can create
a persona or a fake character that wants
to do you harm now how many of you have
ever planned a bank robbery right okay
well first bit of homework don't
actually go through with it that's kind
of crime and inciting people to do crime
is also illegal though but let's start
creating some personas now I don't know
where you come from you come from
different organizations all over the
place but your security at personas are
going to be really vital because they
give us three things they tell us about
the motivation of the person is going to
attack us so you know why on earth are
they gonna get out of bed give you a
spoiler nobody gets out of bed and goes
you know what today's the day I do
sequel injection and it's going to be
exciting nobody does that
like when we attack and I say we I mean
you too because we do attack we just
don't think of it that way when we
attack we do it for a reason I'll come
back to that we look at the resources of
a persona so are they rich are they poor
do they have lots of tech stuff or or
they just largely throwing it together
from sticky back plastic and a little
bit of blue tack do they have access to
things like buildings and resources and
do they have skill finally so how many
of you have ever coded via Stack
Overflow
yeah that's all of you
huh that's not there's no shame in that
but knowing the ability of your attacker
knowing whether they can do everything
themselves or whether they have to look
something up is important there's gonna
tell you the sophistication of what
they're about to do so let's talk a
little bit about that motivation part so
there's financial right I like money you
like money let's get more money it's
quite straightforward personal I think
you're an idiot and I don't like you
very much
and I don't want to do my life without
causing you pain really nice fun things
or I love you you're awesome
I want you to give me all your attention
creepy right
don't do that egotistical I'm amazing
and you should know it how many of you
have ever written code just to show off
ha
the attackers do it too political you
really really really like fidget
spinners I really despise fidget
spinners I think they're an abomination
to mankind and that they're the
destruction of our planet in plastic
form it doesn't matter whether the
politics make sense by the way it just
matters that I care deeply about an
issue that you have an hour opposite
standpoint and we're gonna do something
about this I'm gonna try and prove my
point now if we dig into one of those
let's look at money so financial
motivation that gives us clues about how
they're going to attack us right this is
we're robbing a bank comes in so we can
steal actual money how many of you sat
next to someone you do not know not many
very carefully positioned yourself it's
quite adorable it's like little well
you've been in a crowded space with a
whole ton of people how many of you have
had your wallet stolen yet probably
really for real here oh okay this me
like I have the backs like I'm like oh
my goodness we need to have a tour to
the conference people we could steal
money but you haven't done that he is
stealing money is actually fairly rare
in an environment like this stealing
things to sell for money how many of you
have a shiny brand spanking new laptop
with you or a smartphone that probably
cost $1000 yeah
tablet PCs
sneakers that are like weird
limited-edition rare things like the
sneaker game here is really strong you
look at people's feet corporate
espionage if you don't want to steal
things you could just do espionage that
sounds fun right or extortion no okay
less fun but motivation really really
changes the types of attacks we're
looking at we're not looking straight
forward as I'm going to take your
database and just take the payment
details are in there it could be any
number of things we're trying to do
insider trading how many of you work for
publicly traded companies yeah knowing
what's going on inside your company
could actually be my motivation because
I want to drop some interesting
knowledge on the market now when we're
coming up with these personas excuse the
fact this is a male lego figure I'm an
Equal Opportunities criminal every one
of every type can be a criminal so
please don't gender or otherwise
categorize your attackers when you give
them a name you give them a narrative
you give them motivation and objectives
you give them a skill level and you give
them resources and once you've got all
that you write attack plans for them so
this becomes a really useful tool you
can use this to look at your
architectures go well what would these
people do what are they going to try and
achieve why does this meet with their
motivations and it gives you a little
framework to think about it it if you
work with UX designers you can also work
with them to make sure that users are
shepherded towards secure behaviors to
start with rather than at the end they
can also drive your testing linking back
to our bank robbery the my favorite
usage of them is linking with threat
assessments so a threat assessment is
the idea that we look at our
architecture whether that's drawn on a
piece of paper on a white border at some
god-awful PDF diagram of clouds doesn't
matter which scale you're on but we can
look at it in a consistent way and look
for common threats now this is stride
which is a Microsoft threat modeling
system but there are many others out
there there's free of charge you can go
find the documents and the tools and
things for it it gives us a way of
looking at things like spoofing and
tampering so pretending to be someone
else messing with data repudiation which
is the ability to trace an activity to
someone else in your system
information disclosure denial of service
and escalation of privilege in a
structured way
now don't forget it's not as simple as
you think denial of service for example
is my favorite one denial of service
we're used to thinking you know the
Internet of Things is attacking us all
once and so we fall over cuz too much
demand right did you know there's two of
the categories of denial of service that
nobody ever talks about this cascading
failure denial of service which links
very closely to a lot of the resilience
talks that have been here at NDC where
when a component you're using fails and
a cascading failure then happens
throughout your architecture and then
the third pipe is a developer driven
denial of service which is my
tongue-in-cheek name for when we write
crap code it makes it through to a
production environment and we kill it
how many of you have ever denied service
to your own application through bad code
aha rest of you good luck your time is
coming so security personas and threat
modeling give us tools to understand
who's going to attack us and why and how
they're going to do it now if we run
with that we can start planning the
controls and putting into our design now
let's talk about let's talk about the
design part now I will update the
previous slide I'm skipping over the
ones with links on in that case because
the link is broken so I'm gonna send you
a new version when I link the slides oh
so let's talk about the code we've got
our design we've got our security
personas are fed into stories we've got
a threat assessment which has given us
extra thought but when we're patting out
grooming our requirements so how do we
turn this into code there's three things
I want to talk about very briefly I want
to talk about peer review linters static
analysis
now how many of you peer review code yep
okay so the general rules of peer review
apply for security as well as your stuff
so giant peer reviews of giant changes
to code should just be sent to the sea
and the developer in charge should be
told to just do it again but do it
smaller you know the more code you're
trying to review the more likely you are
to not spot any of the issues in it same
with security now if you're looking for
some structure on how to do security
code review because that's hard then I
suggest you check this like the oh also
open web application security project at
the
and security verification standard there
is a link in the notes now that is a
documented almost book of how to
validate security in your own software
it's written for developers specifically
the newest version came out just late
last year and it's actively maintained
so you can download that and you can get
going and this should be done every
story every sprint every developer every
single time now that might mean that
you've got a bit of upscaling to do
across your team or it might be that you
do spilled your own linters for some of
these common things like why don't you
engineer your in solutions you're
actually software developers when I
write code it looks like a hacker wrote
code when you write code it actually
works if you want some more ideas of
things that you can look for and check
this is the standard security stories
these are published by an organization
called safe code in a wonderful PDF they
put out a few a few years ago now in
fact but still very very relevant they
give you 20 standard security stories
you can put into JIRA templates if you
do the JIRA thing or whatever your
ticketing system is and when you see
something like my thing has to open a
socket my thing has to be an API my
thing has to connect to a database it
gives you the security requirements that
you need to check which means when
you're doing your peer review you have a
pre defined set of security things that
aren't requiring you to go and manually
write this out for yourself okay two
things you can just go and do straight
away awesome okay those are the links to
it you can get going straight away I'm
gonna wait because that night lacy is
taking a look at you or your cameras I
am gonna give you the slides and you can
click the links and not type them Wow
okay so let's talk about testing next
now I know testing isn't sexy well I
think it's kind of sexy but I'm a bit
weird oh electric shock yay
testing is fundamental now whether you
do basic unit tests or whether you're
your place is more of a manual
exploration kind of testing kind of idea
it doesn't matter there's a couple of
things I can show you that you can get
going today in that testing phase and
bring automated things into a continuous
security environment so I'm going to
talk you through the links on these but
remember the principle heart behind this
is you built the code if you're the
developer it is your
baby it is your responsibility don't
just throw it over the fence to a
security tester take care of the basics
first and the basics are not hard to
test for you can write really reusable
tests for this or you can use a
vulnerability scanner that would do the
same thing now to get you started now
there's a wonderful lady from New
Zealand called Katrina she's all over
the twitters and she can get her Twitter
handle from her blog there and in 2015
she wrote the pathway to security
testing and it is a glorious blog post
that takes you step-by-step through all
of the steps you want to go through to
become a security minded tester now even
if you're a developer and you only do
this as part of your role this is useful
and if you're a developer you go Mouse
not really my circus I'm betting you
know a tester who would quite like that
and guess who's not at this conference
testers do you not find it really
interesting that a community decided
that it was a really good idea to divide
ourselves into tribes and then never
talk to each other hmm right
gauntlet and BDD security so Galt and
BDD security our automated test
frameworks for security you can go nuts
and do that today I have a short talk
slot today otherwise I demonstrate this
for you but it's written in cucumber you
can just put it into your thing write
your tests off you go same kind of style
testing you probably doing already if
your automated and finally oh what's
began they've written an OAuth testing
guide which is an entire book on this
and if you saw my Twitter yesterday they
also yesterday launched the mobile
testing guide so if any of you are
writing mobile applications these are
the security things you want to go look
at if you want to drive your security
requirements go look what the testers
are looking for build so we have done a
design we have done a coding we've done
some testing we're now into build now it
doesn't matter if this is a daily cycle
or every three weeks don't care let's do
what we can do a build time your
preflight checks so your build process
are the way of finding their security
internet issues before the internet does
outsourcing finding security issues to
the Internet is a fairly variable
process with different results I don't
know about you but I like being employed
and if your company end up all over the
internet but
cause they get somebody else finding
their security vulnerabilities and going
public with it then you're probably
gonna have a bit of a bad time now the
I'm going to give you a bit of guidance
and I'm going to talk you through the
two tools that we've got for you here
adding things to your build cycle is
actually really really difficult you can
do entire talks on this most people are
very sad when their bill suddenly goes
from three minutes to 24-hours
dependency checkers and some of the
build integrations you can do such as
vulnerability assessment will take a
very long time so you may actually find
for your environment if you are
continuous like three times a day or if
you haven't got the time to really tune
down these processes to only do the bit
you really need then you might be better
doing it in parallel rather than in line
at this point okay so that's something I
learnt the hard way when we suddenly
realized that our build time has shot up
and for us we couldn't scale it any
other way than to do parallel so please
bear that in mind so things you can do
if your open source developer and if you
do open source well that makes me sad to
go to your source they need your help
you can use libraries do if you have
budget that you can pay them very small
amount of money and they can pay for it
almost dependency checker is another one
I watched dependency checker and
libraries do do the same thing they're
checking all of your libraries and
frameworks for pre-existing
vulnerabilities in code so if you're
using an outdated version of x y&amp;amp;z
library then it's going to tell you how
many of you actively go and check that
already good for you I can always tell
because they're always ones in the
hoodies if you're not please remember
and I do use this analogy a lot so for
those of you who are silly enough to
come see me talk more than once remember
every single component every technology
bring into your lifecycle is a puppy
puppies of fun at parties and we like
having them but puppies poop these are
your vulnerabilities when you bring in
many now I've got clients who use
hundreds of cloud services they use
dozens of libraries if you know that you
remember each one of those is a puppy
and you do not want to be the person who
is manually shovel
the waste at the end of that so look
after what you have check your
dependencies at build time and stop your
build if you're using out-of-date stuff
like how many of you know you're using
out-of-date stuff and they're just going
yellow how many of you have justified it
because you're like it's deep inside my
architecture and nobody could possibly
reach it I will give you my favorite
example of why we don't sometimes care
and that there's a reprobate on the
internet called Tavis or Mandi he's not
really a reprobate he's quite lovely but
he likes destroying software and he
finds Laureus books and he finds him not
in the external layers but by passing
things through the layers and getting
them trusted at some weird deep bit of
the stack so it's almost like blind
exploitation of systems he's done this
with Fitbit scales with antivirus
remember if you're interesting enough if
there is a motivation a strong enough
someone will find a way to get to that
awful obscure part of your stack or
they'll just work around and attack your
people whichever you prefer managing
your dependencies is not just a nice to
have it's really really important
there's entire ecosystems and we're
going to come to that just shortly of
people actively trying to find
vulnerabilities all the time and the
more commonly component you're using the
more likely is a vulnerability will be
found
how many fuse node any node developers
oh that's good you're still admitting it
it's great fantastic node is a fantastic
example of why maturity levels vary in
language so if your net developer in
your site they go yeah now I'm cool new
gets got my back
you've probably write this more in
nougat than there is most other package
managers at this point but if you're in
a heterogeneous technical environment
are really rubbish term isn't it means
well we've got lots of different
technologies then it could be that not
all of your technologies are managing
their packages as securely as the core
language you're using node for example
has absolutely no checks on what's in
those packages not at all you can enter
a library into the NPM repository with
the name of a system call and it will be
accepted
you can then wait for people to triangle
all your library your system call
library and do what you like with it
there are some wonderful demonstrations
out there if you really want to
understand the other thing with node
that makes this interesting in this
relevant or net to is remember the more
densely connected your components are so
the more commonly use your libraries are
the better the target is so if
everything ends up at OpenSSL originally
so that's why we see so many
vulnerabilities come through in SSL
because well everyone's using it let's
talk about deployment that's our build
deploy slightly related slightly
separate file don't regularly and
measure now another thing you should go
look at the DevOps defensive toolkit
again shoot these are huge documents I
could do you a talk on each one of these
on their own but I get one talk so you
get homework so this is written by Jean
Kim and a few other people so if you've
read the Phoenix project and all those
kind of things
same people go read it this is your
survival 101 guide for getting through
security audits in a DevOps environment
really great thing we've got SSL labs by
Qualis which will give you free
validation of your SSL configuration if
you're interested in alternatively
there's a command-line tool called SSL
is docker benchmark docker security
benchmark if you are containerized and
want to validate your configuration for
deployment there remember again with
docker they do not validate the images
in the docker repos so if you're using a
pre-configured one please go and check
that because sometimes they come with
pre open ports or configurations that
final link is a terrible AWS link but
that's how they've chosen to link it and
that is valid as of this morning that
will get you to that defensive security
audit toolkit how many of you go oh my
god I didn't come to a talk for homework
this is ridiculous it's like 17 things
to try yes okay you can rant on the
internet later send all of you try your
your feedback to troy hunt ok maintain a
monitor so we've got our code out that
we've done our design we've done our
code and we've done our testing we've
done a diploma in a build hopefully it
was all green and we all went life
fantastic how many of you then go home
and go yep my work here is done any of
you got an ops team that then look after
it for you
code babysitters aha reality check those
days are coming to an end if they're not
for you yet they will it's increasingly
becoming the case that you will have to
maintain a look after your code until it
dies a fiery death on a server so bear
that in mind you need to know bits about
Incident Response about monitoring about
responsible disclosure because it turns
out while your ops teams are fantastic
they're not here either they don't know
how your code works or what a micro
service architecture is or what sharding
is they have no freaking clue about any
of this stuff you're about to foist into
their environment they know how to look
for common patterns and set alerts and
that kind of thing and they're fantastic
they're very good at the infrastructure
layer and the install application layer
but for your stuff the best people
defend the code you wrote is you know
what happens when your company gets this
you know dear company name email I found
a copy you a database on the Internet
do you like Bitcoin I like Bitcoin now I
don't know about you if any of you
received an email like this we've had 27
of them in the last three months I know
that because we have a managed program
for it
there are people who make their entire
living in their entire career off doing
this and that's great we want a world
where we're finding vulnerabilities and
aggressively fixing them that's a good
thing
but if you're not prepared for this then
it gets really scary really quickly how
many if you have a plan for what you
would do and you've using bug bounty
programs so that's the easiest way if
have budget will spend go talk to bug
Crowder hacker one or whatever they'll
take care of your problems and send you
probably a t-shirt but for the rest of
us we have to do it the gloriously
old-fashioned way which results with
reading an iso standard there are some
really wonderful resources out there
about doing this but the key thing is if
you're going to get an email like this
you need to have templated out your
responses you need to know who you've
got to tell in your company how many if
you think your boss would freak out if
you received an email like this and then
you told them if you don't think that's
going to happen
go try it when you get back just for
science I do like science it's really
terrifying to get an email like this
what does this actually look like
there's a word for this in criminal law
extortion absolutely you're coming back
full circle to our motivations from
earlier this is indistinguishable from
blackmail and extortion because it
normally comes with the promise that if
we don't hear from you we're going to go
public with it which to a publicly
traded company could be material that
could affect the value of your company
so being prepared for this is a really
tight line you're going to sit with
engineers and people that yourselves
will be like yeah yellow will write an
email it'll be fine we'll give them a
PGP and off we go
PGP encryption key and you're gonna sit
in a room with a lawyer and that lawyer
is going to need a hug by the end of it
so please prepare for this the future of
software security isn't just writing
secure code because security changes
over time even once your code is
deployed chances are new vulnerabilities
will be discovered is also about then
surviving if a bad thing happens how do
you do Incident Response how many of you
do it for security yeah not many it's
fun when you sit in a room and you
practice incidence you learn a lot you
learn a lot about yourself you learn a
lot about your company it's really fun
if you sit in an environment you go well
I think we've been hacked and we need to
check the access logs and you're doing a
simulation and you go yeah everyone
check the access logs and you go look at
the access logs and you find out you've
got access logs for 14 minutes because
somebody missed configured a server and
after 14 minutes they roll over and you
lose everything that's a really good
time to find that out
because if somebody comes to you because
an instance reached a software team they
need to investigate they don't want the
answer they don't want you to turn
around and go hey you can't really
investigate turns out we have newpsie
with a log file so incident response
simulation even a dev team is really
important what would you do if somebody
dropped all the tables in your database
easy restore from backup because you all
have backups right what would you do if
they did a minut change to a record in
your database every 27 minutes
the last six months that's really hard
to unpick in fact your backups aren't
going to help you much either because
most of us don't have the length of
backups to go back far enough to say
when it started we can't roll back to a
period of time because it's been
happening too long we can't spend the
manpower to surgically then in iterate
over the records and in fact what if
those little changes had ripple effects
through the logic of the system anyone
think this sounds fun
I think it's that's amazingly fun if it
doesn't sound fun find the fun in it
because it's much more fun to do this as
a simulation than it is to do it for
real I promise you again the lawyers
really don't like you when you sit there
go I think it's gonna take me about six
months if I write a script like then
you've got to know what your answer is
going to be and you may not like the
answer but it's important you know
preparing for incidents is kind of
natural you will have all heard by now
somebody from Netflix talked about the
simian army so their suite of tools that
will take down a data center or they
will take down a piece of code to see if
they're resilient this is what you need
to be you need to be the chaos monkeys
for your own organization how many of
you were affected by the AWS heritage
recently it's okay I've asked that to
Anna's you're using room I know that you
know that unless I'm feeling smug and
going Hajj or if you were affected we
were affected you start to get a very
very good feeling of how vulnerable you
are to security incidents happening in
other people's companies if somebody is
denial of service and you're coupled to
them in some way then you're gonna want
to care about that now there was a
wonderful talk at code mania in 2015 my
guy called Josh Robb he talked about
coupling and kinesins and software if
you haven't checked it out you should
now that talks about the dangers of
keeping a software too tightly together
nobody ever talks about that from a
security perspective of what happens
when we're so tightly coupled to these
outsources and third-party components
components that may go bankrupt
overnight there's been several
high-profile startups that went from all
is good all is good to disappeared off
the internet within a week in the last
six months if you not sure what
they look like go look at CrunchBase and
figure that out we've got companies that
got merged or acquired and suddenly
stopped supporting services we've got
the biggest denial of service attack in
history against Akamai last year which
was at his peak giving over six hundred
and seventy five gigabits of second of
data even the best of us in this room
cannot write code that can sustain
against six hundred and seventy five
gigabits per second of traffic this is
what we call a get a cup of tea and wait
situation turn it off
go home come back when it's over so your
insta response you're planning that is
your future writing code is awesome it's
fantastic we can go really fast when we
do it now but to do that safely to do
that securely means tweaking and
introducing a lot of extra things into
your life cycles that aren't already
there amis freeing up yourself to think
like a bad person think about who's
gonna do you harm and why they'd want to
do it you know the biggest risk to your
organization remains you the insiders
within er I'd love for you to go back to
your world and I don't do this publicly
and certainly don't tell your boss but
go and figure out all of the way she'd
defraud your company how would you do
harm to it right now because if you
can't figure that out if you can't
figure out with your access right now
how your software would fail doesn't
matter then nothing else will win so the
tricks of continuous security we want it
to be scalable we want it to be
autonomous we want it to have things
integrated through I've given you all
the principles you need I've given you a
whole raft of tools you can go and try
now the trick to this is you don't need
to try all of them if you do just a few
things you're doing way better than
everyone else out there I did a talk
earlier in the weekend you can catch the
video and I gave you the four things
that small companies startups would do
now if you're doing those four things
and these things you've pretty much
golden those four things were managing
your passwords and accounts privilege of
principle of least privilege or
application whitelisting
not the same thing if anyone's out there
going they're not the same thing they
know they're not but they joined
updating your applications updating your
operating system if you're doing those
plus the stuff in here you've got the
most modern security approach on the
planet and if you're sat there going
yeah but that sounds really rubbish and
there's still more work to do and it's
not perfect then here's my challenge to
you the world of continuous security the
world of security for software
developers is not going to be written by
people like me it's going to be written
by people like you who are engineers who
can figure out how to bring this into
your world and share it and scale it
with tooling or approaches so please
take everything that I've given you
today go run with it and in six months
time come back to me and tell me what
you did and how you changed it and why
it's better than when I told you what
didn't work that I told you if you have
any questions you're more than welcome
to ask them I do have stickers it's not
a bribe but you know it does make things
a little bit more interesting if not
it's been genuinely lovely to talk to
you today and I'll be doing ask me
anything this afternoon you can come
check that out
or if you're coming to pub conf I will
be talking about the nihilists guide to
cyber which is a slightly different
approach to security any questions you
can find me on the Twitter's that's the
easiest way to do it and I'll do it
today now if you are finding me on the
Twitter's and I get fed up of giving
this brief but I have to lady underscore
nert the other lady note without the
underscore is not me and she doesn't do
security or care about computers and she
doesn't want to be your friend so if you
do come to find me either email me or
find me on Twitter but get the right
person because it gets a bit
embarrassing and she gets cross if you
do email though my inbox is a nest of
dragons so you're gonna have to fight
for survival animated gifs get you
further than most things no questions
oh hello
yeah yeah absolutely so when we talked
about test here gauntlet and BDD
security so the question was how does a
well slap which is an application
vulnerability attack proxy essentially
how does that work in a continuous
private line does that work
that tool is is a really great starting
point it's free of charge you can
download and get going today it comes
with the following caveats
it's the Java tool which means you're
going to lump a whole ton of Java in
your environment if you're not Java shop
already somebody's gonna cry it's got
the worst UX known to man because it's a
swing app but BDD security and gauntlet
the two that are up there so BDD
particularly can wrap around zap in
headless mode so you don't have to use
the awful UX and you can then write
automated tests from it running a full
scan with something like zap or any of
the other vulnerability scanners is
fantastic and please consider it in your
pipeline the reason I mention it at
length is it takes a long time to run
one of those scans and the amount of
false positives you get is high so don't
just run the full app scan consider
doing something like BDD security where
you're targeting particular types of
vulnerabilities rather than just yellow
anything that goes or do the one soft
scan on a local environment first any
other questions now enjoy your lives the
