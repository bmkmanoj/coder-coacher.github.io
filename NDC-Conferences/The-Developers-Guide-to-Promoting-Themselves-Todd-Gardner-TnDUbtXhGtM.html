we're at the halfway point of NDC Oslo
right it's another day and a half after
me I'm really happy you're all here this
is the first time I've given this kind
of talk and this is a talk called the
developers guide to promoting themselves
it's all about the ideas on how to
actually sell yourself your ideas to
other people so that you can grow as a
person and as a professional in our
industry I want to tell you a little bit
about me first
so I'm from Minnesota I've been coming
to NBC ozlowe for four years now and the
first time I came here I was just trying
to to sell some ideas I put together a
product and I was trying to like throw
myself out there I didn't really know
what I was doing but over the last four
years I've learned a lot about how to
establish yourself as a brand how to
talk and build an audience of other
people and how to sell your ideas to
them and so I am NOT a marketer by trade
I am NOT a business person I trade I am
a developer but I've learned a lot about
that stuff in the last four years and
this is a talk where I want to share
some of that stuff with you if we were
to go back in time and tell myself for
years you are the kinds of stuff that I
would do now I would be literally
terrified so much of what I do now is me
pushing down the hidden introverts that
doesn't really want to talk to other
people and would rather just sit in the
hole but as you practice it and as you
do more of it you're able to be more
successful it's awesome I am Norwegian
by heritage and Minnesota's very
Scandinavian similar culture I know it's
a reserved somewhat passive aggressive
kind of thing but this is awesome and
you all can do it you all have a product
that you're trying to sell you're all
trying to sell yourself or you're trying
to sell the next thing you want to do
you want to start a blog you want to
break into professional training you
want to become a freelancer
consultant you want to build something
either you have it now or you'll have it
in the future
and so this is the kind of this is why
we need to know how to do this like
recently I was putting together a
training course and as a developer I put
together a plan for how I wanted to do
it and so I was thinking through here's
all the milestones I need I need to like
figure out the topics I want to talk
about and put together a draft and once
I have all of my coding exercises put
together and I've edit it and I'm done
but I think we all know that that's not
how it happens none of the ideas will
work most of them will be bad you'll go
through stages of fear and
procrastination where you think none of
your ideas are any good but the
important thing to note here that I want
to bring up is that even if you make it
through all of these hurdles nobody
cares when you're done with your product
maybe your mom cares but nobody cares
just because you built something nobody
cares until you start promoting it
there's a very common misbelief in
developer culture the great products
sell themselves
I personally said this and genuinely
believed it before I started building
things and trying to sell them myself
you can build the most ingenious piece
of software ever and if you don't tell
anybody about it
nobody cares nobody's going to use it
it's never going to get discovered
there's a lot of scary things in
marketing in promoting yourself there's
things like complexity that you cannot
get out of the system there is talking
to strangers and very slow feedback
loops on whether or not you know what
you're doing is working we need to be
spending probably at least as much of
our time and energy promoting the
products we build as we spent building
them and I know that's very hard for
engineers
well we want to spend the time building
software we want to spend it like
fiddling with the code and making sure
it works just right but you need to
spend most of more of your time
doing the other thing and because we're
our developers and we're 10
to not want to do those things you
probably need to spend even more time
promoting it than building it don't
panic I'm going to put together three
basic questions that we need to ask
ourselves as we want to do these sort of
things and that's what we're going to
talk about today the first question you
need to ask is who do you want to be
you're going to put yourself out in the
world to represent your brand your
product your whatever you want to do who
do you want to represent yourself as and
once you know that how do you build an
audience for your product and then
finally how do you sell to your audience
so part one who do you want to be one of
my favorite personalities on the subject
of marketing and promotion is a very
silly character who really is only on
twitter named fate Grimlock has anybody
heard of fate Grimlock fake room luck
isn't so active on on Twitter anymore he
doesn't treat very often anymore but he
used to do it all the time and all of
his stuff is still out there and he
would he pretends to be a giant robot
dinosaure who wants to talk to you about
startups so what he really wants to talk
to you about is how to build a
personality and a brand so you can be um
you can represent what you want to build
in the world and so I'm going to do my
attempts a very bad impression of faker
and Locke and read you this full quote
most important step for build products
is build products second most important
step is build personality for products
no have personality product boring no
one wants your product is bread or it's
bacon you want to be bacon you want to
be something you don't just want to have
functionality functionality isn't enough
you need to have a personality in what
you're doing
how do you have a personality having
answering these basic questions is
enough to have a personality first how
do you want to change the world what is
the thing that you're
going to do second what do you stand for
what's important to you what are the
things that you are going to engage in a
conversation over that you are going to
stand up for in supports and third I
know this one might be a little hard but
what do you hate you can't really be for
something unless you're against
something so what is your enemies what
are the things that you are going to
stand against so if you have a mission
values at an enemy that is enough that
is enough to start building your
personality from there I work on a thing
called pub comms
how many people have heard of pub comms
I hope everybody in the room has heard
of pub comp because we're holding a pub
comp on Friday PubCon so just crazy idea
where after a conference we get together
in a bar and I pull ten of the most
entertaining speakers I can find to do
five-minute funny talks and we sponsor a
bunch of beer and a bunch of food and
it's just generally silly a good time we
have one on this Friday there's a bunch
of details about that but I want to talk
to you about the pub comp personality
because that's what I've been building
for the past two years on the
personality of pub comp on Twitter and
how I represented it pub comp is
basically an alcoholic pub comp talks
about booze all the time and that's how
it builds its audience I pub comp goes
to distilleries and watches bourbon
getting made pub comp deals with
hangovers by going and finding pancakes
at 11:30 the next morning top comp or
emails out a mailing list with its
holiday recipe for dairy free gluten
free fat free eggnog
bourbon and this resonates with pub comp
like the fact that I am isolating this
personality resonates with a certain
group of people and it it works very
well one of the things that you'll have
to do almost right away when building
your personality is we will be putting
together a webpage of some kind to
represent you
or your product your blog or whatever
and so I want to talk to you about a few
tips on designing that page and I don't
mean design in the creative sense of
your CSS your layout pictures that's our
stuff but how do you build a page that
actually communicates your personality
and what you want it to do I have three
basic rules that I follow each page
should have a target audience have an
explicit goal and persuade number one to
do number two
so first have a target audience who do
you want to visit a page when I say it
when I'm building a page for pub comps I
want the people who are at the
conference that I'm partnering with to
go there that is my audience the
audience for pub conf do right now is
NDC Oslo what do I want them to do I
have an explicit goal for the page I
want people to click and buy tickets and
everything on that page is trying to
convince the audience to buy a ticket
and I do that with all these other
things like you want to talk about the
problems or the loneliness of not having
anything to do on a Friday night you
want to tie into emotional connections
of making sure people have something to
do you want to minify minimal costs and
improve that socially there's going to
be other people at the events there's
all kinds of different ways you can
persuade an audience now I want to show
you another example for something else
that I build in a minute so each page
needs to have a target audience explicit
goal and persuade number one to be
number two that those three together has
a really strong corollary back into
software development with the single
responsibility principle so think of
your pages your web pages that you build
should have a single responsibility who
do you want to visit it and what do you
want them to do and don't just throw all
the information on every page focus on
who you want to do that sort of thing
but don't get clever here is the thing
that most of us will go down rabbit hole
that a lot of us will go down and I went
down its
focusing on the tech I've had this
conversation maybe 20 times where
somebody will tell me hey I want to
start a blog and then they proceeded to
spend the next two years
not finding the blogging platform that
is just suiting to their needs and
building their own and they've
accomplished nothing they haven't
created a blog they haven't don't have
an audience and nobody cares what they
do but they've built their own blogging
platform that is creative in subway when
they should have just gone and got a
wordpress site or a ghost site or a
jekyll site or any of the thousands of
blogging platforms that's available
today or will to our web pages to go as
fast as possible tech isn't the point
building the audience is the point do
just enough to communicate what you need
to do and then move on with other things
we're all very busy so I want to tell
you give you an example for something
else that I work on so the products that
came here four years ago - first kind of
pitch to people is a service called Trek
Jess JavaScript air monitoring and I
want to show you a bit about how I do
follow my page principles in my actual
page so this is like a live demo here so
the target audience for this page is
JavaScript developers and what I want
them to do is I want them to sign up for
a free trial so everything on this page
is about that you'll see right above the
fold I'm asking my users to make a
decision yes start my free trial or no
tell me more it is very obvious what I
want them to do right off the bat if
they're not ready yet we go in and I
start talking about how I'm going to
make them better what are they going to
be able to do after they use the service
I show them social proof from other
context like I'm not the fly-by-night
operation there's some real people using
me and real people talking about me and
then again at the bottom I prove I ask I
try and convert them again and then I
even show hey here's how many other
things I've done but because I know my
audience are developers I know they're
going to be very skeptical of that
number like oh you just have a big
ticker on the bottom of the page that's
 I know that's not true
I'm going to click and I'm going to see
how that works I'm going to prove that
they're no good
and since I know that my developers are
there I left a little note in the markup
for the developer who will be clicking
on this and trying to prove me wrong
that says hey their developer I hope you
know that it wouldn't be performant for
me to make Ajax calls every time some
random from the internet shows up so I
don't do that here's the equation I'm
using to update this ticker and it's
based off of our real growth rates and
if you want to know the number email me
and I'll tell you what it is and this so
many people have emailed us saying that
that was awesome the fact that we
actually left that note for them so I
knew my audience for this and this whole
page is crafted to speak to that one
person it's not for anybody who it's the
site page hasn't targeted at my existing
customers or an investor or a partner or
media people looking to talk about us
it's only targeted for the potential
user potential JavaScript developer
alright let's move on to part two how do
we build an audience so once you know
who you are or who you want to be how do
you build an audience for your message
but first why bother building an
audience once you have something why you
just try and sell it right away building
an audience is because selling to
friends is easier I know quite a few
people here in this room do we've talked
before
we've hung out at an NBC events we've
talked in the last day or so we've gone
out had a beer we're all chatting right
now you all know who I am
and later when I want to try and do
something new you're going to know who I
am because we're friends now and friends
want each other to succeed people you
know the people you surround yourself
with in your communities want you to
succeed at whatever you're doing and you
want them to succeed subconsciously you
want your own communities to grow and so
when any of you go and do the things
that you want to do having a network
around you of people who already know
who you are
and think you're a pretty cool person
they want to buy your thing they want to
share your blog so building that
audience will help you no matter what
you want to go and do later so to build
an audience first we have to understand
kind of a hard truth that we don't often
talk about is that everybody is a
totally selfish narcissist deep down we
all care about ourselves and what we
want and that's okay we do all kinds of
genuine things for other people because
we're trying to make ourselves feel
better about helping other people
we just need to recognize that in both
ourselves and in everybody around us and
so as we want to build an audience and
talk to people don't do it for you don't
talk about what you want to talk about
talk about for them who build things for
your audience that they will find useful
so things like writing articles snippets
sharing snippets of code building a
video walkthrough of some text that
you've learned creating a project
template if you're really good at
building an angular 4 project maybe you
should have you know Mary's angular 4
templates out on github and then you
share it with people because that's kind
of thing that you the audience that you
want to build wants that content once
you not have something to build engage
other people you have to leave your
website your circles and go where there
where other people are and then bring
them back to what you're building if you
have a blog if you have a page there's
the home of your content go out and talk
and other communities go to Stack
Overflow go on Twitter go on medium and
engage with other people who are like
you and want to build their audience and
link back to your own content so medium
Facebook Twitter Stack Overflow github
all of these kind of things there are
people talking on these platforms who
could be part of your audience and are
probably interested in what you want to
do but when you put all of your content
purely on these platforms it doesn't
really do anything for you if you
started a blog
all on medium then all your content is
pulling people to medium maybe you
should be posting duplicates of your
content on mediums and linking back to
your own site or linking people from
Twitter back to your own pages when
PubCon tweets almost every tweet the pub
comp ever does links back to the
upcoming events some at the bottom
there's a URL in the air almost every
tweet that it puts out the real world
you need to engage people in the real
world like we're doing right now hi I'm
Todd that's my email address go into the
real world and then link people back to
how to find more information about you
and how to continue to engage with you I
know that can be hard I mean we're all
here now at NBC how many how many user
groups and conferences and stuff do we
go to is this the only one you're doing
are you going to lots of your local
events how do you level up here so first
level one go to an event you're all
you're all at least level one because
you're all here level two go and talk to
somebody who you don't know there are so
many smart people here the first time I
came to NBC ozlowe I literally didn't
know anybody
not a single person I knew was here and
I met so many friends that first time by
probably having a drink first
no the liquid courage and then walking
up to a group of strangers and saying hi
you look like cool people what do you do
and I met people who build like oil rig
automation and I met people who are
building JavaScript implementations of
search algorithms that could crawl other
pages and I met people working on robots
and just random attendees like just just
the people around you right now are all
working on amazing things you just gotta
go out and talk to them and third if you
can master that come up here do this be
the speaker leveling up your if you show
up an event people start seeing who you
are if you talk to people they'll start
remembering you and you'll build
relationships
if you are the speaker everybody get
everybody knows who you are and people
will want to talk to you after and
they'll want to share the things that
they're working on and so you can be
more and more effective in the real
world building your audience as you
level up it's going to take a while but
it gets bigger you'll spend the first
few months of this feeling like you're
screaming into the void
and nobody cares about what you're doing
but it'll come back to you in ways that
you don't quite understand it's going to
come back to you that Oh so-and-so I met
you at this conference like two years
ago and I've been following you ever
since and I love the stuff that you're
working on and it's probably happening
to all of you right now you just don't
realize it there's no good way to
measure how your audience is growing you
just keep at it because this is one of
the most valuable assets you will have
whenever you decide to make that next
step with your product all right
part three how do we sell this danger
ahead here we're actually going to talk
some marketing words and I don't want
them to scare you off we're going to
talk about the funnel how many of you
have heard the funnel a lot of people
throw this word around and like oh yeah
the funnel is performing like this blah
blah blah and a lot of them don't fully
even know what it means doesn't really
mean anything it's a very abstract term
and it means it's this architectural
concept the data is flowing through it
in the top you're pouring leads people
who might be interested in the thing
that you're doing and then we do some
stuff like the cloud it's all hidden you
don't actually know what's behind it and
on the bottom pour your customers
let's actually blow this open and start
understanding more about what you should
be having your funnel in through the top
of your funnel you're going to bring in
data for you're going to bring in your
data your leads from multiple different
channels and it depends on what kind of
thing you're doing what your channels
are if you're on the web these are the
traditional channels of where your
traffic
from like people go to your page or they
search for your page or they found you
on Twitter or you paid for an ad or
whatever but this might be I found I met
these three people at conferences and I
went to the JavaScript user group and
met that person and I had an email list
I brought in people from whatever your
channels are and then within your funnel
you have your page that we've built that
has a target audience an explicit goal
and persuades them to do it so that
channel is dumping in a person and
you're trying to convince them to fall
out the bottom and how you convince them
is going to be depend on what you're
trying to do you're going to set a
number of goals on your page or on your
site on what you want them to do is
going through and you might not be
you're probably not throwing you know a
touchdown pass on the first go you might
not be asking Oh give me money right
away you might say hey I have this thing
where I put together a bunch of content
on how to fix JavaScript errors and I'll
email you every week for the next three
weeks here's this course and that's
that's my first goal how do I get people
to continue having a conversation with
me is give me your email address in wala
send you some content maybe then I want
them to sign up for a free trial and
play around with something and only then
once I have a relationship with them and
I've already given some value do I ask
them to and maybe should pay me maybe
I'm helping you
like any good software architecture we
should know how to test these things how
do you test your funnel is with
analytics tools and the word analytic is
thrown around a lot what I mean
specifically our tools like intercom
Google Analytics mix panel custom stuff
you might roll in your own systems
tracking how your users or how your
potential customers are interacting with
you so you know what messages are
resonating no one tool here fits the job
and you shouldn't just throw intercom or
Google Analytics or Mixpanel or whatever
on your site and just start tracking all
of the things you should
test the things that you're trying to
figure out for every goal that you have
on your page you should have a test how
often is there are those things
happening for example back on track Jess
calm I know every time somebody clicks
on one of these buttons and I track that
I track how often are people saying yes
how many times are people saying no how
many times are people just scrolling
down to the bottom because I want to
know is that message resonating do
people not like the picture of those
people like all scared at their
JavaScript those people do people
resonate with this image having tests
know whether or not the pages that
you're building are resonating with your
people but unlike software our tests
aren't going to be pass/fail like you're
never going to get an analytics test
that will say yep your sites work and
you're good to go no changes it's all
very abstract you're going to get data
about how is a page converting here's
some data for pub comps this is pub comp
analytics for pub calm Pablo and this is
my conversions over time conversions for
pub cough being somebody purchased a
ticket now this isn't necessarily a
passing test but it's not a failing test
it's a hey here's how it's doing now I
can only understand whether or not my
test is passing by looking back at my
other data at previous events is this
how tickets sold I do this in London
this is how tickets sell when I do it in
Sydney it is going faster or slower and
that's all very contextual to you but
think of it like a test
think of it make sure you know how your
goals are performing here is the funnel
for track j/s this is the actual goals
that we track so I have channels coming
out on the top most of our channels are
to the web through an email distribution
list some social networks some
advertising some referrals on Stack
Overflow people come in and we have a
hits one of several landing pages kind
of targeted
so some of the landing pages for general
JavaScript some of the landing pages are
for react or angular or knockout and I
bring them in I'm trying to convince
them and the first thing I'm actually
trying to convince them is to subscribe
to my email course so that I can
establish a better relationship with
them and if they do that I just get
another chance
I keep getting more chances to interact
with them eventually I'm hoping that
they'll come through and sign up for a
trial and actually use our service after
that I have a strong indicator in our
service on whether or not somebody is
going to subscribe that's whether or not
they install our tracking agent in their
code if one of you one of my potential
customers bothers to take my code and
actually change their code with my code
it's a really strong signal for me
they're like oh they're giving this
thing a real shot they're probably going
to like want to talk to me more
and so I track that as well it's called
an activation metric and hopefully
they'll subscribe and fall at the bottom
as you're building your products and
your pages you need to think about what
is your flow what are the things that
you want your customers to do so that
earlier user your leads to do that they
turn into customers so out the bottom of
the funnel come your customers now what
is a customer worth for revenue based
products a lot of you are going to build
things that are not necessarily revenue
based you might build an open-source
library you might build a blog without
ads you might be just going for a
promotion although a promotion is
arguably a revenue based thing that
you're trying to do but so if you're
building something that will drive
revenue how do you think about what a
customer is worth so many of the things
that we're doing will cost you time and
money they'll cost you time to think
about it and build it it may cost you
money if you're paying for analytics
tools to help you understand stuff so
you need to know what is all this time
and money that you're spending worth to
you
so how do you how we can think of this
is a term called lifetime value when we
have a customer come out the bottom what
is the lifetime
value of the customer we can calculate
that in a couple of different ways so
here's an example this is some blog this
isn't real data this is based on real
data but it's anonymized I'm not going
to tell you who this is this blog drives
about two thousand dollars a month in ad
revenue so it's pretty popular a lot of
people want to actually advertise on
this person's blog and so they take him
two thousand dollars a month for ads and
he gets about 1.5 million hits a month
to his blog and for every one of those
hits they'll look at about 2.1 pages on
average average people can't look at
point one page and so we can calculate
what the lifetime value of one of his
customers are one of the people who
views his blog is his customer as two
thousand dollars divided by 1.5 million
pages times 2 or 1.5 million sessions
times two point one hits per session or
point zero zero two eight dollars that
is what is worth for him to get a
customer now once you know that you can
figure out how much you want to spend
getting more customers here's another
example here's a real example this is
pub comp data so the lifetime value of a
pub comp customer is our tickets are
about $30 more in Norway because your
beer is really expensive and it costs us
more to do it here but on average it's
about $30 and about up for all the
people who come to pub calls about 25%
keep coming back to more pub comps
repeat customers and so I can think of
my lifetime value as somebody buys a
ticket there give me $30 and then
there's a good there's a 25% chance that
they're going to give me $30 again and
there's probably a more advanced
mathematical equation I could figure out
to like continue calculating that over
and over but it's about right so a pub
comp customer is worth thirty seven
fifty to me so once I know that I can
figure out how much do I want to spend
getting more customers if I put a dollar
into putting more people on the top of
the funnel I can figure out what's the
percentage rate that my funnel operates
at if I get more dollars out the bottom
it's worth it and those all have real
terms so for example the dollars I put
it in the top would be through
advertising cost per click so typically
that's how most advertisements work is I
pay for every user who clicks on an ad
that I put into the site and then I no
can figure out what a conversion rate is
for every user who pours in the top of
my funnel I know what is the likelihood
that they will fall out the bottom and
that can be called your conversion rate
and then at the bottom if you multiply
or divide those across you get a cost to
acquire what will it cost you to acquire
a new customer so your cost per click
divided by your conversion rate is your
cost to acquire sorry I know it's a lot
of like really boring marketing terms
here's where the rubber hits the road is
that your cost to a choir customer this
is how much you're going to pay just to
get a customer you haven't even given
them what you want to give them yet just
to get a customer needs to be at least a
third or less of the value of that
customer let me explain that as PubCon
terms you buy a ticket up comps I have
to give you beer and food and I have to
rent a venue and I have to do stuff for
speakers and costs me stuff I use that
$30 to do stuff so I can't spend all $30
getting you to show up because then I
wouldn't have any money to actually do
the event but I could spend a little bit
to get you in because it will make me
have more 30 dollars to spend
so here's real data from pub Kampf the
pub comp funnel is 11.8 one percent
effective as of yesterday that's that's
what was what I calculated out and I
said earlier there's a lifetime value of
a pub comp customer is thirty seven
fifty so I can use our equations that we
talked about to figure out that so the
cost to acquire a customer or it that
if I can keep my cost to acquire
customer at 12:50 or less which is a
third so I can keep growing that means
that I have to get a dollar 47 or lest
as my cost per click if I can find a way
to advertise and spend less than a
dollar 47 this equation works and the
more money I pour and the more money at
what will pour out so let's see if I'm
getting that I do a lot of my
advertising for pub comps on Twitter has
anybody ever done Twitter ads they're
pretty good so I want to show you if
you're on Twitter and you are in
envelope I hope you've actually seen
some of my ads because I tried really
hard to target all of you let's look at
how I targeted you I'm going to edit the
campaigns everybody stopped going on the
internet you're slowing it down so
here's the campaign for pub comp Oslo
campaign is like a marketing term it's
just it's a project it's an app it's a
you know this is one thing I want to
advertise that's all it means
so I'm advertising for pub combos law
and that that what I'm trying to do with
this ad is I'm trying to get people to
go to my site and so I have to add a
little bit of tracking code to the pub
comp website that tells Twitter whether
or not a user comes in and then I can go
in and I can start targeting people like
who do I want to see an ad I want people
in Norway to see my ad and I don't care
what gender they are but I kind of want
them to be involved in software and this
conference tends to be more Microsoft
focused and so I want to target anybody
who like talks about Microsoft or
developers or software or programming
that's pretty good and then I grab all
of my speakers on Twitter and I say and
anybody who knows or follows or
interacts with those people I kind of
like want them to see my ad as well plus
all the people who follow pub comps
I said how much I want to spend so I'm
spending about twenty dollars a day
right now and I put together ads and the
ads are largely I just took the
headshots of all of me and then all of
the speakers and I did a really terrible
job trying to crop them out as you
created headshots for everybody and that
was a that was a fun night I started
watching house of cards and just kind of
going through and photoshopping head
after head after head and so we go all
the way through so that's that's what
the advertising campaign looked like so
I put together ads what I thought would
be compelling I targeted the people who
I thought I wanted to bring in and I
measure my success by whether or not
they click on the ad and visit my page
so now I can I don't want to save it at
that so now if this will load fast
enough we can go and actually look at
PubCon passe l'eau 27 running campaign
and see how it's going so here is each
individual ad running and I can
aggregate that data up I can see how
many times is my ad been shown how many
times has been clicked on and and the
cost per per result right now on average
my cost per link click is a dollar
seventy four I could actually break that
down by each individual speaker and you
know rub it in their face that Niall
gets way more clicks than Lars more
people are interested in clicking on
Niall but overall the advertising
campaign well that's the last seven days
let me do this whole year there we go so
over the entire time of this campaign my
total cost per click has been a dollar
twenty nine so going back to my
calculation here a dollar twenty nine is
less than a dollar forty seven so I am
making it is a reasonable investment for
me to continue this
but that ends up actually being if I
calculate all that all through is that
for every eight dollars and fifty five
cents I put it into the PubCon funnel I
get thirty seven dollars out the bottom
to buy us all more beer now in Norway
that really means I'm buying us one beer
and then we all have to share it but it
still works out that I'm making money
that I'm creating more value for us to
put on the event by putting money in on
the front and so just because I'm
spending money on something that's not
directly adding to the event this is
enabling me to run the rest of the event
so these were the three parts that we
really talked about today as you are
setting out to get your promotion to
break into consulting to start your blog
to launch a product to whatever you want
to do think about who do you want to be
in public who do you want to represent
yourself as how do you establish your
personality how do you build an audience
for whatever you want to do later and
then third we talked about some things
on how to sell so some recaps Minimum
Viable personality from fate Grimlock
figure out how do you want to change the
world what do you stand for and what do
you hate figuring out those things is a
foundation for whatever your personality
wants to be when you're building an
audience it's about creating things it's
not just about giving jabbing on Twitter
and not saying anything create things
that people will actually value create
things that they will find useful and
you can use as a way to engage with
people like I'm doing right now I spent
a lot of time building this presentation
and trying to like craft some ideas so
that I can engage with all of you and
share something that I think is going to
be valuable for you and then the funnel
building your funnel on how do you want
to convert people from your friends into
your customers they're still your
friends even if they're your customers
but it's awesome when they're both when
they're both your friends and your
customers so this was the developers
guide to promoting themselves that's all
I have I'd love to take some questions
and chat about whatever you're building
on but that's all I have for now
