is a C++ track and they keep moving us
right if you were at NBC for a few years
you know they keep moving us from room
to room
this time they hid us in this very
secure enclosure but anyway thank you
for coming and this is going to be
investigating C++ applications in
production on Linux and Windows quite a
title my name is Sasha I work for a
training and consulting company called
Stella we do this sort of thing
debugging performance investigations and
specifically if you have C++
that's cross-platform that you try to
run on both Windows and Linux or some
other flavors of UNIX systems or even if
you only target one platform the whole
story of how to look at your application
in production get performance
information from production get
diagnostic information from production
has traditionally been pretty difficult
this whole production side of things so
there's lots of tools for the
development story for the development
time profiling and debugging and that
sort of thing if you're on Windows I bet
you're using Visual Studio or something
like this if you're developing for Linux
with C++ you might be using eclipse
but these development tools they have
some pretty good debugging and
occasionally performance profiling
capabilities also but the production
side has often been neglected and so
this is what I want to focus on in this
talk give you some idea of the tools I
use and other people use to diagnose
issues in production in our C++
applications so just the slide is not
advancing there we go some objectives I
would like us to cover and for you to
come back at the end of the talk and be
sure that you actually learned so we'll
talk briefly about dump analysis getting
core dumps or dump file depends on the
OS and analyzing them in a debugger
without leaving the production
environment ideally we'll talk about
some tracing tools so lightweight
loggers that you can attach through
application and get an idea of
interesting runtime events that are
happening like file accesses disk
accesses Network events that sort of
thing
we'll talk about CPU profiling and how
to visualize
CPU profiling results to pinpoint CPU
bottlenecks in your production system
without having to suspend the process
without having to restart the process
just doing this for a live production
process we'll talk about memory leaks
briefly and how to identify which areas
in your code are allocating and not
freeing certain memory blocks and they
will do that by instrumenting memory
allocations but again doing this for a
live production process without having
to recompile or restart it and finally
we'll talk about some I'll show you some
examples of little one-liner
investigations where you briefly
slightly customize a tool to do
something very specific so that's the
plan in terms of operating systems so I
tried to highlight five core areas which
will be looking at CPU sampling so
figure out the CPU bottleneck dynamic
tracing which basically means attaching
to an area of the system that is not
instrumented with some logging in
advance then there's static tracing
which is attaching and tracing events on
a system which is instrumented for that
in advance and then we have core dump
generation and core dump analysis and
for all these different scenarios I've
tried to put together some tools and
different operating systems which would
be able to sort of stand up to the task
and that can be used in a production
environment so for example when on
Windows I'm putting down Visual Studio
in there I do I do intend to show an
alternative that you can use if you
can't install Visual Studio in your
production environment and on linux
again i want to show tools that can
actually be used in production and so
what we'll be focusing on is just
windows and linux but of course similar
options exist for other releases
sometimes some features might not be
fully supported or exactly the same but
the general idea hopefully will be
useful before we get started just a few
disclaimers first mind the overhead any
kind of production investigation comes
with the risk of screwing something up
in your in your environment by other
slowing things down or even crashing
your process because you attach a tool
that is too invasive or maybe even
crashing the whole system if you put too
much stress on the whole box so you need
to measure you need
to test all the tools I'm going to show
you in your own system in your own test
environment before you go ahead and
deploy them to production and a lot of
tools will have a dedicated overhead
section in their documentation at least
the good tools they will tell you what
to expect how they work and what the
expected overhead should be and then you
should be able to decide for yourself so
like if the overhead the worst-case
overhead is 20 percent I might be okay
with this for my production box someone
else might say know anything that's
worse than 2% I cannot afford to run on
my production box but some tools
actually have an overhead of like 200
percent and then well they're just not
so well suited for production use I
suppose so we'll start with core dumps
or dump files depends on the OS just as
a very very general introduction core
dumps or a dump file is a memory
snapshot of a running process so you
have a process running over time it has
a bunch of threads and you can attach
the process in a particular moment in
time suspend the process and write out
the process memory to a file and this
can happen either on demand like
whenever you want so like in this
illustration the process is running and
then we stop it grab a dump and let the
process continue execution or this could
happen on crash so if the process
crashes of the system crashes has an
unhandled exception or signal then we
can generate a core dump as well and
this is what most people actually
recognize when you mention core dumps to
them they think of crash dumps actually
but you can generate dumps whenever you
want based on arbitrary triggers and
conditions so let's take a look at some
of the tools we have for generating
dumps by the way in terms of demos I do
have live demos of everything but if
something doesn't work or if we don't
have time I also have screenshots so the
slides you will have at the end will
hopefully let you reconstruct this whole
story on your own box so unlocks the
dump generation story is fairly simple
the system is typically configured in
such a way that dumps can be generated
when an application crashes you can get
core dumps when an application crashes
there's a magic file called proxies
Colonel Corps pattern which you can
configure for one of two things you can
either put a file name in there and then
you would just get a core dump file with
that name in the current directory if
your application crashes with some
unhandled exception or you could put an
application name in there and
essentially pipe the dump information
into a separate process which might just
capture some basic info and write out a
log and not actually generate the whole
core dump which could be multiple
gigabytes of space so you could pipe the
dump output to an application where you
write it out to a file there's also a
configuration switch which controls the
maximum core dump file size that you are
willing to accept and you limit can
configure that and finally to open core
dumps you can use a bunch of different
debuggers gdb works ldd works and
there's a obviously additional custom
tools as well the Windows story is
fairly similar on Windows there's a
registry key of course because that's
the windows configuration database so
there's a registry key that you can
configure to get dump files
automatically whenever an application
crashes you can configure this to be
system-wide or for just one particular
process and both of these things
hopefully are something that you can
actually do on production boxes on Linux
you might want to limit the core dump
file size on Windows you have control
over the type of the dump if it's going
to contain the whole process memory or
your certain portions so that the file
is actually smaller but generally these
settings are something you can apply to
a production system and they would only
have effect if a process actually
crashes so as long as you don't have
crashes and operation as normal you
don't really pay anything for these
settings you only pay for them when
there's an actual crash and you want to
identify what happened later on Windows
there is also proc dump which can
generate core dumps on demand on Linux
there's a similar tool called G core
which can generate core dumps on demand
what do you do with them and I'll show
you a quick demo in a moment
on linux you can attach gdb for example
or ll DB or a bunch of other debuggers
to the dump file to the core dump and
ask the debugger to give you information
about the crash that occurred the call
stack of the current thread get list of
threads basically navigate the core dump
as if you were attached to the live
process at the moment of the crash this
is kind of the idea of generating core
dumps you get a snapshot of the process
and you can just traverse it as if it
were live of course you can't continue
execution from that point because it's
just a snapshot in time but it does give
you the same as if you broke into a
debugger and started looking around
that's the effect we want to get on
Windows Visual Studio can actually open
dump files and this is again less
interesting for production although you
could of course copy the file from the
production environment to a development
box and then open the dump in Visual
Studio on your development machine
alternatively there is a set of
lightweight debuggers such as windbg and
c DB which you can run in the actual
production system it's just files you
need to copy over there's no
installation involved and they can also
perform some basic dump analysis and
tell you what the exception was what the
call stack was which modules were loaded
which threads were running and that sort
of thing and for both of these options
you might also want to look and that's
something I'm not going to cover here
into automation of this whole process so
if you have a hundred dump files opening
each of them individually and then
running commands manually and inspecting
the results is going to get pretty
tedious so you do want to have some sort
of script which would get you just a
basic detailed the basic details out of
each core dump like the crash that
occurred the call stack which module was
responsible and then the next file and
the next in the next this can be
achieved on both Linux and Windows by
just automating the debugger essentially
scripting the debugger to do what you
want so I want to show you a couple of
examples again I have screenshots as a
backup but let's hope we don't need them
so on Windows I have in my registry the
configuration mentioned on the slides so
I have this app called battery meter
which crashes occasionally and I have
configured local dumps on my Windows
registry to generate dumps for the
battery meter process and place them in
this folder see flash temp slash dumps
whenever a crash in that process occurs
now if we actually run this crashing
battery meter application here's what it
looks like it's not actually doing
anything it's just a sample of course
and then I can click around and still
nothing happens but after a while it
crashes so application has stopped
working and I can close it and then if I
look in my dumps directory then there's
a sample file I generated yesterday and
there's also the dump file from right
now which windows created as soon as
that process crashed now this is a
complete memory snapshot so we see it's
it's like 64 megabytes and obviously for
larger processes it could be a lot
larger so there is control you can
exercise over the exact size of the file
now you can open those again like I've
said in visual studio or in a more
production friendly debugger just to
illustrate what happens when you open
this kind of file and Visual Studio I'm
going to drag it in and then Visual
Studio shows me the basic information
about the file which includes the
exception code that happened now this
number might not tell me much but if I
click the bug here on the right then
Visual Studio displays additional
information that says a heap has been
corrupted so they have a memory
corruption in this process actually and
if I click break it will show me the
call stack where this crash occurred
so this is a call stack inside the
windows heap manager which had a crash
so basically was trying to free memory
and then the heat noticed that it is
corrupted and I can navigate to my own
source code as well which is in this
function here and then I just need to
tell
my debugger where to find the source for
this for this process oh I don't have
the sources here well I'm sorry about
that but you could all you could
obviously tell your debugger to open the
source and actually show you the source
I do have a screenshot of this right
over here this is what it looks like
where I do have the sources on the
system it just points to a specific line
of source which had the crash and if you
look at the line it's actually pointing
to the closing brace over here and so
you might ask how come the closing brace
is trying to deallocate memory but then
you think about it and the closing brace
is where instructors run correct
so some destructor was running at this
closing brace and trying to free memory
so probably either the battery
information or the CPU information
classes they have inside a heat pointer
and the destructor for these classes is
then trying to free that pointer and it
notices that the heap has been corrupted
now obviously this isn't enough to
actually investigate what happened
exactly but we know where the crash was
and what the exception was and what the
call stack was and what all the other
threads were doing as well if we wanted
to the same thing we could replicate
using either windbg or even more
lightweight debuggers again these are
there are many options and we're not
going to look in depth at all of them
but for example in windbg which is a
lightweight debugger you could drag and
drop the dump file into the debugger
again and then if you run an extra
command called heap you would actually
get some more specific information about
the heap corruption and this is
something visual studio actually doesn't
do and so this more specific information
would tell you for example that we
detected an error whose features are
consistent with a buffer overrun so our
memory corruption and the heap is not
just a random memory corruption it looks
like a buffer overrun over heap buffer
which can be used for further
investigation and this whole process can
also be automated so here I have a
screen shot from a command line window
on on windows where I ran the CDD
eggs
the tool this is a command-line debugger
which is again very very lightweight and
what it can give you is the same
analysis essentially in the shape of a
text file and I have actually stored
that text file right over here so we can
look at it if we want and this is just
an analysis and exception analysis which
has in in text format the same
information we had a corrupted heap you
can see the call stack you can see the
function and which should happen the
reason I'm showing this is just to
explain that we can automate the whole
process once I have a command a
one-liner that analyzes the dump and
generates this kind of text I can build
the whole workflow which would do this
for a hundred files and then aggregate
the the exception results let's take a
look at the story on Linux just very
briefly so this is a screenshot but
let's try and do it live so I have over
here a core file which was generated
previously from crashing one of my
sample processes these are are online so
you could replicate these results later
so I'm going to just resize this a
little I'm going to run gdb and tell gdb
that the actual application we are we're
looking at is sorry it's over here in
this folder actually it's called per
grep and the core file is this core file
over here and then gdb happily loads
that core file and says that the program
was terminated with signal cig abort so
this is why we crashed and it tells me
that the current thread is thread number
one and then we get we can again perform
some analysis so for example I could get
a stack trace in in gdb and this is C++
so the function names you know what it
looks like the function names are
slightly on the longer side but you can
see that this whole thing is happening
inside the heap so this also has a heap
corruption very likely so we are trying
to call leap C free to free memory and
then it just bails out with a with an
error and we can see along the way some
strings in
indicating double three or corruption so
we also have a hip corruption here and
if we look at the whole call stack which
is kind of hard to read through but if
we look at the call stack we got here
from from stood vector over here stood
vector of string which was trying to
allocate something so it called into the
allocator and probably had to resize
things and eventually the heap
implementation again in Lindsey noticed
that the heap has become corrupted so
this is just again a very very general
overview of what dump files and core
dumps can do for you you can generate
them automatically when something goes
wrong you can then on the same system
even in production analyze the crash and
see like what's what's happening in your
process and this is very very similar
across operating systems and it is a key
way of diagnosing production crashes
essentially there's a I mean hardly a
way to run a debugger attached to your
production process at all times so this
is the second best thing it basically
replicates the whole debugger experience
on a snapshot of your processors memory
now it unfortunately requires if you are
trying to do this on the production
system it unfortunately requires that
you have debug information or debugging
symbols on the production system as well
if you want to do core dump analysis in
production you will also need debug
information in production if you do not
have debug information and I'll touch on
that in a second you will get
meaningless call stacks you will not get
function names you will not get code
addresses and source information so for
example on Linux you might get something
like this where the call stack is just
full of question marks on Windows you
might get a call stack which maybe looks
a little better but it doesn't actually
have function names mostly right it only
has module names and offsets so this is
typically happening because you don't
have debug information or symbols for
your for your application and just to
briefly cover that before we move on
on Linux when you build you need to
generate debug information into into
your binary this is something that
happens at link time and that debug
information would include function names
class names layouts of various types
parameter information source information
as well and if you don't like the fact
it bloats up your binaries then you can
separate the debug information from the
actual executable or from your actual
library so you can omit it into the
binary but then separate them so you
have a separate debug information file
and a separate executable file and on
Windows it's a pretty similar story
except they're always separate so in
Windows when you compile with debug
information the compiler and linker
generate a separate file called PDF a
PDB file which contains the debug
information and if you're looking for a
debug information for binaries outside
of your control like your C++ runtime
implementation or your C++ library then
these should probably be available well
officially so you're not you know you
don't really have to build these
components from source in order to get
debug information for them on Windows
Microsoft makes available most of the
debug information for Microsoft binaries
so for the STL and the C++ runtime and
so on Microsoft has a public server a
web server which will serve your
debugger the debug info files
automatically and on Linux it's slightly
more evolved but still most
distributions would have ready-made
packages with debug information that you
can install so for example an ubuntu you
might be able to install a package with
the DB g suffix whereas on fedora for
example there is a dedicated debug info
install command which takes a package
and tries to find the matching debug
information of course there's a lot of
salties here in terms of finding the
exact right version and so on but this
is something that generally debuggers
have learned to take care of for us so
this was the dump analysis story in very
very short and I hope sort of try manage
to convey the important pieces of this
of
of of being able to get together dump
files when something crashes or goes
wrong in your production environment and
then analyzing those crash dumps or core
dumps even on the same system the reason
I am doing the serve summary is that
from now on we're going to move to
performance and tracing things and if
you have any questions about diagnostic
part we saw so far you could we could
talk about this at the end so we're
going to talk about again performance
and tracing now again on both operating
systems and there's an important concept
to get out of the way first
which is the concept of sampling versus
tracing so essentially both of these are
just techniques for Diagnostics for
getting performance information and
diagnostic information out of the system
sampling works by not looking at
everything that is happening but rather
grabbing samples once in a while so for
example if you wanted to follow a CPU
execution of a particular application
you probably couldn't record every
single CPU instruction as it is executed
that would be a little too expensive so
you usually use sampling for this you
configure the CPU to give you for
example an interrupt every million
instructions executed and then you
aggregate those samples so you don't
really have a record of every single
instruction you have a record every
millionth instruction but then you a
granade those samples and you have
something statistically meaningful to
draw results from tracing on the other
hand is recording every single event and
this is something you typically use for
lower frequency things like disk
accesses maybe a DNS resolution requests
HTTP requests that sort of thing which
is only happening like 10,000 times per
second and not ten billion times per
second so that's pretty much where
sampling and tracing would fit in and at
these request rates essentially so on
Windows both sampling and tracing are
pretty well covered by a mechanism
called event tracing for Windows in the
previous slot there was actually a talk
about egw with a more dotnet perspective
but
can absolutely be used for C++ on
Windows as well and I'll show you some
pretty cool things that we can do with
etw it is basically a logging
infrastructure for the operating system
where various components across the
system like the kernel itself the
scheduler the memory manager the heap
implementation a bunch of other
components emit interesting trace
messages that we can either record into
a file or analyze in real time just get
the events in real time and process them
without even saving them to disk and
this allows for very low overhead
tracing tools to be implemented if you
don't actually store the events if you
just look at them in real time and then
drop them you can get very low overheads
even if you have high frequencies of
events like memory allocations for
example could be happening hundreds of
thousands of times per second
but you could still feasibly use ET w if
you are discarding events and not
actually recording the whole thing on
Linux there is a similar mechanism
similar in spirit anyway called per
vents which is built into the Linux
kernel it's been available for ages as
well and it can do sampling and tracing
again it has a very similar architecture
actually where there's various kinds of
events that you can enable and they can
either go into a file for later analysis
or into a shared memory buffer for
real-time consumption by some kind of
application and Linux also has a
front-end for using per vents which is
just called perf and it's not built into
Linux in the sense it won't always be
available by default but it is part of
the Linux kernel tree so you can install
it typically or even build it from
source for the specific kernel that you
have and it works on a variety of
platforms Intel obviously but also arm
and a bunch of other less traditional
platforms that Linux works on and before
we actually look at collecting storing
and visualizing events from sampling and
tracing I do want to mention just
briefly something a lot of C++
developers are already using but some
are not which is a visual
method for a lot of performance
information that we'll be generating
today very very useful and important
called flame graphs it is basically a
way to visualize lots of stack traces so
for example suppose you record all the
file accesses that your system is
performing and you have a call stack of
where that file access came from in your
code and then you want to see like which
paths in my code are causing lots of
file accesses am I going to do the same
thing with Network events which paths in
my code are causing lots of network
accesses or which parts in my code are
using lots of CPU time so whenever you
have a lot of coal stacks and you want
to visualize them quickly in a
meaningful way this is where flame
graphs come in and will I'll show you an
example in a moment but basically if you
look at the diagram it is just an
adjacency diagram where there's to
access the the horizontal axis is not a
timeline it is just sorted
alphabetically so it's not a timeline
series it's just sorted alphabetically
chart the vertical axis the y-axis is a
call stack so if you see a function on
top of another function it means it was
called by that other function and of
course I didn't say but every rectangle
in the graph is a function is a function
in a call stack that you collected and
the wider something is the more
prominent it was so width is something
that's fairly easy to identify and this
is why flame graphs are useful you can
glance at the whole thing immediately
and you can say okay so this thing here
on the right looks interesting let's
look at that but this little flame over
here right this thing it doesn't look
meaningful so even though I can't see
the function name I'm probably not going
to zoom into that unless I'm really
desperate because that's that's just a
tiny proportion of time so let's see how
to generate those just one little thing
before we get there in order to actually
successfully resolve call stacks so we
get a full picture of where the event
was coming from we have to overcome a
pretty annoying optimization
which some compilers do by default
called frame pointer emission basically
frame pointer emission means that the
compiler will not will not create a
linked list of frame pointers on the
stack so you can't reconstruct the stack
by just looking at its state in a given
time and that can make it hard for tools
like etw and perf and other profiling
tools as well to get an accurate stack
trace of your threads now fpö
does have like some performance benefit
but I think it is mostly agreed by
people in the performance world that
it's not worth it like the two or three
percent performance benefit you get from
this optimisation is not worth the pain
in profiling and debugging your system
later so essentially it's it's an
optimization worth turning off now on
Linux there's a switch for most
compilers called ethno a mid frame
pointer which will disable the Septim
ization Linux actually in some cases if
you have full debug information perf
would sometimes be able to figure out
your call stack even if you do have FBO
turned on but a lot of other tools will
not be able to cope with it so you
probably would want to turn this off
anyway and then Windows egw basically
doesn't work if you have a binary
compiled with this optimization so the
Microsoft compilers anyway they stopped
using this optimization for quite a
while I think since Visual C++ 2003 they
realized it's just not worth the the
pain in debugging and profiling which
usually results so once we have that out
of the way we can actually take a look
at getting some stack traces out of a
live running system will start with CPU
profiling but then I'll talk about off
CPU time as well so block threads like
why is my thread blocking and waiting
for something and then we'll talk about
memory leaks as well which are well the
technique I'm going to use is still
going to be based on collecting stack
traces at interesting points so let's
take a look a quick look at the CPU
story first I might skip by using
screenshots here but I do want to show
you the
target application that I'll be using it
is a very simple one on Windows called
stupid notepad it's a note bit like app
this is a notepad like app and I am
typing like pretty fast but there are
some delays so there are these hiccups
in the in the app and if I put it
side-by-side with something simple like
task manager and just look at stupid
notepad at the CPU usage so if you look
at that at the same time as I'm typing
you would see occasional jumps right so
it goes from zero all the way to 20 18
something like that
so there are CPU spikes and I mean even
without using any professional tools
might be able to conclude that the CPU
spikes are related to my typing activity
and when there is a spike then there is
also a lag in the actual user interface
so this is what we want to investigate
and on Windows we are going to use etw
for this we're going to record events
every certain number of clock cycles we
are going to record the calls back of
what this application is doing and then
we'll visualize the whole thing so the
recording if I actually did it from
scratch here I would probably do with
Windows performance recorder which is a
free tool based on etw which you can
absolutely put in production and in its
in its basic mode it just has a bunch of
check boxes you can check for recording
different kinds of interesting events so
you want to profile just CPU usage will
check the CPU usage checkbox and then
you do a recording with this tool and
you open it with a slightly different
tool called oops the windows performance
analyzer so this is a matching tool they
both ship as part of the same library
and you can actually just copy them over
it's just the executable files you did
you don't really need to install
anything now once I opened my recording
file in Windows performance analyzer it
can
give me an overview first let's just
switch back to the line graph it can
give me an overview of CPU usage across
the different processes on my system and
this is just a default view there's a
bunch of options we could customize but
you can see that the stupid notepad
process which is this guy over here this
is this line has pretty obvious spikes
in CPU activity and I can actually
filter and just keep that one process on
my chart so you can see it is pretty
obvious spike selectivity over the
recording interval so most of the time
I'm idle but then I just have those
spikes going all the way up to 25% of
CPU and actually it's across all course
so if I have four cores 25% is one full
core being utilized by this process now
I want to figure out which parts of the
actual code are are being spent on CPU
and this is where the stack view comes
in so let me just see if I can yeah so
I'm going to start expanding here and
one of the things I want you to see is
that you can when you visualize a stack
tree like this texturally like an actual
tree which is the default for a lot of
tools it can be really hard to see
what's going on you'd need to expend
lots and lots of levels to figure out
which function is actually taking lots
of time and if you have ever used
profilers you know that most profilers
will default to this sort of view which
has a tree that you have to navigate up
to a 100 depth which is really hard so
let's start navigating and just to give
you an idea this is a very simple
application by the way but it is windows
and there's a lot of stuff around so I
am still expanding and none of this is
still my actual code so I'm going to
keep expanding a little more and we are
in this patch message and internal call
will do procedure and okay so this is
actually a function in my application
that I can tell you something about if
we make it a little bigger
this is a function called unchanged main
edit which is in my source code and it's
probably I mean judging by the name it's
probably cold whenever I type something
in and so it looks like it's doing some
CPU work now how much exactly I could go
back here and so this count column that
you see is the number of stack traces
that we grabbed which had this function
on the stack so how many samples did we
grab overall we had eight hundred eight
thousand nine hundred and sixty stack
samples overall five thousand something
were in that function and it's
descendants so this is probably one of
the cpu bottlenecks in my application
but I mean I did have to navigate the
tree quite a bit and it's very painful
for more complex apps obviously so flame
graphs again could be pretty useful and
windows performance analyzer actually
now have support for flame graphs this
is relatively new so if we switch to the
flame graph view here's what it looks
like and I mean the individual
rectangles are a little too small to
read so we don't really see function
names unless we zoom in even further but
hopefully like the structure of the tree
is immediately visible so I don't really
need to navigate through sorry I'm not
going to point up this screen I don't
really have to navigate through this
whole hierarchy to figure out that these
are the functions I should be looking at
right so everything below I just see it
has the same width and there's nothing
particularly interesting in there
probably so I can immediately go to this
unchanged main edit function and then if
I want I could investigate its
descendants
like which functions are called by this
guy in order to consume CPU time so
again this is just a visualization
technique with a pretty useful one and I
hope you find it useful as well the
underlying process was quite simple we
recorded stark samples and then we used
windows for
analyzer to take a look the Linux story
is fairly simple let's see if we could
do this live so let's try the Mac X app
so this is a very simple simple ass app
which basically multiplies matrices 500
times and it's really CPU intensive and
I want to figure out where so we're
going to use on Linux we're going to use
perf in order to investigate its
behavior so I'm just going to switch
over to this root shell make it a little
bigger and I will run perf this is the
front-end for for the perfect mechanism
which I have installed I'm going to run
it in record mode
I will instruct it to capture 97 samples
per second so this is easily
configurable
I will instruct it to grab call stacks
for me the G switch is for call stack
for some reason well actually it's
called graph so maybe it makes sense and
then finally I need to give it the
actual workload to execute or I could
attach it to an already running process
I'm going to use a just the existing
binary okay so it's running with perf
attached and taking 97 snapshots per
second and you can see it is basically
finished and it says I wrote out 632
samples so again 97 times per second
perf grabbed a call stack of what the
application was doing and at the end we
have 632 of those snapshots and it's not
very big like the file we wrote this to
was not very big just 72 kilobytes or so
of course if we increase the frequency
or if you have multiple cores being used
or if you capture for longer interval
your files might grow bigger and now
it's time to visualize this so I could
show you we're going to skip that I
could show you the native perf interface
for looking at the recording the
recorded information it's basically this
command line based UI it's cursed
but we're not going to go through that I
just want to immediately generate a
flame graph of this and show you the
flame graph so I have a screenshot of
the flame graph which is going to be a
little easier here's what the flame
graph looks like on the bottom so again
instead of navigating through a lot of a
lot of stack frames a lot of trees I can
just immediately see that the hottest
functions in this app are matrix of
float operator oh this is actually
unfortunate this is operator rectangular
brackets but the flame graph generator
actually stripped that it probably
thought it was just unnecessary well C++
you know so this this is matrix a float
operator rectangular brackets and also
matrix a float operator star is doing
the actual multiplication and here on
the right there is also something inside
vector now if this was if this were a
live flame graph I could actually
navigate this view and zoom in again I
don't have a lot of time so I'm not
going to zoom into this but I will have
the flame graph file for you to look at
if you'd like so this is again just a
very quick way from the command line to
generate a visualization of where my
process is spending time and what's nice
about perf here is that the overhead is
totally controllable so I used 97
snapshots per second here if this is too
much and I see it flows down my process
I can bring this down I can take 10
samples per second and if I record for
sufficiently long I will have a
meaningful sample or on the other hand
if I don't get enough samples then I
could increase the number of samples per
second and from experience around 100
samples per second works pretty much ok
on typical systems unless you have a
very large number of cores and then you
probably want to take this down a notch
because it grabs a sample of every core
so it will get bigger if you have more
cores so this was just CPU profiling and
I want us to be able to apply a very
similar technique for memory leak
analysis as well and now again if you
have been doing
C++ for a while you know that there are
some development time tools for this
like Val grind on Linux and some code
analysis tools on Windows as well these
are not very relevant for production use
because they typically either slow down
your process like by 500 percent or they
require recompilation which is not
something you'd probably do in
production so instead here's a general
process we're going to follow we are
going to attach to a running process and
look at every malloc and free code and
of course if you're using some custom
allocator
we could attach to your custom
allocators allocation routine and your
custom allocators the allocation routine
and then for each allocation you make
we're going to record and store the
allocated address and the size and the
call stack which leads to that
allocation and then whenever you free
memory we'll look at the address and if
it's something we know that you
allocated before we're just going to
discard that allocation so at any given
time we only have the outstanding
allocations the one that were allocated
but not freed yet by the application
when we suspect that there's a memory
leak we can just dump out all the
outstanding allocations and see how many
bytes we have outstanding how many
allocations we have outstanding and
which call stacks led to those
outstanding allocations so which call
stacks allocated memory that wasn't
freed yet now of course it will still be
up to you to determine if it's a if it's
a genuine leak or just something you're
going to free later right but it will
still give you the immediate insight
into okay so here's something I have
allocated and haven't freed yet does
that make sense now of course
aggregation is very important here
because if I have a million outstanding
allocations I don't want to see a
million lines
I want something aggregated so this call
stack performed 100,000 allocations that
were not freed yet now the old way of
doing this on Linux and I'm going to
show the the Linux and Windows ways in a
moment
the old way of doing this on Linux would
be by using perf again we could instruct
perf to record malloc and free calls in
the Lib C library put that in a file in
a perfect data file and then analyze it
using some kind of script I suppose to
see which allocations were outstanding
now this is slow probably and the perf
that data file that we generate is
probably going to be gigantic if we do
this for even five minutes on a typical
process it's going to be a huge data
file so the new way and this is
something worth knowing about modern
Linux systems the new way is to actually
do the whole aggregation part the stack
aggregation part in the kernel when you
attach to the interesting events rather
than dump out the whole thing to a file
and then look at the file contents later
so there is a unique kernel technology
on Linux there's not something like this
available for Windows unfortunately
called bps and this is this has been
part of Linux and Linux well did the
original BPF technology actually has
been part of Linux for ages but using
BPF for tracing is something you can do
since linux 4.1 or so so it's fairly
recent and it's only in fairly recent
kernels however if you do have a
sufficiently recent kernel you can get
the next generation of tracing tools
essentially by using that kernel side
aggregator rather than dumping all the
events out to a file and then analyzing
the file and there's a large collection
of tools called BCC which you can find
online I've also written some of those
and there's contributors from a bunch of
different companies all open-source
tools which use the BPF technology in
order to solve particular problems which
are too expensive for standard tracers
here are some of the tools that BCC
contains and one of them happens to be
mem leak up top which is a tool for
inspecting memory leaks it basically
does what I described previously it
I chose to malloc and free and then it
dumps out a record of outstanding
allocations but it doesn't dump every
single event to a file and post process
it later it does the aggregation on the
kernel side of things
so the only thing that's actually stored
in memory is this call stack made 100
allocations you don't even store the
same whole stack 100 times you do the
aggregation right when you collect the
event so the overhead is much much lower
in practical terms what does it look
like so I'm going to switch to
screenshots here because we don't have a
lot of time on the windows side of
things and I'm going to start in the
same order on the windows side of things
if you have a memory leak like this
we're going to use exactly the strategy
I just described we're going to attach
to malloc and free and we are going to
inspect the differences the outstanding
allocations and the way we actually
attach to malloc and free is going to be
using etw events this is a full listing
of all the commands you would need to
run for this in order to attach etw
facing to heap allocations and freeze
and get a file that has a record of
every allocation and free that your
process has made but again it's going to
be a file so it's going to be a pretty
massive file and you would need to
analyze that file later because windows
doesn't have BPF or anything like it so
this is actually the only way to get
this sort of thing and then you would
analyze that recording in windows
performance analyzer or some other etw
tool and again just skipping to the to
the crux of it you would be able to get
a stack trace which allocates memory
that wasn't read so this is outstanding
allocations and you'd be able to see the
number of the allocations made by that
call stack and their total impacting
size so the total size of those
allocations in bytes so this is a call
stack inside my application which has
allocated 8 megabytes of memory which
hasn't been freed yet so this is what we
get from this output
and again it's actually pretty simple
like the whole process you can write a
batch file which would do this for you
but it does rely on generating a huge
file if you run this on a production
system for 10 minutes you could get like
several gigabytes worth of allocation
and free data the Linux side is slightly
easier so I'm just going to skip over to
the actual tool this is output from the
mem weak tool from VCC and it basically
dumps out stack traces and how many
outstanding allocations these stack
traces have so it's basically the same
information except in text format and it
can be parsed and displayed as a flame
graph if you prefer so again it's just
stack traces so it might actually make
sense to display them as a flame graph
and so as usual there's this huge C++
stack here so it's a little hard to read
but it does say at the beginning I have
95 outstanding allocations which are
responsible for slightly under a
megabyte of memory which all came from
this call stack so this call stack has
made 95 allocations which have not been
reclaimed which have not been freed and
you can go ahead and analyze and if and
see if that makes sense that your app
should not have freed that memory yet so
I'm going to cover very briefly just to
leave you a minute or two for questions
as well I'm going to cover very briefly
two additional scenarios which tracing
tools can cover in a very similar way so
there's not going to be something super
innovative here but just to let you know
that these scenarios can also be covered
on both operating systems using pretty
much the same tools we already learned
about so one of those is blocks time a
lot of applications don't actually have
lots of CPU usage or not exclusively
about CPU usage they actually have a lot
of blocking as well so waiting for
something waiting for a synchronization
mechanism waiting for network waiting
for a database waiting for a file these
are waiting things that our applications
would typically do now to trace that
time to actually account for
that time we're processes are sleeping
essentially waiting for something we can
use context switch events from the
operating system so both on Windows and
on Linux we can ask the respective
tracing tools to get us a record of
every context switch
so whenever a thread switches from
running to waiting and then back from
waiting to running we can trace where
this is happening when this is happening
for how long this is happening and then
give you a picture of okay so this
function here I spent five seconds
waiting for a lock while in that
function so it's essentially just a
matter of correlating the context switch
events which of course sounds easier
than it is but someone has already done
this job but basically we just need from
the OS the context switch information in
order to do that now the only reason I'm
even mentioning this is that context
switches are a pretty common thing so
you could have a million context
switches per second like easily on a
typical loaded system and recording
every single context switch to a file
again is going to be pretty prohibitive
so on Linux we have BPF which can do
this analysis without actually storing
stuff to disk on Windows we could
potentially process some of this
information in real time but in practice
most tools will record this to a file
and then analyze the file so this is
slightly less efficient on Windows
actually not slightly this is less
efficient on Windows so what can this
look like I'm just going to skip
straight to the actual screenshots or
even I have this open on my Windows box
so this is what it can look like on
Windows by aggregating all the context
switch events I could get a timeline
view of each of the threads in my
process and see exactly what it was
doing and when so for example here if I
focus on my main thread in my
application I can see on a timeline from
0 to 20 seconds exactly by colors and
times what that thread was doing so
green here is execution
this is synchronization I also have some
leaping going on so I can see exactly
what my thread is doing in terms of
waiting and running and if I click any
of those like I did here I actually get
a stack trace so what the tread was
doing if it was blocked
where was it blocked if it was running
what was it running again this is all
available just by virtue of looking at
the context switch events from running
to waiting and from waiting back to
running but again the underlying data
can be pretty massive because every
context switch would have to be traced
on the Linux side of things on the Linux
side of things we could use BCC tools
based on the BPF kernel technology to
get a flame graph of where my threads in
my applications are actually sleeping
waiting blocking for something without
having to generate a file that has an
event for every single context switch so
basically what I used here is a tool
called off CPU time which is from the
BCC collection and on github and it
generates a recording but the recording
only contains the aggregated results so
I don't have like every single context
situation there I only have the
aggregated record saying this call stack
had 500,000 context switches which took
that much time so I don't aggravate
every single context switch making this
a tool that you could actually run in
production so that's that's for context
switches and the last thing about a
briefly mention is tracing file and disk
and network IO which is very important
and so you might be asking like why am i
leaving this for the last four and a
half minutes of the presentation but the
reason is basically that it's it's more
of the same we have basically seen the
underlying technology for tracing
different kinds of events so here is
just a matter of picking the right
events to trace so in Windows for
example etw can trace file accesses and
disk accesses and network send and
receive events and on linux similar
trace points are available in the kernel
for block IO access for network
access so essentially it's just a matter
of using the same tools etw on linux on
windows perf and BCC on Linux to just
get an aggregation of file accesses and
network accesses and disk accesses and
that sort of thing
just a few screenshots of what's
possible to get your appetite up for
example on the left you see a Linux tool
which gives you a record of which files
are currently the hottest across the
systems like which files am I accessing
the most for region 4 writes kind of
like top but for files for file accesses
on the right you see a similar thing
from Windows when looking at a recording
in Windows performance analyzer you can
see a summary of which files are being
heavily accessed on this particular
system the other difference is Linux is
live Windows is analyzing recording a
recording file that's the only
difference between those tracing file
accesses in real time is also possible
so on the left on Linux you see a tool
which prints out every file access
taking longer than a certain time so
slow file accesses print them please and
on the left there is a Windows
command-line tool which I wrote called
each race which does pretty much the
same thing you can instruct it to look
at etw events and print out events
matching a certain filter so again
there's some screenshots here of what
this whole thing would look like just a
couple of final notes to see here which
might be interesting for you this is
pretty cool if you have mechanical
drives like non SSB this is basically a
summary of where the disk head is on
your drive so again unless SVC is
slightly less interesting but in
mechanical disks it's pretty important
occasionally to optimize and defragment
to drive so that you have adjacent
accesses happening at the same offset on
this roughly so you don't have a lot of
travel of six essentially and this is a
diagram that can show you those this is
a linux screenshot of a tool called open
snoop
which is pretty cool and it's traces
failures to open files so whenever you
have a process that tries to open and
file and fails it would print which file
it was and what the error was so just
again some of the things that are
possible by instrumenting those same
underlying mechanisms perf on Linux and
etw on Windows so hopefully we've seen
this whirlwind tour of Diagnostics and
performance investigations and both
operating systems we looked at crash
dump analysis and how to get core dumps
of crashing processes and both OSS and
how to get basic details like a stack
trace and exception information out of
them we talked about some of the
performance facing tools that can be
used for production with C++
applications we saw how to generate
flame graphs of various things not just
CPU use which is the most typical use
but also for like blocked time for
example or for disk accesses and that
sort of thing
and we looked at memory leak analysis
which is pretty tricky especially in
production but you see there are some
options available for this as well there
are some references in the slides
touching on the different tools we
looked at today there's lots and lots to
learn of course beyond this presentation
and here the slides and all the demos
I've used some of these are actually in
lab format so if you would like to spend
a few hours practicing some of these
tools you can look at those two github
repos which have labs for both Linux and
Windows that you can try in your own
environment and just learn more about
some of those scenarios I use but all of
these are covered all my demos are
covered by these two repositories now we
have 22 seconds for questions which is
going to be a little tricky and also I
have in 20 minutes a talk in another
room so if anyone wants to chat we could
do that during lunch or you could walk
with me there but this is as much as I
can offer because they don't have a talk
in 20 minutes anyway thank you very very
much for coming and I hope you enjoy the
rest of NBC please be in touch thank you
