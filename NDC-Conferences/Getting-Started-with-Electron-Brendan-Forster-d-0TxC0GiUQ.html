hour I would not keep you more than that
hopefully good evening thank you for
coming to this last slot
I appreciate the party is going to be
pretty good let me just get comfortable
with the mic yeah
so as part of being here I was involved
with electron workshop for those people
who were there we did like two days
worth of stuff I'm going to try and
condense that down into like an hour and
just share Holland stuff around my
experiences with electron in the last
year for those you who don't know me my
name is Brendan foster I'm a senior
engineer at github and I've been
involved with client apps for about four
years now
I've been also doing a whole bunch of
open source work both net and now doing
some more stuff with node and I was
previously doing dotnet stuff at github
but now kind of switched over to doing
electron stuff full time and fun stuff
was after about 12 months of work we
announced about a month ago the new
version get up desktop for the longest
time we had a Mac app and a Windows app
which were two separate code bases and
so we sat down and kind of just went
alright what's this thing going to look
like if we kind of went and rewrote an
electron so at the moment it's in beta
and it's also open source it's using
typescript and it's also using react on
top of electron so if you want to see
what a big scale app looks like and of
course have a play around with it
desktop they'll get up the comm pull it
down and yeah give us your feedback so I
want to do this talk in three parts
the first is kind of talk more about
electron around the features that it's
got and the sort of things that it's
great for I'm going to do some live
coding of JavaScript show you how to get
started with an electron app yes we're
going to be doing JavaScript so anything
could happen and lastly I wanna share
some thoughts on my experiences doing
typescript Oh blast not touch doing
electron development over the last 12
months and I know MVC crowds and
notorious for being very quiet but I
want you guys to shout Quinn's at me as
they come up
we've only one hour I've got a lot of
feelings on stuff so yeah feel free to
jump out grab my attention and I'll make
sure we kept refer the recording and
yeah let's have some fun so the great
resource that I recommend everyone going
to when starting on electron is this
website here notes the mint
of atom so electron itself was spun off
from the at Meriter they get up launched
over two years ago now we open source a
whole bunch of stuff and people were
interested in this thing called atom
shell which was the rendering engine for
the atom editor that got then spun off
into its own team which we renamed
electron and if you go look at the
electron site there's a whole bunch of
resources we scroll down past the header
you see this little section here
zooming in this I think is the simple
summary of what electron is made up of
we the electron team put together node
in chromium and turn that into
essentially avantime for you to build
your apps with they seem to note here is
that I mentioned chrome but it's
actually using chromium which is the
open source rendering engine and stuff
that Chrome users v8 is also there
that's a JavaScript runtime and that's
used by both node and chromium for their
stuff and so the electron team has to do
some cross compilation to make sure that
they're using the same version anyway
high level details go down a bit deeper
what does electron give you versus all
the other tools out there for doing
cross-platform development first thing
I'll call that is it open source all the
bits rendering engine chrome and all the
frameworks that are built out our open
source so you can go hack on it you can
build your own version of electron run
that in your apps it's all there
I did mention chrome that if you're sick
of doing cross browser development
electron itself is only running Chrome
browser it doesn't worry about native
tool kits like WPF cocoa all these
things there we only focus on Chrome so
that makes everyone's lives a lot easier
there are some little cross-platform
things that come up from time to time
but ultimately if you know crime you'll
probably love electron so alongside the
chrome and node runtimes there's a whole
bunch of api's electron ships with which
are there to integrate your app with the
host operating system so if you're doing
desktop apps you need access to the
operating system resources you can write
some C++ plug that in to your electro an
app and and go with that
but the real cool thing about electron
is that it's amazing community of
projects that have been spun up filling
in gaps on top of the electron core the
electron team themselves are fairly
agnostic around how you want to build
out your apps they're only focused on
really the runtime but then all these
people have jumped up to filling gaps
and share stuff that they've taken
further another resource that I'll point
out is awesome electron just a markdown
list file of all isn't in projects if
you see something up there that's
interesting is probably in that list but
of course on top of the awesome electron
list you can use any sort of node
package that's up there for things that
are native I'll talk about towards the
end but ultimately you can use pure
JavaScript code or if you have node
modules that do native operations you
can use that stuff in electron as well
excuse me
so enough talking let's do some code and
I'll say a little prayer because a lot
of stuff is running NPM and NPM
generally likes network access so
hopefully we can get some stuff going
mmm-hmm smearing my screen that looks
good in theory was the rest of my OS
gone yep
all right we're good I think we're good
cool I'm sure that is nag oh sorry I'm
going to tweak my font size because
clearly that is terrible
hell yeah let's do that so I'm just
going to make a directory like a type
will not live into the JavaScript making
mistakes in do you cool
so at the core of your electron out is
going to be a package.json file if
you've ever done no development you'd be
familiar with the stuff but there's very
sorts of things that an electron out
will look for inside your package JSON
for example I'm just going to pull in
electron as an NPM package this is where
we hope the network of favor us so
things that so I've just made it a def
package here because it's not
technically needed at run time I'll
explain some more of that stuff later
call room business
I'll go code don't so in here I have my
lovely empty file main dot the next u.s.
file which is the main entry points
electron will use this unless you
specify something otherwise to determine
what to launch I can come in here and
create a index dr. hairstyle I can do
this
that you might package.json far I'm just
going to create a shorthand script for
start and what we'll do here is we will
do electron dot this works we have my my
electron package and inside my electron
package I have little command mind to be
able to invoke electron and I'm just
saying here in the current directory
let's run this up and I want my cursor
back like that ship saved
that's good there we go that's why mr.
so npm start no help spike go back to
the right directory smooth and now try
again cool so that did absolutely
nothing aside from print out hello world
this is not an electron app just yet so
you may annex Jess file I'm going to
pull in a module
so if you're familiar with node and the
event emitter interface lots of electron
objects will implement that interface
and so what you do is you'll subscribe
to event - then do stuff to launch app
your app this event here is when
electron is pretty loaded enough
resources for then you to be able to go
off and actually do something useful the
other class we're going to pull in is
browser window this is how you then
display UI to users and you will run
some code over there and so now I'm just
going to go and initialize this so
browser window takes some options I'm
just going to be simple here 500 with
500 that looks like enough
so most of what you do with an electron
app is launched up some content in this
case here I'm just going to pull in a
local file which will be a HTML file
that then becomes the crime that the
user sees switching this up actually
I'll do some proper JavaScript here
let's have one fun thing to note when
you're doing cross-platform apps is that
part separators will be different you
know it was part that I'm just doing
this to be more correct index dot HTML
but ultimately what we should be doing
here is poor passing in file that row
and pulling in path module comes
it was rewire that looks readable except
I don't have an index.html file type
HTML just you know
re
cool that looks like enough content for
now do understand this up yes sir sale
what'd I miss electron a thank you
you're almost safe make almost like me
yeah oh you've gone oh all right so what
I've done let's let's show ed his
curiosity and then I'll explain what's
going on here log your L yeah
cool I broke my donut ones like that
no no that does not make sense
Thank You JavaScript for messing with me
alright so in theory this should just be
so ed was asking if the paths are going
to be correct for my file URL maybe
they're not because I'm not going to
window anymore after name index dot HTML
the fire protocol there which is URL I
have after this up nicely
is that can work for Windows tops
alright I'm just going to follow heads
advice and just throw the stuff in let's
not be too clever let's do that yes
excellent spot ed you get a beer after
the show I reckon you are alright so
that looks pretty reasonable what did I
do
found the first step ah let's see if we
can it did work for a brief moment
I'm sure actually I want to I prepared
earlier for you can completely mess this
up it's fine it's fine
Wow I did mess this up all right
Thank You backup guards all right
so jazz hands here's one that I believe
works across everything so the for
example we will come back to that staff
doo doo save that all right I'll dig
into that one later so what did I do
I have my index.html file which has a
bit more information in there I will
explain that stuff in a second so some
simple Dom that comes up what I've done
here is yep just displayed a page where
we get into some better stuff is if we
want to do some additional scripting and
so one of the big things that I'll
mention now from electrons is that you
will have to context where your app is
running my index file here is running in
the main process and whenever I want to
go off and launch a URL and show some
content that's going to be in what we
call the renderer so these two things
are very much separate processes and
history of this comes from chrome itself
because it's got browsers which run
their own separate tabs in their own
processes this means that the browser
tab when it crashes it cannot bring down
the whole process that sort of
architecture has come over into electron
and it's just something to keep in mind
in general when you are going forward
for most of your stuff that's UI you'll
be in the renderer but for most of the
things that need to touch the operating
system you'll do that stuff in the main
thread and you'll use IPC to communicate
back and forth we won't get into that
but there's some lovely examples I can
point you to afterwards so the teaser
fifth and next step here is I have a
button set up and I have a renderer
script so this is going to be some extra
code that I run in the renderer process
I write that stuff up as well awesome
simple example run some script we do
hello world
now to give you an idea that this is
more than just a browser tab I'm going
to open up the dev tools put a
breakpoint here cuz I don't you need a
breakpoint I'll be here
so this so processed version is no
specific API but in my renderer process
in electron I can see a whole bunch of
stuff that indicates what has been built
into this version of electron I'm on 1 6
11 I can see the version of the 8 bits
there these are the enhancements that
the electron thing exposes to you when
you are running in your app the other
note here so if I do process dot you'll
see a whole bunch mentioned resources in
here RC I agree they're pure node CWD
whether the regular running process
memory info these things that you hook
into the OS those things are available
when you're running inside your electron
out so keep things moving and hopefully
not piss off the demo God anymore I'm
going to do a little example here so a
little bit of integration when your app
is running up we're going to put
something in the system tray and so you
can then interact with that I've already
jumped ahead to then having the menu and
tray namespaces pull in not known TASIS
module excuse me
menu coolers look from template come
back to that just sketching out the
pseudocode now
come to menu
so there's very sorts of icon support
based on the operation submit you're
running on if you're doing Windows ICO
files are generally great for doing
anything icon related if you're on Mac
OS icns files of what you should use but
to be consistent and keep them simple
I'm just going use a PNG so this will
work nicely on both platforms the real
benefit of using I Cole I seen s files
is that they have dpi difference or dpi
is baked into it and so on high DPI
scenarios the icon appears nice we'd be
great back down on the regular platforms
to things that still look good so the
interesting thing about these menus is
that they're especially immutable and so
I build something up from the template I
pass it through to the tray API and then
they get set by the operating system
I don't need to care about the platform
details I just say like this is the
abstraction I work with
this looks pretty reasonable anyone's
going to jump up before I explain this
no cool
there's my icon eye contact click
there's my details if I click on first
there's my click so the idea is that
these API is a very JavaScript friendly
and they hide away all the platform
details I will however warn you by going
to the electron website but there's lots
of platform specific things that come up
so the example I will use is browser
window come here browser window that's a
simple example that we've done before
frameless windows are there radio show
events for optimizing stuff but as we
scroll further down there's all these
options it's it's a lot and so there's
lots of notes in here around how things
work on Mac versus how things work on
Linux and versus how things work on
windows if you kind of want to get stuff
working well on the platform it's worth
knowing or with little details the thing
to look for in particular is this sort
of event so an event here that only gets
raised for certain OS that gets called
out in the docs
so my hello world when it worked was
kind of basic I will point out an
example app that the electron team
publish out it's an electron app and it
has a whole bunch of samples inbuilt and
you can come through and run things up
they're nice because they give you the
into an example of it running in an app
and then you can see the sample code
itself a little example here keyboard
shortcuts lots of apps themselves
whether they're doing the menu or
something else need to keyboard
shortcuts control of okay
I said control okay and you can run that
stuff up yourself great for kind of
navigating more stuff that's saved
without having to write the code and
experiment with what's what's well the
other thing I will point out while we're
here is a repo in the electron org
called simple samples these are a little
bit more bigger than the whole world
that I just did they are nice because
they're a little bit more realistic they
pull in JavaScript a point CSS they do
something a bit more useful I'll show
you one of the demos now
make sure everything's up to date cool
so this little example goes off to pull
down data from the API and display it in
a page very simple kind of easy enough
to understand but then you can start
playing around with it and doing things
beyond what you might expect
another thing that I'll point out is
there's a whole bunch of known electron
apps listed on the electron site lots of
these things are open-source and so you
can then pull these down play around
with the code themselves see how people
are building out real electron apps if I
come in here and do a bit more shameless
self-promotion where's it stood on there
click I'll go to the site download it
like yeah all that stuff there and yeah
lots of people are sharing the stuff as
they build it out the one project I will
mention that we don't use for the
desktop team but I thought I've fallen
in love with is electron forge like
before where I was doing all the
scaffolding for setting things up
electron Forge is there to take that
pain away it's also there to take pain
way around packaging and actually
pulling in real frameworks the examples
templates up here you can kind of just
sketch out up a quick site with all the
tooling that you need in just a couple
of commands that's how easy it is so
electron
while we wait to see that word just cook
which at the era yep that's what so I do
the electron Forge actually let's go out
of Papa directory for in it
so this is nice because it takes care of
putting together all the stuff you
generally need to remember to do
yourself making sure to get repository
setting up the package config pulling in
the modules I'll just show you once this
is done we can between yeah we do
any questions while we wait for NPM to
compile yes Ari L will get that so our
real question was about debugging and if
you've used the chrome dev tools they're
actually baked into your electron app
and they're also baked in there as you
distribute the app so you can then have
a user open up the dev tools poke around
that stuff grab a timeline file
excellent growing business yes debugging
is a lovely story it's not quite vs in
terms of advanced but it's something
that I find totally adequate has offer
an endorsement all right so over here
we've got a couple of metadata files I'm
sure to show you the package file first
so electron force has replaced the
scripts that I have defined for like
electron dot with its own scripts so
this is it taking care of the basics of
getting things set up making things work
and there's three sort of things that
it's doing really well the start which
is the dev experience the packaging
making sure that all the bits are in
place and then the make step which is
generating installer for the current
platform that I'm on
we've got yes lint the compiler I see
stuff that's so it's using babel for
doing some translation stuff behind the
scenes again you can kind of polka this
stuff but it's the default are pretty
good
so it will start like that it checks
everything is setup it goes off for
launches it and that's the similar
experience to what I had before
and there's my chrome dev tools I've
showed some tricks after this but for
now yep they're there that's what I use
for the debugging side things that will
take a little bit longer I'm just going
to do in ten make I get that wrong
look I do too so NPM quirks are that
start and test are reserved scripts I
need to the NPM run make to do what
explicitly little grievance button yep
so while this takes a while I will
switch over to another tab and show you
guys how touch script support works
and they're like Tron - for just in it
coming back to the links here there's a
way that I can specify the template to
run so if you're not react fan there's
also angular - there's view there's J
templating whole bunch of stuff to kind
of get you started with those popular
frameworks do that again no dashes thank
you cool so that's going there I'll
switch over to my other tab we're still
going there little things about
platforms that electron supports windows
32-bit 64-bit mac OS only 64-bit Linux
it requires GK dependencies to run but
for the most part those are
self-contained is also some arm support
as well but I've not really looked into
that I don't think it's officially
supported yet but generally we're places
where chrome and chromium can run it's
potentially possible for electron to run
cool so this went often generated and
installer for me I'll just pop over the
file options when I want Brendan so in
here these are the source artifacts that
happen that when I want to do a package
for an app so in theory here I can come
and run the exe and it'll work out the
resources that it needs to launch my app
this isn't very user friendly and so
there's another step which is the make
step and so inside the make output
screwed up windows is an installer
framework for doing apps that don't
require like elevation and don't require
installation in the Program Files the
whole sort of like clicking install
experience that's what it's about if you
have them familiar with click once as a
framework this is an open-source version
very much inspired by that so in here
there's three files for updating
purposes there's a new package and
ultimately the exeed is just doing a
wrapping of that and if I wanted to kind
of double click that to install it
that's that's how you would get the same
store in your machine the customizations
for all this
hiding in the package JSON file
you can see here I can target Windows
Mac and Linux if I wanted to I can go
and look at these related projects to
then understand the full set of
configuration flags that are available
at the time coming back over to the
typescript project
summers what we had before we've got our
package.json far but we've also got
typescript config and typescript linting
support baked in if I go into my source
file it's a bit more advanced
there's my index dot TS file if I look
at these details it looks rather similar
to how it's doing
it's my create window code there's the
index we're installing the react dev
tools is also available like all these
things to kind of get you going up a
running quicker these templates are
great for that and then I've got my
index.html page we're doing some tsx
compilation to then load in your react
component this stuff is just it's
glorious for for demos run it up
so the other nice thing that example
includes you might have noticed it
before is the hot module reloading
switch back to the tab it's updated all
the stuff is just there to make
developers happy and get stuff going and
build out your electron apps quicker so
I do have a bit of times I'm going to
run the setup.exe a little bit
there's my little sample app this
loading splash screen is from squirrel
doing some setup behind the scenes
registering your program so that it can
be uninstalled safely moving files
around on disk to get everything up and
running all the stuffs taken care of it
should just be as easy to get get going
as possible
there's my app if I go into Windows then
come down here what I call it I call it
any project no that wasn't it there we
go some force project so the icons there
are the electron default ones I could
change those in theory later on we often
believe it plugs into the OS in the same
way that users would expect other apps
to do I go and uninstall the senior that
I'll explain is that as part of an
installation squirrel gives you an
opportunity to run stuff in your app I
didn't actually use that hook at all I
should have shown a UI but that's just a
side effect of the Segway so that's been
uninstalled that's all gone that's how
these things apps should be and you
don't have to worry about knowing all
the ins and outs of installers
to
switching back to my slides
cool so to run through what's happening
so we just did the first electron app
which is the QuickStart example was
available on the site if you want to
pull that down yourself the electron API
demos are a bit nicer and fully fleshed
out they'll give you more idea of like
the end to end usage of ap is the simple
samples repo for seeing a little bit
more interactivity the apps website
under the main electron site showing the
list of projects to explore electron
forge is a mouthful way for improving
your scaffolding and getting things up
and running quicker and I'll mention
these 3-pack packages in particular
electron packager which is there for
getting things ready for a point where
you can run them run them up without
depending on having node or electron
installed locally electron wind Staller
I liked because it generates these screw
packages and the MSI's okay we want to
do machine wide installs electron
builder also supports a whole range of
installation formats for Mac Windows and
Linux
so some thoughts about how my experience
has been doing electron stuff over the
last four months the team bio was on
before well the team I was on that came
over to be the electron team we're a
mixture of mac and windows devs and we
had a whole bunch of feelings around the
UI side with our previous apps we were
focused on them being native and like
fitting in well with the OS whereas now
we're at this point where we had this
common sort of like electron UI we were
trying to work out with how far we go
with trying to be native we end up going
with a different approach that companies
like slack and BS code have gone with
and it's like making the UI consistent
across all the platforms which make
things a lot simpler because we weren't
writing UI twice but for people who are
very much familiar with the native
paradigms Mac OS devs very much in this
bucket they kind of think they've not
taken to it as well as like the Windows
users have for our side if we just want
to make things easier so to give you an
example of stuff here's the mac app UI
as it is and here's the Windows one not
very much is different you could
probably find some things in scroll bars
and things like that but I'll call out
the menu at the top
so on the backside the the menu is not
actually plugged into the window frame
it's it's at the top of the the window
with the OS shown on the window size we
weren't happy with the default menu so
we went off and built our own you can
see it up at the top there that's all
HTML CSS and JavaScript the goal here
was that we wanted to fit in better than
what the default menu does but to boot
from the electron to see what that is
have a look at the s code on Windows you
see the menu there it's gray it doesn't
quite fit in with the rest of the theme
we want you to do something different we
wanted it to kind of feel a bit more
integrated with the rest of us the other
thing I'll point out here coming back no
I don't have that that's later on do goo
goo goo goo which leads into a lovely
ramble about OS conventions so Mac and
Windows are very much different
operating systems they have a rich
history of doing things differently and
as you're doing at your electron apps
you should be mindful of this stuff from
the April UI side example Mac OS has
very sorts of expectations around the
top menu it expects the first item to be
the apps name it has certain naming
conventions for menu items it also does
capital case every item every word in a
menu item should be uppercase not
against and schuster with a capital
letter the window side has its own force
file becomes the first item menu item
names are a bit more relaxed menu item
names are Center cased as well the very
first character is uppercase everything
else generally says lowercase unless
like for proper nouns and things like
that these things matter because users
notice them and users they'll stand out
so ensure that you are familiar with the
stuff that you are deploying to and
making sure that the stuff fits in
because yes users will raise bugs
probably my favorite bug that came up
when we were testing this internally was
from a Mac user there was a concept
called destructive windows I'm sorry
destructive dialogues and these are
supposed to behave differently unlike on
Windows where the primary menu button
there should be emphasized they wanted
the other one to be emphasized so that
by default you would like not go and
make destructive changes so we need to
handle with stuff at runtime
for certain menu items that we knew that
was destructive again this was raised by
Mac user we could have probably gotten
out the door without it happening but
these things are noticeable and eat and
people do care about the stuff so the
debugging side that someone talked about
earlier if you're familiar with chrome
dev tools that stuff is baked in there
with electron if you do any sort of
translation stuff to j/s plug in your
source maps because you can get a really
nice experience in there and this is
just a screenshot of ejs debugging get
up desktop what was fun about this was
yeah I'm looking at the typescript
source code because when we went and
built the app for production we shipped
the source Maps you can then easily kind
of poke at the stuff that's there the
items on the right are a bit well
they're not quite mapping to their
original variable names but that's fine
we can mostly figure that stuff out but
this makes stuff a whole bunch easier to
navigate we also then use the source map
stack trace when we send errors back to
map things back to the source getting
this thing set up right a huge
time-saver and the other thing that I've
been playing around with lately is the
timeline experience so there's a 24
millisecond sort of like frame wait for
browsers which maps to about 60 frames a
second and when you're running up the
app you can record timeline data things
like CPU usage stack traces at any point
of time what your app is doing to see
when you're not as responsive as
possible because browsers are single
threaded you should be mindful of the
staff users notice when things don't
work getting this raw performance data
out it's all there in the chrome dev
tools and as I've ever said earlier with
the things about the menu when your
application is running inside electron
you have access to the whole operating
system think about what your stuff what
stuff out there that you do that could
be plugged in to the OS of the examples
I've got run down here if you're doing
things with documents you could then
show them recent documents list Mac OS
has a spot windows has a spot these
things make it easier for users to jump
back into your app with a recent file if
your app is doing some stuff in the
background and you need to show some UI
drop some stuff into the system tray if
you're doing things
heavy load have a look at the power
monitor usages electron provides an API
for that and if you are on battery maybe
kind of ease back on the work so that
users don't necessarily you're not
necessarily doing the users battery and
there's also things that chrome wary
supports like access to microphone
access to the video those things are
there as well
electron doesn't need to do anything
specific but again like building on top
of that stuff we get to the native
modules so if electron doesn't give you
an API for something and there's a node
module for doing something pull that
stuff in we've done some stuff with
integrating with credentials there's a
package for that it works on Mac Windows
and Linux you pull that stuff in it
builds for the right platform yeah that
stuff was saved just having to write it
three times for the stuff that we needed
we've had to write some silly plus plus
to contribute back to electron but on
the whole it's probably something out
there already as an NPM package for what
you need
random anecdotes someone a couple weeks
ago and the electrons slack was asking
if there was a package for turning off
your computer this seemed like a silly
idea but I go to NPM and I type power
off there is a package for this like yep
there was a bill talk from one of the
guys from slack and a guy from Microsoft
around how they deal with integrating
stuff using the windows API s so they
wonder did great with Windows runtime
which provides a whole bunch of
abstractions they then turn those into
no packages which are literally just
script api's which you can then pull
into your app lovely talk which gives
you an idea of like all the details that
come up but I would definitely recommend
having look at them
some kind of running out of stuff to
talk about at this point there are any
questions people have or demos that I
could do while we're here yeah excellent
question
so the question was about how you do
updates for electric electron so I
mentioned squirrel dot Windows there is
a sister project for Mac which is called
screwed up Mac creatively named so
inside I'm over here engineering sorry
so the reason why I choose those
projects is because electron itself has
first-class support for updating those
so I go into the docs there's this thing
called auto up data module for interface
for the screw or framework so as part of
doing the package releases if you don't
host them up to a server that does HTTP
if you're using squirrel and scroll or
Mac and screwed up Windows you can then
point your electron app at that server
give it the details that are needs for
like you know the platform to run an
example of this is nuts which is only
backed by key dub releases so host ins
little thing in a Roku it can then go
off to my private get up repo to
download the updates that it needs and
the API for this is very sort of webbing
you know you could say like you know I
want to download these version I want to
download this beta Channel stuff all
that stuff is baked into the API and
then you just use the squirrel domak and
screw it on Windows assets to the end of
the downloads so yeah I would definitely
recommend using the school of stuff
because again it's it's low friction it
takes the stuff away it knows how to
apply the updates successfully yeah and
ultimately you just listen to events on
this component and when you get an
update ready you then ask the user to
quit and then install the effects like
that's that's what I would you
oh yeah
what so the question was what sort of
apps would not be suitable yeah yes okay
so so paraphrasing Christian the thing
that you would think about when
evaluating electron is if you have a
significant investment in the UI so
Photoshop was example that you talked
about there they have a very complex UI
that's very much designed to for that
specific audience but if your UI is a
bit more simple and then works can be
worked in different ways yeah I wouldn't
rule that out
the thing that start garrison
yep
so paraphrasing Christian he has been
surprised about the stuff that he is
found CAD is like another whole field
that people are spewing stuff out of I
like traps wait yeah if you need access
to well you can do things Ivan HTTP you
can do things by accessing the file
system you can do things by accessing
drivers like all that stuff is possible
with electron and so the set of
applications that you can't or shouldn't
do is it's very limited let's put it
that way yes WebGL support in Chrome
means that you can do graphics based
programs in electron as well
so this is where the model messes up so
the question was about multi-threading
and how you do things with the main
thread and that paradigm doesn't really
work with electron because on one part
your UI stuff is running in the renderer
process that's going to be a single
threaded environment because JavaScript
you don't really have the ability to do
multiple threads fairly easily but you
do have ways to spawn off a hidden
window so the example that I'll come
back to here
there was a little note here after view
there we go
so this is what I would look at if you
wanted to do sort of a multi-tiered
stuff I thought there was a trick with
like hidden window in browser window but
I'll come back to that yeah
I guess you guys are all ready for the
party all right
so wrapping things up that's the site
that I recommend going to whole bunch of
resources the API Doc's are really
detailed yep I'll hang around a bit some
small questions there's some notes up
there which should cover off all the
resources from today yeah hopefully you
guys have some fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
