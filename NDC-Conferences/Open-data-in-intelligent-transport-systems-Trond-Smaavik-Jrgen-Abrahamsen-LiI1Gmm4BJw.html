ready for his last session my name is
Jana Bronson and I am trans Molly and
we're here today to talk about open data
and intelligent transport systems this
is a topic Quinn been working on for a
couple of a couple of years and we are
really looking forward to sharing some
experiences with you we work in a
company called a condo which I we're
looking into online but we also have a
department here now slow and we focus a
bit on these subjects so let's take a
look at today's agenda yeah so we're
going to take a look at open data and
explain a little bit about what it is
and in the context of Norway mm-hmm then
we're going to look at intelligent
transport systems and use that as our
domain here today and see an what's with
the status today and what's the
development and then we're going to take
a closer look at the different data sets
again in context of Norway and of course
we want you to start working with the
open data and we're going to show you
how to get started with a couple of data
sets yeah and lovely i would like to
show you our project from leave us now
or the national public roads
administration that has been published
as a beta earlier this year okay so
start let's start with some vague
definitions because the point here isn't
to be legally correct but to set some
terms in place open data is data that
has been made available by the right
shoulder under an open license so that
it's free for anyone to use public data
is another term nets
been used some time and in the same
context because data from the government
and the municipalities is quite it's
quite common and to share and it's also
the case that a lot of this data is in
practice already financed by the public
and therefore should be publicly
available these a lot of this data is
collected as part of their the daily
work and not intentionally collected for
sharing the perp but it has many many
potential uses in Norway it's also the
case that there's law that tells us that
we have the right to see what data the
government test and it also gives us
access to this data and exports of it of
course there are some exceptions could
be a sensitive personal later such as
health information and it could be
confidential information as such as
business secrets or classified
information due to national security or
the cubed data that is controlled by or
used by one organization but it's owned
by someone else so they don't have
rights to share it so why do we even
bother with open data and what's in it
for me the perspective here is I'm going
to take is from two different sites it's
both as the data owner and as a data
consumer and you might ask yourself why
do people come to conference to speak
and I guess there's many reasons but one
of them is that sharing knowledge makes
us all better and the same applies to to
open data and even if you share data
because you really like concept in the
idea of openness or because you have to
because law tells you the effects are
immortal is the same
we've seen that sharing data increases
innovation both within the organization
that church the data and outside because
it makes people think differently within
the organization people see that
collaborating is a good thing and there
may be datasets that one department has
never known existed before but they can
make really good use of and you also end
up with better data quality because when
you share data with others people would
find errors and is the if there's one
thing people like its commenting on
others errors so you're pretty sure that
you go get feedback from the users and
in many cases this is data that you rely
on in your daily business so it's good
to get that kind of feedback it also is
good for your reputation as an
organization because people like when
people share as a day to consumer you
could just do too fun just be real
weekend and dig down in all the data
there is and there's a lot of
fascinating data as we'll see later on
in this talk another point is as the
aspect of transparency and and democracy
because we don't like people who lie or
people with power that misuse it so when
municipalities share data about how much
money they're spent on schools in your
area or how much money they give to
different organizations whether it's
sports clubs or yeah whatever it is it's
it's creating an open and addressed
trustful atmosphere and of course it's
good for new business one of the first
project that I was on when I was
finished at the University was being
part of small team creating plugging a
search plugin for oil and gas
application and there we added dataset
from the norwegian petroleum directorate
as a data source and it had a great
value both to the users of the
application and of course to the client
selling it so there's there's many good
business opportunities in using open
data and i hope you you find find the
good sources to look at um openness is
only the first step because once the
dataset is online i'll put it under an
open license there's only so much you
can do if you completely make good use
of it tim berners-lee the guy who
invented World Wide Web has been working
on open data for some time off lat and
he's made a classification of quality of
open data the first one I already
mentioned the second one is about
publishing data in machine-readable
format and that means instead of
publishing a table with data within a
PDF you should use a spreadsheet for
instance from excel on the other hand if
you choose Excel then someone would have
to have a special time software a
spreadsheet program or profitably Excel
maybe to read that so if you instead of
Excel choose to publish comma separated
values then you're at level three
because you have a non-proprietary
format that doesn't require you to have
special software or pay special face so
we see that the first three levels are
quite easy to achieve when we've
delivered for it's starting to get more
interesting too because now we start
adding semantics to the data and
semantics is about meaning the meaning
of data and that's really really
powerful because what you do with a
number of eleven digits if you don't
know what it is
if you happen to know that this data
this 11 digits is a social security
number you could use this at the key to
look up other datasets and find more
information that you could link so
semantics is about relating data to
real-world objects if you really want to
place the the founder of the internet
you should always also linked data
linking data means that you have say I
have a data set about a book I know that
book has a title it's got 350 pages and
there's an author so instead of just
typing in the name of the author and a
link to another date set about the
author because i know that some other
guy has created that say it's William
Shakespeare or whoever so by doing that
we end up with the graph of data that
can be navigated based on such relations
and to do this we use technology called
RDF rdf is short for resource
description framework and it's a method
of relating data objects to each other
so this is maybe like Facebook of
everything not just people and an
organization's but everything can be
related from let's say like take Bob
Harry please the subject and he is
interested in an object the Mona Lisa so
all statements are built up in this way
a subject with a relation called the
predicate and and an object such
predicates are statements that can be
true and in this case Bob is interested
in the Mona Lisa we can also see that
Bob as a friend of Alice which is not
the statement so this is sort of Bob's
world and
and this is an an image of the real
world and then let's poke about that
there's more to it so let's take a look
at the model world we see that the
subject objects are the same and if you
have particularly bright eyes you'll see
that the object has also gotten and and
identifiers written in small letters
below them so every object or subject
gets a URI that identifies them it's not
as not necessarily a URL as a link to a
webpage but it's a URI as an identifier
it identifies Bob this is Bob he is
identified by HTTP colon slash slash
example dot org Bob hashmi and you see
that the links i also changed a bit and
if we would take a look at the right
side first and the green and we see we
have DC terms creator and easy terms
title and the see terms subject these
two terms is short for Dublin Court
terms which is a vocabulary that our
engines from the library world so we use
use this properties to describe things
that we normally would find in library
well oops movies documents and would
describe the objects by using them we
see that on the blue side we have for
instance both topic interest or Foe nose
focused short for a friend of a friend
and if you is another vocabulary that's
used for showing relationships between
people and how they interact and the
strength and rdf really lies and reuse
of such vocabularies so that when i have
one graph that is described by using and
terms from Dublin core like creator in
title I can I can know that this title
is means title in the same way that it
does in another graph and and knows
means that Bob knows Alice in the same
way that Leonardo the wind she knows
another guy and there's also a way to
navigate such graphs and a machine
oriented way there's a query language
called Sparkle they can use so for
instance I could look up other objects
created by the creator of Mona Lisa
because Bob might be interested in that
too so this is way too to really expand
into de linked open data and this is the
way the world is moving slowly all right
so let's take a look at site es which is
today's domain intelligent transport
systems is about making transport safer
more efficient and cleaner by using new
technology and IT many of the solutions
we see here have been around for at
least 20 years and i'm pretty sure that
many of you would be able to come up at
least with 10 different solutions that's
within the IPS domain but maybe even
listen to haven't necessarily thought
about it as a separate domain but this
is this is a domaining growth there
different way of categorizing ites
solutions and we could start by looking
at at the one in the middle that local
you might recognize the auto parts logo
this is a typical typical back-end
system that helps with a sort of
administrative part of
i TS instead of having people sitting in
and told us you have these until
stations where you can just drive
through and you read the chip in the car
or you do digital image analysis of the
number plates that could be one idea
solution a lot of the solution that
doesn't exist yet and is the one that we
have on the right side this is from a
research project between volvo cars and
the National roadless administration in
your way and where they trying to use
sensors in the cars to predicts or to
warn other other cars around if it's
slippery on the roads you have a lot of
sensors for instance for abs brakes you
have an to spin control and things like
that and when these sensors in the car
reaches certain special threshold you
can warn other cars that's saying that a
kilometer had there's Ison road so you
better be careful you can also send a
message to the road maintain errs so
that they can come with the truck and
remove the ice and snow making the road
safe again on the left hand side we have
a guy standing in front of a bus and
that's an autonomous bus and a guy in
front is our sales manager for IDs oh
love and he's working on deploying such
autonomous buses in the city of
Kongsberg here in Norway and which
happens to be the city with the highest
density of Engineers so there's no
coincidence he's there I guess we've
also seen a lot of other companies
working on autonomous cars lately at
least well actually every car company is
working on at that moment so a lot of
exciting things going on there too the
last logo i have here is as a
consumer-oriented i TS service it's an
app called ways let's say that you're
ganna I are driving in separate cars to
the same this nice
and we want to click the quickest route
instead of just sending us in the same
direction ways might send us and on
different routes because ways recognizes
that if everyone goes the same routes
will all get stuck in traffic so it's
it's using different routes to sort of
load balance road network all right I
think that's a good introduction to both
open data and and I TS so let's get
started looking at some examples yeah
great introduction there at home so I
think we should look at some specific
examples so there's a lot of Norwegian
open i TS data available the major
player there is NPR a or leave us on but
there's also a lot of others other
organizations that publish their data
openly so we thought we should take a
look we've picked out three sources that
we think is giving a great value to to
the end user using either as a developer
or then user viewing it or using it they
are in increasing we're going to present
them in increasing difficulty order so
we're starting with an easy one and then
we are going to increase the difficulty
by how to get in get started with them I
would like to apologize for the
selection they are Norwegian and most of
them are unfortunately only documented
in Norwegian so if any of the developers
or maintainer of these projects are
watching this video or live here right
now I would urge you to add some English
documentation
so yeah so let's start with the easiest
one yeah let's take a look at avenue
flight flight information I've noticed
Norwegian an organization that runs most
of their most of the airports and flood
control and that's it's a quite simple
service and too easy to get started with
with the flight information from this
service you can get every flight on the
Avenue guro controlled airports and
under the flight control with an airline
code and the flight number it's a
schedule time and whether it's a
domestic or international flight if it
is our arrival or departure tour from
what airport and these are the mandatory
fields you might also get feels like a
via airport if it's several stops and
departure gates or baggage belts it's an
arrival and the status code and time
status codes can be this flight has been
delayed or it's been cancelled and yeah
or it's gotten a new time they also
provide us with some code lists there's
airport core codes names there's a line
code code names unfortunately these are
available only Norwegian so if I'm
interested in the airport at capital of
Denmark Copenhagen um when asked for the
code lists all the codes list for the
name I'll get shipping Hoffman which is
the Norwegian and Danish the name of it
but the status codes and texts are
available in both Norwegian and English
yeah let's let's see where more
technicals look at it also yeah so here
you have the documentation page it's as
I mentioned this one is also in
Norwegian
and the documentation is in Norwegian
the API is implemented with using
English language but as John said if you
are going to look at the code list for
four airports you will get the Norwegian
display name like Jabba now yeah it's
this is an easy ipi to get started with
i would suggest if you haven't played
around with any ABI before this is the
excellent starting point if you ever
been out flying as i presume everyone
here has you've seen that the info
boards at the airport where you have
five times gates yeah everything and
that's basically powered by this IP I so
here are the endpoints the three bottom
end points are the code lists and top
one is the one for querying the API so I
was going to show you some API calls I
used postman API client here you will
get it for from Chrome or Chrome App
Store or I think it's ported to Firefox
and it's also standalone app for mac so
i have it on separate screen so i'll try
to
show you so here's that you can see this
I'm sure it can be but yeah it's pretty
small but i'll try to execute this and
you see that you get the code list for
airlines if i went to a for example
query for a specific airline i need to
look up if from the flag data which will
just show you the code i need to specify
our airline and then for example as k
which is such are Scandinavian the
airline it's important to remember that
this service is case sensitive so if i
type r sk with lowercase letter i
wouldn't get any answer as you'll see
here now yeah so I'm retrieving the
important or more interesting
information is done by doing the query
to the xml feed here you'll see here you
can use several parameters to filter
your query so here i have prefilled
query with that time I think it's time
from yet time from which means that i
want to have flights for one hour back
from now and two hours forward in time
i'm interested in flights for oslo i'm
interested in the arrivals and I want
every flight updated after some date
here so I'll just go ahead and execute
that and here you see all the flake
flight data it's xml-based and you can't
get it in Jason it's only in XML but
here you see all the flights each flight
has a unique ID
you have the flight ID also domestic or
international funny thing here that is
the S with which isn't documented in the
code list but it's shangem so it's a
special special case case there and then
we have a scheduled time and the
definition of if its arrival or
departure i filtered for arrivals so
it's arrivals and it's going to the
coffee digging it came from Gothenburg
let's check let's check that yeah so
then we have to go to co-list for
airports I need to add a primer
parameter airport was it got gotgot GRT
yes correct ten points big about data
this is we're talking about okay so yeah
um I think I skipped this list here
Caroline no I overwritten it here so
yeah
let's get back to this list yeah so here
you see since I last queried I now have
new information on the top and so this
is this store this information is always
updated specially on also garden which
is a pretty busy airfield yeah and the
last thing I wanted to show you was down
here you have a status which is updated
if anything happens here the status code
a means right yeah so it's update time
for confirming when the plane i right it
might be before scheduling time after
scheduled time and so forth um so I
challenge for you if you want to play
around with this is actually collecting
data for let's say garden wall for a
month and then calculate the timeliness
for each Li that could be cool so yeah
this is brief view of the day okay okay
yeah let's get down to earth again and
look at some road to data as we already
mentioned the image in public road
authority publishes a lot of data and
I'd like to categorize them into three
different types are there's registered
data there's static road data and
there's dynamic data Road data there's
also test expect we won't be covering
that now so let's start with the
registry data the reason I called this
Doug damn gold is that there's a lot of
interesting data sets here but there
aren't all that many good services
available to get ahold of the data but
but remember that's you can always get
access to the data if you ask unless
it's covered by some of the risk
restriction is earlier mentioned let's
say that I want to buy a used car
and to me as a as a car buyer it would
be really interesting to know what type
of average that has been reported to the
car when it's been through periodic
vehicle control or a control as we call
it in our way and there's of course
there's a registry for that so if I
could look up that kind of information
and maybe in addition maybe could
connect it with the garage registry I
can see that all the areas that have
been reported have been fixed at a
certified garage unfortunately that's
not possible at least from any services
at the moment but it would be fine would
be fun if such a service were to come in
place and it would be sooo to sell cars
also because you'd even though you're
looking like this lacy guy that's trying
to sell you a used car then you might
just points at the service say I'm
telling you the truth this is a good car
um yeah that's one example say I wanted
to learn how to drive a bus then I could
use the driving school registry to look
up what kind or what driving schools in
my area and could teach me that because
they don't have the competence although
learn me how to drive bus and there's
other other kind of registries to that
are a bit dug down at the moment um but
there's actually one little detail here
that's showing that there is progress
because the guards registry is now
available it's not available as a
service but it's available as the
downloadable and commerce separate file
so there you will find all the garages
and their addresses and what kind of
certification that what repairs are
allowed to do
moving on to some static road data the
regional national road databank is
really gold and it's originally created
to make planning of maintenance of roads
easier but there's a lot of more
information here in theory every road
longer than 50 meters that's drivable
should be in here and there's three
hundred seventy different types of Road
objects there's 725,000 road signs 212
stations and 240 thousand kilometers of
speed limits on the on the left-hand
side you'll find the sum of the objects
that you typically might want to look
for bridges tunnels road signs even
every light post s in here there are
speed limits and that's not just signs
but it's the speed limits for every road
section segments rest areas along the
roads toll road landslides and accidents
and there's even even information about
a very detailed information about the
road sort of each segments how their
length have they connected to other road
segments the Whitford Road height
restrictions load capacity which is
relevant for for heavy trucks and
turning restrictions which is indicating
for instance if this reeks is one way
you can't drive in this from that's this
direction and actually this information
is also published as a separate dataset
and it's being used by manufacturers of
navigation systems so if you want to
create your own navigation systems you
could actually just download the data
and get going this data is updated
several times a year so if you have a
gps and you want to to create the map
service and the route planner and things
like that
except for you and there's also some of
the less obvious data for instance
wildlife and vegetation along roads it
could be rare species of flowers and
things like that dub or it could be a
dear crossing and it also contains
geographical areas and administrative
area so it can be an being nice to know
about so let's take a look at at the API
again yeah as I mention here that the
data catalog is large so I would suggest
that you get to know the data catalog
and all its different objects because
that will make you that will make it
easier to to to know what to expect for
the result and what you could actually
get out of it this documentation is in a
Norwegian again sorry about that perhaps
google translate can help you but in
essence and then it's all in a witch and
also that the implementation of the API
is in a region and the API endpoints are
also in in a Widgeon it could return
both Jason and XML which is very nice I
prefer Jason and it's also the default
return formats yeah so here you can see
the endpoints all of these are our
detailed look up end points for the
objects in the database and use the
search endpoint which knowing Norwegian
is called circular so we have that in
the middle and that makes it a possible
to search
amongst all the objects in the database
filter on properties and so forth and so
forth the search object is pretty yeah
it's pretty complex so they've
implemented using adjacent object which
contains several filters and limiters 44
area and as I said properties and stuff
so the best way to and to get to know
the env DB is basically to to visit the
Ricardo dunno which is what I call our
env DD browser and so I thought I was
going to show you a little bit about
about that
they're so here you have ricardo de know
which is the map a search box here at
the upper rights so let's start with
limiting our search for Oslo and you see
that you get auto complete and so I
picked the Oslo municipality you get
focused area here so let's run a quick
demo of searching for tunnels again we
get autocomplete you have a heading for
which tells you what kind of object this
is it's an object type we click it and
we get a result of 19 tunnels so why
would first a good luck would like to
look at some of these elements so we
click this list and get a detail view of
the information for this given in tunnel
so that's cool but let's say I want to
filter this result further what I do
then is click + so let's say I want to
search for subsea tunnel how many of
that type is is there in oslo
municipality so in the region that is
energized yeah so it's like that so this
is kind of a query so you have to kind
of select operators or its equals and
yes and
each other and then it's it has returned
one hits that's nice so you how also the
list here and you have it marked on the
map here so we click that get the
information so this is the opportu num
pretty new one it's almost yeah it's
almost six kilometers long and you have
a lot of other information as you can
see down below here the the object
contains to several child objects and
several properties so and the answer you
get through the API gives you a list of
these objects and properties which you
can further navigate to which is shown
here so we could just pick one and we'll
show you the information so it's very
verb is very complete information you
get when you search like this you
quickly could of course filter this even
more so that was a quick look at it was
no service but before I leave it I need
to show you the core feature which I
wanted to show is this button here so if
I was a developer which I am I would
like to know how this this API call is
constructed and or even get the data
roll out so what you do is click this
button here and here you get the choice
of excel at CSV or even the API call so
I'm interested in the API call so what
what this does is basically send you to
the page or to the API with the search
objects prefilled and here you have the
results in XML
as you can see it's pretty big I
wouldn't recommend pushing this to a web
client but yeah I give you some tips
afterwards on how to handle this
so yeah you saw this picture the API
endpoint is like this you paste this
search object pretty printing it and
edit or it would look like something
like this you can see that I've I've
filtered on the municipality 301 I
selected the Tamil type objects which is
has the ID of 581 and I also applied a
filter for sub sub C tunnels equals yes
so yeah the documentation is cured in
Norwegian but unfortunately lacking in
English so if you're if you could try to
use google translate or try to make
sense of it it it would help you along
the way yeah now we looked at registered
data we've been looking at static data
and now let's move on to dynamic road
data there is a solution and a standard
called data X 2 it's a traffic
information exchange format and it's a
European formats so this isn't available
only in only from the region roads but
also it's the service being published by
all the countries in Europe because of
because of that and because of its is a
big standard and there's differences
between what they publish but these four
points are what is being published and
then we can one travel times this best
explained by looking at the backdrop
hair along the roads you might see signs
like this telling you that from this
point on you might expect to use seven
minutes to get to ask it or 23 minutes
to get to domin and this is
data that's dynamically updated based on
the traffic and how long it actually
takes to get from one paint point to
another at the current time you also got
to weather data from weather stations
along the roads that can tell you it's
not giving you a forecast but it's
giving you actual situation at the
moment the temperature of the road
whether it's there it's any any rain
coming down let's say it's you can see
the temperature in road is below zero
and you know it's going to rain then you
might expect ice and that could be nice
to know if you're driving there and it's
nice to know folder once who maintain
the road road cameras are located
usually with the weather stations and
they give you actual pictures of the
road and the traffic situation so you
can see that okay there's a lot of
traffic at the moment for instance or
you can see that there's snow on the
road could be nice to know but the most
important one I think is traffic
announcements these are announcements
that tell you when there's been an
accident maybe a lie Elaine is closed or
a tunnel is closed for maintenance and
there's information about the reason for
closing for instance or how long it will
be closed they could be in a few troops
saying you're planning to drive tonight
somewhere and you can see that this
tunnel and is closed tonight from this
from 22 to look six in the morning and
then you have to plan ahead then and
reroute yourself and this data and this
service is actually being used by by
Google another an apple also
they're road maps so when you in google
map see whether it's a red or green line
on a road indicating traffic that's
based on this information as i said its
european standard so you might find
other services also it's xml-based so
it's straightforward format and it's and
it's yeah it's it's possible to find
other services from european but you're
going tell us a bit about what's the
situation nor where how do we get access
to this data yeah so the data X source
from Davis Nora or mpra isn't publicly
available some can get access but you
need to apply for you so all the people
that apply for it often get access so it
shouldn't be really a problem but you
need to actually have a username and
password to access the XML so this
service is different from the two
previous because they aren't published
as a service they are published as
several XML files so you need to
actually download and parse these files
the documentation even though it's also
in english isn't good but the data is is
excellent you can use this for for many
purposes and recommended to to have a
look so the data X data model is is
documented on the EU site de texto latex
to EU so you can take a look at the
model there and how it all connects but
here you see the endpoints that they've
asthma or npra
publishes for us you have the two first
ones that are weather data and the next
one which is the webcam and data and you
have travel times and the last one maybe
the most important one the traffic
announcements for the current state so
yeah what you should do is this build a
parser which parses these files and then
you can put them into your own store and
yeah you can choose how many properties
and objects you want to store because
again this is pretty pretty verbis data
so so building your own partial could be
be a good way to go but they do support
a Heather called if modified since so
you could pass in date and time so if
you have if you're pulling several times
an hour you will pass in if modified
since last time you pulled and this
server will answer with a HTTP code for
yes or no you get the answer with XML if
it's modified and ago2 I think if it's
not modified since that so that's kind
of a optimization it's important to know
that these files are updated every time
new data for for example one of the
several hundred web cameras in this list
are updated so you have to keep track of
what elements in this total length of an
XML is changed so that's kind of the
downside of it you need to roll your own
a diff on this xml yeah and it's kind of
big xml so you this one is not meant for
dropping right to the client you need to
depart it yourself and publish maybe
your own API yeah so that brings me over
to the next point which is making your
own API I won't talk about how to make
your only guy because that's not why
we're here but I want to talk a little
bit about when you should think about or
consider making your own API so we
talked about data X which is basically
xml files and not a service so since
there's not any service publicly
available here you you are pretty much
forced to to build your own API and data
storage for them and then I think I want
to say about data X they are momentarily
information real time so they don't have
any history and you want if you want any
history with that data you have to to
store them yourself so just be aware of
that another scenario where this is
where its you should consider your own
API is like NV DB which is pretty
variables when you return the data too
yeah just pick out the data points that
you need and expose them into your own
API for for your clients and your use
then we have the situation where you
have several sources that you want to
combine into one query on one answer
could be place searched research you
have several sources of search for
places like addresses and places so you
want to turn to
mash them up into one answer and one
call to your own from your own service
of your service when a client calls your
service your service calls to other AP
ice and when you receive both answers
you answer your client with one mash tub
answer and the last case is when your
service the service you want to use is
password protected and or a rate limited
so several api's in order to guard
themselves against da dee da sore that
sort of thing they protect the service
with rate limiting or password yeah so
the last thing I wanted to talk about is
this map based traffic information
project which we which I participated in
the Emperor array or vapors not
initiated and started the last spring so
we started with the idea that various
not had a need for displaying their
traffic announcements in a better way
the traffic announcements was published
in text and not very easy for the
traffic the person going after in
traffic the road user that wanted the
information about the traffic situation
and the way he was going to see if there
was any any road work or accidents or
anything so there was a great need for a
map that you could put the map or
location-based information on so here we
see our view of other moving parts the
services that we need to the build this
web application and if we start in the
upper left the orange is that I'm region
public roads administration
so in the upper left you have the route
planner this is not publicly available
but it is a tool for calculating the the
route or several routes actually from A
to B and then you have the data X and
the env DP and on the right side you
have the Norwegian mapping authority
with their place searched and the land
register which we used for was searching
for addresses and places we did a
mash-up service of those two and the
last one was the mapping layers both
aerial photographs and the raster maps
so here you have the traditional traffic
announcement in text it's sorted by Road
number counties and the important
mountain passes so when you open this
side it doesn't initially it's not
initially clear to you if it if any of
these roads announcements are relevant
for you so I thought I was going to show
you this service maybe some of you
already have used it so you go to Vegas
nap
hard to see here yeah for you who visit
the side with the English language this
link is not present so you have to visit
it in Norwegian and service is pretty
much in meant for Norwegian at this
point and so here you have the service
it's pretty much like you would expect
any map it's yeah you could say it's
inspired by Google Maps the same
behavior in several ways you search for
places addresses but what is different
about this service is that it's stated
from NPR a and yeah they showing it on
their own map so it's a it's very cool
and what's kind of useful here is both
the traffic times which you see here in
color you see the traffic announcements
here you see from that other where you
when it actually is active and you also
have it's confusing because i have
another map here but it's not here it's
ok so let's turn on some data points on
the right here you have a menu for
toggling the different kind of data
layers you have 12 stations you have
Road cameras you have weather and you
also have fairies so down here you have
webcams that's cool nice burger and what
I like I'm from the north so I take a
lot of fairies when I go to go north for
vacation and I always need to google
around for the ferry timetable but if
you click this ferry actually get it up
down here so it's very nice very neat
this service is in via as you can see
here on the upper right
but it's possible to give some feedback
so I'd like to you to use this service
if you already haven't done that and
please give us some feedback if there's
anything you would like to do better'n
yeah
alright so let's summarize by now you
should we hope that you've gotten a
better understanding of what open data
and intelligent transport systems is
about we've seen that there's many
exciting data sets but there's still
work to be done when it comes to making
some of them more easily accessible open
data can be a driver for innovation and
provides valuable more valuable services
to the many type of applications we also
looked at some some api's that provide
IT s theta and how to get started with
using them for instance in this mat
based application as we've just seen we
believe that will see more use of open
data in the following but it's important
that the data owners publish their data
to the release this potential we also
put together slide of resources for you
to get started with these are both links
to api's and and data sets and
documentation so take picture of it now
or wait for the video to come out
sometime later oh yeah sorry
okay one more okay good so um if you
have any questions we can take some now
you can also contact us on these
addresses and it's also worth noting
that the road administration has a small
unit for handling questions about data
and data sets so if any of the data sets
we've been talking about here today is
something you would like to know more
about you can contact them or email or
Twitter so um feel free to ask questions
now or contact this lighter and hope you
enjoyed talk thank you okay we're good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
