for the first NDC's Sydney and yeah I'm
happy that you are here and that you
want to follow my talk because quality
starts in your head if you expect me to
talk about quality management or the
PDCA cycle or something like that I
think then you should leave because
that's not what I want to talk about I
want to talk about something much more
important and that's you because
whatever as a quality management system
you want to implement it just works when
you want to work with it so I think you
won't go out and have learned a lot and
it's not what I'm aiming it what I want
you to do is to think afterwards about
what I have told you and perhaps to look
at your own work to look at yourself and
then look what can I do to improve my
quality so if everyone anyone wants to
leave its time now ok yeah my name is
Sabina vucic formerly known as a beaner
Veronica bendixen the name is not that
my new name is not that all that you
find something about Sabine evo shack on
the internet this will change after NDC
but when you want to go go me please use
my old name I'm consultant author and
speaker and I work for get next I t this
is a company in a northern part of
Germany i will show you some things
about Germany later on and my topics the
important factor of the human being
everything I do is around the human
being and the people inside a company
the people in a team because we all are
so important but often we forgot about
this
yeah where do I come from Europe you
know Germany is in Europe this is
Germany and I come from the northern
part which is called fleece vejo each
time and it's near to the Danish border
where I live here here and it's very
nice we have the key channel perhaps
your third of it it's the connection
between the Baltic Sea and the northern
sea and it's very nice when you have a
walk on the landscape and some day you
see a big ship going through this camel
although you have been in the tourist or
something like that it's really crazy
sometimes it looked that nice mostly in
May blue sky is also available in
another part of Germany you can believe
it or not it's up to you but we have
also winter but not that much as you may
think we have beautiful sunsets we have
the Baltic Sea that's directly in queue
we have all those fairies he'll go from
here to Norway to Sweden into the Baltic
countries and we produce a lot of wind
energy in the northern part of Germany
because what we really have is wind on
both sides of land air sea water and we
always have wind from the one side from
the other side from the top front button
but yesterday someone told me only
Australia has the beautiful beaches and
Germany does not have Beatrice with
white sent we have we have a lot of it
increased recharge time and it is on a
side of the North Sea and we have a
small village called California and it's
in Germany it is not the California in
the United States and it's beautiful
really beautiful we have lighthouses we
have spiders too we have snakes
and they bite but what we don't have our
crocodiles so that's what I'm here i
hope to see a crocodile but i haven't
perhaps tomorrow in the zoo so when you
want to contact me these are the ways
you can get in touch I've said it before
now let's start with some examples about
ecology and because I don't want to
teach you things because I want to make
you think about it I have chosen a
different approach and I come up with
examples you know from the daily life so
don't be scary with will come over to
your daily work later on do you know the
Oktoberfest yes do you have something
similar here in Australia something like
something like an annual fair or
something like that ok in Germany it is
very popular to draw lots and a lot at a
lottery stall and you can win a soft
toys yeah you draw pick up some small
papers piece of papers there are some
signs on and you have collect different
signs to win so you see there are
different signs and sometimes you have
to have five of the speaks or five
different science or whatever and then
you can win but now also piece of papers
where what you won't win anything with
it because there's no sorry you haven't
won you hope for the jackpot when you
draw lots and open all those piece of
papers but this is a winner or loser
even if you have won something
when I prepared for my trip to Sydney I
try to draw lots and this was my winner
I really spent a lot of money to win
this little guy let do you have an idea
how much money this costs me 15 of 15
not that much but 25 and I think it's
very much for such a thing because when
you ever have opened such a soft toy
from relat or install you will find out
there's no quality inside you have
plastic pieces inside all buttons
buttons and whatever but never quality i
disappoint them no because it didn't
expect quality versus the quality here
for this is what what different if you
want a high quality soft toy you would
have turned this one do you know she
dies yeah steiff are very very high
quality soft toys I serve have to have a
Scottish dive soft toy which is about 45
years old I thought I get it when I was
two or three or something like that and
it looks nearly as if it is you although
I had it always in my arms so that's
really quality but what is what is the
quality for this why do people spend
money on this on one hand it's slow on
the other hand it's fun and it is hope
for luck so the quality is defined in a
different way for drawing lots so
quality has a lot of different phases
and when you ask people what is quality
and they don't start to define their
understanding of quality it could be
that they won't understand each other so
quality has to be defined what is your
quality so I say
we don't have any attendees under 18
here great are there some attendees who
do not want or like to talk about adult
stuff you like it okay so I think then
you are the right person to help me the
first one please come over please yeah
and I need a second one what's will yeah
yeah we want to test something you know
about testing yeah someone somehow okay
please do this yeah so and you please
choose one choose 11 open it I hope so
and please pull it over what about a
please care about the reservoir okay how
does it feel soon you yeah and usually
feel how does it feel fits good yeah
yeah Fritz natural yeah hmm smell citrus
yes thank you very much no not yeah so
what kind of quality do we have what
about the usability is it good to use
when you put it over it's good to use
this is going
I was easy enough of it yeah is enough
and when you're a little bit excited it
was easy to use and maybe not sailing
yeah it works it looks okay what about
the user experience you said it feels
good yeah because it's very thin it's
wet you can't see it but it feel you
feel it um some of those have naps on it
some nap this one smells and I get a
taste if what do you want to try and oh
yeah it's orange cool color so um I
don't want you to do thank you very much
you can go back to your seat take it out
if you want to listen if you watch it
it's up to you I don't want you to do is
security test because there could be a
bet bit wet if it not work I've done it
on my own at home and yeah it was really
cheap roof it was elastic it worked fine
I think we never need that much
electricity for using the condom if
quality is bad in this case please think
the small pockets are not very expensive
each one is not expensive this could be
one consequence which you have to care
for the rest of your life but there
could be other consequences which are so
bad i will don't want to talk about so
the user who uses the condoms expects
quality if not it could be really really
worse I found a quote programming is
like sex one mistake and you have to
support it for the rest of your life and
I think that's a really good quote
because it says everything you have to
take care of what you are doing
otherwise you will work on it and work
on it and work on it and work on it and
you were worried on it and what
on it and work on it so that's this fits
very well but please no storm now
for using the oops word but I think you
can deal with it although people are
aware of the consequences in this case
quality features sometimes I'm not
enough to use a product I don't know
what it is here in Australia when you
ask in Germany people no matter which
eight which age and you talked with them
about using condoms they tell me oh it's
not cool I know about the consequences
but it's not cool that's the reason why
a lot of producers have built in things
like noobs and color and smell and taste
just to make it more fun more
interesting just to sell mall it's the
reason they're not doing that because
they want to protect you for the
consequences but they want to sell a lot
of this but quality features sometimes
are not enough safety is sometimes not
enough and so it's the reason in this
case let me tell you about story in my
daily work besides that I'm a consultant
for companies I work in a social project
we are working with people who are for a
long time unemployed and have a lot of
problems and we have a CO and some some
weeks ago she sent me an email and who
wrote hey zameen our new website is
online now have a look at it I'm so
proud of it and she spent a lot of money
on the phone the website eight thousand
euro and this is what i see when i open
this website on my ipad or my phone the
characters at the side are not proper
there's a gray line in between this red
button here is within the text and i saw
this website and said oh my god what's
that we have had a website before it was
not that modern but it worked and she is
proud of this one because i have a new
website and i have paid a lot for it and
i told her hey yeah just have a look the
characters he are missing are just a few
characters and their sides but that
doesn't matter so for her is quality
something different and for me and
people all people who are engaged in
this whole process of quality have to be
ready for it for it it starts on our
head and it brings value when it is
useful for us so let's let's have a look
what quality could be this is a t-shirt
of my son and I think it's very
interesting because that's what quality
is it is something like a mask for a lot
of different features usability could be
a feature of quality you eggs could be a
feature of quality as well as
performance security reliability
extensibility maintainability modularity
or efficiency or something more could be
designed or whatever so quality could be
defined in very different ways and we
talk about quality you have to talk
about which quality you want to speak so
question number one is what kind of
quality is important for you that's the
question you have to ask yourself or you
have to ask within your team before you
start a project so I want proud to
present you a new stakeholder in this
whole process and it's called the
customer I want to go away
from the name user because the customer
is but with the wording customer it's
more obvious that it is the customer who
pays the bill the users on who uses your
product the customer could be the user
to but the customer is the one who pays
the bill and so second question what
kind of quality is important for your
customer when you are writing software
you are true you have to to think about
your kind of quality but on the other
hand you have also think about which
quality is important for your customer
and you have to think about it at the
beginning not when you are ready with it
so you have to make up your mind don't
underrate the customers expectations
customers are those right down on the
internet when they are satisfied but
they write also down when they are not
satisfied and you can't why by the way
of the internet and everyone who will
google for your product for your company
will find bad ratings and good ratings
so the quality process has a lot of
stakeholders we have on the one hand the
customer here we have the whole
organization the company you're working
for the team you're working in and you
the individual and all these
stakeholders influence are influencing
each other your team the atmosphere and
your team is influencing the way you are
working your work is influencing the
team the company is influencing your
team work and your own person the
customers are influencing the way the
company reacts and so on so all these
parts have to be together and modern
customer
ah also responsible for quality william
edwards deming once said quality is
everyone's responsibility and he's right
with this because when I'm a customer
and the quality is not what I'm I have
expected it's my task to bring it back
to ask for the company to make it better
to give feedback or whatever or just to
let go just won't won't buy it again but
also the company the team and everyone
in this team is responsible for quality
and it's not okay I am just an employee
here and quality is the matter of the
organization no I am the employee here
and I am responsible for the quality of
my work quality at every stage do you
know what your customers really want do
you notice how do you work when you
don't know what the customers want ah
that's bad sorry whatever some of you
right specifications with the customers
but specifications are just half of the
truth because you can't write down
everything what you really should avoid
is to guess because to guess is just a
small view on the topic try to
communicate and now it is a question how
can we communicate with the customers
and it's the reason why you have to
think about before you start with the
product what does the customer really
want so you have to think about how do
we get these information what can we do
to get those informations which are so
important for developing a high quality
product or product with the certain
quality so John F Kennedy said too often
we enjoy the comfort of opinion without
the discomfort of thought
it's so easy just to say oh I believe
they want this it's very hard to make up
my mind how can I get the information
from the customer so it's easier just to
have an opinion what I think I think I
know what I want no because we have to
think of quality we have to think what
is the purpose of quality on the first
hint quality is an investment Amit and
long-term investment on customer
relationship and customer relationship
is important because money money money
and to be honest you all develop
products and deliver services because
money is in the background you don't do
it because you have only fun I hope you
have found a new job but that's not all
and when your employee your company
would not be happy if you saw money
doesn't matter yes money rules the world
and when we speak about quality it's a
question of money it's a question of how
much money we invest in the product but
it's also a question of how much money
we can earn even if you are developing a
product which is sought for one or two
years your company is measured on this
short term product so if you have a
short-term product and this has a good
quality it is a reputation for your
company and it will be a sign of koi
sign of quality for next products people
will have an expectation so quality is
an investment and customer relationship
so when you know what your customers
want at the beginning of the process
you're able to build quality in right
from the beginning which will be much
easier which will be much cheaper and
which will be much better you all know
when you have finished a product ninety
percent and then you start building
quality security it's a hard work often
because you have to restructure things
you have done or whatever so building
quality right from the beginning is much
easier it's if you build a house and you
forget about the water you need in the
on the second floor and your bathroom
and afterwards you have to break up all
wards and put the tubes and so that you
can have water water in the second floor
it's your choice choice quality versus
price versus time it's your choice which
quality do we want which price are we
aiming it and how much time do we have
and to find a balance between all those
three points is very important when you
don't have enough time and just a low
budget it's very hard to believe in a
very high quality so that's the way
that's what you have to to consider
before you start otherwise this could
happen the first ninety percent of the
code accounts for the first ninety
percent of the development time ten
percent are still leaving still missing
the remaining ten percent of the code
accounts for the other ninety percent of
the development time is this familiar to
you
and a lot of thing sometimes this
happens because you have missed to build
in some special features and you have to
put them in later on so we can you can
shorten the development time when you
think about all those stuff before
another example of my work in the social
project we are seeing some bags with the
people who are in this project and we
have attack which we put in all our
products and we are called diets hope
styles hope is a department in Hamburg
where a lot of underprivileged people
are living low level of educational
level of income and we changed this word
diets hope is usually one word its name
and we changed it in two words and hit
the word hope at the end as the hope we
want to give the people who are in this
project for the rest of the life so all
the time we are producing something we
put in attack with our labor and a
customer came to us and asked us to
produce 20 of those bags with some
special printings on and lady came to me
and said sabina we have finished those
20 bags and I looked at the small tag
and I saw they were all mirrored you
can't read them they were all mirrored
20 bags and I go over turn said hey
Claudia you have to open all those bags
again because the tag is wrong and she
said sabina I've seen that but I think
nobody will see it okay and when you are
true to yourself I think you are have
made this experience in your daily work
you have seen something is not really
correct not really good
and you said okay doesn't matter no one
will see it quality is doing things
right when no one is looking and that's
the problem about quality quality often
is hidden inside something and also
space and no one will really see it and
you do it when no one is looking so it
is really easy to say ah doesn't matter
no one will see it but it could be
expensive at the end the end when you
have this attitude don't forget you your
team and your organization you're all in
the same boat because you want to reach
one goal success when your company is
successful they can pay your income when
the company is not successful it could
be that you all lose your job so you are
all sitting in the same boat and that's
a committed goal and for this is
important in your company in your team
to find a quality commitment a level of
quality you all are committed on and you
all want to follow because in the end
you have the same goals from every
single person and up to the whole
organization so let's have a look at the
quality of daily work look here lines
are very straight everything is financed
hear someone I get had slept while doing
his work and perhaps when he has done
his work he haven't even seen it because
just the seeds and the earth perhaps you
haven't seen it these guys later on
we'll have a problem to pick up all
those leaves here but that's what that
is what happened in daily work
do you know the sin of pi sins it's on
python.org by Tim Peters and I've just
picked out a few of his mentioning it's
not only when you work with pies and
it's not only when you work writing a
program because that's what I have
mentioned here what I will mention here
is for all our work not only for
programming explicit is better than
implicit lets you when I communicate
with you it is better to say directly
what I wanted you to tell instead of
communicating implicit and you have to
find it out what i want to tell you so
when I want to tell you something very
important I have to do it experts it
when I want to reach a certain kind of
quality please make it explicit so that
the other one who has to work on it
knows what you want simple is better
than complex don't make the things
always so complex and what is complex is
also better than complexity is then
complicated that's the next step and
send off pies and this refers to the
wording kiss keep it short and simple or
keep it simple stupid or whatever there
are different interpretations of kids
but they all mean the same make it as
easy as possible not so complicated in
the face of ambiguity refuse the
temptation to guess we had it before but
in the second the percent of person it's
also written down please when you don't
know when you're not sure about it ask
people try to find out what's right but
not guessing not when you want to
achieve quality so quality you have seen
it has a lot to do with communication
when we want to reach quality we have to
communicate with each other so that
everyone knows what we are talking about
quality over quantity is also the rule
for communication and if you haven't
been in my talk on Wednesday I have
talked about this topic quality
communication just take a chance and
look at on the video as soon as it is
online so it's this slide refers to the
talk before I don't want to talk about
software architecture to you because I
don't know about software architecture
that much but you have I hope so a
software architecture and the question
is do you work around this architecture
do you follow the roots it's your
decision accepting it or working around
when you work around it doesn't make
sense to build up with architecture and
forehand because when nobody is
following the rules you have wasted a
lot of time so better to accept it you
know about software craftsmanship who
knows the roots nobody some ideas behind
software craftsmanship yeah yeah clean
code is one of the big hashtags of
software craftsmanship building clean
code and it refers so many other things
which lead to a clean code so if you're
interested in software craftsmanship
look at Google you find out something
it's really really good but enough to
know about it you have to know how you
can do it you have to understand why it
is so important to follow such rules but
the best thing is stop talking about it
just do it and that's with all the other
things it's not enough to talk about it
when you have a certain idea of quality
you have to talk with your colleagues
sometime you have to stop talking and
you have to do it and nothing more
because otherwise the quality would come
wouldn't come into your product so
always code as if the guy who ends up
maintaining your coat will be a violent
psychopath who knows where you live so
there's someone later on who has to work
with your coat and if you hand over a
bad quality I can assure you he would
sometimes start worrying about you and
then it's better he does not know where
you are living or the atmosphere and the
team could become very bad if someone
starts worrying about your work and
that's not what you really want no one
wants to work in a team with a bad
atmosphere we want to have fun at work
we want to have colleagues we like and
colleagues who like us but we don't have
to worry about other colleagues
perfection is achieved not when there is
nothing more Treach but rather when
there is nothing more to take away
sometimes less is more the more features
are put into something the more
possibilities will be there where
something could go wrong this is the
same as kiss the more ingredients the
more possibilities of failures so all I
think do I really need this do I really
need to add this or are there are ways
to do it a little bit simpler how do you
feel about continuous testing I think
all those who have a car are very happy
about that the companies do those crash
tests I'm because you can say that your
car is some safety wants on some safe
one I know a lot of employees and
companies who feel like watched by Big
Brother
with all those testing and saying oh my
god another testing and they came back
to me and they have to change things
that is not good and why do they always
test don't they believe me that I can do
a good job are do you think continuous
testing is a useful help because it can
help you to improve to improve the
product and it can help you to avoid
mistakes which are later on hard to find
out another part is this kind of
documentation in Oregon when I come two
teams whenever I come two teams there's
always at least one person who is
worrying about writing documentation I'm
not talking about how much come their
documentation is necessary it's only the
thing that there has to become
documentation is the documentation for
you the evil thing you need to avoid or
do you think documentation is important
kout reviews now sometimes I have the
end of impression this is the picture
which is going on in some teams but do
you have committed roots for your code
review you can follow and everyone knows
what is important for the code reviews
there's a tea too much I see sorry for
that ah does your code review happen by
accident
quality of meetings meetings are part of
our work few companies don't have any
meetings anymore but most of the
companies do have so who has ever felt
at meetings are waste of time please
don't blame always the facilitator he is
just so she is just a guy who who runs
it think about what is my rule in the
meeting do I go into a meeting and just
consume everything the facilitator tells
me or do I play an active role in this
meeting I've joined a lot of meetings
and company because we one of our
services is to improve meetings and
companies who come to me and say hey
Serena please join our meetings because
we have the impression that we waste so
much time and the meetings are not
effective one big mistake which happens
there always is that all the Italians of
the meeting sit down and say so there's
a facilitator let's let's do him his
work and we are interested in here and
listening listening it is a good thing
but sometimes they don't even listen
because they are playing with their
laptops or phones or whatever or just
shut down so meeting is an active part
in our daily work and when I go to
meeting and I'm not satisfied with what
there is set I have to ask I have to say
it I have to mention it and all
attendees in a meeting are responsible
for the efficiency and the quality of
the meeting not only the facilitator
so when you go next time to a meeting
and you think oh my god another hour
wasted then have a look at your behavior
within the meeting and look what you can
do that this time is not wasted but
invested in a good thing quality of
feedback feedback very very important in
our work is your feedback offensive and
destroying do you take care about what
the other one thinks or is your feedback
appreciating and helping this is what
the feedback should be it's also up to
you to ask for feedback not only to give
for feedback it's easier to give it back
to give feedback instead of getting
feedback but if you want to better your
quality of work you can ask for feedback
and say hey what do you think about it
quality of dealing with failures when we
do what when we want to do great stuff
failures will happen we can't do new
things we can't do complicated things
without failures failures will be there
there will be on our way to achieve
success but what do we do when failures
appear do we play the blame game hey you
made it wrong so what's going on with
you you always made some mistakes do we
try to hide failures I hope no one will
mention it worst way or are we
responsible for what happens and learn
we learn out of failures that's very
important to learn other failures but
it's also important that we knew that we
know that failures can appear and then
we start work with a lot of thinking
about it so that we can avoid some
mistakes in the forehand the quality of
dealing with failures blame game hided
responsibility on and learning what
about the quality of sharing sharing
knowledge you are mostly working in
teams with a lot of different
individuals who have different knowledge
ease there are two ways I try to hide my
knowledge because I want to be someone
special and when they want to know they
have to come to me and to ask me to do
this I'm very exclusive in my knowledge
so yeah they need me or am I open with
my knowledge and I'm open to share it
and I want to share it because I have
the whole game in mind the whole success
not only my safety and my success
quality of
sharing sustainability when we want to
achieve quality we have to look at
sustainability versus hop on and hop off
mentally mentality this is one thing on
the one hand for the HR department do we
hire people for three months and let
them go people who are in a company for
three months are not really interested
in quality for a mid or long term time
so hop on and hop off of new employees
could be for a short time in solution
but it's not the best solution to
achieve quality it's also with new
methods and new tools when I always put
in new tools new tools new tools and try
new methods the employees need time to
get familiar with these tools and
methods methods to get out the best of
it but when I try it three weeks and I
say oh it's not that fine as I thought
and I put in another one it doesn't make
sense Hana hop-on hop-off is not what is
good for achieving quality
sustainability is what we need quality
is not an act it is a habit have you
heard this before I was very surprised
when i have read who has told us this
this was totally us and it's long long
long time ago when he said this but it's
the same today quality is not an act
it's a habit it should be part of our
behavior when we want to do a good job
and a job full of quality so what you
should take way is check your own
attitude towards quality
check your own way of working check your
own behavior and check the culture in
your team is this a culture of trust
where you all can put in those things I
have told you about because quality
really starts in your head the tool you
need for this is here in between your
ears and when you are not ready with
your tool for quality all the other
stuff of quality management and PDA PDCA
cycle and so on won't work this is
really your task to start with quality
thank you very much I hope you all had a
great first NDC here in Sydney I thanks
