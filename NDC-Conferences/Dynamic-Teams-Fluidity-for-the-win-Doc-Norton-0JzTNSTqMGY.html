are at the party last night
yeah well thanks for making it out I
know first first session morning after
the party rainy day so the title of this
talk is dynamic teams fluidity for the
win if that's not the session you want
it to be in now might be a good time to
find the session you wanted to be in I
am Doc Norton I am the CEO of a company
called CT o2 and we offer coaching to
organizations who do a lot of agile
rescues so companies that tried to go
agile something went wrong we can come
in and help them figure out maybe
there's a way to do things that works
for you but doesn't come out of a box
some of that involves leadership
leadership coaching and and even working
with HR but one of the things that we
keep seeing as we go into these
organizations especially those that have
made an attempt to move to agile is this
belief that teams have to be stable I
will talk to them about maybe increasing
the fluidity of the organization's
internal we can't do that we have to
have stable teams we have to okay
where'd this come from so well it says
it in the scrum books and most of us
these days think scrum is agile so
therefore you know it must be true right
but ok great it says it in the scrum
books but why why do we need to have
stable teams what is all this about are
any of you familiar with Tuckman's
stages of team development I got a
couple of hands up several of you may
actually be familiar with it and just
not realize that it had a name so the
most common response that I get from
leadership for why teams need to be
stable all kind of maps back to this
basic theory Tuckman's theory of team
development and what Tuchman told us in
his theory was that
teams go through various stages as a
team is actually coming together they
will go through these stages in sequence
teams must go through these stages they
will go through them one at a time right
and if there are any challenges the team
will regress in those stages most stages
are forming storming norming and
performing to sound familiar to more of
you now that we've yeah
okay so that's Tuckman's theory right
Tuchman came up with this theory in 1965
right and as I said he says that all of
these phases are necessary they're
inevitable a team will go through them
and what happens according to documents
theory as a team goes through these is
we see varying levels of performance on
that team so as a team is first forming
and you've probably experienced
something like this as a team as first
forming everybody is actually kind of
cordial nobody's really being their true
self quite yet right you're feeling out
everybody else on the team trying to
figure out what do they value why do
they do it that way right everybody's
just kind of being nice to each other so
performance isn't too bad it's not
awesome but it's not bad and if you
could stay there you know you'd be an
okay team but after a while it starts to
actually just piss you off that that guy
never writes a good commit message or
that she keeps putting the curly
brackets on the wrong line or right
whatever it is that just kind of gets to
you and so you bring it up and it turns
out that that's maybe personal for that
person and so now what happens is a team
starts to go into the space the Tuchman
refers to is storming and in storming
what's happening is now we're starting
to show our true selves and we're
starting to have real conversations but
they're hard conversations and while
that's happening our performance goes
down right because now we're fighting
over all kinds of standards or having
heated debates discussions over all
sorts of things that
we do if we can get past some of the
emotional pieces we then move into
norming and then normally what happens
is now we're having more civil
discussions we're starting to reach
compromise understandings standards the
team starts to agree where the curly
brackets go the team starts to agree how
the commit messages are supposed to be
written right and all of that kind of
noise starts to fall away and we move
into performing and now you have a team
that is performing well the challenge so
actually so the graph should look
something you know like that it's
beautiful right and as I said how many
of you just just quick show of hands how
many of you have joined a team and have
gone through something that feels sort
of like this okay so most of you right
and so that's actually the thing is is
we hear Tuckman's theory and then we map
it to our own reality and we go that
sounds pretty reasonable I think I've
experienced that okay yeah yeah that
makes sense right but what if that's
wrong right what if the problem wasn't
at all because of Tuckman's what if
there was something else going on
because in my experience when I actually
watch teams this is what we say happens
right but often times the reality looks
a little bit more like this we spend an
awful lot of time in this storming thing
sometimes way too much time in this
storming thing right or it seems like
there's this continual loop that happens
we just keep regressing back right which
on a timeline actually looks you know
more like this right and many of those
teams go through all of this but the
performing doesn't quite look like that
it looks more like where we started when
it's all said and done all right
so Wow when we hear about Tuckman's and
we kind of map it to our own experience
in the beginning we go yeah that sounds
right that's that's that's familiar but
then you start to think about what's
what's actually happened for me and it's
kind of sort of like Tuckman's but not
really right now it turns out the
Tuckman's theory which is basically just
this hypothesis right was based on a
1965 review of 55 articles on team
development right now most of these
articles were personal narratives
written by members of the team that
Tuchman himself had asked them to share
their experience and in the way that the
question was asked there was a lead and
so many of those narratives mapped to
this idea because it was planted in
their head already so 65 this theory
comes out 1966 through to 2011 dozens
upon dozens of various studies done to
test Tuckman's not one ever validated
Tuckman's several of them showed this
can't possibly be right none of them
ever came close to actually validating
it right now I don't know about the work
that's been done in the last five years
but that's an awful long time span to
have all of these studies done and all
them basically saying something's not
quite right here in 2011 the US military
did the largest study in history on this
particular topic and they looked at many
many many different teams under many
different contexts and what they did was
they took all of these behaviors that
should appear during forming storming
norming and then performing according to
a very comprehensive Tuckman's model is
now it's called now called a model it
was
never a model and he did it was just a
theory but people kept adding on to it
until it became known as a model and
there's all this stuff around it so they
took all those behaviors and they said
okay let's observe all these various
teams let's actually map when these
behaviors occur and see what really
happens and what they found was not that
curve that we see not the linear
sequence that is supposed to occur but
something that looks a lot more like
this teams
very rarely go through all four stages
in sequence most teams do not experience
all four stages the stages clearly
overlap massively right and the most
significant part about this storming is
the red this is what happens in reality
teams are constantly storming it may be
subtle but a healthy team is
continuously re-evaluating their process
and discussing should we continue doing
that should we do this should we try
this other thing and that fundamentally
is the behaviors that are exhibited in
storming and it turns out that it
doesn't really affect performance in any
quantifiable way because it is a
constant occurrence so the number one
argument that I have heard as I go into
organizations for why we need to have
stable teams is wrong if the reason we
need to keep the teams stable is so that
they don't regress into storming but
storming is a constant therefore there
is no regression it's wrong but I will
admit that stable teams are valuable in
an awful lot of organizations so if the
problem wasn't because Tuckman's which
we've clearly seen at this point maybe
there's something else that's going on
and I think maybe the problem was
because resources and what I mean when I
say because resources how many of you
work in organizations where they refer
to human beings living breathing people
with minds and souls as resources as if
you were a pencil or a lump of coal
I think this pervasive resources
mentality is what's actually hurting
most of these organizations so let's
look at this so here's our pile of
resources right nameless faceless
they're just moveable cogs I need stuff
done they are stuffed doers awesome I
happen to have a large pile of projects
that need to get done now as an
executive I could think about these
projects and decide which ones are
actually the most important to the
organization which ones give us the
greatest strategic advantage which ones
would pervert you know would actually
provide maybe the highest return on
investment be that perhaps cash or some
other kind of outcome that I'm looking
for right I could prioritize these
things and I could invest in a few of
them and I could see how that goes and I
can readjust my investment strategy
based on the actual outcomes but that's
really a hard work and I have a pile of
resources so if I can just figure out
some way to get them to do all of that I
don't have to make hard decisions and
lucky for me I figured out a way to do
that I will just assign people to
multiple projects and if I can assign
all of the projects across all of my
resources then all of my stuff is being
worked on and therefore all of my stuff
will get done right it's not quite how
it works though is it how many of you
have been on more than one project at a
time yeah do you feel super productive
when you're on more than one project at
a time
you might feel super busy but do you
feel super productive what turns out
that every time basically let's take a
look at this if you are assigned to a
single project in a 40-hour work week
and I'm assuming 40 hours as a standard
work week it turns out that the reality
is there's about eight hours that just
go to stuff and things right you are
about 80% efficient on any given week
now it might be getting coffee it might
be taking a restroom break it might be a
smoke but it might be whatever it is
right but the reality of it is in a
40-hour week if you're actually tracking
all the hours about 32 of those are
actually applied to work in some way
that's a reality we can lecture people
we can do whatever we want about it
that's an actual reality so when you are
on two projects you lose 20% of your
time to context switching right so this
is not micro stuff but macro stuff I'm
thinking about this project and the team
members and the context and the business
need and where we are in terms of status
and now I need to set all of that aside
I need to find some way to
compartmentalize that over here and not
think about it because now I need to
work on this thing right that switching
of context which unfortunately for most
of us happens within a day multiple
times when we're on more than one
project causes costs about 20% of
efficiency so if you're on two projects
you're getting 24 hours worth of work
done in a given week which means you're
putting 12 hours to each of those
projects and you can kind of do the math
here right three projects four projects
what happens at five projects at five
projects mathematically all of your time
is spent either on stuff things or
switching between projects you
technically never get anything done now
I know lots of people that are said it's
not true I'm not like seven projects I'm
delivering things all of the time sure
you are getting some things done but for
how long they take and for how few you
actually complete compared to what your
throughput would be if it was just if
you were just on one project
mathematically you're almost at zero
right it's this is asymptotic you're not
going to actually get to zero you'll do
something the math is still pretty valid
right so let's I'm gonna look at this
from a slightly different perspective
because when I show this to executives a
lot of times like oh well you know I
remember oh okay what if you look at it
this way so this is basically what
happens how long the duration does it
take to complete eight hours of work and
I'm doing the air quotes on eight hours
of work thing because who the hell knows
what is eight hours of work right like
eight hours of work for me it might be
three hours of work for you I I don't
know but we'll just use a standard of
eight hours of work right if you're on
one project and you have lost 20% to you
know stuff and things that eight hours
of work is going to take you ten two
projects three four basically once
you're on five projects one day's worth
of work will take you infinity to
complete right based on this but that's
not the only thing so so this is just
that you're if if you're on multiple
projects but there's another problem
with this because resources mentality
and I see this one even more often in
organizations and this is this idea of
we've got to keep everybody loaded right
we need to have people loaded to a
hundred percent because well it's it's
not good use of our money if I'm paying
you and I'm paying you a good salary by
the way if I'm paying you you should be
giving me 100% of your attention when
you're here so I'm going to make you be
100 percent
utilized and work is variable the
difficulty of a task from one task to
another varies the amount of time that
task might take varies the type of
thinking that is required varies
whenever you have variability in a
system you have to have slack if you
don't have slack the system jams right
so the common analogy is a highway if
you're on a highway and it is 100
percent utilized meaning there is
absolutely no space whatsoever what's
happening it's a traffic jam right it
fundamentally it becomes a parking lot
that is 100 percent utilization nothing
moves now theoretically you could load
that highway to 100% and it could all
move at the exact same speed and I've
had people make that argument you're
right
there is now zero variability in the
system not one of those vehicles can go
any faster or any slower cannot veer to
the light cannot veer to the left cannot
in any way alter their trajectory and
then that's possible right zero
variability is the only time that
hundred cent utilization actually works
otherwise it causes jams and that's
exactly what happens in our work when we
are 100 percent utilized our performance
graph starts to look something like this
the amount of time it takes a task at
100 percent utilization is exponentially
higher than at ninety percent which is
you know twice what it is at eighty
percent right so as we kind of go
through this right around forty fifty
percent utilization you start to see a
little bit of drag sometimes in
organizations but as you get to 80 and
90 it's a significant spike where the
throughput actually goes down so when we
start loading people to 100% allocation
we're actually slowing them down they
are going to get less and less and less
done and then we marry these two
concepts together and we start saying
okay here's eight hours of work on one
project with utilization now we can see
down here there's a bit of a drop that's
because at 10% utilization you can't
actually get all the work done right in
the month time right but eventually okay
two projects three four five projects
home percent utilization you will get
nothing done ever right what stable
teams is solving for these organizations
is this problem it is solving because
resources right that's what it actually
solved it stopped managers from saying
okay you're going to be on this project
this project in this project and I need
you
33.33% on each of them or you know I
need you 40 percent here 40 percent here
20 percent there or whatever right it
stopped that from happening and it
stopped organizations from assembling
and disassembling and new assembling
teams based on some project or some whim
right it allowed us to say this is a
stable team leave them alone
stop doing that if they don't
have enough work for their front-end
developer they will figure out how to
make that work they will maybe have the
front-end developer work on some more
documentation maybe that person will
pair with the back-end developer so they
can start to scale up in that area but
this stable team will figure that out on
their own leave them
so that's what it actually solved but
stable teams started to create a new
phenomena inside organizations we
started creating these tiny little boxes
right we made a new form of silos so at
one point we had maybe all of the DBAs
reported into one structure and all of
the you know API developers reporting to
another one and all the front-end
reported into another one and we had all
of these little weird silos right and we
tried to figure out how to flow work
through each of those little silos we
said well that's not working and we kept
you know shoveling people around
eventually we said okay standing teams
stable teams every skill you need is on
that same team and this is working
really well but we started creating
these little tiny silos right because
now these teams start to associate with
themselves more than they do with others
right new learning is happening within
each box but it's not necessarily
getting out so this team figures out
that maybe they're getting flow was a
little too complicated and so they
streamline it and now they're just going
off a trunk crazy and it's working
really well for them but no other team
and the organization knows about that no
other team the organization learns about
that right and these teams start to
create their own subculture some of
which are very toxic and I've seen this
in organizations where I actually call
it like the cult of personality you'll
see these put these teams where the team
itself is awesome everybody gets along
everybody works really well man they
crank out work and everybody else hates
working with them doesn't want to have
to depend on them for anything doesn't
want to even have to communicate with
them because they are abusive to
everyone in the organization except
themselves right and I call cult of
personality because typically those
teams have some type of ego driven
leader
who benefits greatly from having that
team be unbelievably loyal to him or her
right and so they create this dynamic
where the team loves them and they're
always protecting the team and so they
create all these you know adverse
relationships right and then what
happens is organizations grow and you
know we start to realize that like the
mana list just isn't working anymore for
us like we you know we prove the market
and the product is good and now we got
to figure out something else to do so
what are we going to do we're going to
break it down into some kind of services
maybe even micro services and every team
now belong oh it owns a service and all
of a sudden you've got this organization
that is growing and this this this new
problem is actually getting worse right
this is this is just another
implementation of Conway's law we're all
right so maybe you fit with Conway's law
by the way all right so yeah it's kind
of a thing that like most of us know at
this point right but but paraphrasing
Conway's law the systems that we produce
are a reflection of the organizational
structure that produces them so when we
organize in certain ways wherever the
seams are between teams between groups
that is where the highest number of bugs
defects issues occur not just in
software Conway's law actually was was
was later realized for software was
originally applied to I believe military
tanks trying to figure out why tanks
consistently failed in certain ways and
after a comprehensive study realized
that all of the failure points mapped
back to communication points on teams
right and then looking at other systems
realizing this is universal this is just
kind of how it works it's also how it
works in software so as we get into
these kind of these micro teams right
and they're highly insular and there
isn't sharing across them you know the
organization isn't growing isn't moving
isn't isn't isn't actually advancing as
well
and you start to see all these really
strange behaviors the other challenge
becomes let's just pick any one of these
teams right let's say this team here
when this team first forms their
responsibility is to launch into a new
vertical right we are going to come up
with a new product that is similar to
our current offering but will will gain
us access into a different market so I
was a global director of engineering
culture for Groupon for a number of
years and you know the original coupons
thing was great and it worked until we
screwed up but we wanted to launch it to
other markets and so we wanted to get
into say travel great vacation packages
we peeled the team off and we said you
guys are responsible for figuring this
out and capturing this market so when we
started this is a team full of people
who absolutely loved wien startup you
type things right try a little thing a
little bit Mechanical Turk just throw it
out there see what happens get some
feedback run an a/b test boom boom boom
boom boom moving fast breaking things
right that didn't work this will work
let's try this let's try that and they
got to a certain point with like oh oh
people are starting to buy this okay
what happens next what happens next is
okay people starting to buy this we kind
of proven it out we should probably pull
the reins back on the and start actually
stabilizing but this team doesn't like
doing that kind of work and they're
still responsible for travel so they're
still going to keep doing what they like
to do so it turns out that the product
itself actually wants different skills
different people different capabilities
as the product matures so we introduced
a new
problem with this stable teams concept
and that was that teams were not
necessarily well outfitted for you know
and a bunch of people said oh but they
could have learned to do that well sure
we can learn to do that that's true but
if I really like to play basketball and
what the team needs is baseball why am I
going to stay there right yeah I could
learn to play baseball but I don't like
doing that it's not a matter of skill
it's a matter of desire feathers talks
about this quite a bit there's a lot of
words on the screen feel free to read
them if you want to I'm going to redact
this down a little bit what he basically
says is look none of none of this stuff
is static right
none of our projects are static it's
actually very fluid and if you have the
ability to read team then you're able to
do this sort of thing consistently
you're able to actually move people
around in ways that serve the needs of
the product right so we're starting to
realize that reteaming is actually a
good idea the question is how do you do
it so in the past the way that we did it
was a management got together in a room
and they I don't know man they through
name through names in a pile and they
drew them out and they negotiated a
purple one purple and then they came up
with like these are the new teams and
you came in Monday morning and it was
announced these are the new teams and
then we wondered why things didn't work
very well
but some other organizations
organizations have started to figure
this out
right how can we actually read team in a
healthy way so one of them I want to
talk about a little bit is valve
software I think you know that a few
years ago their handbook came out it was
very was very clever a great read and it
really kind of like made its way around
you know the software community they
have this idea of cabal's and basically
what these are is they're multiple
multidisciplinary
project teams so same fundamental
concept that we're seeing an in agile or
whatever right take everybody that you
need put them on a single team right
what happens is they completely self
organize into these basically temporary
groups they see all of these groups as
ephemeral they will live as long as they
need to live and they will disappear
when they are no longer needed and they
are for the most part entirely trusting
the doers to decide the people that do
the work now in a lot of organizations
when I talk about this type of thing
this idea of very high autonomy what if
so at valve at least the theory is I
don't I don't haven't spoken anywhere
they said like yes that is actually
reality I've seen that happen I have
only heard it third hand but you could
be working on a project on Friday
afternoon Friday night you go out with a
few friends from work for drinks one of
them is talking about the project there
on your like your project sounds pretty
cool so Monday morning you come in you
release the lock on your desk you roll
it over to your friends area lock pull
down the power and you are now on that
team done there's no paperwork there's
no management approval there's no
nothing right you just move and the fear
in a lot of organizations has been well
if we do that everyone's going to leave
all of the boring work and everyone's
going to want to go to the sexy work
they're all gonna want to do the new
interesting stuff and no one's gonna
want to do the boring things and it just
turns out that that's not actually true
if you actually implement this that's
not what happens and there's a number of
reasons for that one what you think is
exciting and sexy somebody else doesn't
ever want to have to do so you know we
talked about the one team that like what
they really love to
is that Lean Startup II kind of stuff
right there are other teams of people
what they really love to do is actually
turn it into a rock-solid scalable
performing platform right two totally
different things there which of them
thinks is you know is exciting differs
the other thing is that even for us as
individuals our needs and desires change
I've seen plenty of engineers who have
come into an organization have
skyrocketed themselves into some
position of like man she is amazing she
gets a ton of work done she's here long
hours she's you know just absolutely
nailing it we made her the lead in his
team five years in she's starting a
family and what ends up happening is she
leaves the organization because there's
expectations of her behavior and there's
no there's no place for her to go within
this organization and I see the same
thing with men right they come in and
they actually you know escalate in some
way and then they start a family and now
it's 40-hour week is good and and if I
can come in after a sleepless night and
I can pick a ticket off of a stack and I
can actually get it all the way to done
and check that in by the end of the day
that's a good day for me right that's a
reality so what we actually want and
need changes so it turns out these
things actually work one of the other
arguments that I hear about about
especially this type of thing here is I
actually had this so at Groupon one of
the first things I introduced was an
internal transfer procedure the reason
that we did it was interviewing a bunch
of the developers there were a lot of
complaints or people were actually
leaving the organization because they
thought that they couldn't move from
team to team right and so I went to the
executives and I said many people are
leaving the organization because
feel as though they cannot move from
team to team to which the VP said well
that is patently false and I said no I
don't think you heard me they feel as
though they cannot move from team to
team you cannot tell me that is true or
false is their feelings not yours and we
have an option here there's basically
two things you can do you can go out
there and you can lecture them you can
chastise them for not knowing that they
are in fact allowed to move from team to
team but maybe they should just try a
little harder or we could change our
behavior such that it's no longer a
question and as we started to actually
design this procedure for being able to
move from team to team one of the
concerns that came up was well you know
there's a couple of teams where like
everyone's going to leave the team so
why is that the managers really not very
good okay so what I'm just going to
reiterate what you just told me you as a
leader of this organization are telling
me that you know you have bad managers
and your solution to that is to force
people to stay on their team oh yeah
that's actually kind of a good point
okay and what happened when we actually
put this in place was there was a flurry
of change on the teams and then it
stabilized out none of you know none of
the teams were understaffed if they were
it wasn't for very long and it worked
out perfectly fine Spotify has a
slightly different model by the way if
you guys are still if you're still
talking about the Spotify model and you
think it's the white paper that they
wrote many years ago this is not what
they look like today because they have
grown they have scaled they have had to
change several times the Spotify model
actually is not squads chapters guilds
blahblahblah
the spotify model if anything is the way
that they continually
bearment internally with their
structures and you know adjust and adapt
as their context changes if you want to
follow a model follow that not some
static moment in time you know that
worked for them at a specific size in a
specific context but regardless even in
this kind of in this structure which is
one that most most most folks know they
allow for easy transfer between roles
within tribes there's knowledge share
across guilds which also leads sometimes
to changes across actual tribes
themselves so they actually have an
entire way of kind of moving people
around so in their concept the team is
static in terms of we have a group of
people that are responsible for this
thing but the team is not static in
terms of who is on that team
at any specific point in time right so
the responsibility States the team who's
on the team is in a relatively fluid
alright so if you actually want to redo
reteaming in your organization what do
you need to have in place and this is a
little is I think this is interesting
right so there are basically four
factors that lead to better team
performance and collective satisfaction
and these are the things I think any
leader needs to be focused on and those
are autonomy
connection excellence and diversity
right now how many of you familiar with
Daniel Pink's Drive right so he talked
about autonomy mastery and purpose right
and I and I like Pink's work I've read
almost all the same research papers that
he has in a few and several that I think
he probably hasn't drive autonomy
mastery purpose speaks specifically to
individual right you as an individual in
knowledge work in thought work what do
you need to be happy you need autonomy
mastery and purpose
autonomy connection excellence diversity
is what teams need so there is a
difference here right autonomy is about
being able to actually have influence
over your day-to-day work freedom to
choose how the work is done freedom to
choose what team you're on right
connection is connection to the purpose
and cause so what is it you know what's
the organization actually doing right
why are we here it's also connection to
one another so having empathy for other
members of your team it's about high
communication we look at Spotify right
and they had their guilds which is a way
of actually sharing knowledge across
chapters and tribes I introduced into
organization something we call interest
leagues it's a very similar concept
actually guilds and interest leagues we
were developing them at basically the
same time and Anders Iverson and I had
an opportunity to chat for quite a while
about like how they were working at
Spotify and how I was working at Groupon
and we both kind of made adjustments to
what we were doing based on each other's
learning so the concepts are very
similar excellence so this about
personal growth and quality work but
it's also about you know so the work
that we're actually producing and the
ability to actually see progress towards
both of those things in a lot of
organizations we don't measure things
like the quality of the code we don't
actually show people the return on
investment of the thing that they're
building right we might show some Vandy
metrics but excellence is about actually
getting the information you need to know
that you're doing your job well and then
diversity is probably the most important
one this is not diversity of visual
differentiators this is actually
diversity of thought it is the different
perspectives different experiences
different backgrounds different mindsets
different skill sets coming together
onto a single team that actually makes
the difference right now diversity of
thought is a hard thing to go after
because it's you can't see it touch it
or feel it it turns out
that if you are deliberate about hiring
for visual differentiators you will get
diversity of thought both in that when
you add people from different
backgrounds to a team you automatically
have diversity of thought but something
very interesting is a study that's been
done if you take a team of I'll say men
all of whom have very similar
backgrounds maybe they all went to the
same school they're all in the same
profession they've all worked for the
same company so these are really kind of
you know like clones of each other right
and you add to that team a woman who
comes from the same economic background
went to the same school has the same
career is basically the same except for
some very clear differentiators the men
on that team will automatically change
their behavior and they will think
differently because if they think she
thinks differently even if she doesn't
so the point only being that when we add
someone who doesn't look like us
to a team the team's behavior
automatically changes people start to
think differently all right so let's get
some reteaming patterns right so all
right so we've got autonomy connection
excellence diversity we know that we
actually want to read team because we
know the stable teams maybe they solve
the problem but hopefully that problem
doesn't exist anymore so what can we do
so there's a few of these that I'm going
to share with you there's an excellent
book that is being that is written by
Heidi Howland and she's still working on
some final touches of it but you can get
it on on epub on lene lene pub sorry
called dynamic reteaming where she has
studied a ton of organizations that are
doing this type of stuff and she's
actually come up with a bunch of
different patterns so first one
socialization the socialization pattern
is pretty pretty easy right here what
happens is a team adds a new member and
makes a concerted effort
actually on board them and get them get
them acclimated to the team so many
organizations what you see is there's an
onboarding process that is completely
separate from the actual work right it's
pretty general it's enough to like get
your user ID and show you where the wiki
is and maybe get your workstation set up
for general work but then when you join
your actual team there's all this new
stuff that you have to learn you just
kind of have to learn it through us
Moses because there's no process
socialization is an easy way to
basically say all right there's an
onboarding for this particular team all
right
it allows us to actually absorb people
more readily and in having that we are
now able to actually add people to the
team much more rapidly so this actually
fosters fluidity I can move from team to
team and know that I'm supported
actually onboarding to that team another
very common pattern that we see is
mitosis so what happens here we talked
about you know the the travel team right
and the way that was actually executed
at the time was oh we need to get into
travel so we'll take a couple of
Engineers you know a lead from this team
because we think she's really awesome
and we're going to take you know one of
the back-end folks from this team
because you know we think that he's got
the right kind of skills to do this and
then we're basically to hire up
everybody else we're going to make a
whole new team we're going to do a whole
new thing right that means that team has
to come together learn all about each
other learn the environment etc mitosis
what you do is you say okay we have an
existing team they have a socialization
capability so we're going to keep adding
members to that team until it just gets
a little bit too big and then we'll
split it into two teams we're not going
to decide how its split until the moment
of split comes and ideally what we're
going to do is we're going to allow that
team to self-select into the two into
the two new teams right what we've done
here is we're basically
we're extending the culture because
we've by adding people to a team they're
learning very quickly oh yeah okay this
is kind of how it works this is where
stuff is this is where I go for this ah
this person knows this they're kind of
my go-to for that so then when the team
actually splits you've got two healthy
high-functioning teams right out of the
gate and this is a really good way for
organizations to actually grow right
have teams that are basically your
incubators for launching new teams as
opposed to hire and hope right another
pattern that we see quite often with
reteaming is so many people don't think
about is reteaming but this it actually
is right is called a volunteer fire
department something comes up there's a
need once we solve this thing it's going
to go away people temporarily leaving
the team that they're on to create some
temporary task force take care of that
problem solve that issue run that spike
do those sets of experiments and then go
back to their regular teams so this
might be because there's a production
outage it might be because we are
investigating partnership with some with
some other company we need to like
really explore their api's and decide
we're actually want to do this or you
know whatever it might be right but just
having a team temporarily come together
and then disband once that need has been
solved another one that I like to see in
organizations is Trading Places here
what you're doing is you're actually
swapping team members for some period of
time right two teams
swap members for you know two weeks two
months whatever that might be we look at
some organizations now have this idea of
tours of duty so you are on some team
and your basic contract with that team
is for three months or six months at the
end of that time period you might move
to another team or you may reap with
this one
but you know every three months or every
six months you have an opportunity to
like make a switch Trading Places the
idea here is now we're actually sharing
knowledge back and forth across these
two teams right I'm going to spend a
little
times out of the team I'm going to
figure out you know I mean I'm gonna
learn about oh man you know actually the
way they do their stand-ups they don't
even ask the three questions that's
interesting they just look at the board
and they talk about the work that's in
front of them right now and it goes a
lot faster and their communication is
higher and they're collaborating more
and it actually takes less time so you
go back to your team and you tell them
about that cool thing the other team was
doing and maybe we should try this it's
a way of just getting knowledge shared
across the organizations I want to have
a little bit time for Q&amp;amp;A so we're
almost done here a friend of mine we
were talking about this and I think this
quote is actually in Heidi Helens book
as well but ngayon Hodja wallah and
talking about she said look man
reteaming is inevitable you might as
well get good at it
right the reality of it is for us it's
happening all the time and all of our
organizations either because it's forced
or because people are opting out you
know so new members are coming in it's
going to happen anyway let's just get
good at it and the thing for me maybe is
maybe if we really think about it we
realized the truth there is no team this
idea maybe in and of itself is
completely flawed that's it thank you
very much I hope this is helpful and
informative thoughts questions I think
we've got ten minutes maybe if so if we
suggest that people can move freely from
team to team who gets scared the company
gets scared sure sure but why right what
what about that scares them deadlines
they think they won't get met yeah sure
I mean but this is the same reason think
that they allocate people at 100% right
it's the same reason because they
because they may want to make sure the
deadline gets hit right and their act
it's actually counterproductive you're
right there are plenty of organizations
it would be that would be afraid of that
idea and it doesn't have to be a hundred
percent validity but it doesn't have to
be like valve right that's an exciting
it's an extreme end of things at Groupon
what we did was as a member of a team as
long as you were not
on a performance improvement plan which
was a rare occurrence there any way you
could move from team to team but there
was a process for it so one identifying
the team that you want to move to
talking to to them to make sure that
there's actually availability and
interest right so they have a slot they
need the help they want you on the team
and then talking with your manager and
that team's manager to create a schedule
so what we did all we really did was
people were always allowed to move the
challenge was you would go to your
manager and say I'm thinking I want to
move to the you know I think I want to
move to the live team I really like what
they're doing I think think I think
really the live sign use is a great
thing I want to move over there your
manager would go yeah now it's not a
good time
well what does that mean to you right
that's so when is a good time right
that's no that's not what the manager
means what the manager means is that
makes me feel a little uncomfortable I'm
not sure I want to talk about it what
you heard was nope and so then you leave
the company and the problem they were
trying to avoid happens anyway and you
know right so we moved the question from
if to when it was no longer a question
of if you could move yes you can
the question is when can you move and
that helped us solve that so it wasn't
just people going all over the place
right so it might be that you can't move
until this project has hit this deadline
now you may disagree with that you might
still have to leave the organization
we're at least having decent discussions
now and it helped quite a bit
right so that's not a common argument
right so become the argument basically
being there like hey you got this
company there's a couple of teams
they're doing really awesome stuff it's
very innovative you can see if they're
high-performing and there's other teams
that basically all they're doing is
maintenance and it's kind of boring
right and and if you allow for this
fluidity then everyone's going to leave
the maintenance teams that is a common
argument it turns out that when you
actually give people that kind of
autonomy that doesn't happen it doesn't
happen for a number of reasons there are
some people who look at it and go oh
crap if somebody doesn't do this
maintenance stuff we're all in trouble
and they will step up and they will take
the maintenance stuff and they will
actually find high personal value right
they will find intrinsic motivation in
knowing that they are the pillar for
this organization right so they're
people who actually step up because it's
intrinsically interesting to them there
are other people who wants that role
because there's other things going on in
their life right now you know your your
your parents have taken ill and they are
you know in in a home and you want to be
there for them in the morning and you
want to be there for them in the evening
and so the high paced innovative stuff
is just a little too much for you to
actually deal with right now again it's
kind of the same situation being able to
come in pull a ticket get it done that's
a great day right if I can actually like
when I close that laptop at 5:00 not
have to think about it again until I
come in the next day and whatever is in
front of me is new fresh and I know I
can do it in a single day that allows me
to do what else I need to do so just it
is it has worked out that those fears
I have yet to see it realized in
organizations and typically if there is
a mass exodus from one team to some
other area it's not about the work it's
about the leadership right maybe it's
about the way that work is being managed
or executed and if we switch that then
the problem would go away yeah yeah okay
so that's a good question right so as
you're going kind of going through this
what types of things do you actually
want to measure what do you want to look
at one of the things that that I've used
several times is doing employee
engagement surveys so micro surveys
usually trying to keep it to a handful
of questions no more than maybe like 12
to 15 questions and sending those out
one or two at a time so it's really
super easy to actually answer those and
what we're looking for is things like do
you know what is expected of you at work
do you feel like someone is actually you
know helping to move your career along
do you feel like your co-workers are
committed to doing quality work those
types of things right if we make
adjustments to the organization and we
see some of those things slide like
people don't feel as engaged the work or
don't feel as much you know like things
are going well that's certainly one
measure we want to look at obviously
another thing we want to be able to look
at is you know is the actual the actual
throughput of the organization how much
stuff is actually getting out is the
adoption rate of that work going up or
down so it depends on the size the
organization group on we were large
enough that we could actually run
multivariate testing and get to
statistical significance in a relatively
short period of time that is a whole
talk in and of itself a B and
multivariate testing and when are they
actually valid and when are they
actually misleading but we were able to
do that at Groupon and actually could
see that when we made certain types of
switches you know did we actually get
better uptake out of our performance or
out of our experiments or worse and kind
of you know so we actually see the
team's performance from engagement
satisfaction internal code quality
throughput in terms of lead time cycle
time and actual product quality in terms
of adoption in the market and growth
right so we had all of these measures
that we could look at and they're all
this kind of you know the levers are a
little complicated because everything is
is a is a trailing indicator right so
you adjust this and it might take weeks
before you see a change in the
measurement but those are all the kinds
of things that we were measuring and it
was definitely helpful yeah oh yeah yeah
so no that's actually a thing right so
the question is is there X we know what
do you do and when the team doesn't want
someone to join don't let them join I
mean I know that sounds harsh right but
that's you know there's there's a
balance between creating these kind of
micro cultures you know they become
highly insular right so you want to make
sure that you are adding you know
different people with different
perspectives different backgrounds to
those teams and keeping that you know
fresh right you don't want to get to
kind of a group thinks or a situation at
the same time if the grifted team has an
agreed set of standards that you know
that they hold themselves accountable to
and they have evidence or reason to
believe that this new team member is not
going to you know live up to that
standard if it's not someone that you
would hire don't hire them
right a lot of a lot of organizations
actually run internal job markets and
you are basically applying for that role
on that team and you may or may not get
it for any number of reasons and it
might actually be that that team feels
that your technical marks aren't aren't
you know aligned with what they hold as
a standard even though
organization as a whole did in fact hire
you so yeah I would say if you know if
there's a reason the team doesn't want
the person on the team then it shouldn't
happen and it doesn't have to be you
know
rudl by any means right it can be just
an honest conversation so I think we're
right at 10 o'clock I will be around for
the rest of day I'm glad to chat with
folks about this or other things
software and team related again thanks
