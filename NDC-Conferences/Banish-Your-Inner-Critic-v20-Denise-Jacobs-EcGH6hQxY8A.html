going to start with people are uncommon
I thank you for coming I appreciate you
taking choosing this out of all of the
million billion choices that you have at
this conference so thank you for coming
I hope I make it worthwhile for you at
the very least I have presence at the
end so so there's that I would like to
talk about pretty much my favorite topic
right now which is the inner critic and
it's such a favorite topic that I
actually wrote a book about it which
just came out last week whoa thank you
thank you very much so
I did do a talk on banishing your inner
critic in 2014 but if anybody happened
to have been at that talk just know that
I'm actually not going to really talk
about anything that I talked about that
in that talk and I'm going to talk about
new stuff that I talked about in the
book so yeah so let's get started
I'm Denise Jacobs I am a speaker
obviously an author obviously again and
I also started a company called the
creative dose which is a creativity
consultancy where I go into companies
and I give talks and also lead trainings
to help people unblock their creativity
so they can start to do their best work
and also work better together if you're
tweeting which I hope you do my twitter
handle is Denise Jacobs you know the
Twitter handle for the conference and
the hashtag and then the hash tag that
I've made for the presentation and for
the book is by inner critic so you can
use that so I want to start off kind of
talking about why even bother banishing
the inner critic like what's the point
so the problem with the inner critic is
that it kind of makes us limited it
actually keeps us
smaller and in place and to kind of
illustrate how the inner critic shows up
in your life I'm going to share three
stories from my own life and kind of the
interpretations that I made from them
and then how that affected me later on
so when I was 12 years old
I went to a summer camp with my best
friend Emily there we are at summer camp
and in the summer camp you know you have
multiple activities and things like that
that you have to do and one time we were
doing an arts and crafts activity
activity and we ended up I ended up
drawing a picture of a mermaid
when I was 12 so I was super happy with
this picture I was just like oh yes oh
Emily by the way as a little bit of an
impasse of information my friend Emily
was really really into comics and she
was really into the x-men and she also
drew as well and she would draw these
kind of superhero type like people and
type women and so you know I would just
kind of copied her and so I drew this
mermaid and I was super psyched about it
and then I mind on business I'm about to
show it to Emily who's sitting next to
me and this heifer who's in the in our
group comes up to the table completely
uninvited comes up stands over my
shoulder looks at it and goes it looks
like a frog and I was like okay this was
what I was like inside but I didn't do
this because I didn't have like I didn't
have my chops back then but what I wish
I had done was been like oh really fish
what but unfortunately I was 12 and yeah
I'm from a small college town like we
didn't have like tough people and have
tough people to like learn from so
instead of being like oh really bitch
which I wish I had done I was kind of
more like I was more like this inside
like she could yeah I I thought I could
draw
and so from that experience even though
it was completely unprovoked and you
know there's a lot of people who are
adults who can't draw that kind of thing
so I'm kind of like I was doing okay for
a twelve-year-old right but even still
the thought that I had was maybe I'm not
as good at drawing as I thought it was
then let's move forward a little bit in
time to where I'm about thirteen or
fourteen so for the people who are far
away and can't tell I am 6 1 and
imperial measurement and 185 centimeters
in metric I'm a very tall woman and I
was always very tall I grew very early
and so when I was 13 I was 511 about two
inches shorter than I am now and so I
had played basketball earlier in my
childhood and then fell out with some of
the girls on the basketball team decided
wasn't going to play waited a couple of
years and then all the girls on the team
were like you need to play with us again
you would be so good it'll be so great
okay I said okay fine so I decided to go
ahead and play basketball there was just
one problem I wasn't very good as a
matter of fact I was just so so
everybody else had played for an
additional two years they had built up
their skill I hadn't so what do you
think the expectation is for a tall
black girl playing basketball exactly
and I wasn't that person and so what did
I do during the games
I hid I was absolutely terrified to go
and play on the floor my coach in fact
would call me and Scioscia my coach
would be at the end of us at the end of
bench like this and she would lean down
and she go Denise
and I would be like this and I'd get up
and I'd be like Miss canine I'm not
ready I'm so not ready I put me in at
the end of the game I'll I'll be ready
then and I would beg and plead and
control her to not play me in the games
why because I was so afraid of being
judged I was tall I was kind of like
gangly I had really long arms and really
long legs and kind of was like round in
the middle and I was certain that people
would either judge me for not being a
good a basketball player as they
expected me to be or they would judge me
for being like a tall awkward gangly
young woman I was like I'm not here for
that
I hid so that's what also happened and
then moving forward a little bit longer
in time to when I'm 24 ten years later a
lot of things happen in ten years I
graduated from University of Washington
my parents came to my graduation and I
was having a conversation with my father
and he was up what do you what do you
think you want to do after you graduate
and I was like well I don't know what I
think I might like to be a writer
now there's backstory to this I had done
a very competitive program and
International Studies where writing was
a really strong requirement I had had
professors take me aside and say you're
a really good writer I had one professor
say you're such a good writer I want you
to come and actually tutor other people
at the Writing Center okay and then I
had another one who said to me later on
actually much later after the fact said
to me I thought you were going to be a
professor of political science so my
thinking that it might be a writer
beside the fact that I liked it was not
completely unfounded but my father being
my father was trying to protect me
and he said this to me do you know how
hard it is to get published
now let me say a couple of things about
my dad my dad was no joke okay my father
was the first person in his family to
graduate from college he got a degree in
aeronautical engineering
he built experimental aircraft for fun I
grew up with an airplane fuselage in the
garage instead of a car literally he
also decided to go back to school
because he didn't want to work for
anybody else and get his doctor doctor
of Optometry degree and became an
optometrist my father was not a person
who sat around and talked about how the
man kept him down or anything like that
and said talked about how there's
limitations all the time right that was
not my father he broke through barriers
so much in his own life and yet despite
that my father still played into the
belief the cultural belief that artists
starve right that creativity is
something that you do for fun in your
free time and not as a job and that very
few writers get published and I took his
information to heart I was very it you
know insecure was unsure about my future
and I took his information to heart and
started to believe getting published is
really hard I should just forget about
being a writer all of these things add
up right all of these pieces of
information that we get from people all
of this misinformation comes together
adds up and kind of multiplies and
becomes the inner critic the problem is
is that in order for us to be creative
we need to silence the inner critic and
so I'm going to talk about that a little
bit
I feel like creativity is actually a
source of power so like I was saying
these negative things that we've heard
plus the fears that we have about
ourselves right the fears that we kind
of have and then somebody says some
and it triggers that fear and then we go
oh that fear is true and then we make it
true right all of that ends up equaling
the inner critic and the inner critic is
actually helped by a couple of other
psychological pieces something called
negativity bias and also something
called fear conditioning so negativity
bias by the ways anybody here afraid of
snakes that looks like a no I got a
couple of people like a few people okay
I was trying to figure out what to use
for a negativity bias but so negativity
bias is basically the brain natural
ability to scan for danger right so
thousands of years ago we were when we
were hunters and hunter and gatherers we
actually had to scan for dangerous
dangerous take came out of the bushes
somewhere where we were gathering food
you were going to actually really glom
on mentally to the fact that you saw a
snake in that area and if you saw
something beautiful in the same area you
saw a beautiful bird or you saw a
butterfly or something like that your
brain would be like that's nice but that
snake right and that's that piece of
information would go into a piece of
your brain because of something called
fear conditioning would go into a part
of your brain go into something called
implicit memory which is this memory
that you use automatically right it's
the memory that basis the basis of
habits so that you know that when you go
back to that area that you need to be
aware that there's potential danger that
there's snakes you won't be running
around going I hope I see another
butterfly you'll be like I want to make
sure there's no snakes right that's
negativity bias and fear conditioning so
like I said it goes into implicit memory
goes into this place in our brains that
says okay this is something that I'm
just not going to have to think about
that much I know it's there it's
important and it also largely affects
our subconscious but the problem is is
that sort of thing if you hear a
criticism from somebody if you feel
judged by somebody or something like
that
that
also we'll go into the implicit memory
those things that thing that little I'm
telling you about it that was like forty
years ago that little half of that
little bitch is still in my head right
by saying that now I know I can actually
draw it's okay she was just having a
moment bless her heart but it's still
there and it goes into those past
conscious memory goes into subconscious
thinking and then it affects our habits
and behaviors and really in my mind more
important most importantly that's what
ends up blocking our creativity
like I said creativity is power how many
of you guys have been in a flow state
like a serious deep flow state what did
it feel like when you were in the flow
State great okay be more specific more
tell me more bliss what else fast what
else you guys all you guys raise your
hands so you can say something yeah time
flew by absolutely what else
empowered yes what else anything else
productive right empowered time flew by
bliss productive right if that's not
palette that's not tapping into a source
of power I don't know what is right and
I feel like being creative and being
able to get into that creative flow
state is one of the easiest ways that we
can tap into our own personal power the
problem is is that when we start to
succumb to the inner critic we end up
giving our power away right that power
that ability that capacity that access
we end up like relinquishing it for
these awful ideas that aren't even true
because let's take think about it this
chick Heather at school my mermaid did
not look like a frog it looked like a
mermaid she might have been jealous that
she couldn't draw like that I don't know
why she did it
truth is that I ended up actually
playing basketball tell you about it
later
and then the other thing is is that
obviously it's not that hard to get
published because it was I would
be published right now right so the good
news is so that's the bad news the good
news is that we have mental power tools
that we came with out of the box
we've got capacities mental capacities
that we can use to actually counter the
inner critic now this is the part
actually of the book that I felt the
most excited about because for a long
time I would talk about all of these
things to banish the inner critic and I
didn't actually know why it worked I'm
just telling you guys now because we're
friends I didn't actually know why it
worked but then when I started doing
research for this book I started to
understand why it works and why actually
some of this stuff is really powerful
for one there's neuroplasticity our
brains have the capacity to change over
time continuously throughout our life as
long as we give it the proper stimulus
so neuroplasticity is actually driven by
attention whatever you put your
attention on that is what your brain is
going to like expand upon that's what
your brain is going to put resources
towards that's what it's going to build
neurons and neuronal connections with
and that's what is actually going to
make your brain expand or contract so if
you spend a lot of time with your inner
critic leading the show and it telling
you you can't do this you don't know
enough of that why can't you
you should have etc then that part of
your grain is going to get stronger and
stronger and stronger whereas if you
start focusing on other things every
time you're aware that you're doing that
you say okay and you focus someplace
else then you will actually start to
that part of your brain will actually
start to it's actually they have this
something called synaptic pruning that
your brain will actually go through and
start like those connections won't be as
strong and they'll get replaced by other
ones that are stronger pretty cool I
think the other tool that we have is
mindfulness so being mindful basically
means just being aware right paying
attention being more aware of your
thoughts and then again making a
deliberate choice and saying
I'm thinking these thoughts but I'm
actually going to choose to think other
ones now there's something called stop
stopping stop stopping doesn't work when
you say to yourself I'm not going to
think that what happens when you're not
going to think that don't think about a
pink elephant don't don't think about it
don't think about a pink elephant I
forbid you to think about a pink
elephant what are you thinking about
exactly that's why I thought stopping
doesn't work but if you say okay I could
think about a pink elephant but I'd
rather think about a blue one all of a
sudden you're not thinking about a pink
elephant you're thinking about a blue
elephant because you made a choice right
so mindfulness is about being aware of
what you're thinking and deciding to do
something else if needs be and then the
other power tool that we have is self
compassion so self compassion is
actually really a lot more powerful than
people think they think it's like oh
well you just have to like you know
think nice thoughts actually one of the
kind of tenants of self compassion
there's a really great book by an author
named Kristin Neff who wrote the book on
self compassion but self compassion
actually has a like a large kind of
litany of attributes and things that it
helps it helps with grit it helps with
resiliency it actually helps you be
happier but self compassion basically
kind of boils down to first recognizing
that you're suffering like that for
example in the case of the inner critic
that thinking these thoughts is really
unpleasant and it doesn't feel good and
then also basically treating yourself
with the same kind of care and
compassion that you would somebody else
who is actually suffering or hurting so
I called this a self compassion template
if you think about if somebody who was a
friend was just like oh my god I am
having the worst day I'm just and then
they just start running down all of
these awful things about themselves I'm
such a loser I did this I messed up on
that and read a lot and what would you
probably do you'll probably be like whoa
whoa wait why are you beating up on
yourself you're fine you're
okay look you did this you did this and
you did this you're fine right but when
it comes to ourselves what do we do oh
my god you're such a loser and you don't
know enough any of that and you need to
do this and you need to do that right
and there's nobody there to come in and
run interference and provide a do an
intervention so self compassion is doing
that same thing for yourself so the
other thing that you can do so you've
got neuroplasticity on your side you
know that if you pay attention to some
one thing over another that it will
change what your brain does right
mindfulness same kind of thing that you
have the choice the option to choose one
thought over another one right and then
self compassion you also have the option
to be kinder to yourself to be nicer to
yourself the same way that you would
with somebody else who was in a hard
position who's suffering who's not
feeling well who's being mean to
themselves right another thing that you
can do with the inner critic is you need
to recognize the inner critical voice so
I gave you examples of it but have an
exercise you don't have to do it now
there's just something for you to look
at but if you're kind of like I don't
really have an inner critic I've
actually I actually had a friend this
kind of cracks me up every time I think
about I have a friend who is from
Switzerland she spent a lot of time in
the UK getting a degree in midwifery and
now she is in Africa in villages like
helping women being the Midwife for the
village which is amazing right she's
amazing she sent me an email and she
said hi Denise I don't have an inner
critic I'm not going to buy your book I
was like okay that's my thing I'm not
saying everybody needs to buy it but
it's just funny that she says that way
so some people don't have an inner
critic I get it totally fine I admire
you and I want to learn at your feet but
for the rest of us who don't who do have
it if you're not familiar with it what
it is if it's so sublimated and so
subtle and so persistent that it's just
like it's just it's Tuesday it's like
you're not even notice
that it's there then here's a nice
framework for you some mad libs that you
can use to try to get to what your inner
critical voice things like and you can
just fill it in you could just keep
writing them over and over again if I
for example go and play basketball in a
game then people will judge me right if
I'm not smart I'm not smart enough right
or I'm not talented enough I don't know
enough I can't be a writer because being
getting published is hard right etc so
you can go through these these mad libs
and fill them in and you can start to
like actually get at what some of your
mistaken beliefs are so the MIT inner
critic what I discovered so I do this
exercise where we add we do this
exercise where I give everybody a piece
of paper give them a pen have them write
down on a piece of paper their main fear
around creativity crumble it up in a
ball throw it across the room people on
the other side of the room pick up a
thing look at it and then everybody
starts to see that everybody's got the
same kind of same kind of issues so
through that I determine that there are
multiple ways that the inner critic
shows up so I'm going to talk about a
few of them today today I'm going to
talk about something that I call
creativity denial when people say oh my
god I'm totally not creative I'm
analytical and logical or whatever to
that I say hooey who is a technical term
thank you like three Americans over here
like oh my gosh hilarious thank you guys
so creativity denial something I call
creativity denial something that I also
called judgment dread fear of being
judged and criticized also something
that I call deficiency anxiety fear that
you don't know enough that you aren't
good enough that you're not talented
enough etc I also identified something
called comparision syndrome where you're
constantly in the process of comparing
yourself to other people that you can't
see what you actually have to author and
what you have that's valuable and
then finally I think that's actually it
so five different ones so let's talk
about creativity denial first so I
actually usually talk about this last
but because I'm here at this conference
that is a developer conference I thought
let's just cut to the chase and like get
to this let's just get this one out of
the way how many of you feel like you're
creative okay that's a good good showing
excellent for those of you who don't
feel that you're creative
here's the thing there's a great quote
from Bruce Nussbaum who wrote a book
called creative intelligence and what he
says is that creativity is all about
seeing patterns and making connections
and so I feel like especially developers
are particularly talented at that not
only that but I also feel like
developers basically do magic right
somebody tells you I want this thing to
happen I want it to look like this and I
want it when this happens I want that to
happen and you go OK and you sit down
and you start writing code to make that
thing happen what that's crazy that's
super creative so I invite you if you
don't think you're creative to start
reconsidering that and just also just
give yourself permission and fucking own
it right so actually in the book I have
a download for a creativity permission
slip if you want a creativity permission
slip if you just feel like I just need
somebody else to tell me that I'm
creative like I kind of think so but I
need somebody authoritative dÃ©tente
will then look I have this you can tell
yourself I give you permission go forth
and be creative be your badass selves ok
number two remember that words have
power so there's something that I call
imposition mentality and that is a lot
of times people talk about this
the time oh my god I'm so slammed oh my
god I totally have to do this oh my god
I need to do this it always starts with
oh my god but seriously this is what
this is the language that we use all the
time now but there's a book called the
now habit by Neil Fiore and he says in
this book that when you use that kind of
language
it is this imposed upon victim mentality
right so when you do that start to
remember how powerful words are and so
to be able to shift out of imposition
mentality I recommend being very very
thoughtful about your words when you
have a situation where you say something
like I have to you can say I choose to
or I will right if you say I should you
can say I'm going to write take away
words like should ought must have to
those all make it sound like this is
imposed upon you but it is your life you
can switch how you can reframe how you
work with stuff and you can actually
choose to do stuff and you can actually
show up like you may not like to do it
right I'm not saying that you're going
to enjoy it but I am saying that you you
can actually realize that you do have a
choice in this and that you can choose
it you're going to have to do it anyway
so choose to do it if you're suffering
from what I call creativity misgivings
where you feel like creativity yes kind
of sometimes can't count on it don't
have enough good ideas then this is what
I recommend I recommend doing something
that James Altucher talks about which is
to become an idea machine and that is to
try to basically work to have 10 ideas a
day to start carrying around a notebook
and to start noting down 10 ideas for
things so it could be like a bug list
things that just bug you it could be in
something that you use it could be in
software it could be a practical thing
just something that bugs you where
you're just like ah I wish it was like
this and then you can just start writing
ideas of what it could be like right you
can also try to come up with the worst
idea that you can come up with you can
also do ideas within a theme like all
things that have to do with water all
things that have to do with the
environment all things that have to do
with my house whatever you can do this
and you can do that he also says that if
you are having feeling like you're
having problems coming up with 10 then
push yourself to come up with 15 the
goal is not to have good ideas the goal
is to have ideas period and when you
start doing this and you start doing
this habitually you'll start to see that
ideas come to you more easily it's more
it's like a habit it's like a muscle
that you end up building so that is
creativity denial let is talk about
something that I call judgment dread now
some of this stuff like I said it's
really deep I was suffering from it
tremendously when I was 13 and 14 part
of what ends up happening is something
called or that ends up influencing it is
something called confirmation bias you
guys know what confirmation bias is yeah
tell me no he was like okay was like
that he's like that's all I can commit
to okay yes exactly so it's when I'm in
a paraphrase but thank you that's
awesome so it's when basically you have
a set belief on something and then you
basically look for confirmation of that
outside of you in the world so for
example if you feel like people don't
like you or if you feel like you don't
know how to touch to talk to people or
you're not you know comfortable in
crowds then anytime somebody does
something that confirms that you're
going to be like ah see it's true
whereas there might have been somebody
who was really nice to either
have been somebody who was smiling at
you when you were walking by you didn't
notice because you thought well people
don't like me right that's confirmation
bias so the problem with the inner
critic is that if you have this set
belief this is going to be hard I can't
do this I don't know enough of this
people don't trust my expertise or
whatever then you are going to look
around and you're going to find
confirmation of that around you one
thing that's really important with the
fear of being judged is that people
again think they're being judged and so
something that's a really good counter
to that have you guys heard of a kudos
pile is anybody heard of a kudos file
I feel like Bob needs probably has no
yes okay so kudos file is basically when
anytime you get some kind of positive
feedback you get a really nice something
from your manager from a co-worker in
your email somebody sends you a
thank-you note you get a tweet on a blog
posts that you posted and they're like
oh my god I love this blog post totally
changed my life
whatever it is you start gathering those
up and whenever you're having a down
moment where your inner critic as if I
saw that about out of that you just go
into your kudos file where you've chose
you saved all of this stuff or people
say that you're great and you just look
through it just to remind yourself okay
okay I'm actually I'm alright I'm okay
right it's a really actually a helpful
tool I've seen it recommended in a lot
of places another thing to do for
judgment a lot of times when people are
afraid of being judged like in my
example for for for example then people
start trying to hide you start hiding
yourself you start toning yourself down
you stop sharing things that could
actually be valuable for other people my
recommendation stop hiding in plain
sight and one of the ways you can do
that is by knowing how you're unique is
what I call your uniqueness advantage
thank you for laughing at that I really
appreciate it
I was like somebody's going to like the
Unicorn the cat riding a unicorn
oh so know your uniqueness you've an
advantage there is nobody on the planet
who is like you nobody's had your
experiences nobody has your knowledge
nobody has the unique combination of
talents and skills that you have no body
there is nobody who can do exactly what
you can do period that's just the facts
so instead of trying to hide because
you're afraid that people are being are
going to judge you it's actually to your
advantage to start letting out the ways
that you are the only person who can be
you right the only things that you can
do the things that you do amazingly to
start actually letting that out and
sharing that with the world
dealing with criticism is hard okay
I'm saying that it is hard but I'm also
saying that it's a really important
skill to have I would like to tell you a
story that is actually relevant to this
so several years back when my early 20s
I was met this guy who was a waiter at a
restaurant that I worked at that I that
I went to a that regularly and I was
just like totally taken with him he was
like tall and he was funny and he had to
totally querque sense of humor and so we
met up one night totally felt like a
date I was like all yeah it's on and
then I had this really cool experience
that I wanted to share with them and I
called him a couple of days later after
the date and I was like oh my god Jim
this thing happened and I was going on
and on and on I was talking about it and
finally when I was done I was like hey
what are you I mean what do you think
are you there and he was just like you
just went on and on and on and I was
like what and he's like you're just
talking so much it was like it was the
Denise show and I was like what and I
was totally gobsmacked I was like what I
thought we were I knew and we were tried
okay never mind so suffice it to say I
did not talk to him
after that and it weighed on my mind
after I was like do I really talk like
that me just do I not pay attention to
people do I just run on and on about
myself well you know what maybe I do but
guess what it turns out that that is
actually one of my talents I love
speaking obviously I love having an
audience and I love telling stories he
hit upon a grain of truth but he hit
upon a grain of truth that was actually
insight into something that was actually
valuable in something that was I think
is a positive thing about me so when
people tell you criticism it's really
important to be open and be curious
about what they're saying one of the
things that you can do is you can take
notes if you're getting feedback from a
manager or somebody else that you work
with or something for example start
taking notes so that you are detached
from what they're saying you're not
reacting to it you're just getting
information ask them questions about it
ask them for more information ask them
for recommendations what do you think I
could do to improve this right and then
the other thing that's really helpful to
have an attitude that you're when you're
doing this you're actually saving time
you're actually learning without having
to learn like the hard way you're
getting information you're getting
feedback some of its going to be
valuable some of it's going to be
completely crap and it doesn't have
anything to do with you would have to do
with them
but if you can take go through this
process have a little bit of a
detachment you can get the pearls of the
information and it may be helpful it may
be insight to something that can help
you be even better at who you are then
than what you already are so let's move
on to high self-criticism so one of the
things that happens one of the things
that we get kind of trapped in is
something called rumination do you guys
know what rumination is yes okay I heard
it yes that's good enough for me so for
the people who don't know what
rumination is it's much like if the
llama chewing it's not chewing I'm like
how do I
selamat achoo there we go
Sobel Emma that's ruminating okay but
that's basically what we do that's this
is the thing that we have in common with
antelopes cows and llamas is that humans
also ruminate but we don't ruminate with
our food we ruminate with our thoughts
and so if you've ever had a situation
where your thoughts are cycling and
you're just going back and forth back
over the same thought over and over
again especially a negative one right oh
my god I should have done so and so I
can't believe I didn't do that why
didn't I do someone so I can't believe I
did do it that about over and over and
over and it won't stop you are
ruminating okay so a lot of times
ruminating doesn't feel like something
that you can stop but there actually is
a really cool hack that you can use to
stop rumination and that is taking a
squeeze ball in your non-dominant hand
and squeezing it so what it does is it
forces your brain because your brain
it's your non-dominant hand it forces
your brain to use a part that it doesn't
normally use and it switches you out of
rumination because you're trying to do
this this movement that you're not used
to doing crazy but true right so if
you're right-handed and you're
ruminating squeeze the squeeze ball with
your right left hand if you're
left-handed and you're ruminating
squeeze it with your right hand after a
few minutes you should actually be
kicked out of the cycle and you can go
on and do what you want to be doing cool
right oh I'm trying to give you guys
stuff that you can like take home and
use like immediately
another thing with high self-criticism
so high self-criticism is basically like
when you're just constantly in the phase
of always like nothing you ever do is
ever good enough in a nova everybody
else is like it's you're totally fine
like this was great here like no no no
it should have been this and it should
have been that and I should have known
better and I and that's how you work all
the time as matter of fact I have a
friend who I've had to try to coach her
out of it you shall call and she'll be
like I'm so sorry I haven't called and
so long I'm be like it's okay should be
like I'm such a bad friend I should be I
should do sewing somewhere often I was
like no she's like I'm not I'm a bad
daughter because I don't talk to my
parents enough I was like really it's
really okay can you stop stop right high
self-criticism
so it's self-taught gone awry so here's
the interesting thing about self talk at
least I think it's interesting so we
learn talking to ourselves is actually
part of the cognition process is
actually thought of actually thought of
as a subset of thinking the thing is is
that a lot of times with self-talk we
have learned it from our parents or
we've learned it from caregivers so how
many of you guys have kids okay so have
you seen and even if you haven't seen
kids have you've seen kids for example
like maybe like you've gone to pick up
your kids at daycare or school or
something like that and you see a kid
off playing with itself and then the kid
goes ah you're so stupid why did you do
that
you're like oh my god what just happened
that child learned that language from a
caretaker very interesting stuff makes
you kind of think twice about what
you're doing and so a lot of the
self-talk that we have is stuff that we
actually learned it's not something that
we just you know we weren't born like
calling ourselves stupid right we
learned that from someplace
it's self-talk high self-criticism in my
mind is self-talk gone awry but the nice
thing is is that we can actually reboot
our self-talk so this is a technique
that's used a lot by athletes and like
high-performance people is that they
have changed how they self do self-talk
the first thing that they do is they
don't say I they refer to themselves in
the third person so for example LeBron
James before a game I'll be like okay
LeBron this is what you're going to do
you're going to do so and you're going
to go you're going to go in hard you're
going to go for the basket
you're going to get 50 points that's
what you're going to do he doesn't say
that's what I'm going to do he distances
himself as and he's talking to himself
as if
coach would be talking to him a very
supportive coach right deep and so when
you need to bolster yourself when you
need to pump yourself up don't try to do
it by saying I do it by saying you and
using your name
okay Scott this is what you're going to
do you're going to go into this meeting
you're going to present this stuff it's
going to be great you're going to say
all the stuff that you need to remember
to say you're going to be fine it
actually really helps there's actually a
whole range of studies that have shown
that for example I think it was students
at I think was Harvard or high Ivy
League school basically we're told to
like do this this self-talk before they
took a test and they actually did better
on the test before afterwards than the
control group that was either told to be
to talk to themselves with I or not say
anything at all so really really cool
another thing you can do is to program
your mind so here's another cool thing
so kind of like the like the the squeeze
ball hand squeeze thing you can actually
use gesture and movements to change how
you think so
for the people who came to my speaking
workshop the other day we did the power
pose but this actually goes beyond the
power pose there's a woman at the
University of Chicago who does a lot of
research with gesture and language and
knowledge and learning especially with
children and what she found is is that
when you teach children math and you
teach it with a hand gesture they will
learn things faster and they will learn
the the computations faster it's pretty
amazing so if you are on a board for
example and you tell them when they
subtract to do this or to add when they
do to do this they will get it better
than if you just have them stand still
crazy so you can reprogram I reprogram
your mind with your hands very cool
if you're having a lot of high critical
critical high yes self-talk critical
self-talk what you can do is you can use
a gesture that we're all incredibly
familiar with which is the swipe left
right so everybody knows tinder
hot-or-not delete whatever it is you all
know swiping left means delete it that
is built into every that as part of the
lexicon now swipe left swipe left swipe
left so if you're thinking of really
negative thought about yourself you'd be
like oh my god you're so bad it's on so
you'd be like delete and say delete and
swipe left you can also do this and push
it away nope don't want it nope keep
going right anything that is a gesture
that means no don't want it go away
we'll help the other thing that you can
do is you can actually then follow it up
with something positive and do another
gesture to anchor that so you can be
like oh my god you're so bad at
so-and-so you'd be like delete and then
you'd be like actually I'm quite good at
you know coming up with ideas and like
anchor it to yourself with another
gesture so you can actually start to
reprogram how you think with that to
move on to deficiency anxieties because
we've only got 20 more minutes so
deficiency anxiety is really all around
not enough not enough miss
good enough not knowing enough not
having learned enough not having done
enough not expert enough etc etc etc you
get the idea here is the really
interesting thing about this and this is
true with everything with the inner
critic just because you're thinking
something doesn't mean it's true
you're like wait a minute
back up put a pin in it just because
you're thinking something does not mean
it's true it just means you're thinking
that right we think all kinds of things
that are
patently untrue and yet we take them as
truth and we act upon them your thoughts
aren't true so one of the things that
you can do to counter deficiency anxiety
feeling that you're not enough and you
don't know of enough etc is to think
like a scientist and to have kind of a
scientific inquiry so this is also kind
of a mindful approach in some ways right
is to actually say okay I'm thinking
that thought is that thought true and to
actually reframe so you think oh my god
I'm so bad at talking to new people and
then you can actually try to reframe it
and say am I really bad at talking to
new people and then you can start to
think that actually will shift your
brain into thinking into at different
things
confirmation bias starting to look for
instances that prove that actually bring
that into question and you were like
well actually no I was I was on the bus
that one day and I started talking to
the man who was sitting next to me was
very nice we had a nice conversation and
they're like oh there was that other
time and then you start to find things
that actually refute it so you can use
that model where you think I am blah and
then you follow it up immediately with a
my blah and then you go through and you
think about it and you can even make a
rubric where you have a thought that is
probably untrue and or a situation that
happened the son 3 true thought and then
the thought that's actually probably
closer to the truth right you just came
out of a meeting and you thought nobody
liked any of the ideas that I had and
then you think well actually I was
talking to Jim afterwards and he said
that that one idea was really good okay
that's actually not patently true then
right think like a scientist also
there's something that I've called kind
of a subset of deficiency anxiety which
I call proficiency anxiety where people
feel like again they're not good enough
they don't know enough etc so in order
to build mastery there's something
that's called deliberate practice
you guys heard of deliberate practice
where is like nope great
I'm like telling you all kinds of new
things then so deliberate practice is
something that again like athletes and
things like that so as any everybody's
heard of the 10,000 hour rule right in
order to be a master at something you
need to do 10,000 hours actually that's
not true
unless you're trying to achieve this
high level of mastery like being a chess
grandmaster
or being like the next Tiger Woods did
anybody see the pictures of him for the
drunk driving it's kind of sad actually
god bless him yes so so you don't want
to be the Tiger Woods drunk driving you
want to be the Tiger Woods he's a badass
he's like winning everything
or the next Serena Williams even more
telling one Australian open 20 weeks
pregnant
what okay anyway Syrena so unless you're
trying to get to that level of mastery
you don't need to do 10,000 hours you
can do it with much less but what you do
need to do is you do need to use
deliberate practice so what people who
are musicians etc do is they practice up
to the point of failure they practice up
to the point of where it's hard they
practice the hard thing and then they do
it over and over again they practice up
to the point of failure and then they
keep going to that point until they get
over that and then they get to another
level of failure does that make sense
more or less yes so deliberate practice
is something that you can use if you are
like totally stumped on something get in
there and try to like figure it out try
to unravel it and if you can unravel it
put it aside come back later try to
unravel it again I assure you the more
and more you do it on the more you do
stuff that's peripherally around it then
you will get to the thing and you'll be
able to like move past that point
another thing that people suffer from
with deficiency anxiety is something
that I call originality anxiety I've
talked a lot at designer conferences and
stuff like that and
the things that people seem to be very
very concerned with is that what they do
isn't original they're like I'm a one
idea Wonder I'm just a copycat
everything that I've done has been done
before well guess what yeah
there's nothing new Under the Sun or
there's nothing not that new but so I
feel like we can take that and can we
use that you know Pablo Picasso says
that good artists creating great artists
steal
so steal like an artist and get your
remix on has anybody seen the talk
everything is a remix by Ferguson Kirby
Ferguson yeah
I highly recommend it he talks about
creativity and how all kinds of things
are actually derivatives of other things
and that's okay things don't have to be
amazingly crazily original you can do
something that's a derivative of
something else and again like I said
because there's nobody else like you in
the world your interpretation of
whatever that thing is is going to be
different right so still like get to the
point where you're get yourself
comfortable like I'm just going to I'm
just going to do like a lot of times
I'll do something I'll be like you know
what I'm going to do the easy thing and
then I'm going to build on it later
because it's not going to be amazing and
perfect and original and creative out of
the box maybe but at least you have a
starting point right another form of the
inner critic is something that I call
comparison syndrome and by the way fYI
these are crumpled up paper pieces of
paper are things that I got from actual
people these are from talks that I've
done workshops that I've done where
people wrote down those fears about
creativity threw it across the room I've
gathered them all and use them as data
points and these are from actual people
this is what actual people have said so
I'm not making this stuff up so
comparison syndrome comparing yourself
to others so the problem with comparison
syndrome as I see it is that we aren't
seeing ourselves clearly we're so
focused on what the other people are
doing or what the other persons are
doing that we can't see what we have
offer and we kind of get lost in the
sauce so it doesn't help that we live in
this like social media era right where
everybody's like posting everything to
Instagram and Facebook and it's like
selfies gone bad gone wrong and like has
anybody seen on Instagram like every now
and then you come across one of those
accounts where like it's just somebody
posting selfies all the time and then
they try to say something philosophical
and long underneath it and I'm like you
just posted a picture of yourself and
then you're talking about
and then I just want to get to like a
higher place and start to manifest and
you're just like you just posted a
picture of yourself like really like
okay and then they're like I've got
5,000 followers posting pictures of
myself nothing but pictures of myself
like god bless you okay but so we don't
see ourselves clearly because we're
inundated with all of this stuff but
there have been studies that show that
when people share information even when
they're just talking they tend not to
share the negative information they will
only share what they perceive as
positive so even when you're talking to
people who are just normal people in
your life you are not going to be
getting a fair representation of what's
actually going on in their lives and
what's actually a problematic and so
then we end up comparing ourselves to
other people to things that actually
aren't even real so my recommendation is
to know what throws you off is it
Instagram is a snapchat is it Facebook
is a Twitter is it magazines is it you
know this is a 40 under 40 on
entrepreneurial machine is it like who's
on the cover of Wired like what is it
that triggers you to get you into this
downward spiral of comparing yourself to
others and finding yourself lacking my
recommendation is to do a social media
or a media detox for a certain amount of
time so to give yourself permission to
not have to or not give yourself
permission but to actually make it a
mandate I'm not going to check Facebook
or whatever the thing is I'm not going
to read the newspaper I'm not going to
read Wired magazine whatever it is that
is that trigger
that puts you into that place I did this
a few years ago and I stopped reading my
Twitter feed I would only read direct
messages and note notifications like
mentions and I won't read my Twitter
feed because I would just go into a
tizzy when people are like I'm speaking
at so-and-so conference I got this book
deal I'm going to be on so-and-so and I
was like I can't I can't I can't I can't
and I just stopped and it was like so
freeing because it was like my brain
didn't actually go to that place that it
kind of normally goes so give yourself
permission do a detox see how that works
and see if that actually helps you get
away from comparing yourself to others
as much another thing that happens with
comparison syndrome is that it's really
based on envy now there's a difference
between envy and jealousy
so envy is when you see something else
that somebody else has that you feel
like should have been yours right that
person's famous but I actually should be
famous
that person is having so-and-so's baby
and I should be having his baby
something like that that person is rich
and I should be rich right so it's
something that you feel you have wrong
footlong fully has wrongfully gone to
somebody not you right jealousy on the
other hand is more about three people
right it's when somebody else's
attention is going towards somebody else
and not you right so what usually has to
do with you when you say you're jealous
of your wife's sister because she hangs
out with your sister her sister and
talks to her more than he does to you
okay that's jealousy that's not envy
right so just to be clear about it so
Envy however I think can be a really
valuable tool and a very valuable thing
to learn from so for example if you're
feeling envious of somebody that could
be telling you something that you
actually want that you weren't in touch
with and that you weren't willing to
weren't willing to admit to yourself so
one recommendation that I have is to
look at what is underneath
your envy if you're jealous because
somebody got an award for being the best
developer in the country company then
maybe that means that you just really
need recognition for your work and so
then that means you can set up ways you
can talk to your manager or something
you can say hey I just really want to be
recognized or you can get yourself on a
project where you can be in the lead and
you can get recognition for something so
it's really really important to take
envy and take it and learn from it
instead of just sublimating it and
trying to act like it's not there you
can also transform envy so envy can be
something where it's something when
you're comparing yourself to other
people in you're envious it can be
something that can be very paralyzing
and kind of keep you stuck but you can
take it and you can transform it into
something else and make it something
that's positive so what I recommend is
then taking your envy and turning it
into admiration so really looking at the
person and realizing that again just
like you just like everybody else
you're seeing what people call their
highlight reels right when you see all
their success you don't see the failures
you don't see their own inner critic you
don't see all the hard things that
they've gone through you just see
they're a success and then you're basing
your experience you're taking your
insides and you're comparing it to
somebody else's outsides right so
recognize that they have an inside too
and like give them credit for having
made the progress and done what they've
done knowing that if they've got some
probably messy insides just like
everybody else does also to take that
and call use them to be instead of a
role model an opportunity model and so
something I've been saying a lot in the
past week is being able to open up the
field of the possible right looking at
that person and saying oh my god they
did that that's possible I didn't think
that that was possible with somebody
that I knew but that's possible maybe
that's possible for me too and that
having that open up what you feel like
you can accomplish yourself and then the
last thing
that you can do is to actually give them
kudos so that you congratulate them send
them a card send them a present
recommend their work to somebody else
rise them up actually something called
shine Theory where with somebody else
shines that is in your circle then they
shine a light on you and then you can
shine a light back on them on other
people and everything kind of goes
outward right so you can do that with
this admiration and beyond
so finally oh I'm almost done finally
step into your creative power so you go
through this process you go through this
kind of series of things that I outline
in the book and I talk about the
exercises and stuff you will get to a
point where you will start to feel more
confident and sure and have what's
called creative confidence then you will
have the ability to not just be your
brilliance to be the unique wonderful
amazing person that you are that nobody
else is on the planet but that you can
also start to share your brilliance so
one of the things if you haven't started
doing it yet please start to share your
expertise to blog to mentor to teach to
present rights to get out and to show
all the things that again that you can
do that nobody else can do and to help
other people come and step into their
own creative power validate other people
give them kudos tell them the things
that you've always wanted to hear that
you never heard enough of you know doc
Norton is here and he has this amazing
presentation that he's done before he
hasn't done it in several years it's
called the love contagion and he talks
about how powerful it has been for him
to have managers and mentors and
everything actually give him validation
and how that bolstered him up and made
him want to give the validation to other
people so give other people validation
recognise their efforts recognize their
creativity and help them be the best
person that they can be
so I told you that I was going to tell
you what happened with the parts of my
story so even though Heather said that
my mermaid look like a frog I went on to
do other things artistically when I left
high school my favorite high school
teacher asked me to do a little math on
the back wall of her room so that she
could use it to teach from and I ended
up making a mural that was 10 feet by 20
feet that took me 250 hours to make over
the summer between my senior year and
going to university and I'm very proud
of it it doesn't actually exist anymore
which I'm kind of heartbroken by but it
was a wonderful piece of work and I felt
really really good about it I did all
the hand lettering drew all the
lettering drew the compass rose etc and
so even though this woman this young
girl made this comment about my artistic
abilities I didn't let that stop me even
though the ages of 13 and 14 I hid on
the end of the bench when I went into
high school my friend who was the other
really tall girl on the team actually
ended up moving and there was basically
a vacuum and I decided to go ahead and
step into it because there was nobody
else who could do it and I ended up
becoming a really really strong
basketball player and I almost played
volleyball in college at one of the top
universities top universities in the
country that also had one of the
strongest volleyball programs in the
country so I didn't let that stop me
and finally despite the fact that my
father and his attempts to protect me
said that it was hard to get published
and I sublimated my desire to be a
writer for years and years I actually
ended up interestingly enough having two
serendipitous book contracts that I
literally did not have to work for that
fell into my lap so know that people
will say stuff to you and it doesn't
mean that it's true and you don't have
to make it true about yourself so I hope
through all of this if you thought that
vanishing your inner critic was just
like a pipe dream and it was never going
to happen you didn't think it was
possible and you didn't have the proper
tools to do it so you're like ah forget
about it it's just going to be there
it's just going to be like in the room
with me all the time I'm going to be
like hey Bart now you've got both things
that you know that you've got it's
possible and now you have more tools
right and now you can create magic I
love that gift so in closing I just want
to say the potential for greatness I
believe is in all of us all the time
it's a seedling it's there it's the
potential right so do you want to have
the inner critic kind of driving the bus
and have you kind of snipping away at it
constantly and have you hold yourself
back or do you want to kind of fully
grow into your magnificence until what
you potentially could be and fully
actualize yourself
so with banishing your inner critic just
know that you do have the power you have
the power to take that step and to go
beyond what you thought was possible so
what will you do with this power that's
it now
before I stop I want to say that today
is actually the day that my father died
15 years ago and so I wanted to dedicate
this talk to him because he was a really
amazing person and I miss him a lot and
then the other thing
the other thing is that I have copies of
my book here and I have five copies and
I was going to give them out to anybody
who wants to ask me a question yes cuz
I'm a I have a question yeah hit me yes
you're failing but it's like so there's
something called the flow channel and
the flow channel is basically where
you're at this kind of nexus point of
challenge and and skill and so there's
going to be points kind of like I kind
of think about deliberate practice kind
of like just going just a slightly bit
outside the flow channel so that slight
bit where your skill doesn't quite meet
the challenge but when you get back into
the flow channel you just kind of kind
of knock down the challenge a little bit
and you then you build up your
confidence and you can try it again so
it's if you ever see a graph of the flow
channel it goes like this right skill
challenge flow channel through the
middle of it so just know that you can
kind of go up get to that point go back
into flow go up get to that point go
back into flow right and that it's just
it's kind of this this dance yeah yeah
you're welcome
yay all right who else yes
this guy actually the book that I was
referencing said 20 hours actually yeah
but like 20 hours of deliberate practice
not 20 hours is like noodling right but
like 20 hours of deliberate practice
where you keep kind of challenging
yourself getting to that point of
failure and then kind of getting up to a
higher point of failure and going down
that yeah I'll get it to you job of like
feeling lazy else I saw you guys wait is
there anybody in the back that I'm like
totally missing okay hold on I saw you
guys do that yes okay yeah in there okay
I'll get back here yes excellent thank
you
yes that's a great question she asked if
you don't criticize yourself will you be
able to improve there's a whole lot of
studies that show that self-criticism
actually impedes your progress and does
not actually help you improve and a lot
of people have been taught that that's
how they do it that's how you do it you
crack the whip and then you go because
you don't want to get hit with the whip
but that self compassion and so kindness
actually helps you move forward faster
than self-criticism does excellent
question you get a book I saw you there
yes
that's kind of what she asked so he
asked if is it is important to have a
little bit of your inner critic to keep
yourself in check personally again I
feel like okay here's an answer to that
question so there's a part of your brain
the prefrontal cortex the part of your
brain that judges that evaluates that
kind of looks at things all the time and
and adjust your behavior when that part
of your brain goes silent that's when
your most creative that's when you're
able to go into a flow state so my
answer to that is I actually don't think
the inner critic keeps you in check like
why do you need to be kept in check this
why do we need to be like what we're
supposed to be trying to like be like
this we don't need to like somebody like
nope down like all the time right so I
actually think that the inner critic is
it's going to be there all the time and
let's not act like it's you know like oh
it's magic and it's gone but I don't
think it's at I don't think it's very
beneficial it was beneficial at one
point in time when you were younger and
trying to like protect yourself from
threats but now that we're older we can
kind of reacts to things differently
yeah
what's a good place to start
