polythene berg I'm the health emergency
coordinator at innovation Red Cross I've
been invited here together with an ad
from Microsoft and Richard Campbell from
the humanitarian tool box we will tell
three different stories I'll start with
telling a little bit about how we
envision Red Cross and in the
International Federation have been
working on developing a program which we
call community based surveillance is
basically using technology to early
detect potential outbreaks that could
lead to a larger epidemics this whole
started in 2012 where I was supplied
together with some colleagues of mine
from Geneva to Sierra Leona it was we
were asked to support the National
Society to establish what we called oral
rehydration point services basically his
first aid post for cholera early
treatment of cholera we trained about
800 volunteers in managing those first
late post but what we also did is that
we train them in registration how many
people use that first aid post and how
many - how many who was presented with
symptoms of cholera and how many people
who was referred to the two health
facilities and what we didn't have at
that time that we didn't have the means
to get that information in real time
they didn't have any tools to go see
sores in hard-to-reach community it was
far away from the existing health
facilities and it could take several
hours to either walk or go by motorbike
to those communities so what we did
during that time is that we were trying
to search desperately to find some
technical tools that we can grow up
provide us that information which we
were didn't succeed in that but we
equipped about 40 of those rehydration
point with a mobile phone that we call -
just to check up how they actually
managed to to detect an escalation of
the outbreak
the findings from that was quite
positive we found that actually only
four of all of those people who was
using the first April's on the five
percentage was referred to the national
surveillance to the national health
facilities and then included in the
national surveillance data that means
that the epidemic was much larger than
we anticipated that also means that in
some of the hot spots we had the first
day post actually the the it was more
people or more as much more sick people
there than we actually knew and that
encouraged us to go further in
developing a methodology and how the Red
Cross could actually use technology in
emergency response to have a better or
more efficient support to the to the
beneficiaries who was affected by an
epidemic so basically was probably
supposed to move from paper to mobile
phones at that time right after the that
that year after we came back from Sierra
Leone we were working on that
methodology and then I was approached by
Haitian Red Cross who wanted to play a
role in the eradication campaign for
cholera in haiti color Italian color in
our ideas one of the largest outbreak
that we've seen in the world and the
access to health care is very difficult
for a lot of people living there
actually this is this is a picture of
where we have the project where it took
us three hours by car and then two hours
to walk to get to this community and
that's that's how difficult the access
can be in situation like this
dehydration red cross the very so they
asked me is there any new tools that we
can contribute to it and I told them
about our experience in Sierra Leone and
they were very current very and they
said that will be are interested in to
try to try this that so we had our first
pilot of what we call community based
surveillance in Haiti it was an 18-month
pilot project between two hundred and
forty volunteers which
sent about 4500 SMS reports and what
this actually what this pile showed us
is that they had a proof of concept we
saw that volunteers were able because
volunteers are not healthcare
professionals but we train them in
detecting a potential outbreak of
cholera at a part and they did that and
they initiated response so it was a
proof of concept from for an early
warning system that could lead to an
early action how we did that is that we
used there's a lot of data collection
tool out there so we used magpie as a
data collection tool we knew that we
couldn't in you had to use basic mobile
phones because because of the
connectivity or the coverage we the
volunteer center SMS into the magpie
online database and then we had support
from an epidemiologist who knew how to
run our scripts and we he developed that
for us to enable us to have a more
visual report that we can both it was
easy for us to read and was easy for the
volunteers to read and was also easy to
share with the national health
authorities they could be included into
the surveillance data then adebola had
ebola happen as since we are the one
who's been part of this development are
also emergency responder we were
deployed to their bola during the up
during the peak of the outbreak we were
very busy on being at the Ebola
treatment center server but we saw that
we actually there wasn't she
hugely to engage in the community's due
to both you to the to the fear of you of
that the band that the people had to use
the health facility but also so they
were hiding in the communities and there
wasn't need there to start both to
detect a potential new outbreaks of
Ebola in in the communities but also to
start an early response
in Sierra Leona what that what that
learned us is that here we moved away
from the our script we use the same same
reporting functions that we used magpie
by mobile phones here as well but our
scripts was for us who is healthcare
professional too complicated for us to
use we removed into business or to the
BI tool and we use tableau is instead
here what this experience showed us that
we were able to make this program to up
to scale so we trained here about 2500
volunteers who reported on a daily basis
when the epidemic was ongoing however we
will not happy but what we saw also as
well is that we didn't have a good alert
function we didn't have a good
communication with the volunteers at
that point of time so we the next
experience was actually now in
Madagascar where we know Asian Red Cross
has a health program targeting areas
which is affected by plague every year
is in a plateau and highline's in
Madagascar we that's also hard to reach
community and those are very limited
surveillance to actually get into the
national surveillance data and for
plague is important that you detect that
quite quickly and start initiate
response immediately because you just
have we have a small window of
opportunity to treat specific like cases
I will tell you a little bit more about
this how it is we used all their
experience that they have some previous
versions him we the what we did is that
we actually moved from from only SMS and
a visual report into a dashboard so we
had a bed a volunteer registration we
had a better event detection and
reporting and we had an automatic alert
function that could initiate a more
efficient of quicker on-site response
and the data consumption and analyzes
was also improved a bit better this
visually history here
we moved away again from tableau we went
into power bi and the reason for that is
that power bi isn't all the radicals
computers so it is more sustainable so
see use now and this is there this is
just a show of how the dashboard looks
like and we can also access both because
it was only a few people last access to
the actual power B to the power bi
because of the legal aspect of
collecting data which is related to
health and but most everywhere for
public it was available to see an
overall or absolute the website sells
what we do in and what's happening in
the community but it doesn't visualize
sensitive data however this was actually
we didn't find the system that we we
were happy with so we got support from
an IT em IT person because the one was
working on this we only health
professionals we are not IT people so we
got support and told him that all we
need this and this and this and this and
can you please help us make this and see
if that is working as I said maybe not
for you but for me this is quite
complicated this is this is this is how
we read pcs still it's not a very
user-friendly system for us it still is
very it still build on many companies so
the first part of the system is plan is
the collection of data so how it goes
into the heavy use removing we wanted to
test another data collection tool so we
moved from magpie into seg above which
this could be another fare collection
tool as well but here we're using in my
gas car using that so we this the first
first part there is how we have a
collected the data beyond say very basic
SMS but basic phone and then it was
transferred into the azure cloud weather
and also a design
published the report into the poll via
in the cloud which and then the next
slide is showing that how it was visual
both inside the Pompeii and on the web
and so what is on learning main learning
points from this three experience is
that setting up and running a system
like this still is quite resource heavy
to is very is a challenging for all
those who implement this in the field to
maintain it and that's one of our
biggest concern how do we develop a
system which is sustainable and can be
maintained and has a support function
and how do we develop a system which can
be used in multiple context by multiple
users just put it in context for you is
that we are now one to our the mythology
around community based surveillance has
is now being proven to have be a
effective tool to detect outbreak but
the technology still a little bit behind
for us to go at the global scale we are
currently thinking about for the next
year to add community based services
into existing health programs it at
least five to ten countries and to be
able to have that there need to have a
better system it needs to be much more
flexible so we can have more
drag-and-drop so you can easily be
deployed to an emergency if there is a
new outbreak situation or if there isn't
an area where we are moving into the
epidemic season so you can drag and drop
it for the different diseases or
different events that you need to
survive for it needs also to be a much
much better and more interactivity with
the volunteers so how what we learned is
that the alert function so setting a
threshold for example in Madagascar we
also survey for acute watery diarrhea
and in the community we have a
so level that initiate a response that
is a new function which we didn't have
in in thoroughly honor or in Haiti and
we've seen that that is very helpful for
the volunteers but it's not
automatically enough in Madagascar
either it doesn't provide a good
feedback loop to the volunteers there's
also something that yeah we're looking
at so they'd ever be making technical
evaluation of the setup in Madagascar
and we have also written a
functionalities description of the next
next version of what we call CBS which
we want to as I said improve the
interactivity with the user we have a
want to have a better alert generation
and we have going to have a better
information sharing both with the public
but also with the national health health
authorities and where are we on what's
next
Norwegian Red Cross is now has ever
since the beginning of this project work
very very closely with our Secretariat
in Geneva the for the International
Federation of Red Cross and we will we
will sweeten that even more now by
having a joint project so we'll have we
are now from moving from being three
people to being a much larger group at
the wishes combined with both people
sitting here in Oslo in Geneva and also
in Nairobi so expand the global team
which will have also more technical
people to set the whole scene on how the
Red Cross want to use this as a tool for
the future we want to contribute there's
a there's a lack of evidence of doing
that for three years
3m three pilots that we've done I have
shown us that this is half shoot huge
potential but there is this limited and
scientific evidence out there so we want
to generate that doing for the next
period and that's also why we want to
develop first of a version two and then
move into version three immersion four
measures five version six based on
on the on the evaluation of of the
implementation we have there is a huge
demand from some from our partner
National Society who wants to implement
this so it feels like we have a very and
we have a lack of time we should have
had this ready yesterday so some yeah
this is where we are now and I'll say
thank you for your attention and I would
give the word for to ina okay let's see
so thank you Tony and Red Cross came to
us said like four or five months ago
yeah and basically presented this I was
in a stressful moment I had a lots of
stuff to do and I didn't know what to
actually expect from this day pretty
much the same presentation and I was
like world we have to help we really
have to help that at Microsoft we have
the thing with cilantro cilantro peas
where we actually organizations like Red
Cross actually get a sure consumption
for free so that was kind of also
already done and at Microsoft we also
get three days every employee of
Microsoft at 3 days to actually do
things like this and my line of work
being a Technical Evangelist I can also
do 10 more because it's relevant for the
work that I do so I just found this
project really really interesting and my
immediate thought went to actually
Richard Campbell who's been running the
humanitarian tool box and I reach out to
him pretty early and got in touch with
the guys during this both Richard and
then he called upon me to gin McGowan
and red cross America and had kind of
walked through what they've been doing
and tried to model both an architecture
and the process for moving this forward
so you basically going into this we have
to set up kind of clear goals and it's
obviously Red Cross I'd Claire
those and we wanted to kind of build on
that so Red Cross does non hot
developers they're not a development
organization so we have to take that
into consideration from day one how do
we do this how do we build something
build it smart reduce the cost because
it can be very costly building software
can be also very risky
building software everyone in the room
here probably agree the me right it's
both cost and risky so we need to build
something that is seriously sustainable
for the next like 10 15 years or more
something that we can build on so Tonya
mentioned the version two three four
five six we really have to build for
that scenario so going into this we need
to consider quality so it probably needs
some at least one unit test right at
least and obviously they wanted this to
be built as far south as possible
because this is serious stuff right
people are actually dying as they don't
get these tools out into the field so
other things that we had to keep in mind
is as Tony also mentioned provisioning
they had to run new countries and it has
to be smooth getting a new country up
and running and also when kind of some
of these things are seasoned that has a
seasonality to it so there's outbreaks
they know when these outbreaks typically
start and when they em so how can we
actually take the system and put it in a
kind of dormant state and just save the
data and make sure that we have it for
the next time and also going into all
these different countries with different
data governance legislations and all
that we have to really take that into
consideration as well it cannot
necessarily only live in the cloud
because well we only have data centers
in so many places of the world so we
really have to take that into
consideration as well so coming up with
an architecture for that is with all
those things in mind well this is the
kind of core principles we were looking
at
we wanted to go small to reduce risk
basically build the smallest problems
that we can think of enabling us to
actually go to smaller teams right it's
easier to build smaller things and
larger things so come up with a good way
to do that so base it off of things like
dumb domain-driven design and really
going in into identifying the different
bounded context and understand the
different boundary contexts and that's
your kind of division that's the team
division that we get the silos right so
how do you pull all that back together
how do you build the composition from
this again reducing risk and thinking
about that event-driven architecture
seems like a good thing to think of so
it was basically bring the different
body concepts together by having
well-known events being the contracts
between them and this should then help
us improve the throughput because now we
have autonomous teams autonomous bounded
context that actually can go forward on
their own and improving the throughput
and velocity of the project and of
course we need to automate this I
mentioned that one unit test that we
need and really follow up with that
because we need to deliver the quality
there's no there's not going to be a big
support organization for this that can
actually respond quickly right Red Cross
does not have that so we really have to
keep in mind that everything has to be
automated and kind of guarantee as much
quality as we can for the entire thing
so the next thing we kind of looked at
is okay how do we actually host this so
we wanted to go in and do darker based
basically enabling well actually we kind
of I took out one point here but we said
also kind of just do with Linux at the
court and darker on top basically
enabling us freedom right again a point
of reducing risk because we want to be
able to bring anyone into this project
so it's not just net developers or
anything or guys it's everyone right
bringing in like Java developers know
developers Ruby developers anyone
and with the docker or container based
approach we will enable that scenario
anyone can work on this project enabling
us to go out and find resources much
easier we want this to be held and
registry with a strict versioning
strategy enabling us to actually have
full control over the release cycle and
with this we do need some kind of
Orchestrator and doing something like a
sure container service with kubernetes
enables us to have all these workloads
in a cluster and governed by an
Orchestrator like kubernetes so logging
into the boundary context they pretty
much define them this themselves and
this is what we tend to do in software
development we find these different
modules what we all build modules in our
systems even our monolith has bonded
context we just uncommon that so the
modules that read costs already defined
our natural bounded concepts they've
already defined the different workflows
they need to capture so taking these we
can come up with the architecture that
sets those boundary context so looking
deep more deeply into it so obviously
this is very high-level stuff we don't
have time to go in-depth on everything
but taking the voluntary registration we
basically want to be able to have some
sort of mobile front-end that enables
them to do all that registration all the
volunteers and all that stuff government
coming in natural to having a kind of
API endpoint and also provide a web
front-end where they can manage all
these things so they have the volunteers
coming in with mobile but they want to
manage the kind of rights and kind of
roles and whatnot from another web
fronting and what cosmos DB is just kind
of just thrown in there but a document
database is what was thinking them and
using something like the MongoDB API in
a
to go with cosmos but also kind of on
and on premise saying as well because we
want to be enabling the scenario of
having to date and not necessarily only
in the cloud and having the event driven
thinking at the center of this so
anything that happens will be published
to something like an event or a message
brokers of some sort service bus you
name it and enabling us to actually have
something that translates that from this
from the context to a different standard
context that's called a mediator
something that mediates between the
different bounded contexts looking at in
the next similar at this time well the
ingestion is from a SMS right we want to
be able to capture as a message so it's
kind of a similar thing we capture that
with events we can have something that
processes these events could be a shore
functions could be something completely
different
again we store it in a database but we
also go even further we can transform
that event into something else that we
can use per se machine learning let's
say we want to capture and see and
predict things why not use machine
learning to that and obviously also
there's here's where the alerts system
would come into play
and actually notify the user and the
user being the healthcare worker saying
there's something going on you need to
actually respond based on the thresholds
configured and also visualize the whole
thing in something like power bi but
again publishing to other context is
important so again another mediator that
will actually deal with translating to a
different bounded context and another
one would be very similar to the first
one being the kind of place where you go
and set up all the thresholds and
whatnot so again the same kind of
pattern same kind of thinking but in
isolation and the last bit being the
analysis part where we actually can take
data from all the
different bounty hunters and actually
take that into here and again publicly
to another place and process it store it
put it into Part VI enabling power bi
desktop at this place where we want to
publish reports because we want them to
be able to easily quite easily without a
developer's hand to actually create
reports so utilize existing tools for
that and just publishing that through
web front-end so that's pretty much what
we're looking at there important part of
this is obviously security so one thing
is the security around the data and
looking at like hybrid solutions where
we need to keep the data probably
on-premise for some part but also how do
we actually log into this how do we
authenticate and then authorize the
different API s and all that stuff what
we need that to be standardized because
we need to be able to actually enable
different scenarios so not only like -
or ad they have their own Red Cross out
there and actually using office 365 and
stuff like that but also enabling other
things because out in the field they are
not necessarily in that 80 right so
enabling the field workers to log in
through other in social providers like
this and maybe even go all the way down
to custom login kind of a username
password database that we maintain in
this system bringing in something like
identity server would be perfect for
that and still be on the open ID part of
this right it's completely standardized
so another thing is I want to bring up
is I've been doing a framework for close
to 10 years and it kind of captures all
this and if you want to read more about
all the kind of different patterns and
all how to do this I would recommend you
to go to this place and have a look at
the different articles and videos and
whatnot because it kind of just explains
it in more technical detail rather than
me trying to do that on stage today so
moving to process processes
probably the hardest part in this I
would say because as I mentioned they
don't have Red Cross don't have
developers so how do we develop this and
there's a big data sticker there because
we don't really but we don't have the
answers but Red Cross is considering
doing a few things and based on our
recommendations basically from what my
keys are and what we're recommending is
what if we base the whole development on
momentary you guys what if you can
contribute to this on your spare time if
you haven't maybe your employers will
give you a day here and there and
actually help out on this because this
is important stuff right so that's what
we're kind of working on we're well
recourses in the process of kind of
looking at doing a risk assessment
around this is this feasible is this
something that we can do and of course
then we would be doing everything in the
open everything would be on github we
would have a pull request regime for
this so there would be a team that
actually does code reviews and stuff
like that and also try to come up with a
plan for doing like a regular commitment
to stand up where people who want to be
involved in this come in and actually
have a chat and we have natural product
owners in Red Cross governing the
different things they want to build so
that is kind of what we were looking for
for this project so that's a great
potential for building it building a
test and also reducing risk because then
there would be lots of people involved
right so the natural part of this is
having product owners we need product
owners Red Cross as the product owner
tanya is a natural one and they would
own the whole thing they would own the
background and this is also from the
work that
you guys have been doing a human
humanitarian tool box if the Red Cross
guys knows what they need all right so
it's natural for them to actually own
this so somewhat different where you see
in a lot of other open-source projects
where it's tech oriented right this is
not tech oriented so we need natural
product owners and we also need to build
a team of architects and someone that
owns the vision the development vision
so it needs to be I'm saying at least
supers and I would say more right three
four people that actually have the
overview the global vision for the for
the product being built and they kind of
govern this so again it's about reducing
risk because we don't want what just
that one guy that has this and all of a
sudden has a busy week and can't respond
to anything so we need to be able to
scale this so part of this is also
documentation and we hate documentation
right we have to do this right if you're
going into this place and into the space
you need to kind of do documentation you
need to document everything that you do
so the next guy can actually pick it up
because if we get this done right there
will be people all over the globe
actually contributing to this project so
obviously we need the next guy coming in
to we have a quick read and understand
what to do so that's important and get
other issues is one of many purses many
things that we could do for
documentation but also everything that
we do what if we can automate that and
generate something documentation that
becomes publicly available use markdown
and things like that to generate proper
documentation for those we need to have
automated builds obviously continuously
integrating the whole thing running
tests we need a bunch of them to
guarantee that we're
actually not breaking stuff and
delivering what we need and as I
mentioned published documentation
continuously since we talked about
containers we need to kind of build the
container images and publish these two
registers versions every time we do
things so that's super important and for
the community part what if we can do
hackathons coda zones where we actually
gather people in the room and work
together for a couple of days we come
there with a clear goal set by our
brothers owners saying this is what we
need built these are the issues that we
really need to focus on now so obviously
we need some presents planning for that
to happen and hand out assignments so if
we're lucky enough to get enough people
in the room maybe there's multiple teams
actually working on different parts give
them assignments and build it I also
follow up after such an event with who
will do what because we the chances are
we're not going to do everything at the
event we need to actually follow up
after that and basically from the work
that the guys at humanitarian toolboxes
been doing trying to build on that
experience and see well they've been
doing this for a couple years now and
build on that experience really share
that experience and yeah I think that's
a perfect segue village
Thank You radar
little did I know when you pinged me
about a year a little over a year ago
about this that I'd end up here so next
time we'll be more careful answering my
email
how many folks here in Norwegian they're
in the room right now just have the
curiosity of you okay I hope you're
proud of what a relatively small arm of
the Red Cross is able to do I'm a
Canadian I live beside this big beast
next door and we like punching above our
weight too and I hope you do as well
because I just get chills when I think
about how much a small group of
dedicated people can move the ball for
it can make this world a little bit of a
better place and actually save some
lives
most of the software we build on any
given day is it's not that exciting is
it you know forms over data helping
somebody fill in an insurance form or
get some work done that's fine this is
software that makes a difference in
whether or not a child lives or dies or
that we actually know where to get
medicine to where to put expertise into
and to make sure that those precious
volunteer hours are well spent
there's lots of different kinds of
volunteerism it takes a special person
to go to Sierra Leone or to Haiti or to
Madagascar to go on the ground and do
those sorts of things but I value the
volunteers that we get a humanitarian
tool box to who take time out of their
lives to write software to make those
people more effective and that's the job
we've always had as software developers
we rarely do the work that gets the
results but we do build the tools that
allow those people that do that work to
be much more effective we amplify them
and so we can do that in a volunteer
basis as well it would be interesting if
we could all make our living or live our
lives working on only this kind of
software it's not practical or
necessarily realistic a few of us may
but for each of us to have a part of our
lives a part of our day in citizenship
to the world that we take this skill the
superpower we have the writing software
and apply it to a bigger problem than
the one immediately in front of us into
something that gets better over time I
ended up making HD box because I wasn't
satisfied with the mechanism necessary
to allow a volunteer developer to use
their time well we only have so many
hours it's the only really limited can
resort we have how do we do the most
with that time and so this is a
mechanism built around making it simple
for you to use your skill my I don't
have a problem with volunteer developers
I can find a lot of them it helps to
have a podcast that people listen to so
that when I can shout it so let's go
build some software I make a difference
in the world be like yes my gate is good
work items it's project management
actually but that's a good use of
resource that we can spend our time to
actually pull together well-thought-out
work items I do enjoy the open source
community we have a great time together
most of the stuff that we do an open
source is by us for us tooling to
improve our ability to write code and to
build better projects so forth these
kinds of projects are different and
you'll see their shape differently too
if you look at them because most of the
time when you're talking about working
on an open-source project when you're
looking at auto FAQ or automap or your
sack or any of those types of tooling
around development they're very very led
by a Nicholas bloom parts or a Jimmy
Bogart a person with a vision who drives
a particular these forward is written
the majority of the software and
appreciates your contributions to do
more we don't have single leaders for a
project of this nature we have experts
that are on the ground doing the work
and need the software to be better and
then we do project management to figure
out what that work looks like break it
out of the items that someone can
pick up and execute on if you look at
the contributions in github for a
project in HD box you'll see that
there's a collective we run codeathon
to get people excited about our projects
we expect our goal if you come to a
codeathon for humanitarian blue boxes
you'll have a couple of check-ins over
the next couple of days that will teach
you about a project because you set
about a project you'll pick something up
and add to it but my real goal and
getting you to my codeathon to get you
hooked on building software that save
lives
so you'll keep coming back and keep
contributing and if you look at our
projects you'll see a group of addicts
this is one of their favorite things I
had a team of three developers come in
in Wisconsin they used to go bowling on
Wednesdays now they write code they work
on already and I see them every
Wednesday with a couple of check-ins
they continuing to work on that piece
over and over again and so you'll see
that the folks that really get hooked on
it they keep making contributions it's
about a dozen for the already project
that have fifty sixty a hundred
check-ins now and we have weekly Google
Hangouts where it's essentially a scrum
session that you can hop on chat with
folks we do it early in the morning
westcoast times of the folks in Europe
it's in the evening it's not in the
middle of the night for anybody who's
contributing but we can talk about where
we are what problems we have I grieve
urge my best skills so that I can
facilitate those folks being productive
and I'll give you an example of that as
we were tackling the timezone problem
because the software is being used in
more and more places dates and times are
harder than they look we were looking
for the right library to use and what
did we find
we found no two time tota time is not
for the faint of heart and as the boys
were struggling to understand how to use
note of time I said you know I could
just call John skeet so I called John
skeet he dropped in on our slack channel
and spent a half an hour and got us
straightened out so we're using note of
time the right way and believe it or not
John was very grateful because he cares
a lot about that library he wants to
make it better and being able to talk to
developers who really need to use it and
are struggling with it helps him make a
better library too so I feel like I'm my
that self when I can connect those
people together and build the best
software we possibly can build we all
have different roles in how we can build
these things and make a difference if
you're able to focus on it full-time I'm
excited for you there's lots to do if
you can give me one weekend a month if
we can talk to your employer and build a
corporate citizenship program about how
your entire development team once a
quarter can spend a weekend building
software I can help you with that too
there are ways for us to routinely
contribute to sort of charge ourselves
around software around the super power
that we have and do more with it and I
would reference Daniel Pink's drive if
you highly encourage you reading the
book because it speaks to this idea of
that in a creative enterprise like
software development there's really
three things that matter long term that
really dictate our own happiness in our
careers autonomy mastery and purpose and
I think with efforts like what the
Norwegian Red Cross is working on what
iron our sport is sold into and what
we've been doing a humanitarian tool box
we try and address those three things
autonomy your ability to choose what you
do and how you do it that's what
volunteerism is all about that's why
people volunteer it's why people
contribute to open source projects I
choose what to do
mastery that I press against the edges
of my skills that I want to get better
that I work on different things in
different ways to grow in my profession
and in my life and purpose the stuff
that I make matters so I hope you'll
take those three things and look at the
things that we're doing here and if we
can help you press against those things
we'd be excited to help you with it you
can reach us at any other social media
is on the screen or go to the website
and register for the newsletter thank
you so much for your time
we have a few minutes for questions
yeah we are here so you know what you're
going to do next right yes sir and when
it does it's also on volunteer
organizations so I'm wondering we also
have like our 9-1-1 emergency services
but they only use voice and voice
communication they're going to bridge
that because they probably want to move
up the scale and to also be able to
convey we or visions that are actually
present almost 11 activists and that
happens all the time and collective
responsibility and hope that those
squirrels who kind of connect that all
those kinds of emergencies are
small-scale Sierra Leone and and in that
sense that you give you all selected
challenges to gather the relevant
evidence and research over all the
software
thank you so yeah so first of all em we
work we want a system that can be used
by communities which is in risk of
potential outbreaks
so which meaning that they have
recurrent outbreaks of different
diseases we want to do this status from
you the link so you have a system there
that is ongoing which can be hibernated
and it's not an epidemic season because
it's epidemic seasons every year but
then it could be reestablished when when
they entering into that epidemic season
that is what I'm talking about not them
so and then we will have the same system
that can be mobilized in emergency so
while if you have a crime system to that
you rather have also have a system which
is ready to be this already been used by
the National Society in in that country
so for for the I'm not sure if I
understood you it's so small scale
medium scale in our scales are so this
is want a system which can be using both
small medium and large scale sources so
the system that we are looking for is a
system that I can use when I'm going to
allow a large outbreak specialist in
Ebola epidemic or to Tamala Gasca where
you have wishes in and seasonal trends
which is like wanted to other cases
every year in a certain area but
suddenly you can have a peak there and I
want to capture that before the kick
comes send yourself it did I I'll see
you a little bit
- so everybody knows what you're talking
about here is well there is a there this
idea that we call nine-one-one kind of
archaically you know who talks on their
cell phone it's so strange but that's
the only way 911 works right now and the
in the developed world it's interesting
when you see the technology is being
built to work in a place like Sierra
Leone and Madagascar things we don't
even have that here and I think that
might've something you're getting at I
am aware of some other open-source
projects not necessarily HD box projects
that one of them called City pulse where
they are trying to use bot type
technology and text messaging and our
Facebook message those kinds of tools so
that a city can have a conversation with
its citizens and so that yes when you
have a moment like there's been a car
accident here's a photo and that can be
rapidly disseminated to medical
professionals and and emergency
responders although we're a side-effect
of the developed nation is also rules
around how responses can be pulled in
what information is available it is very
tricky for example to send a photograph
to a police department there are very
strict rules of evidence on how they're
supposed to receive that kind of
information
so citizen responders can complicate the
ability for police to do their work
that being said being able to say
there's an incident or more relevantly
when you start looking at one of the
magic parts of the piece of software
that that the Norwegian Red Cross is
using is being able to see where an
epidemic is building up so when you
start seeing geographically multiple
incidences that many people are
complaining about a problem with water
or a problem with flu or any of those
sorts of things even in a developed city
that health care workers can see there
might be a problem in this particular
geography so picking up on the social
media Gestalt the energy around
commenting in social media
geographically bound allows the city to
respond more quickly
I do see that software starting to form
that will be available here as much as
in a place like Sierra Leone I think
they're different creatures because
that's not so you less you just look at
citizen as volunteer but when you when
you talk about a cognizant issue like
plague and in Madagascar which has large
range of consequences for their
economies that's why there's a volunteer
group there why that the National
Society reaches out to the branches to
help them with it a city's natural gauge
of the I think it will be funded
differently think it'll work differently
but I don't disagree with you for a
moment that mobile and cloud those two
technologies together we need to get
better to using that routinely in our
ways that we communicate with our
governments and with our services with
our cities actually follow up on and I
do work with startup that is actually
doing nothing and it's based upon social
and it's supposed to be kind of a
network and people being able to respond
to it so that I do see kind of a
security aspect or not because I don't
think one entity should really own that
data so this could be something that
what King could be good for for
capturing that so it's not just the kind
of services out there but there's also
data governance again so you mentioned
as well yeah we have a battle with
privacy and in following policy and it's
part of the conversation it's very
challenging when you move to different
jurisdictions different countries
different rules so I think as part of
our efforts at building the software to
make sure we we respect the locality
now they do those things I don't that
answer your questions
yeah
serious absolutely and and and different
cultures and how they work with them I
mean I don't think I don't know that
tell me as if it says quite enough like
I worked on the Ebola crisis as well the
sheer amount of fear in the populace
around hospitals in government stuff we
would never consider here it's a very
powerful force in other parts of the
world and and there's there you will be
baffled as a volunteer at the reactions
sometimes they just have to learn that
culture and understand where it comes
from if you can't get there you can't
help them so I do think it's going to be
the same problem with each time we
introduce technologies in different
communities you know we have a problem
we get this stuff and we're not the
majority
all right we're a small part of herbal
society even in a place as rich and
developed as Norway we're right at the
leading edge we're comfortable with a
lot of things that our parents and
grandparents won't be and so we have to
be careful as we introduce technology
like this anywhere in the world that we
bring it in a way that makes everyone
comfortable at least can understand its
value and can mitigate the fear around
it otherwise it creates more problems
than it solves
sign me up well if you're going to go
with my gig there we are
but I'm interested to how folks are
going to contribute to the Norwich
you're across yeah the thing is that
it's really really early we were hoping
to get the answer by now but the thing
is that we will keep you posted so
follow me on Twitter I forgot to
actually put my thing up but II I and
they are I said I know at 4:00 Twitter I
will be sure to actually well try to
inform everyone and I do know a bunch of
you in the room so expect an email so
that's what we're told
right now what our plan is like we have
a sudden sudden my presentation is that
our goal is to have a global scale up
thus we need to have we want to have a
close cooperation at the global level
with Geneva so we are currently looking
at different methodology and exploring
different way that like looking at what
you've been doing and finding out a way
of doing this best and we will we hope
that we can be able to do our codeathon
which is a new term for me which I
learned yesterday maybe this maybe this
fall over themselves please keep in
contact with Madonna and we will start
moving as quickly as we can
we use the term codeathon rather than
hackathon because I think hackathon has
a bunch of connotations now especially
in the US they've been doing these
coding competitions they call hackathons
and often when you use that term you get
that kind of behavior where a bunch of
people want to compete against each
other to write against a common API or
common set of tools and win a prize and
that's not where what we're about at HG
box and I don't think it's what they
don't reach and right across wants to do
either
I call it codeathon more like a marathon
in the sense that we have a long way to
go
and if you help us take a few steps in
that direction we'd appreciate it so I
just put my contact details I think if
you want more information please feel
free to contact me obviously you also
have two slides of your colored
information maybe we should if anyone's
taking the notes so reach us
we go as well so you're not seeing that
that's great for you yes awesome
nice let me actually pull right over
sorry about there we go so please reach
out that's what we have to say about
this today and hopefully we'll get to
the whole community time yep
we'll get this show on the road oh yeah
sure sure
and it's very obviously we need to keep
it to kind of track on this and
obviously the stuff that they've been
doing over at HD box as well it's
already something that I've looked into
them it's something I can some of it can
be reused for this project so we need to
keep our eyes and ears open and if
anyone knows about anything if you can
give us a shout out because we don't
that's the whole thing what we as long
as we can guarantee the quality as long
as we can maintain it and as long as we
can get it out to the field working with
this it doesn't really matter who builds
it or actually it doesn't really matter
how we build it even as long as it works
I would love to hear about that yep yeah
but it's them because we've been done a
lot of searching to try to find it and
my colleague is now deployed actually
it's not Nina is in in Africa and I
called lashkar's back there now and I
talked to her last night and she said
like oh I'll just wish we have this
because now they're using something gold
COBOL there now and then they have been
unlike that I've been on other K that
mean I'm so listen but we haven't really
found that actual interaction with the
volunteers yet but maybe you have it
please contact me again it's one of the
reasons we're working in open source for
HD box as well as we're trying our best
not to repeat ourselves and more than
what you'll see they'll give you a
preview what's going to happen the
humanitarian boodle tool box over the
next year or so we're writing less
software and we're taking over other
software that's becoming a big pieces
that your software that has been built
inside
in organizations that they need to
sustain and they want to grow further
and that they would prefer not to repeat
themselves and we don't have to keep
writing the same thing over and over
again and so we're helping to put those
soft that software in a place and a
foundation and in organizations so that
anybody who needs it can use it you know
they're one of the advantages of that
the HD box software cities living on
github is you don't need my permission
to use it you don't even have to tell me
just parking go crazy
enjoy the installation notes are there
if you want our help we can help you as
well and if you want to contribute well
there's a pattern for how to contribute
that involves conversation first in code
second so we work on the right things
but I'm with you sir that I would rather
we gave this stuff away and that we
wrote it all once it's never going to be
that cleaner perfect and there's many
different kinds of organizations out
there and they work in different ways
we're trying to find our way forward and
help each other as best you can so just
to follow up on that so what we do in
our community and Lego and in the Red
Cross we have global meetings that we
share like what the different national
society is doing so I know for example
some next month are going to Nairobi to
have a regional meeting within African
national society who is currently
involved in community based surveillance
at this point of time mostly are using
papers and someone also using the other
roster to notify about potential aspects
but what we have trying to develop is
use applying epidemiological methods to
create more and early action and to
throw film better we we do how like we
did you talk together than money that we
also had a global meeting in Geneva in
November there are also different
national societies shared what we're
doing but we haven't really found it yet
time for one more to
take the software well we we need
automated tests all right so we need
automated tests on multiple levels to do
that so anything from a unit level to
actually on an integration with it as
well and also test the yuan so we're
going to have to do that and it needs to
be automated because we're they're not
going to sit there and have time to
actually test this they're out in the
field they're just going to have to
trust that it works so we're going to
have to do that for them so we need some
kind of guidelines around that and my
experience in doing open source for the
last 15 years I'm pretty familiar with
doing those tests and saying this is
what you need to do to be contributing
to this project and also that's why we
have the gated check-ins the gated
check-ins also build right so the gated
chickens world automatically build run
the tests and make sure you didn't break
anything so and also have kind of code
reviews in place as well so at least one
other person looks at the code right so
that's what I'm kind of thinking of but
again it's it's going to be well we're
hoping it's going to be built in the
open and that means also the kind of
governance that we come up with there's
something that we do together it's not
something that I come up with or
anything like that these are my
suggestions basically for not in our
experience in working with different
disaster relief organizations over in HQ
box there are trials so in the United
States the FEMA organization runs
Disaster Response events where they will
simulate an earthquake in Los Angeles
all too often it's not a simulation and
it allows the relief workers to practice
and move their equipment makes your
communication worse so forth and it is
an opportunity if you've followed the
process to have some of your software
tested as well relief workers are heavy
very high bar the usual calm and a half
of them is you have to demonstrate to me
that this beats pen and paper because I
love the battery life of paper so there
but it's a good challenge of my
frustration because we come from
software where we're used to iterating
really quickly if they only run two or
three of them a year and so we have to
build we have a big build-up to those
events and then we get our butts handed
to us as all good testing does and then
go get better it's fun when you can work
on our resolution like the Red Cross on
different projects where we can iterate
faster because we're dealing with the
people who will use it on a routine
basis and they will iterate with us
quickly but in larger responses it's a
slower pace and I'd rather be right than
fast in those scenarios so we go through
that process I think our time is up
