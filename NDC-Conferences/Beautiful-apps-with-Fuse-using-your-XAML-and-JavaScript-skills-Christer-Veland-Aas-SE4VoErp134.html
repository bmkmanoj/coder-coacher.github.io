there any girls here today
no yeah you guys are woken up to learn
about fuse and creating beautiful apps
that's nice to see you guys so how many
of you guys have used sam'l before yeah
that's probably why you're here because
it's in title and what about JavaScript
yeah most as well that's good so and how
many wants to create beautiful apps
using these languages so try to inspire
you today and see what we can do with
this new framework work called fuse but
I know you have heard of fuse so use it
before
yeah one guy over there yeah so you know
just start start with with a little
little background of why I came to
choose well work with fuse technology
the past five months so my name is
cristy off as you probably know and this
is who I am this is sort of the time
I've spent it's a relative point to it
I'm program programming fun stuff a lot
I'm programming some boring stuff now on
then I just walking driving my car I'm
super happy of times but not yeah but
I'm mostly balanced I would say yeah I
get angry clean the house do several
things
I'm a definitely a family guys now you
know a little bit about my personality
but what I think is very important here
is is not these things but more about
how do i well you are mostly the things
I do mostly routine or is it about
exploring stuff
in general so I would say that 30% of
the time I do routine stuff and I try to
in every every every daily thing I try
to do exploring exploring new stuff if I
go to work I maybe take new routes just
export something new so this is part of
the reason why I'm driving interviews so
who are you guys who's exploring 70% of
the time or you guys that's good yeah I
like it so maybe one third so here is
more 50/50 balanced okay and who's 70%
routine and 30% maybe less yeah a couple
of guys here so have a couple of things
for you guys I have a compass for you
and a compass for you so you can go
explore a bit more okay so this is this
is what I met in January when it's hold
by the project stakeholders that it's
decided that you must build the mobile
apps but you have to use one specific a
fantastic new mobile framework that
solves cross-platform forever okay
because it saves you from doing any work
and thus take hold and keep generated
from Photoshop basically that's sort of
the agenda here and the stakeholder have
attended the conference inspired
showcases and more and it's totally
convinced this is the right thing so I
guess we're all been there that we have
some people run off that decides a
framework but how do you react to this
and that's that's very core to how you
tackle new technology I think I like
this
I guess everyone is like this at some
point or more like this or I like this
super excited you think so I'm probably
bits a mix of these three things I guess
but I try to be mostly like this but I'm
getting these technologies
it's and well I getting the opportunity
to explore a new framework and that's
also probably reason why I've found this
new company in January first I want to
build mobile apps it's it can be
frustrating but I look at it is it's an
exploration trip and taking some chances
and I would say it's definitely like
this in mobile technology today you have
all these choices all these frameworks
some are more famous than others
fuse is pretty new in this is group most
of us know summer in we have semantic
way for building things and yeah how
many hip is heard to work with native
native like swift Objective C Java one
guy over there who's summer in people
here
one two all right and how about the web
based framework html5 okay so most of
you guys are on the html5 bit that's
interesting so very often when we we
talk about well when I'm thinking of
which which mobile framework should I
choose for this job as I mentioned you
have a stakeholders in the project you
have you have your previous experience
in the team if you're if you come from a
developer backgrounds you would usually
choose well you would think guess it web
developer when when we're approaching
mobile and html5 is it's much closer to
you in many ways me myself I'll be
working for years with doc net and
Microsoft so it was natural to explore
the mobile platforms from summer in and
also be developing a lot of JavaScript
web applications so it's so the
combination of looking at fuse now is
very interesting because
you get to reuse your summary experience
and your VBS and Silverlight and all
these Microsoft technologies it's it's
very influenced by that and combine it
with JavaScript so I try to rate the
three frameworks based on these one
based on tooling based on how big the
business logic is in the app that's all
vary from app to app some apps have tons
of business objects you might even well
you might don't really realize it before
you begin the project but you usually it
grows quite quite large and well some
products have a need for custom designer
animations if sometimes you you want to
lean on the on the iOS framework or the
android framework and just want to look
and feel of the OS you want to reuse the
navigation system you want to use the
toggle button for iOS and and pretty
much lean on UI kids and the material
design that's fine in other projects you
want the same consistent feeling
throughout the application on both
platforms and you really want to move
more to gaming have custom animations
and create a total user experience by
yourself and some frameworks make this
quite easy and some frameworks make it's
quite hard and usually you want to
access some native controls and features
as well that that's like geolocation
using the camera creating a custom
experience maybe with the camera yeah
all these different things the mobile
can do actually and you basically need
to access the Android API and the iOS
API directly to be able to do that and
you have a community full of third-party
components you have UI components and
you have more like integration
components maybe you want to
analytics with Google Analytics or
something else and the way you can
integrate with this it varies a lot of
fun framework to framework so I'm going
to use this this is my subjective score
on these frameworks based on my
experience and I can challenge you guys
to maybe get the html5 rating in here
we'll see so this is how I this is for
my experience how some rain is lining up
to this I find somewhere in very strong
on a business logic device because you
have C shop you can use the PC else you
can reuse the code so that's that's one
of the strong things that you bring into
a project in that perspective and the
tooling is quite good it's maturing it's
been around for years on custom designs
you can choose summary informs
particular choose to go with well if you
don't use summer influences everything
gets more complicated with summer in so
if we compare this to building native
apps then you're the reason why are
rated lower is because you have to build
a business logic twice you have to do it
in Java and you have to do it on in
Objective C so you need to see you get
less productive and we have to maintain
two code bases from business logic side
and doing custom designs you also have
to do it twice on totally different
platforms and if I put fuse in here it's
quite different it's like top score on
custom designs and animation and that's
a different take on it so that means
that this is well the good the company
making fuse this is their goal to be
able to well enable the mobile apps to
have custom designs of animation with
superb quality with 60 frames per second
making it easy declarative and I'll show
you guys some some animations today and
how to build it
and it's kind of fun so but on the other
side it's it has matured a lot yet it's
was released in one point zero two weeks
ago so you can do integration with
third-party components and and you can
do that gives controls and features that
you have to call a lot of it's yourself
the community hasn't grown large yet
from the tooling is it's also more about
well you have to use sublime or Assam
and inking those are the official
plugins in those text editor tools
really and you have yeah so you
basically have those tools at hand and
use the terminal and you have to to do
manual logging in many ways and build
all this wiring yourself behind the
scenes let's see yeah and what framework
will it choose is based on what it what
your app will actually do so I would say
that fuse is lined up on the left side
probably between gaming and the regular
app somewhere over on the right side
doing a lot of peripheral equipment is
connected to the phone using the USB
ports doing all this hardware stuff
Bluetooth that kind of thing I wouldn't
say it's picture enough to do that as
well but it eventually will be we'll see
so what about the sign so this is a
snapshot from from well as the video
from fuses on webpage and what's use can
can be used to build and you see these
experiences that totally customized onyx
is not classic iOS so classic Android is
here it's but it's very cool experiences
and fuse is based on wall a use OpenGL
to render this to have the performance
the performance is key with this
you can do infinite scrolling with
thousands of elements it's it's very
optimized for well here we do a pinch
and zoom and all of I'm gonna have 60
frames per second this is just a few
examples as you can see the belts this
yeah we go got some public second and I
can just imagine doing this on native
platform on Android iOS would be quite
hard to get the same experience in both
tough ones
that's last thing I think there's a
tickets system and have all these small
tiny effects that's going on I don't
have to decide if you should go
cross-platform and these days it's it's
natural to think that way
so what is fuse well fuse is made by sea
use tools here in Norway and it's right
up the street er the company Alex now
free and open-source you can download
the bits and see what's going on it's
using OpenGL to generate the UI and I
render most of the code down to C++ and
it's easy to install so if you can get
you can start with this like in two
minutes as so compared to many other
frameworks it's it's very fast get
started
you pretty much click the download
button and then you run the Installer
and then you're set and well one of the
key things would see if you can do live
preview on multiple devices at the same
time so if I connect my android phone
and the iOS tablets and I used too much
at the same time of the PC you can do it
on PC a Mac they also show the same view
so they have two modes if you if you
choose to build it it's more like you do
a regular build of applications it will
render
it's too so you can open it in Xcode and
it can deploy to the device and you ever
have the 60 frames per second and fully
optimized up that's one way to do it the
low previous difference and this is
where JavaScript comes in because they
do reloading or what they call refi they
call it so they they build in the
background and they refresh it using
javascript so the performance is a bit
degraded but you will be able to code
and see what's happening at the same
time and it's one-to-one with this fine
so I'll show you guys off towards how
this works
so we'll dive into the preview and make
a small app yeah these are formal things
you can do alright so I'm still excited
so we can do fun things like this all
right so this is the start just take it
very shortly
you have the JavaScript on top you have
UX and UX is pretty similar to sam'l and
you have you know have you guys ever
heard of you know yeah forever no that's
pretty good
it's c-sharp scuffin actually it's
pretty similar to C shop I'm not sure
why they don't use C short because it's
very similar but it's probably has to do
with rendering down to C++ and then
running our OpenGL and native bits and
I'll just like to show you guys the
diffuse docks as well because it's very
well documented to be such a such a
young framework so you have all well if
I if I want to see what the panel is
doing I can go in here and click anyway
if you you guys have seen stumbled
before or you don't see it oh thanks
let's do this
you see not yeah so if you go to the
fuse webpage you can just hit talks and
then you pretty much get started
installation is as I said just download
the bits just install it and then you
me personally I went through this
tutorial which will give you a lot of
best practices which I will recommend
and then you can dive into all these
various elements and like a panel and
you can see some samples on what the
panel can do you can put some margin on
it
padding colors and you have all the
properties so it's very well documented
to be such a young framework let me see
yeah so JavaScript for my experiences
it's super flexible it's functional you
can do Jason work very easily you can
just stopped in to the Jason you can do
all sorts of things to manipulate it's
you have the required to create modules
from JavaScript that's built in to fuse
and I want to keep the JavaScript simple
so you don't have any like you don't
have angular or react inside it so you
don't well he usually don't use node
package manager to fetch all these
dependencies it just really want to keep
it simple with this because it's already
very modular and easy to create
components I don't get the hots reload
that I mentioned then you also have have
I'll show you some of well how the
Joseph can look like in and because I
have a very huge product here that I'll
use as a basis to show you guys let's
see if we dive into this one and we've
got this this can be a JavaScript behind
the scenes oh it's still then yeah this
can be how Joseph can look like in a
huge file so it can be this sort of this
sort of the bad side with JavaScript I
would say because you have you have all
this requires modules but you need to do
so much stuff than this components that
is still stuck with the text editor and
as I scroll down you can see wow there's
a lot of JavaScript going on here and
promises and and
yes so since it's not that mature the
test framework is lacking it's difficult
to get control o at the same time if you
keep it in a in a small and consistent
package like two three pages up doing
really good stuff good animations you
can have small very consistent code on
it so so this is what the JavaScript
looks like here and some oh yeah so
several well most what you want to do
with fuses to clear most of it this
mocked in JavaScript but share it in UX
which which is comparable to summer so
you really want to create the grids and
rectangles and panels and even
animations should be declared inside
directive instead of coding animations
in JavaScript you do it here and then if
you want to bring in some external
components you use it you know which is
similar to C shop to recognize the
syntax and this is the way you you
includes libraries from Java and you
include libraries from Objective C yeah
but as you see it's still a bit complex
to do this so yeah so if you want to get
the the SDK version from iOS or some
Java you create these brackets with with
the apps in front of it and you can then
do the native code directly and return
that value to JavaScript all the way out
so I was thinking we should just build
something in fuse to see how it works we
have a blank few supplication here it's
just white I'll switch to that up
so this is basically the app when you
when you start a project you just create
the folder you have this is the the only
file I need to just get the fuse project
to recognize it as a fuse application
and it will add this eventually you can
put in the version number and things
that go into the Android manifest file
and all that comes in here eventually
this is basically the app so what I do
here now is I go to my terminal I can
write fuse preview and then if we will
I'm just sitting in the folder with this
call this I will see if fuse is firing
there it is so that's the that's the
basic preview this is the free version
that you see on the right hand side
there's also a professional version that
will give you more like drag and drop
things you can explore a bit more I'm
most been working with this and it's
it's working quite quite nicely
so if we go into the app here now I'll
just rely on this a bit and there's not
fires okay I'll just make the stuff by
making a written rectangle let's see and
I put the color on this can be red and
there we go it's Reds so it's just
filling the full screen so default in
infuses it's stretching to the
boundaries boundaries by default okay so
that's fine we have a rectangle all let
me see if you can just make this get
smaller maybe should be like this
okay 66 day problem type something wrong
here
there we go 60 60 okay and I would like
some more rectangles so let's have a
stock panel like this and we can and
then we can then have a fun thing that I
usually doing codes behind the scenes I
have I can create something called them
each in UX and in this I can just say
count four and get four rectangles and I
can do item spacing 18 all right um
spacing let's see it's not only each
it's on this back panel and say 18 okay
so we spread it a little bit looks like
and then I would like to align it the
other way or in so I keep its
orientation on it
let me see or is some tool so what I'm
using here is awesome two coats and
there is I'll just show you that quickly
because I get some intellisense is if we
can call it bad but there's a package
here called fuse it will give you some
syntax Healthcare orientation so that's
what how our sample is popping up there
we go
and I think this is what we will
recognize as a difference between UX and
sam'l because in in sam'l I would have
to say horizontal alignment and vertical
alignment and we have to say Center and
top in two different things here I can
say center left center right or just
Center so they kind of compressed it to
making them it's easy to to well he will
write less properties so just Center it
it was still well now it's centering
vertically and horizontally yeah so we
got some red dots there so what should
we do with that we can
make these things a bit more exciting so
I can open this bracket up let me see
we can create a linear gradient so just
type those in here and we can have a
gradient stop and would offset 0 with
color
do you have any color you want in this
application you have a hex value for me
just make one and see if it works
ss difficult to have 1 2 3 4 5 all thank
you there we go
okay are there much though oh that's
that's right you guys so awake oh it's
purple so we have to make this one a bit
different maybe should it work
what
ah that's true gradients well no its
gradient stops hmm okay just make it
great
oh it's there which was just just very
simply yeah so we we got something there
cool and then I would like to add a text
on top of it so I'll just make a panel
around it's a panel is just a simple
thing it will just stack things on top
of each other so if I make a text box
here I can say value hello like this
oh it says hello it's a bit Doric so it
just sets color white yeah there we go
and also like to align this in the
center of this box like this so I have
four gradient boxes that's doing nothing
but it says hello okay so we should do
something bit more fun with a focus so
what I'm thinking is I would love it I
would like to have a an area up here
with where it can animate this stuff so
if I click a box it could animate up
here it could expand maybe can do
something with the corner radius maybe
it can become a circle instead of a
square that we've gotten kind of nice so
try that so I'll create a panel up here
give it a name I can call it super Bock
large okay so it should be a large box
up here at some point I'll give it a
width could be a hundreds these are
relatives this is a relative size so it
will it's not pixels it will adapt to
the screen and density your house so it
looks similar on all the various screens
so you can say hundred fifty there as
well so we have a square box nothing
nothing and we're just align it to the
top centre so we can see where it is
that's it it's there okay and then we
put some margin on it just to whoops
just a bit further down okay so we want
this one inside this one how do you do
that all right so this box right here
should have a width of well it should
basically I should have some kind of
container around this box because if I
just move this box up here this one will
well the stuff that care will collapse a
bit because then you actually move the
one over four elements away from that
stack panel it will change so I create
this placeholder around it so I can
remove it without it losing its place in
the original in the original spots it's
an animation technique that you can use
for that so just make your I don't mean
the name of that but I just create the
same width on this wrapping panel from
small boxes so it's 6610 so now it has a
panel around it and the rectangle is in
there so I'm thinking of well I change
time this is the one I want to move so
this is my fancy box I can call it I'll
make you come around this this is sort
of the way work with fuse you start just
building everything in in one file and
explore you sit with a preview maybe put
it on device eventually and you just
figure it out but and the previous
greats in this way because you can sit
and explore the technology and all these
various components without building and
building and waiting and see how it
looks some device like three minutes
afterwards so I'll just experience with
this I'll put the grids here
60 height 60 okay it's still there if I
do something wrong it disappears so I
know it's good okay
so to do this animation then we need to
we need to have a selection API so I'll
just just make sure I have the code in
place here I'll show you it's pretty
similar and just do that do that the
chef's do oops
let's see
okay you can see immediately changed we
have the same boxes we have the super
box Lodge we are the same age we just
have different colors what I added now
is a JavaScript behind that's the only
change here so I really want the boxes
to be read from this one instead so I
give it every box in ID one two three
and four
I create something called observables so
I require from the fuse j/s library
observable library and observables are
extremely powerful in fees you have a
full API you can you can put a list in
it or you can just put a boolean a
string and integer and you can listen to
events on it so you can use JavaScript
functions like nothing if you have a
text and it change the text in real time
you can then inside a mock function you
can act on it it can do something you
can set the bool in from somewhere else
and you can you can have all these
dependencies together through the
observable API so we can imagine well
right now I'll just go to this basic
JSON right in this file in line we can
also fetch it from a back-end or your
API doesn't matter where it comes from
and then you just type it into the
observable that I declared right here so
I can declare a variable boxes equals
observable to enable it and then I by
saying replace all I just make sure that
every time I set this list it really
place all the existing elements with
this list or a new list so if you
refresh from the back end I could just
use replace all or some some other
function if you want to add at it's in a
different way and then I can use the
JavaScript require system so I just say
module exports and I export the name
boxes with the observable boxes so then
I have a JavaScript file here that I can
instead of having the counts here I can
just say items and I can say boxes like
this and it still doesn't say anything
else but I still have four boxes so it
means I'm also doing something right and
then I can start to date the bytes I
should do in some old I can data bind
the ID and text so let's start by
replacing hello with text like this and
this is zero one two three and four
inside the box as in the JavaScript and
now we can start because I now have a
different data complex for every box I
can now start to animate it and do
something with it so what you see in
this file is I've added something called
selection and this is the fuse selection
API which is pretty well-documented as
well but what I do here is I say I can
select one item at a time
I can select well happen but I don't
have to select any so that's why I set
minimum count to zero and a max count to
one so if I click on one element
something should happen if I click on
another element it should be exchanged
with the first one and so on
so with this I have some some some of
them so I can filter and we can start
with this while and you see all this
while thanks see you have built a little
Devon thing and the interaction around
this wild patterns so if I have
something said while true I can bind it
to a bool in like true/false I mean if I
put something inside wild food I can
show it and remove it based on that
value so everything stopped secured
inside what while true will be hidden or
enabled based on maps and you have this
see you have faults if the counter is
something if it's empty the list is
empty you have all these different
things so now I use while selected so if
the fancy box is selected
and I will do something with it and I'll
make a click event on this I see time is
flying so just make a small shortcut on
this as well you see
all right so based on that we have a
selectable API I now bind the ID to the
selectable API we still inside the fancy
box if you look at the JavaScript we
have the ID you one two three there's
something to have come every box on the
fixed events I just use something called
toggle selection which that will
communicate automatically with this
selectable and the selection API which
is up here that defines how many you can
select at the time and then we add them
from animation so as I said we have the
while true we have the while selected
and then we can do something quite cool
we can change the layout master or the
fancy box so the fancy box is still well
let's see if we can turn this on in the
fuse preview the fancy box is it should
be a blue line around it okay we can
still should be able to click it here as
well and you can see some yeah well it's
not that visible but now it's selected
all these four boxes in the preview so
you can see where where you are so we
still have the super box large up here
but it's without color it's 150 wide so
let's try to click it and see what
happens it animates and it changes
corner radius and the corner radius is
well we we do two things with animation
set one selected we set the layout
master to the super box Lodge which is
the placeholder of top right there and
we bring it to front it's just the
general thing you can do on all elements
in infuse you can bring it to front and
we'll stack on top on the top layer in
the same context and we change the
Superbook corner radius and super box is
I'll just name the rectangle itself
so a rectangle can have a corner radius
so you can make the rectangle a circle
so it's a nice trick so we change the
corner radius of the rectangle to 75
because the box up there is 150 it will
looks like a circle and the duration is
0.3 and the duration are set to 0.3 ml
days and when you select it and you
change the layout master you can add
something called layout animation on the
fancy box itself because this will
trigger when you change the layouts and
this is you get used to this the syntax
and what it does this is one of the hard
things in the beginning it's once you
try it a few times in the preview you
will just get it on your skin so you can
do move you can just scale it can resize
on animation when something happens so
we just changed the container and based
on that this one will trigger so I say
based I will move this element relative
to the world position change and that's
kind of the application the change in
the application where it moves in the
whole application not not in this inside
a slight bubble not inside this but like
the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates in the whole
application and I will do this with a
vectorial one I can say well I will just
move it with I am could try that I can
say I will move the X by by half the
relative distance and I will move the Y
with full relative distance and see what
happens okay
so it changed a bit and I can say I will
move it fully and they course you can
see it effects the animation now it goes
directly to the rectangle on top there
if I say I will move it by 2 X it goes
it doesn't change sideways first so you
get this bit of the animation but the
combination of x and y is Specter so if
I just say rector one it will smoothly
go up
left line to that box yeah it's pretty
smooth and then I want to resize it and
I'll do that is with back to what one as
well because I wanted to resize in a
consistent way on both width and height
in combination relative to the actual
size change between those two boxes and
I can do some easing on it as well so I
get this quadratic in the mouth it will
do some speeding and slowing at the
right time so that's basically what I
did to make this and I can click it as
fast as I want and you can see oh it's
reverses it will automatically reverse
the animation if you do something else
with it
and this is like a huge time saver you
can you can bypass the buckboard
animation you can you can set them well
you see I set a duration here you 0.3
but if I want something else on the bus
on the way back I can delay it in the
backwards animation or I can do duration
but sets of different things so it can
be very slowly on the way back it can be
super fast on the way in so you have all
these things you can do so
yeah I'll just show you the next step
and this eventually this small code I
just made this like super fast yesterday
just I probably used 90 minutes to make
this stuff some system fiddle with it
and I came up with this it's not super
beautiful so if you guys want to evolve
it into something super nice with great
color schemes and everything feel free
to do so what I see here is I put on
some more effects from this layout stuff
so I do a half tone thing I get tinting
and BOTS on the image behind it when I
click it and I change the corner radius
as before I can also change well I can
put a layer on top that I can use a
slider
and this slider is actually native
so if I run this from the iOS that will
get the native iOS slider here so I'll
keep a village to do this and blend that
mix these things together so so how did
I make this halftone let me see
that's the wrong project halftone is
simply adding image I just put it on the
App level or I could put it on on the
palm itself but this will automatically
stretch to the full size of the screen
and this is declared below the stack
panel with with the boxes and the slider
it will appear behind it just as in a
normal stack and these are building
built in functions in fuse you can have
Hall stones you can do you use
desaturate you can you Explorer if you
want on any layer in the application you
can just imagine the effects you can
create on on even list boxes okay set
some properties like smoothness and tint
and all these things that's hot phone
can provide and the image is just local
image or I can load it from a URL if I
want and the colors are now coming from
the JSON so I'm I'm binding this and
I've created separate classes of my
super box which is the rectangle and the
wrapper with animation in it so how do
you create a component from it well you
actually just create a new file you name
it super box if that's the name of my
rectangle super box top ueq and fuse
will automatically find that folder in
compile it and include this in your
project so everything you have to do is
instead of declaring it as a UX name to
declare it with the US class and that's
it you had then have a new class you
have a new component you can use the way
you use that component afterwards if
like this to get a new the character
thing you can if so my fancy box cloth I
can
use it like this I can see it with
properties that I declare so in my super
box I've declared two properties and
they do it like this I have a float for
that is basically a hex hex value and I
have a float for here which is the end
color so that enables me to to put it on
a PC yeah don't use it there actually
but I can also create dependences
because my fancy box now have
dependences to this container outside
right so every every element here is a
fancy box it has this width and height
but it needs to communicate with a super
box large to do this relative scaling
right so what I do is I pass in this
panel which is the placeholder to every
fancy box through this variable and in
size fancy box I can just Eclair the
same panel but instead of saying UX name
or something else because then I get a
new element I can say UX dependency so
then I'll just pass the pointer inside
the component and I can do the main
animations inside the components based
on the click so this is the click events
and we still have the same haven't done
anything with with them naming here it's
the same so just copy it from my big
file and break it into small components
as I go so that is just a very small
showcase on how you can explore fuse
from that perspective and I'll just fire
up a different project here as well just
to see something a bit more fancy so
just not navigate with terminal we can
go to the I'll show you guys yeah very
cool switch
someone made so this fire fuse preview
actually got a new preview in there okay
that's good so it's compiling the you
know code so everything is it's ready
build complete loading and there we go
so this is this is just a custom switch
basically doing the same stuff but it's
using a swipe gesture instead of just a
click gesture but it's doing animation
in the same way it looks a bit more
fancy though so you have you have a
combination of duration delays and you
can even swipe it then like slow like
this so it's quite cool and if you move
this code that you make you know start
with the simple apps and you move this
into its own file it can create a file
called toggle switch button dot ux and
you just give it a ux cloth on top then
it can reuse it in a very few
application you have on every page and
multiply it by a thousand forints if you
want and then you can hit it here is the
data complex so observable you can turn
things often off and on based on that
that's quite cool show it one more which
which is a bit more complete application
concept the wheel navigation shirt we
can fire off that and I didn't mention
that but do be able to publish this to
the app store all the after this use you
know well fuse built and then you say
configuration release and it builds your
apk package or your IP a package for iOS
and Android and you can upload that to
the store so it's it's pretty easy this
is kind of cool you can create this
experience it's tab control
and this is actually doable in fuse I
fit in a project now for the father lost
five months where we build these
experiences and then never done this
before
well not in this way built a lot of UI
in the process but fuse makes it's much
more simple and manageable using my
humble background and using the
JavaScript backgrounds in the ways you
see you just build on it to create
components all the time and you could
end up with something like this I'll
show you one more you can see we can
have the dynamite come bar she's
previous and it's easy to I can flip
them just foot gasps picked here I can i
can choose devices here if it's let's
see the ipod Rutina like this you can
scale it you can test it in various
various sizes just in the preview so
it's very fast to just have a feeling or
how it looks like and how it scales from
various devices so now this looks like a
more better application and it can
imagine if you have the JavaScript in
background you can replace the static
competence wits with just a real list
from the backend or the API and then
you're pretty much good to go
yeah any questions on this does it look
fun yeah yeah sure yeah well actually
I'll correct myself a little bit I'll
see if I can find the professional
version here if I I'm not sure it's not
like actually drag and drops it's more
like you see the full visual tree and
you can click on it and you can sort of
explore stuff I'm not sure if they built
the drag-and-drop yet but probably they
will just be able to drag and drop
things into the visual tree but you you
will only have to layout properties on
the right hand side you will to ten
margin some stretch mold and uniform to
sell and all these things you have to
select from you'll just have have a UI
to do it them yeah yeah so
from what you see in them how will this
expedition end you never know really
with new mobile framework if you don't
like this
hopefully it wants but it goes unlike
this so it's just being open-minded
diffuse I me first now fine to use
fantastic for these small nifty
applications I can easily deploy to
Android and iOS I personally I think
right now with I would probably prefer
fuse doing if I want to have these
custom animations in a one or two or
three page application it's great then
you have kind of control only with Java
so full control on the JavaScript size
you have most of it is declarative and
you can really concentrate in the
preview about making it super nice and
having all these small animations that
makes it stick out from the clouds in
the App Store a lot of it is about that
just making it stick out and creating
that wonderful user experience so yeah
right now I would I would do it for the
small applications and but if it's more
corporate if it's more enterprise I
would probably stick with summary in
many cases I'm just lean on the UI UI
kits iOS and Android and for some
projects I would definitely just use the
natives stuff no matter if if you're
doing a lot of peripheral equipment if
you want to connect to two other systems
if you really want the latest things
from from Apple one 3d touch game
sometimes you don't have that capability
for months maybe even yes in some
frameworks and if that's important to
you you should just stick with with the
native platforms directly as well so
that choice is always there but for me
it's like this hopefully this is this
whole travel selecting different
frameworks make me wiser and I can still
explore and how
fun and fuse definitely makes it more
fun so that's it hope you had a good
time
please come up to me enough questions so
meet me afterwards we happy to show you
a demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
