thanks for coming it's a lovely weather
out there and I know it's a challenge
being in here rather than being outside
and take nice walks by the river today
we're going to be talking about open
source and I usually start this talk by
asking a few questions so the first one
and foremost is how many of you do open
sourcing here no one awesome so that
would be a very very useful talk how
many of you wanted to do open source but
I have no idea where to get started
which is usually Talent right I mean I
want to do open source but I know know
where to start and my goal for today is
to give you a knife information about
how to go about doing your first open
source contribution and if you
eventually decide to take that on and
eventually turn to be a maintainer so
you have your own project out there then
there are some useful guidelines about
how to be a good maintainer as well so
we'll speak about how to get started why
you should get started with open source
and a checklist of the things that you
need to know of the things you need to
do when you decide to do open source and
then we'll talk a little bit about
contributing to open source and
maintaining open source projects and
another checklist for maintain is a few
points there that will make even better
at what you do right so my name is
christos Mathias or Chris I'll spray
with my surname I used to be an MVP and
in fact that was the shortest-lived MVP
in the UK only two months and then I
joined Microsoft so they took my title
away but now you know I work for
Microsoft so I am a premier field
engineer I want to try to describe that
it's a role between a dev and a
consultant and we work with customers in
doing lots of things surprisingly enough
the more customers that we visit these
days the more open source stuff they do
so it's not just Michael things that we
do now it's also open source stuff that
we have to know and help them and
support so I'm a speaker hello you can
see me here I blow quite a bit so I have
a site where a blog even after I joined
Microsoft I kept my own blog because I
think it's nice to have my own brand I'm
a break you're not the maker I tend to
break a lot of things and loss software
and love machines out there I'm a gamer
whenever I get time that
these days it's about 173 months so my
playstation sits quietly in the corner
I had dad and husband so they take a lo
of my time as well so a lot of different
things and I'm not just a developer or a
geek as my wife likes to call me and
this is usually me on my spare time so
I'll give you some time to go through
that you know if you are developers you
probably have ideas as well about doing
things everybody got the end kit see
loads and loads of different projects I
do lots of different things I play
around with code I break something and
then move on to something else
now that's how we learn and that's
that's the whole point here and open
source allows us to do a lot of these
things without feeling guilty about
breaking stuff or you know picking into
software that we should not be picking
in and breaking license agreements and
all these things so my first experience
with open source was totally accidental
right I never thought about contributing
to open source because I never thought I
had the skills to do it I mean I was
developing for about how was it maybe
nine years before I did my first
contribution and even though I had
really good experience with software I
always felt that I was not competent
enough to contribute so I joining a
company I was working as a consultant so
they give me the source code and I open
it it was a dotnet application how many
of you are dotnet developers by chance
so we have point of reference you are a
JavaScript JavaScript awesome so we have
nougat which is a packet monitor same as
NPM and in.net you're allowed to
actually check in all the packages into
your source code or you can say your
video when it builds to go and pull the
stuff out of the web so I was thinking
this is a massive project we have lots
of nichkhun packages why do we have them
in source control that doesn't make any
sense so I went and flicked the switch
and said I'd build time go and grab the
packages now this was my first day at
the contract right they gave me the
source code I changed stuff second
automatic build kicks off everything is
broken
I was like 2:00 p.m. on my first day
broke everything broke the build
congratulations so I spend about three
was trying to figure out how to reverse
that because apparently flicking the
switch is just one single tick but
changing that it takes a lot of effort
because every single CS prods file like
an NPM init file or config file will
have settings there to say when you
build go and grab the packages
automatically so that was I had to mess
with the XML and it's it's a painful
process and there was nothing documented
out there which was a bit odd
so I documented that at the end I went
home I said to my wife I broke
everything it was a fun day first day in
the office you know I had to bring
Donuts the next day for everybody else
and I said I'll spend some time just
trying to blog about it because there's
nothing out there and that's what I do i
blog about everything I break and make
and have fun and I blog life ins about
eleven o'clock and I tweeted about it in
hope that one of my 800 bought followers
will retweet that and apparently then
you get him pick it up and said this is
an awesome article why do you not just
put it in the docs so the new get
documentation that everybody reads when
they have issues was like yeah okay I'll
send you an email and the guy goes no no
just send us a PR or a pull request and
we'll merge it in I had no idea what to
get this guy I was like it's like
totally alien to me so I spend the next
three hours so we're talking about 11 -
maybe - am learning about get learning
about poor request learning about github
and all these crazy stuff and then send
a pull request and eventually about 2:00
a.m. in the morning us time was probably
normal hours maybe 6 6 p.m. at night my
food requests got accepted oh my god so
I grab my laptop and run into the
bedroom to my wife and say Luke Luke
that's my first full request look at
that and she goes you know half asleep
he's like what are you talking about
it's like look this is big deal you
don't understand do you think okay we'll
have a talk in the morning right we had
a ton in the morning and he knows now
that she leaves with a geek and things
like that will happen but I ended my
lesson no waking up at 2:00 a.m. in the
morning but my first contribution thanks
to Jeff who was leading the team at the
time was totally accidental I never
meant to do it and overnight I learned
how to do poor requests obviously
struggling along and raining
instructions but I did it it was my
first request now I could've gone
totally wrong I could have been like
this is solar crap don't do it again
it was awful and then now we have
totally turned me
of open source but it's actually opened
the floodgates that was my first massive
contribution to community I mean the new
get documents they get read by so many
developers out there when they have
issues so I mean I was thinking even
hundred people in the world if they read
that that's hundred people more areas
out there so like oh I can do more of
that you know I can contribute more it's
easy so your talents or your experience
with open source does not have to be the
same it can be totally different to mine
and everybody has a totally different
experience in joining an open source
community but what I'm trying to say
here is that it's totally easy it can be
totally accidental or it can be a
purposeful one as we're going to be
discussing today and this is what I'm
going to tell you about so what is open
source I think most of us out there know
what open source is but just for clarity
definition it's software whose source
code is open and available for
modification and Hassman
and enhancement by everyone or on our
way right it's open source software that
is made available with a license that's
very important because there are
different open source licenses and we'll
discuss about that in a little bit in
which copyright holders do give you the
right to study open and you can see how
things work it's an excellent tool as
well for you to learn how code works in
a brand new environment so what is open
source it's a community and a concept
such a community because we have
thousands if not millions of developers
out there doing open source work and
contributing their free time and their
free hours to do that work but it's also
a concept because new developers branded
the field stayed out of university even
in university or before even university
as they do work with code they can work
with really experienced developers I
have been out there for 20 30 years
maintaining projects and learning from
them so as a community we grow together
and we build better software ok so who
uses open source software in fact every
single one of us in here uses open
source on a daily basis even if you
don't want to admit that and when I was
asked by a junior developer in one of
the teams and the question was like why
do you do it and I said let's think
about that how many tools that you used
today you think they're open source so
you spend like maybe 30 seconds thinking
about
and here lies a more more of the more
than half the tools that we were using
today were open source very good
examples so everyone is using open
source the US Department of Defense I
mean if they get it wrong you know it
can go horribly wrong so they rely on
open source to run their stuff the city
of Munich in Germany Spain the Federal
Aviation Administration the stock market
for the French parliament Cuba and a lot
of other organization as well bonus
points if anyone can guess what's the
picture on the right hand side a little
it's a large hadron collider yeah that
runs on open source and every single
submarine out there is also running on
open source this is just a few examples
right so everyone was doing it the cool
kids were doing it so the big company
started doing it as well this was Apple
two or three years ago coming out with
the statement Apple the first major
computer company to make open-source
development as a key part of our
software side C now the the point over
there was the first major contributor
which was like wait a minute the
community just jumped on that it was all
over Twitter and people were laughing or
making jokes and everything else so my
Apple decided to maybe backtrack that
and change the statement over a couple
of days so they were like open-source
software is at the heart of the Apple
platform so sounds a little bit bare not
the first major contributor and then we
have this one anybody knows who said
that Linux is not in the public domain
Linux is a cancer that attaches of in an
intellectual property sense
hello Steve Ballmer Microsoft that was
in 2001
you guys know where we are today right I
mean I don't have to spell it out but
there's a massive banner which I forgot
to put in Microsoft loves Linux we
actually announced a snake or on the
Linux conference the HUD conference
which was just insane getting on stage
releasing a product at somebody else's
product and working in the essence of or
the legacy that we left in 2001 and
changing that whole mentality in 2015
2016
and that was probably maybe a month ago
you can see reporters with the most open
source contributors their max of the
sitting at fifth place we have Facebook
as well so these are coming some
multi-billion companies relying and
contributing to open source in fact Mac
so it's at the top of the most open
source contributors in the world right
now
it's just insane stuff so this is a nice
start for a snake or how many of you
follow a snake or there are new open
source web platform okay so SNS core is
open source from the onset roadmap is
out there in in the open and the
community is also working together to do
that so these are the this map depicts
the contributors per country in 2014
okay so fast forward to 2015
what's that 2016
oh man skip town look at that its
massive right look at how many
contributors would get outside the
company in fact a a snake or has about
forty percent as a whole contributions
from the community so for the whole
thing it's built by 40 percent
contributions from the community so
that's insane I think 2017 will just be
a green overlay over the map okay and we
also have the dotnet foundation so the
the new open-source Microsoft where we
actually allow you to host your or
submit your project to work with the
open source community within Microsoft
so although it says Microsoft is
actually a small subset of Microsoft
what they do though is they give you the
space and support and they help you
market your project they help you to
give you some space and give you legal
advice they give you resources for
Microsoft for your project so if you
have anything that can benefit the
community especially the dotnet
community then you can actually submit
it it doesn't have to be a product that
you know it needs to be used by maksim
but if it benefits the community you can
out there and then you can be side by
side with a snake core and the core
framework and Rozlyn and zama in the
mono and everything else so it's a
massive project we do have a lot of open
source projects in there and every day
we are new so reach out to the community
if you ever get that state
but then again it's not just Microsoft
right I'm talking about Microsoft
Microsoft we're not the only ones doing
all sorts in fact we're too late into
the game we're just trying to cut up and
we're doing it fairly quickly
other projects nodejs it's open source
of course and we have tons of
contributions angularjs all open source
as well everyone is using it bootstrap
is open source and too many to list here
I mean there are thousands of thousands
of projects out there that are open
source and we use them every day so why
should you care right I mean why should
you be involved it takes time it takes
effort but let me tell you why it's cool
I mean if you say I'm doing open source
people think these guys doing Linux
kernel stuff he knows he knows what he's
doing right he's he's a hacker I mean he
tell people open source all right I'm
pretty sure that quite a few today will
probably never have guessed how you can
contribute and I'll tell you how you can
contribute don't have to write Linux
kernel code that's it I thought I
thought it was the same thing I was like
I don't know C++ I can contribute to
Linux I thought that was open source
it's not it's really cool but if you
tell people that you're doing open
source that's what they think so it
elevates you you'll build a great
network half the people I met here I met
them in conferences and stuff I spoke to
them before I even met them in person
and that was because I was doing
contributions helping out raising bags
and discussing with them about things so
by getting involved with open-source you
are becoming part of the community and
then your name will be heard and then
you might eventually become really good
friends with some of the really
established people in the community
you'll get help and support I mean if I
have issues here sometimes even with
Microsoft products rather than going
through the 20 layers of interaction and
jumping up through hoops I go directly
to the source because I know this guy's
right and that's insane and not just
with the.net products or the Micra
products it's also with third-party
libraries that you might be using like
react staff you might be a node staff
and you get to work with these people
even contributing a teeny tiny thing
they do appreciate to the point that
eventually if you reach out and say I
have a problem
they might take time off their staff to
help you out so that's fantastic you
join the community you join the big
family of open-source so that will help
you as well when you get stuck with
something it's not just you
No I'm making friends and so on but
you'll also make friends you'll become a
better developer obviously you're going
to put your code out there in the public
domain and God knows how many people are
going to see that right so usually
before you even get your pool request
accepted which is one of the ways that
we work with open source these days
which means that you take your changes
and you merge them to the main branch of
the code you're gonna get some feedback
back you might be really good job well
done
congratulations are gonna be accepted or
you might get well I think you've missed
something out or you could do this
better or if you get stuck halfway
through your task you can always reach
out and say look I'm doing this task but
I'm stuck can you help me out a little
bit and this is where you get the
feedback this is where you get the
support and this is where you get the
the mentorship which comes for free
because you're contributing something
and you get something in return so
that's fantastic you become a better
developer and obviously you get feedback
from random people that come into your
code and say this is very good or this
is very cop and you should eat some some
how else it's great for your CV I was
giving this exact same talk last year
and Rob Connor was sitting in the same
audience OHS oh my god is rock on me so
I said it's gonna help you with your CV
in fact it can be the better a testament
of your skill set by saying I've
contributed to 10 projects and people
will see that and they might know you
might get a job without any test or
interview process or anything else they
might reach out to you and say look
you've done I've seen what you done and
github how about you come and work for
us I'm kidding you not now in the US is
it slightly different in the u.s. before
you join one of the good companies that
you know they they offer good stuff like
Facebook or Amazon or whatever you need
to have your name out in the public
domain and even smaller companies now
start to look into that because if you
are contributing to open source you have
a certain level of competency that
people will rely on to use your software
ok so that's a better testament of your
skill set rather than sitting for half
an hour doing random tests and that's
that's fantastic and you build your
network as well and you might even get a
job without even having to apply because
you come into these places and people
know you from your open source
contributions I say look this is an
amazing guy and you're looking for
dotnet developer or a JavaScript
developer
they've done an amazing job so you know
you should look at our habitat in fact I
was offered a job like that insane
things happen so it's great in the u.s.
is becoming mandatory in the UK it's not
that they're there but if you do any
open source work I can guarantee you
that if you put on your CV people will
go directly into that and they will skip
the whole thing sometimes I hope look
into that I mean I would prefer to do
that for a developer and for them saying
oh I've worked with a Marine and then
okay how do I know you've done that what
if you have a library for Zahara in that
anybody can consume then obviously that
that's a very good indication you've
done some work and finally free stuff
free software guys I'm kidding you not
if you do open source work and you have
a project out there in the public domain
even just one and you can reach out to
companies like telluric and red gates
and submit a form that you say this is
my project it's my name and you know you
can find the URL to my open source
project and you'd get free stuff xamarin
used to do that with their license so if
you were doing anything that was
pertinent or related to xamarin they
would give you almost 2 grand worth of
free software before they were bought by
Microsoft and everything became free it
was 2 grand worth of software and then
Red Gate would give you the full toolset
for you to work with and then you had
resharper they also did an open source
license now what's the insane thing is
that MVPs also get benefits as I'm max
Renn BBS but the max of MVPs get less
stuff from they're the same companies
than if you were applying as open source
so I had the Red Gate to set and I said
I'm also an MVP totally related and I
said yeah you can get these three
subsets what as an MVP I get less than
open source and this is how companies
are you know I realized that open source
is important in fact if you're using
these tools on your spare time it's
almost guarantee that you'll go home or
you'll go to your office and say look
I'm using this amazing - why no use in
here as well there's definitely benefit
for them as well but for me I mean
thinking that in a very self self this
way I got free stuff that's one way to
get started with open source who knows
ok why do I care now this is why do I
care because I can build software by
standing on the shoulders of giants like
really clever people out there that I
have no
way to compare to they build amazing
libraries amazing tools that I can pull
off the web as a package or whatever and
work with that so as a community we're
doing so many good things by building
the software and allowing everyone to
use it and obviously you don't have to
rewrite angular from scratch because
it's already out there right I mean
imagine having to write all the software
for you in the past we would do that
it's just amazing right and imagine if
we didn't have to fix bugs every single
day and we were working all together
into propelling humanity into something
better by using our skill set obviously
that's not a reality but in an ideal
world okay so let's say I've convinced
you now that you should be doing some
open-source work this my recipe for a
successful open source project find the
project to contribute write some code
send a pull request magic happens you
make money right nobody makes money from
open source to be honest and it's insane
because if you think about it we spend a
lot of time I mean millions of hours
every year contributing to open source
and creating projects so why do we do it
very rarely you'll get money but you do
get all the other benefits I described
earlier on and you're gonna become a
better developer that's guaranteed or a
hope so how do you get started now let's
say I've convinced you you want to be a
contributor and how do we get started
first of all you need to find a project
that actually excites you okay so if you
are using a tool day by day basis and
you think you can make it slightly
better or there's something missing from
that project then you can do that just
find something excites you although I
was writing that I was thinking maybe
you can find a project that you really
hate because you have to use it but it's
absolutely awful so how can we make it
better by contributing into it so you
don't have to be excited about the
project just have to use it and want to
use it more and you can think I can
contribute to that if you're going to
contribute to a project make sure that
they're looking for help because some of
them are open-source they're out there
in the community but they don't accept
to requests because they think they're
quite mature so it might be out there
they might have been out there for two
three years it's heavily used by the
don't accept contributions so make sure
that you you get that
contributing to a project that's still
active again if it's a project that was
out there for five years and they
haven't been any updates in maybe three
then obviously it might still be using
dotnet - or npm 1.1 and then there's no
real point in upgrading it unless you
have to use it obviously at which point
you might want to fork it and create a
copy and reach out but make sure it's
active sometimes used actively and you
should only contribute if you're happy
with the licensing now we did mention a
little bit about licensing so if you are
getting a project as an open source
project make sure that it has a license
because otherwise people can use it and
then a company that wants to consume
open source they need to have a license
attached to it otherwise just because
you put it in the public domain there's
no make it open source that's very
important
okay so licensing is what makes your
software open source and if there's a
license out there there was GPL
licensing which was quite restrictive so
even though it was open source it was
very addictive in the way that you use
it and people said well I don't want to
contribute to anything that has to do
with GPL there was a nice chart a couple
of days ago that actually shows how MIT
licensing which is another open source
license has overtaken GPL by a large
margin which is nice now because it
means that less people contribute to GPL
based projects and it's going away
because it was quite restrictive and in
the way they worked but make sure that
you're happy I know people that would
not contribute to GPL based projects
just a reference so look into that and
where do you get started I mean where do
you find all these projects I mean
people say I'm contributing all the time
but where did you find the project so
there are some really good sites out
there that allow you to reach out if
your first time ever ever ever ever
there are two one or two ones the first
timers only and your first PR which is a
nice Twitter handle I'll set the deck as
well later on so you don't really have
to copy it but the idea is that if you
never done open-source before these
sites have really really simple tasks
for you to do some of them might be
documentation some of them may be
something else like sorting out or
fixing very very small bugs and I'll
tell you what every single documentation
out there has typos so if you find that
you can want to be in fact I got my name
as an asp.net contributor by fixing
documentation because I was reading it
something at 11:00 p.m. at night and
wouldn't make any sense it was like a
sentence I thought somebody has written
it but did not really know English well
to write English in a way that would
make sense so I was reading it like four
times it wouldn't make any sense so it's
out to the the maintainer said look can
I change this sentence to these sentence
do you think it's right
I said yeah go for it so I did that and
then the next day my name appeared and
if you go into github you'll see the
contributions you've done a snake or was
at the top people don't know what you've
done it was just a simple sentence right
we can say well I'm going to get into
all a snake or it can be the same for
NPM or whatever you use so it's the
simple things that you know the add
value even though if it's that's just
one sentence people read that and say
well you know it seems better now so why
not but for other things up for grabs
dotnet for mainly for dotnet code but
you can find other projects there so
they have issues in github or whatever
other repositories that they mark with a
specific label that allows them to
publish that project into up for grabs
and this is where you go and say I want
the task in dotnet and they say whether
it's advanced intermediary or beginner
and you can pick up tasks from there
same for issue hub and open hearts they
do have the exact same functionality but
if you're a bit more advanced you can
use code trial tears which sends you an
inbox from projects that you've
registered and it will send you an issue
every day on your inbox so you can have
a look into that and say well I won't
take it or not and they pull requests or
let's that's if you feel adventurous
about it this is where you get a pull
request that waits for a viewer to go in
and say I like your code or you've made
a mistake here or you could do better so
this is these are the sides that most
people would go in and look into that
alternatively you can go to github if
you know already a project are you
working on and you've you've used it
quite a bit and grab it from there and
become a contributor as well now this is
my contributors checklist I mean this is
the important stuff first of all you
need to learn how to get or use git
if that makes sense this is crucial
because whether we like it or not the
open-source language speaks get so the
basic commands did pull git fats there's
ample documentation out there if you go
to the official get side they have a
very good documentation about the things
that they do
every single person out there has also
written a blog post about how to do
something so the nine basic commands are
there just learn them and use them you
don't need anything else find a tool
that works for you command line GUI
whatever works for you and use it but
that's the starting point you need to
learn how to do the basic commands in
git now if you find the project that you
want to contribute to make sure that you
read the contribution instructions and
that's very important so they will say
if you want to contribute go and fault
the project they will give you a set of
instructions this is how you run it
locally and this how you do things and
they also have instructions about how to
write the code and whether you should
reach out to them first and that's the
next one contact the owner so if you say
I found a bug don't start fixing you
without communicating with anyone
because they might already be looking
into that bag and fixing it on the side
so the first thing that you need to do
is maybe raise an issue or it's out to
them by email or Twitter and say look
I'm using your software I love it I
found a bug or a thing we can add a
feature here and you can start the ball
rolling right and I might say yes yes
please go and do it or they might say
don't worry about it it started in the
backlog we've already done some work so
please don't spend any time on that but
if you want to contribute you can do
something else so reads out the owner
because honestly you might spend maybe
two weeks worth of time and then they
might not accept your request because it
doesn't fit their backlog or whatever
don't change coding standards I was
going to put a Tubbs versus spaces there
because that's one of the things that
get people rambling the another thing is
obviously if you're using tools like
ethics co-op or document documenting
your methods in a certain way
I don't like comments some people really
like comments but if I have to
contribute to their project that's all
commented out then now we need to abide
to that rule so if you are contributing
just stick without code structure or
that code pattern that also allows you
to learn about new ways to write code
right somebody some people might like
link a very verbose links a might some
people might like using lambda
expressions so try to adjust their needs
because that will also make you a better
developer that's where we're coming back
into working with different styles of
code
do not do not change encoding standards
attached related unit tests so if you
are fixing if you're if you're fixing a
bag or attaching a new feature into the
the solution there is no better way to
get your pull request accepted by saying
these are the unit tests guys right so
I've worked really really hard and I can
prove that this is working I can also
prove that this is not going to change
our break your code in a way that you
don't expect so if you are sending a
poor request make sure that it has the
attached related unit tests if you are
if you find bugs before even start
working maybe you can send the
screenshot or steps to recreate I think
I read somewhere that it's becoming the
norm now to send small videos or gifs
where the somebody just goes to the
steps and does it which doesn't really
make him sense I mean imagine as a
developer somebody says your application
is not working this is a video that I'm
showing that it's no working it's even
better if you actually put in text and
say these are the steps I followed and
this is the exception ago because that
actually proves that it's working in
salsa replicatable and be patient if you
send a poor request in it doesn't mean
that it's gonna be accept overnight I
had I have poor requests out there that
have been sitting for a while and nobody
has really looked it to them I tend to
reach out and say look I've got a pull
request here do you want to have a look
maybe you're busy or you know I
understand some of them have like 120
pull requests I tend to convey quite a
lot to the user documentation right now
and they have their own backlog so if I
find something that's not documented I
will go in write a little bit of a blog
post or whatever and then contribute
back to their dogs but they have a
massive backlog so they might say well
do not attach it for another two weeks
so be patient and don't like exact acts
expect your poor request to be
automatically accept it might take a
couple of weeks ok so now we're moving
from being a contributor to being a
maintainer right so that's fantastic
actually before we go into that and say
that year-old rock stars if you're doing
it a couple more things now we did say
that you don't have to write Linux
kernel code which is what people think
that you're doing but what can you do if
you haven't done any open source and
you're not really confident enough maybe
you're straight out of uni don't really
have a lot of experience
so some of the things they can do
obviously and I've mentioned before
documentation very important because you
can go and contribute the documentation
and usually documentation is pretty crap
with open source because most people are
bored they want to write the code and no
documents and that really helps you
because writing documentation means they
have to go through the code it means
they have to understand how the code
works you write the docs so that's one
way you're getting up to speed any
cheesier as well because it doesn't it
doesn't require a lot of pressure other
things you can do is you can actually
replicate issues so if somebody raised
an issue about the software you can grab
it fork it in your own environment and
run it because sometimes they might
raise the issue because they were
running let's say NPM on a Mac OS with a
specific version of Mac and it wasn't
working but he download on Windows and
try to run the same thing and it's
working so that's a that's one way to
eliminate certain things so the
developer will not really have to worry
about Windows because it knows it's
working and you've just proved it by
saying well it works on my machine and I
have Windows and that person in that
version but it still for reduce the
scope of the bag so that's helpful plus
you get you up to speed on how you run
software on your own machine sometimes
you can contribute by creating the
public image of the project so maybe
it's a big project but I don't have a
public domain that people can go and see
stuff and it's only github so maybe you
can create a website for them but they
might want to use or maybe on a website
you can go into some tutorials on how to
do things with a software or you can
even do some graphic work that's
actually quite helpful um I have a
friend that is not really good at
developing but he's an awesome designer
and he started contributing to open
source by creating logos because you
know naming and finding a name for your
project and maybe attaching a nice logo
to that adds value but you know world
struggle with naming so let's say the
naming is old but we want to create a
nice logo that people can really relate
to and I'm a crappy designer I would
never do anything with design so this
guy is amazing and he can contribute to
that so he's he's doing his bit about
open source and he doesn't have to write
a single piece of code so it's another
way to contributing things and you can
put your name in there so let's say now
that you're a maintainer and you rock
because you spend your time and you're
free you know your spare time in doing
these things you don't get paid for it
which is very insane we do it and all
don't get paid and you know we won't
thank you because we use your software
in a single every single day but I'm
pretty sure there's a little bit of
scope there for becoming a better
maintainer so first things first if you
are going to put a project out there in
the public domain make sure that you're
not doing it for the sake of it you
don't say well I opens or something
there's a lot of software out there that
it's just pet projects that we're done
over a weekend and they're dumped out
there in the public domain which is fine
I mean it can be a public repository but
did not really advertise an open source
because obviously you have to maintain
it so open source is not just for
Christmas as I like to say it's for a
lifetime people would use your software
I've got sample code from blog post I
wrote and people go and grab it from
github and they say it doesn't run this
is from two years ago man it's not for
consumption so be careful how you
advertise your project when I do it and
when I put stuff in github that relate
to my blog post for example I don't put
a license there because people snore
really be using it and I also put
instructions out there saying this is
just for my you know for this blog post
and link back if you want to use it and
please be aware that it's not open
source and time something like that so
people know that it's not maintained and
it's not up to date and should not be
looking into using it great contribution
guidelines now this is from the reverse
side of things where people come into
your software and they have no idea how
to run it don't need Python my machine
to run stuff why do you not put in there
don't need NPM do I need something else
what tools do I need to use do I need to
use vim VI does it only run in Visual
Studio do I need to have a specific edit
or so it's all these things that you
give out guidelines like if you're going
for the first time and try to contribute
you want to know and read these things
how to set up your environment so the
exact same thing in there if you don't
have time to write code the documents
please adhere in tests because sometimes
even a sample project can be more of
value to someone rather than reading the
documents because they will go into your
code and see how it works
maybe if you create a library and have a
sample code that actually calls into the
library to do some stuff that can be
more of value rather than having
documents and spending hours and hours
maybe one of the new contributors will
come and write your documents for you
I'd set up instructions that goes back
into the contributor contribution
guidelines
also things like this is what you need
to download and please do not change my
coding standards don't go from tabs to
spaces and back and forth whatever you
prefer but the idea is that you need to
set up expectations otherwise people
will spend time and then you'll say well
I can't accept your request because you
did not read my instructions so it's a
nice reference point for you be open to
criticism yeah you put your code out in
the public domain and sometimes there'll
be comments coming back saying your code
is crap or your code is very slow or it
doesn't run people tend not to be bad in
you know when they discuss or consume
open-source but some of them can be so
if you're going to put your code out
there be be a bit of a thick skin and
say right okay well I I accept your
comment maybe can show me how to do it
better and this is how again you become
a better developer include a code of
contact unfortunately over the last
couple of years we were seeing this more
and more where people need to include
code of contacts in their open-source
projects only because some people tend
to misbehave or or being really mean to
each other it doesn't happen often I
mean I've been working with open source
for three years I'm a noob still but in
every single project I've been I haven't
really seen any bad instance though was
one the guy a guy raised an issue from a
year ago and he went back to the report
to say this is still open and nobody's
looking into that and decided the whole
conversation of look it's open source if
you want to fix it you're more than
welcome to send a poor request he was
like no no that's not how it works well
and the guy said well if you want to pay
me I'll fix it tomorrow so that's how it
works
this is open source we contribute for
free there's no expectations there's
that false entitlement for people when
they consume open source they have that
false entitlement that they are allowed
to say or do whatever they want so code
of contact protects you from things like
nothing you say well you're banned from
my repo so thank you very much but you
know we're not gonna be listening to you
anymore
adding explicit open source licenses
again this goes back into if you have
something very useful that people want
to consume I know big companies out
there that they can consume really
useful projects because they don't have
a license attach them so that's toting
them from using your software and
getting loads and loads of you seeds and
downloads and benefiting everybody else
so make sure you are a licensed in fact
these days if you go to get
I might have a quick demo we have enough
time Hamas how much more time do here
you know what time do we finish okay so
we might have some time to do a couple
of demos but the idea is that when you
create a new project now in github it
says would you like to attach the
license which is fantastic because it
takes all about you know having to go
into the MIT license site and grab the
site for you so he says which license
would you like to attach which is
brilliant and be supportive of new
members so maybe you've been doing it
for 10 years maybe you're ace maybe
you're a hacker maybe you're the best
developer out there but everybody has to
start somewhere and people will make
mistakes so if somebody does want to
contribute and they don't get it right
be supportive if somebody reads out to
you for help please be supportive
because I would never be here if it
wasn't for Jeff three years ago when he
said to me you know raise a paw request
and we'll accept it and he was you know
very helpful given some comments back
saying this doesn't look good fix it and
then I fixed and said right that's
fantastic we'll take it thank you very
much for contributing so that's that's
the whole point I mean it was really
much I didn't do much for them but the
contribution was very important to them
and he said thanks I mean that's that's
the best thing you can get and when
things go bad now if you are a
maintainer of a project things do change
life and that's life circumstances you
get kids but take take up all of your
time you don't have enough time to do
open source with young kids maybe you
have to move maybe you're maybe you're
out of job maybe you're in a transition
period maybe something happens right
just let people know this is a nice way
to just put a nice banner in your
project saying this is not maintained
I'm looking for maintainer sand it
happens quite often people will say I
don't have enough time to do this
there's anyone the community want to
take over and people do tend to jump
into the opportunity to say well I would
like to do that and these days most
projects do you have one or two
maintainer that you know the co-owned
the project so it's easy to pass the
torch if you don't go out put the butter
out there say look I can't look into
that right now
I might be back in two years if anybody
wants to use the project please be aware
it's not maintained feel free to take
over ownership you might be tired or
bored it happens you know you might have
too much to do at work and
you don't want to contribute any more or
the last hydrant Collider implodes
explodes and humanity is wiped
that's fine how about can things go this
is a comment that somebody put out there
for a project so this guy Keystone Jas
maintains this project and this guy went
back and said your documents which is
also mistyped and our filled with lies
you heard the community and you should
stop I mean it's open source right if it
doesn't like it he does have to use it
no but he hasn't paid any money for that
that's the force of Titan was talking
about and this is just one of their
hundreds of thousands people have gone
off open source only because they had
this kind of you know dealership dealers
dealing with the community so let's say
to be good at each other right rather
than I'm doing these things so there are
more useful things out there and there's
a nice book called the cathedral in the
bazaar if you ever want to go and read
onto that rather than writing code I
would prefer to write code rather than
doing this and I think we have some time
for some demos so how many of you use a
github here don't know it awesome how
many of you have done a poor request on
github
nice so you got some open source work
some of you said you haven't okay
so if you were to to do that and I do
have a few projects that I contribute so
it's just gonna jump into that I hate so
so one of the things they can always do
is go into a repository and find issues
you can always find them here at the top
and say I want to look into stuff and
open at some point when my phone decides
to there you go so one of the things you
can put here is create a new issue or a
new bag and do that you can also fork
the project so this is what we do when
we copy the project over to our own
environment so if I were to click on
that it says where do you want to copy
this and I already have a copy of this
so there's no point I can just do that
so we'll go and copy that for me so you
can see now rather than being at Brady's
website where on my
sigh or my my account my poster and this
is my copy which is 4pi Brady so if I
start doing any changes here
Brady will not be able to see them it's
not as simple as that
and then if something changes in my
environment and I can do a new pull
request so this the whole point you can
click into that Brady will love me for
doing this but there's nothing really to
change or compression if I had to do it
if I had done it changed and you could
see it but you'd get the the basic idea
of how things work and it doesn't have
to be loads I mean I have probably about
50 projects in my side which are forth
from random places some of them I
contributed to some of them I haven't
contributed to but it's all about
looking and learning about the code so
let me go back into my slides so I'll
leave some time for questions if you
have any questions about open source and
whether you came across any stories or
in here we'd like to share with us and
I'll be more than happy to answer things
but that's the idea I mean you cannot
ask anything about open source did you
do you find any value today when we
discussed about open sourcing had to get
started I know some of you have no
contribute before so yeah you're gonna
go out and do some open source today
awesome well I think I think that's me
we have probably 10 minutes left
yeah grab some coffee unless you have
questions and feel free to reach out to
me
how much time do I spend I do yeah but
the kids go to bed and then the wife
goes to bed and I stay outfits at crazy
hours in the morning but that's me you
don't I know some people that depending
on how you work I mean I work full-time
so it's not easy for me to say I'm not
gonna good customers because I want to
do open source but if you are a
consultant a lot of freelancers 10 to
the open-source where they will you know
the man is the time in a total different
way that we manage those full time so
they might say I won't take 2 days a
week to do some open source work and
contributions but these are guys that do
hardcore contributions and they they
write the whole framework for me it's on
my spare time and sometimes if I find
something now
I'm very reactive I'm not really
managing things like I don't have a
project that I maintain all the time and
my projects that I have out there tend
to be quite mature so they don't change
that often my the ones are building on
the Azure SDK that might change so I
change them every time the address TK
comes out run the tests if that works
then happy so I do that everything else
I do and these days I do a lot of
documentation I'm kidding you not I'm
probably if you check my github
environment you'll see that I've got a
contribution every single day because I
work with the azure documentation all
the time and I'm a customer so I'm
trying to explain to them how to do
things if I find something that doesn't
stand right or if there's a bug in the
code then I will fix it so it might I
might take an hour or two throughout my
day just to fix something but if I if I
were to do like we have that project
with Brady right now which is a tool set
for azor inside Visual Studio code so
allows you to do to manage all your
infrastructure by using Visual Studio
code and that's totally cross-platform
open-source you don't have to have any
dependencies so that tool we are quite
invested into that so I might take three
or four hours a day but then again there
might be two or three months I don't do
any open source it's it's totally down
to you how you did because you manage
your time sometimes if you're yes um yes
or no I mean you're consuming something
that might be open source maybe I don't
know autumn apparent net and if you find
a bug you're gonna go erase an issue
that's your first contribution I mean it
doesn't have to be code code or you
might find something that's missing the
dogs and raise that with Jimmy who
maintains support the product the idea
is that anything any simple thing you do
it's a contribution to open-source does
have to be code or code or tests okay
and you have to you can manage your time
I mean for me it's when everybody is in
bed because that's the only time I have
free or when I'm traveling it's more
flexible because I don't have any anyone
around me when I go back to hotel but
again that's that's personally I know
other people take time off work to do
that you can't do it full-time because
obviously unless you get a sponsor for
it that will pay the money for you then
it's very hard to make
living out of that because it's open
source they don't pay for it yeah
inclination in that that's that's a very
important thing and we are seeing a
curve and shift in the culture some
people not join companies and unless
they're allowed to do open source not
through the company time but on their
own because there are companies out
there that in the contract they say that
ami code you develop while you're
employed by us even on your spare time
belongs to us which is insane because
not many people do open source but
eventually if you develop a very
successful tool that people tend to use
the company might go and say we want to
monetize on that and that belongs to us
so that's a very very important clause
in your contract you might want to have
a look into that before you even get
started maybe something as we've
included in the slides but yes lots of
companies do fix things I mean I had a
company that I did a talk on a national
core and they said we fix something with
in fact the framework the logging
framework that was causing issues but we
are in a battle with our legal team
because we want to contribute that
externally and send it back but or send
a poor request but one a lot too but
even in the UK I'm starting to see a
massive shift in the way that developers
themselves so I think we need to push
back a little bit and say the companies
look it's fine consuming all this open
source but the fact that we don't really
pay the money at least we can contribute
back to them and help them fix their
bugs
I mean you're fixing bugs for yourself
right and it makes sense do you know
want some other person in the world to
be able to benefit from your effort
obviously yes it doesn't take you extra
effort to do it it's just it's changing
culture and we're seeing a lot of
competition I mean you see Microsoft you
see Apple these are giants and dinosaurs
in the way that they move and you can
see how quickly they move into embracing
open source because it's the future for
me it's the future and
every company out there should actually
contribute one way or another I think
somebody had a question back there while
I was working for them yeah well I think
we sent a poor request back to signal
our I was talking a company that had to
do obviously it shouldn't have been the
case but I was on XP using.net for and
and that would only allow us to go to
signal our 1.8 something which was the
latest version before 2.0 which 2.0 was
targeting 4.5 and we had a problem we
were having issues so we sent the pro
request and the team said well fine
you can do that so yes I've mast and
they were a bank I mean but I was quite
flexible in my manager was quite
understanding and he was all odds Island
news period the new idea but
traditionally it's very very hard - yes
it's very hard to convince companies but
I go to love customers these days they
are embracing open-source more and more
and when you speak to them and say how
if you're to say it's actually open
source it's saying that you don't
contribute back or fix bugs then you can
start saying that say it's slow again it
might take years before it happens but
it's exciting to see that people I think
developers are the one thing to push
back again I did mention that that you
need to push back and say look I'm using
this tool we found a bug we should
change it but lika things don't change
that legal documentation or legal rules
in the company very hard to convince
upper management to change that just
make sure that if you are contributing
you don't have any clauses in your
contract I think that would be probably
the biggest bummer and realizing that
any time that you spend belongs to your
company
renegotiate your contracts no I didn't
say that public yep
yes yeah I mean internally even even my
team I work from actual so we do have
certain rules about how much code you
can put in the public domain before it
has to go through reviews in the legal
department and so on but it tends to be
quite Lux I mean something like 1500
lines of code or more needs to be
reviewed by the legal team but you start
seeing even internal now that people say
well if you are going to benefit the
community you might as well just put it
out there and then if there are any
issues we can speak to the legal
department
I mean dotnet core is out there and
they're doing so many things like
millions of lines of code you can see
that there's a change my manager is very
supportive we as PA fees would do a lot
of work with customers proof of concepts
Nouriel a production code but even proof
of concepts I found that putting stuff
out there in the public domain and
saying if you were to do something
consuming one of those services then
this is a sample code that you can do it
people benefit from that and even
between us we can start code in a much
better way rather sending emails and
saying this is the piece of code that I
wrote more visibility yeah correct yeah
so things like Visual Studio or any
editors you might be using that are not
open source and the company paid for
them then yeah you can learn yourself in
some really hot water depending I think
I've met a guy here in the last year
that he wrote an amazing piece of
software and he was working for sell and
he ended up going into a legal battle
with him because they they said the
software belongs to us because you're
doing on your spare time with our own
tools so just be careful if you want the
open source and make sure you take your
closest but hopefully that's the only
that that's the only thing that's
stopping you from going to bidding just
your contract clause is not your will to
contribute I think that's me guys thank
you very much for coming and catch me
later if you want yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
