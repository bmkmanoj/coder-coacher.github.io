it's geared to beer o'clock attendees
yeah a lot of subdued crowd not as
subdued crowd at all so we're here in
Oslo this is ours going serverless panel
we're here with a few guests we're going
to have some fun and then you're going
to drink some beer or more berries or
more beer I'd like to start with Rob
Connery Rob helps developers of all
sorts learn what's new with technology
has been working in the technology field
full time since 1998 as a DBA and then a
web developer his original focus was
Microsoft asp net stack building tools
like subsonic and the first micro RM
masses moving yeah a name right there
like a long time ago next to him is Lin
Lang it she's a cloud and big data
architect AWS community hero Google
cloud developer expert Microsoft Azure
insider MVP and lynda.com author Wow
when do you sleep
yeah she does it all she's currently
working on IOT cloud projects and when
it's also director and lead courseware
developer for the nonprofit teaching
kids programming which we've done a
whole show on in the past yeah
and I'm turning myself up just a little
bit ok ok we go and next to them is next
to hit blue and finally all the way to
the right here or your left is Mattias
Brandon whiner he's been developing
software on dotnet for about 10 years
and loving every minute of it except
maybe for a few release days
I'm thinking all the early and got net
core releases those were pretty tough
yeah his language of choice is C sharp
until he discovered F sharp and fell in
love with it he enjoys arguing about
code and how to make it better and gets
very excited when discussing TDD or F
sharp don't discuss them in the same
conversation or you'll be hurtin
Matthias is Microsoft F sharp MVP and
founder clear lines consulting a big
hand for our panel
so in the 90s and the 2000s we had our
servers and then we had our cloud and
there were servers in the cloud and now
you're telling us to take our servers
away what do you guys doing what are
they doing to us discuss nice we're
gonna sit over here you do have to start
with the name server lives it is a
problem it's very servers right make you
cranes just make it Cringer there it
might you probably should be called
ceremony less I would say that's about
right less ceremonial yeah house at some
point was called mental services I
Louise will now serve that's hmm it was
the micro services how how far down can
we get yeah I mean what's after
announcer hiko's service he kills that's
like the way Scott Hanselman describes
it which is you you're a slider and your
credit card and some code is pretty much
I think it's all about that credit card
actually right but he says this is sort
of the least ceremony to get I'm just
going to write my code run it for me and
then run it as many times as somebody
asks for it and only charge me for when
it runs yeah or not at all not at all
if it's not running yeah which is we the
big deal well no I asked even if I have
clients that are running on free tiers
okay I ran quite nicely here yeah yeah
pointed one of them that probably a lot
of you guys have heard of his a cloud
guru a very notoriously started their
own site which was Amazon training on
the Amazon free tier serverless and I
think reps like twenty thirty thousand
users a month and it's on the free
chairs bill on the free tier that's sort
of circumventing the concept of a free
clear supposed to get you started then
you eventually pay right well the idea
is that you're going to pay for premium
services like machine learning and stuff
like that but if you're just using tier
storage and compute there are use cases
that make sense on free tier doesn't
everything makes sense free is free
everything yeah well you know eventually
they're going to go out of business
because there is no business so how do
they do that yeah the last exam ever
i've always interpreted the sole service
move it is started sort of by the
community with a demain
ended the concept of lambda from vws as
anybody else have a narrative for how
this started no fee disagreements well
for me it started with lambda I mean I
reinvent and it was a like a bomb
dropped when lambda launched and there
was this just incredible momentum from
developers as frenzied and people were
building things right at reinvent while
you're watching it being presented you
start writing code yes I love that yeah
that's pretty cool I mean I wasn't
reinvent this year and they announced
Athena which is serverless sequel
literally there was a guy that before
the end of the demo got something in
production and we did it yeah it was
probably Sanderson it kind of magical
that way I've seen it be the same thing
on the other side so I have no
experience of the lambdas but what I
have found about this is extremely
liberating
so maybe so you started as a DBA I never
I'm not an IT guy by background I have
very little patience for IT this is not
what I want to do and it was just
shocking to me I could just take a scrap
ship it and have something in production
like this is amazing and so the Apple
just picked it up and it's you just
write a couple of lines of code and it
runs it's a magic and in your preferred
world this is as your function that is
correct okay yeah and and it's hard to
argue with that I just feel like this is
not well represented on what if it's
just fatigue yeah that there's so much
has changed so quickly in the cloud
between the ions versus paths versus
containers you want kubernetes you want
docker and then they come along though
hey you could just do server list like a
lie because the server and be like I've
looked at enough stuff thank do I have
to look at this - yeah my question is
when do you stop doing serverless
functions and go to a more robust
microsoft access database functions
are they crazy or is it doable all the
big enterprise project that I worked on
last year with blended architecture it
was kind of interesting because the
developers that came in were kind of
old-school and they said oh we don't
even want to use containers much less
serverless and so we fired them what's
one enemy well we have we got most of
its build server lessly but there was an
implementation I do a custom security
pairing it was iot thing and it was
long-running okay so we use the Nano
so it was blended and I don't yeah and
I'm thinking that that's going to be
more typical manner price that you're
going to have blended stuff code there's
hard limits but in fact but it's
long-running the only thing I mean why
would you
I mean I get all the good stuff that
comes to service fabric for scaling and
and all of that stuff what do you get
that just built in without any without
any controls and well again for us it
was function it was also controlled
because it was a security functionality
like we wanted to be able to SSH into
the servers we wanted to be able to make
sure the service was a hundred percent
up we wanted to have the level of
control because the pattern of lambdas
firing lambdas wasn't fast enough for us
corrupt for authentication we tried it
yeah but it didn't work
because each lambda is effectively a
security boundary so there's a lot of
and educating a Rio sent a game well
there's latency when it comes up sure
and there was too much latency in our
case oh alright in fact the case with
Azure functions as well yeah have a cool
stop yeah do have yes or the once it's
fired it's going to be pretty fast with
the first school we think it rolls and
first call after compiling
yeah say as far as well even later than
compiling because the queue don't play
because things will kind of just all
right sure yep so in that sense so there
you go there's another reason why you
don't want to do that we're up against
the same thing even with asp.net pages
and things like eventually die next shut
stuff down if you're down calling it off
another guess question is how frequently
I have to call it you don't have cold
starts I think that depends on what you
want to do so is like to go back to the
question when you want to use a function
and notice I can make it
I started from scripts so small
applications the pieces which are
no-brainers like if you have a job which
runs once a week takes a minute
you should just do that because you
really like one minute a month I know is
like I'm looking at things where like
how big at what point is it too bad idea
and I wish I had the answer to that I
don't know yet like yeah yeah one of the
I tested thanks away yeah what I like
that's okay what a nice things about
firebase that I found is it's just easy
to add on little projects and you find
yourself doing that in a natural way to
answer your question about micro
services so I made a cart thing and it
turned into a checkout thing and then I
thought well what about delivery when I
was like I just made another app and
then they give it a different URL and I
thought about well what about
notifications check out sang calm yeah I
made another thing it was really neat to
just track all those things together and
I'm riding all the data into Postgres
anyway because I don't trust firebase
okay now should we talk mean everybody
sort of gets Amazon certainly gets out
here tell us a little bit about firebase
hero firebase was real-time database
that was their only claim to fame a few
years back and in google bottom so now
they're part of the Google cloud
initiative and it's a real-time database
you get authentication you get storage
you get functions and missing a few in
there you get you get all these really
insanely amazing triggers that and I say
that because you can reach out to just
about anything and get a trigger off of
it like a Google Analytics event when
someone uploads a thing they like a file
to the servers you can trigger a
function right someone writes the
real-time database which they do right
from the browser that will trigger a
function as a matter of fact that's how
people actually check out on the site
that I wrote is the check out
information the items and the payment
from the token from stripe just gets
written to the database there's no Ajax
call that I'm making right no separate
implication yeah and that just triggers
a function it was Bing Bing Bing Bing
Bing for it is amazing too because to
what you said about the latency between
the functions I didn't even notice it
and it was enough that I could do a
real-time checkout where I'm checking a
progress flag on the client man watching
all the functions go off and little
checkmarks tick tonight yeah it's done
with the order it's pretty neat to see
it so in the azure land we have the
similar ways to trigger functions or do
we yes yes that's kind of what I wrote
about it there's like most of listeners
there you have ik timers which are
obvious and have the cue you have an
HTTP request you have hooks to a github
to all these things you can write your
launcher and atom so that's one of the
nice things because like most of the
scenarios I wanted to cover just air out
of the box I have to think about it man
nice yeah in the brownfield scenario we
were coming from VMs or many as a number
of things it feels like we're going
through this with the Dahlia oxide alone
right started off with one VM that was
all the things yeah and then just sort
of peeling out websites and so forth
I got imagine that you'd be in hybrid
for forever like actually turning stuff
off completely is rare you just keep
peeling more pieces out maybe they're
functions maybe they come in another
form so then I'm kind of curious about
what's happening in the other sides
because I haven't touched anything but
as are functions but so one question is
like how big at what point is it a bad
idea to put many functions like a friend
of mine has something with I think 140
lambdas I don't but he made that work
one for oh yes okay and yeah it's really
what that's one direction always tricky
because at that point is like how do you
keep track of what's actually going on
in your app right other one is like I
started doing something which is in the
hybrid app where I have like a something
which is a Windows server with a Windows
service and I want to call the functions
and how to make that work together I
don't have the patterns quite yet and
and she's it kind of what I find
interesting in the field because it's a
it makes sorts of problems simple but
then is actually have lots of problems
which were simple before and there you
have no pattern so it's a both scary and
exciting that's definitely true I mean
in the project I worked on we had a
continuous deployment pipeline and so we
had we were we did the cattle not peps a
pattern where every time you have a new
code you just kill the VM and then you
have a new one and when we refactor two
functions we went through that process
right and we had kind of a interim point
where we tried containers but containers
actually didn't provide us with value
which was an interesting learning to me
we just went from I don't know if you
know this limb but containers are the
new hotness
I'm curious as to why you know what what
was it about your particular thing that
made containers not is a container
orchestration it's kind of an immature
area right now a lot of work but what
kind of exactly what kind of things are
you doing in the functions that might
clue us into well what we were doing was
it was IO Enterprise IOT and so it was a
phone app to control enterprise IOT so
it was a crud model basically through
within
qtt okay so it was easily refactor able
because it was the different kinds of
messages lends themself to that yeah so
but to me that was a big learning
because I thought that we might have
some value out of docker as an interim
solution because it was less a
technology problem and more a learning
problem like they were running off
getting certified and all the stuff but
doctor didn't really help a string yeah
so it's like the effort to decompose out
of the sort of traditional monolith
model yeah it's no good not going to be
easier to stop and containers that it
would be just good directly to so it
hasn't been in the to clients I've
worked ok and you know I'm in this group
Amazon community hero so it's like MVPs
it's really it's an interesting group
because they are these really high
volume sites like Reddit and Netflix and
stuff like that and their report working
at those levels in the Amazon ecosystem
is similar that for Amazon a lot of
people are just going straight to lambda
so the one thing I sort of saw in the
orchestration management space or maybe
you could emulate this on as your API
management it's just like being able to
deal with a bad actor somebody's just
almost you know you cost you money for
every call so somebody winds up and is
just calling you a million times an hour
for no good reason how do you stop that
account I don't have a cell to finish
truck well I would think that the Azure
API management service and I'd only know
about that cos vicious Lilith rod us on
another show that you would put that in
front of your Azure functions it's
putting the gates on those things yeah
so I can't really speak that much about
the the proxy or the other proxies like
I know they built that so that you can
build an API in front and then it's like
here you are you don't have to give you
the function themselves that you play
that type them they're my use case has
been more enterprising maybe so it's not
in that I have used it mainly to do to
build Twitter BOTS right so that you're
not exposing to the public it's your
apps that are calling correct and most
of what I have been doing is a queue
skew skews because I like queues
apparently it's only you so I'm getting
back to this little idea about you know
darker in value of darker versus
functions and I'm trying to think of you
know that I guess people love docker
because they can just go from one cloud
platform to another very elaborate yeah
if you're writing a c-sharp function
what's the familiar paradigm right
because like you before you had a VHD
file and now you have a docker file
right like the DevOps people are much
more comfortable with that well plus
being able to execute on the developer's
machine on the QA machine and the
production machine yeah right I mean I
talked about it and I talked here my
experience has been the DevOps people in
enterprise freaked out when you start
putting functions and continuous
deployment pipelines because they have
to learn all new tools really like and
the vendors are catching up like Amazon
has X right now which is pretty cool and
Google stack drivers pretty solid there
and I assume Microsoft has something now
but they have to learn a lot of new
stuff they can't follow their typical
processes to understand what's going on
with functions HJ do you have bento so
so and so on the question of containers
if you brought up the fact that it can
be run pretty much everywhere you want
here is one topic which pops up is a
vendor lock-in so if I decide to that I
don't want another function anymore I'm
not sure how would execute myself and a
container will run everywhere right
right well because the functions whether
it's firebase or Amazon or function
they're specific to the platform and you
kind of have to be online right like
developing in the in the airplane is
going to be tough this is the funny
thing about firebase is it's you can
write your code to be free of their
framework but yeah you can so one of the
things they have is an HTTP trigger so
it's just an endpoint yeah and you can
write code you know the function code
the way you see in the demos or you can
just create an express app and pass the
express out to the function and then you
have your full value that you would have
with express and then if you need to
pick up a move you just take your
express up and go host it somewhere else
interesting yeah and so that was
fascinating and you don't get the
real-time database and all the off stuff
right still have a level of platform
lock-in but when I tried lambda that was
the first thing I thought is there's
nothing getting me out here although it
was node but it didn't have the same
level of like just light touch that you
have with firebase that I really liked
this is here you could pick up that node
code and stick it in a container and you
know basically the same code this is now
your owning the infrastructure data runs
in okay okay if that's the feeling that
I think the firebase team is trying to
go for but there that's just here's a
little bit of orchestration to give you
end and off you go so so you have an
option of a local runtime you want to
run
Prem go ahead not that I know that'll
job really would express that about well
you can you can you can set your code up
you don't have to use their real-time
database it's just there for you sure
same with your pub/sub and a bunch of
other things but if you needed to pull
that app out and go on your own servers
it requires work but it's not it's not a
dead stop no and it's not like rewrite
everything either no but I think we know
what are you writing your functions in
the tiers like is this C sharp F sharp F
sharp it's more like use me sorry
yes like it's all a shop but the at that
put I think it's officially supported
JavaScript bearish like PHP it's kind of
interesting because one of the benefits
of a function is like it allows you to
focus on the business value and not
infrastructure there is no average
Hansberry yeah but check the year so the
emphasis doesn't care about the code
that could picks it up and associated it
these are my bindings and the cool song
code and it doesn't reek air what it's
written in so look for me I care about
the code and they care about the whole
infrastructure absolutely because you
guys could just hold that side right
there we'll take a few minutes to pay
the bills all right we're back with
dotnet all right we're back you're
listening to dotnet rocks Carl Franklin
Richard Campbell we're here with a a
panel of three talking about serverless
computing or is it really somebody
else's server for somebody else's server
computing so f-sharp in the cloud
actually noting the code because that's
the second part so when positive
language but the other one is also where
do you write your code okay and so the
thing I liked so when functions came out
of the box is that you had to go to the
azure portal you have to write code in
an editor and this is not what I want
yeah for many reasons like the editor is
okay but like you mentioned in the plane
I don't want to be stuck to not be able
to write code to run it and so all my
code I write in in code like in vs code
right took a bit of effort but that's
also a please web I don't know how the
other are the other functions look
spectacular that was actually a bit of
pain to find patterns on how to write
that code because it makes things easy
but out of the box it's not completely
obvious how you write codes with your
classical editor so that I am so but it
eventually makes its way to the cloud is
what I'm saying
yeah lecture at that point I use the
command line I write stuff and then it's
approach you push it to github you do
whatever and it just runs it just runs
yes that's kind of nice but in all these
contexts you're effectively stateless
like if you write some F sharp code that
opens up a file stream and tries to
write to a file when you push it up -
your functions it's going to be sad
yeah the status messages are interesting
- and forces you to write a bit
differently it's not quite the same as
maybe actors in Airlines or things like
that but you have a bit of something
like that every function will have that
new state so it fires you run and then
it's gone yeah so you can't keep
anything in memory between the calls
which is great because then is that you
know that if it crashes it doesn't
matter but then is like if you need to
maintain state you need to maybe persist
it and all these things which requires
also a bit of a rethinking and how you
write your code sure well not only that
but on firebase it's just a node module
that when you push it your functions are
just exports on a node module that's
yeah so you can send your node modules
up and and I was going to try this but I
never did I was wondering if I could
write to the local directory right yeah
but then he's not knowing where it is
you don't want to do that because that's
actually defeating the point because
when heavy traffic and load comes in
they just spawn in on the node process
there are your functions yeah and then
you're getting your dust
I mean because then you have a whole
other process it's not going to know
what you're talking what were you trying
to write to the local directories for
there's a there's a like a sequel light
of document databases called
any DB so it just writes to a text file
but you could have easily use a service
for I just wanted to try and see your
turn cause I got no I can see where
things break yeah if you didn't know
that typically it's about you know image
files or stuff like that there's a guide
right but you know we have this whole
thing called the web did firebase
storage that's what they offered that
for so they need upload files will give
you a centralized overhead it soul in
what's the AWS story so the typical
pattern is use s3 and make sure encrypt
if that the data warrants that or
DynamoDB but we did in the big project I
worked on we did something weird these
with so much net new and what we did is
we used actually aurora rather than
DynamoDB with aurora aurora is big
sequel basically something my sequel
special i
this guy yeah so anyway anyway so we put
we put the cruds lambdas in front and it
was almost like a stored procedure
pattern well because it was less for the
developers to learn sure and it worked
great and Amazon you know kind of had a
connection when they came out and looked
at that because they said this is an
anti-pattern and then lo and behold they
now offer support for it any pattern is
anything we don't understand right right
up till becomes a pattern and what's the
preferred language for lambda so we
chose node node really seems to have the
broadest support pythons right up there
interestingly though Amazon just added
support for c-sharp interesting which I
thought was very very clever of them and
Google really like C sharply stated okay
you know John ski crystals and all those
guys right there's a potage yeah are you
rolling there mr. Connery no you
actually bad you yeah I would never do
such a success let's get together okay I
think it's really cool I really do think
it's cool that they're they're jumping
on yeah code in the language of your
choice but why not f sharp that's what
I'm wondering
it'll go cuz I've starts access I've got
it that's my thing I got to get a dig in
an F sharp every talk I was expecting
such a nice panel didn't I invited Rob
Connery yeah everything goes wrong after
that I want to jump back a little bit to
this idea of like at a hundred and forty
functions it's almost like I have the
stored procedure problem now where I
have this huge I would like in the end
the only way I'm going to find something
is I had a good naming strategy would
you would you agree with that is that is
that how you manage that many or is your
way to start them so I didn't write that
one holiday forty but I'll find out
well yeah but I think that's a reporting
too so one of the things which is nice
about functions like each of them is
completely independent
yeah they live in their own world and
that's fine but then if you start to
have ten twenty of them is I got some
hot the hell do you know this works
right and it's very much convention base
like I we say I need a cue called foo
and the cue is there and that's fine and
another one is looking for to call foo
and if I type something like a
misspelled as I care maybe everything is
broken and don't quite know that right
but the flip side of this is a quite a
fun interesting is okay so again you
write the code but like here you have a
very self-described system and that
every function
so contains the bindings in the JSON
file right and so by looking at this you
can you can see each what each function
does and with one of the things I built
for myself is something which is going
to scan every possible function and
rebuild the whole application diagram
yeah and that's pretty awesome because
with a classical application you take it
and there is no way you will get to
diagram which shows you what the
application does
and with this is like I have names I see
that this one took C discs you took
there and I can see immediately what the
whole thing how it's working I wouldn't
think that I would've thought that that
exists in Azure portal I mean you know
you they would give you some sort of
management software management tools as
far as I know it's got their particular
I I wrote this for myself and they
thought it was a good idea so maybe we
do it anyway yeah yeah I mean at what
point you just say let's you service
fabric you know I mean that's what
service fabric does it does all that
great management stuff for you but is it
normal you then you were talking about
when you had functions call it functions
you were not happy with the performance
right you run into this tube mattias or
do you have functions calling functions
so yeah that's a nice thing is like your
function is nice but what's nice
especially especially in the other
functions it makes it very easy to type
them together like right and so but I
don't have that type of polymer with the
performance is that thought is a good
cue or something like that unreal II the
cool stuff and to be clear it was in
that one use case of it right um I've
had other use cases it works fine and it
gave me giving this hierarchical model
of functions with what our endpoints
what are called into that can we sort
those things out can we see what's
related to what and sort of get a view
of the calling hierarchy yeah and this
is why I went with the diagram because
the kids kind of introduced it sure yeah
but I really liked it the natural
tendency and you described it as very
well Rob as you solve one problem after
next you're making separate individual
units that thing could be sorted into
any order or utilized in different ways
or different purposes like I remember
Scott coppery saying I really want you
to fall into the pit of success that
this tendency the way naturally wants to
work as a probe that will tend to
encourage reuse tend to keep simplicity
focus that refactor yourself that big of
a deal like I like everything about that
as long as I can keep it in order yeah
that was actually a problem I ran into I
mean I'd like to talk well about
firebase
there's also pain sure no like a vented
programming is not always the easiest
thing to understand especially if so I
get a trigger to function when an
invoice got written and and so the
function would go off and it would send
an email to the user and a few other
things and at the very end it would tag
the invoice with email sent so if you're
triggering a function when the invoice
is written and you write to that invoice
at the very end of that function guess
what's going to happen next
you're fired again and you're fired
again and again and again and I wanted a
la happy loop and the logs are going off
and I'm standing like a hundred emails
off to discuss account like oh my god
boy I got contained yeah email say I'm
like where to stop button where's the
shot button and so that's one thing you
have to get used to is not doing that
right hey Richard yeah buddy
yes the time is now it must do that
happy time again yeah it's time for me
to take my docker file back scary you

that's right we've done enforcement
we've given away twenty thousand dollars
worth of stuff so far we like to ask our
guests as well you say that again
and we like to ask our guests as well if
you had five thousand dollars to spend
on technology today Rob Connery oh boy
what would you buy an xbox right the X
button max oh yes the Xbox one X does
look pretty cool five hundred bucks so
you get ten of them yeah do that the
line for everybody you get an Xbox
giving away at Halloween right yeah a 4k
Xbox I'm a you Lynn this is a weird
answer because I've got a heavy travel
schedule coming up and flying all over
the world it's kind of an aside I would
buy airplane upgrades it's like only
technology in the earth that's quality
of life right there that's about it yeah
more business class tickets
Mateus I'm a poopy grin to get the chair
like a good programming chair under look
at these stools were the best we could
do it was funny when you talk about
program which was of course the air on
the Herman Miller air owns but the
reference chair since the dot-com boom
yeah which is you know 1718 years ago
now I still have mine which I picked up
as like a fire sale after the dot-com
boom was over and they write cheap hmm
but the only other chair I've seen in
that class that sort of newer the chair
called the human scale in two attempts
three feet 1,500 bucks chair it looks
like it's actually doing surgery on you
and you sit on it's all these little
knobs and bends and things as a Japanese
it is not because they make all this
crazy Neverland yeah is doctor it was
Japanese did have tentacles that's a
different conversation oh there's
something that's why do that water yeah
we're not going to talk about that at
all we're going to move on pasta yeah
they you know we talked about being
developers basic day-to-day things that
you know I love the 80% case what do you
do every day that matters great chair
great keyboard like you can buy a $20
keyboard by the $200 keyboard you will
be happier
and more screen space more better mod
more Azure credits more if better coffee
machines because we all are just
creatures to convert caffeine into code
right so yeah I'm a big fan of the I got
us the Dell 43 inch 4k which is one
hundred dpi 4k monitor that's a lot of
monitor I'm like one of these yeah put
on that what is that like a 20 foot pad
and projected display and I'll get to
tell you that that projector back there
is full on that screen that's not 5000
bucks or exact those are expensive
projector I could buy the lens there you
go yeah or maybe the bulb because I lo
all right we got to get back to this
because there's so much to talk about in
this space it's it's really interesting
to me
I've been reading discussions around the
sort of progressive web app server list
is going to be the new modern app like
that that's just going to be the browser
calling the functions nothing else with
an icon on your phone yeah disagree now
love it I don't know I mean I like I
would stand before step by step
everything seemed to fall in place and
timotheus this point it felt fun yeah
because I wasn't worrying about view
template engines and everything else I
just was writing code and I had a static
site generating all the HTML and then I
was just using the firebase SDK to talk
to the database may be the only thing
makes you unhappy is HTML if you
considered though yeah it makes me
unhappy lots of things making it okay
why should me so yeah I know it I felt
like a hacker again it's what I told a
friend right back in the days of writing
ASB Classic you didn't care you just
wrote the code right yeah I didn't worry
about anything else and in this cell do
they ever going to see it
yeah there's freedom to not knowing the
patterns there's reading to not caring
so much and just discovering something
new like oh I could do that
yeah ya know and I could pub/sub over
the other app and do oh wow that's neat
maybe some of the weight on this as sort
of you you know if I that you may be
doing something is going to punish you
later yeah and you can goodness that one
yeah I'm really a champion at that one
here's this week's cookies - yeah that's
right nodes like whatever the patron at
some points you put so like the
advantage of servers list is whoever's
punished later it's somebody else's
father well then
yeah one thing I did find actually along
those lines I'm glad you brought it up
was I was trying to be a good object or
any programmer and have my models and
have everything in place with this note
app so I could just move it over and it
just for some reason was not fitting it
wasn't working I don't know why so I
went to a more functional way of doing
things which is just data comes out and
I transform it and I put it back and I
don't have any models that represent the
data and that fit perfectly
interesting I don't know why they really
don't know where it's up to there you go
yeah but I would always the functional
tendency of sort of approach it from an
immutable perspective right I'm never
going to modify anything I'm going to
output the change thing and that that to
me speaks volumes of that service
approach it's naturally immutable ok
pescetarian transform do something else
yes and give it an output and don't
modify give is enough with a new
incarnation yeah where your memory
anyway you don't care so going up to
words where do you see it going and not
each of them each of you have done it on
different platforms and I'd like to know
where the holes are where you think
things could be improved well something
that I always think is a big part of
service I talked about my talk that
hasn't been mentioned here is serious to
me is not just surreal compute it's
surrealist data and so because I build
these huge data pipelines for everything
from social media
you know sensor monitoring and like on
the Google ecosystem they have a number
of offerings around serverless data that
I'm helping my customers to understand
so they have things like BigTable and I
don't really know what it is an azure
but Amazon has similar similar type of
thing and bigquery and all these
different sort of data services so you
ask like where are the vendors going to
make their money here it's on these
premium services go and going really
high level machine learning so I'm
actually looking you know we talked
about immutable pieces I'm looking at
tensor flow and MX net because those are
distributed immutable machine learning
pieces and again the most premium
services and helping customers to figure
out when and how to use those serverless
services I suppose a Google what did you
call it say it again tensor flow tensor
flow yeah tensor flow is distributed
machine learning
ok I'm filming yeah deep learning and if
that for Amazon and Azure has something
with the the equivalent certain software
will be seen GK yeah well yeah that's
right that's right
so
that's to be like kinda where the
hotness is because I have a DBA
background for the audience I code but I
come more from a DevOps side so that's a
part of the service architectures that
I'm doing a lot of work on well you
think that the machine learning parts
sort of inevitable of being in the cloud
anyway yeah I don't care what tech you
use if you store your data in the cloud
we're going to get you with the machine
learning platform so yeah and not in a
bad way you know I try to do
OLAP and machine learning related stuff
in the 90s you know I was a ralph
kimball disciple and those were all too
common umber bets that you had to make
in advance where I'm looking at 30
something different potential mining
algorithms and I have to figure out
which one I'm going to use is each one
of months three or four train it would
just be great if some of these things
could be powered by machine learning and
we didn't even know it you know just
like like auto scaling for example would
it be great if just some robot took care
of that for well Google is actually
suggesting to you on their instances
what instance you should use I mean
Amazon gives you this through their
trusted adviser but Google gives it to
you in the UI and says hey you should
switch to this machine type or this
number of course based on the workload
we're seeing and that's based on machine
learning against your workload and
Google also allows you to trigger
function based on I kind of glossed over
this but Google Analytics events you can
you can craft up whatever analytics
event you want to respond to and a
function will fire and I mean that's
pretty that's pretty insane - yeah
that's more than analytics analytics
typically sounds like a read only thing
that's it yeah that's real code yeah now
can I go back for a second - so you
mentioned the term chauvinist diva I
have never heard that I don't understand
whether it is so what I mean by that is
that the rather than having like a
database cluster that you manage
bigquery is a good example of this
Google bigquery so it's been around a
really long time you just upload a CSV
file and then you just enter an C sequel
query against the data I actually showed
it my serverless talked five terabytes
of data going from 82 million rows down
to 2500 rows in less than 30 seconds for
five bucks so it's not really that
emotive 7s query yeah okay yeah but
different types of processing whether
it's sequel or
learning so I guess the idea is you
don't have to have a sequel manager or a
management tool you just express it in
oh dear your metadata
no I'll clustering the log shipping is
out no nothing yeah this game-changer
paying for the persistence yeah yeah you
do want to keep that data drive bucks
yeah I like that price well I think more
than anybody Amazon has been driving
this sort of race to the bottom in terms
of pricing especially for the
infrastructure products right if you
know the bm's have never been cheaper
right where we're going to do
differentiation is at the platform level
which I think it's a strength of Google
and Microsoft more than Amazon but
everybody's doing it because it
ultimately that's the value prop and
machine learning being the largest candy
and in store here but on the server disk
with machine learning so there's a bit
of a tension pool because I guess is
like you could do Severus and expose
free train services as a service but if
I'm going to do machine learning
typically I'm going to use something
which is very CPU intensive very long
and that kind of goes at odds with this
so you know but no not really because
it's GPUs as a service now you can just
add GPUs on and all three of the vendors
have machine learning as a service where
you can host your own model up there
that's just straight machine learning
and then the tensorflow and MX net is a
distributed
so here if you're a more computationally
intensive and they also have a few of
the standard models like vision or video
or whatever they have those too so it's
like the way you use it would be server
list but behind the scenes it's probably
not going to be service
well if you exist an endpoint for you
well that box what if you could do a
service list service okay weird
I actually think initially when you
mention the GPUs that in Syria gets the
the vendor is intended to execute any
given function slash lambda slash
whatever you want to call it as quickly
as possible so you'll just run more yeah
it's going to be interesting when we
finally write one that just run that
fast or how do we optimize this because
we I don't really have any visibility
into that you think I should show you a
problem that everything's running fast
so far right well again from my
production experience we heavily relied
on logs right now we have an X ray which
is
I don't know what the equivalent is a
measure but it's a it's a tracing tool
so it shows you through your application
what the latency is where the latency is
it's relatively new supporting land of
it's super useful because we have to we
have to piece together the logs before
visualizes it for you and really shows
you a big arrow where the bottleneck is
I wonder wrapped in sites would pick
that up on the azure side I knew that by
next boot but that happens I haven't
used its program yeah everybody says a
reporting tool that actually had a bug
in it
nice yeah there's a there's an article
in medium where this company said our
cost went up by seven thousand percent
yeah long story but it was a buged in
the firebase reporting tool but anyway
they do have exactly that where they
show the median runtime volume functions
right and so you can look at one and say
why is it run in three seconds but the
interesting thing is they only charge
you for CPU time so if you're just
waiting for an i/o round-trip which a
lot of times you are they don't say how
they calculate that so there's a lot of
there's a lot of gray area in there you
know I mean because the actual CPU runs
on a database calls for a quarter second
yeah but what's your bill what's your
monthly bill like twenty bucks nine
cents less but I don't do very much I
serve files and that's you know yeah I
have some functions running when like
the web hook comes in and that's about
it how efficient do you want to be and
how much time do you want to spend on
optimization when you're in the
single-digit yes yes single sense nine
cents and then they take two percent of
that service charge robbery and the
pricing model is interesting too so I
don't know how it looks on lambdas
particular unknown functions is that
what you pay for is like time and memory
consumption and so the by default it
would cost you nothing like I went my
first expression to that was a Twitter
bot like we had like 10 calls a month
and I was just hosting it on the
cheapest possible machine you could in
the project twelve dollars a month right
that's like very expensive per tweet so
I moved through the functions and I go
to to essentially zero and that was nice
but like if it was a bigger unit of like
now I have to the incentives is a quirky
alliance because I have to write good
which is fast and which is the queue
memory efficient yeah and it'll actually
reduce your charges right actually
that's interesting if you do the right
thing is that it will pay you less
you'll actually spend less although
again chasing around up to twelve
dollars you know have any of you use
cosmos DB what's happens not yet
kind of
really we're just learning about it here
yeah okay bye caiman in the building
timeframe I guess it's the pieces around
the matter because you don't have to
think about scaling on the service part
so no more this cloud front front or any
of those sorts of bits it's just every
college is independent and it calls many
times as you want it's just gonna light
up more we talked about the the time
that it takes to spin up how much time
are we talking another function like I
think Nicole started something of the
order of few seconds and I know that re
second on the cold cold start and that
was a I know that because the other
boats I was trying to do was again slack
which has a timeout if you don't respond
within three so the first goal would
have a problem and afterwards it's a
perfectly frank but afterwards for how
long and how long D how what determines
when it goes to sleep after you stop
calling it for a period of time
yeah like I think it's of the order of
me half an hour oh yeah that's not bad
so if you have like the reason I had the
problem was again like you may boats
we're not very active yeah so typically
you hope that you have more activity
than one cool it's that per function or
is that you know another I'm trying to
trying to figure out a way that I can
make a dummy function or something like
that that I can call it's when I learn
my app like it keep alive you're going
to do a function which pulls your
function two weeks or here or just pass
in a certain value and that tells it to
not do anything wake up retiring yeah
and you could avoid that as well because
that you have two modes so I never
remember her the code but it was called
a dynamic and the dynamic essentially is
the dynamic mode is where you pay only
per usage you can also make it where you
pace and she it's actually on the VM
yeah and then you don't get your pay per
use but you don't get the cooler
services but yeah yeah services mode
yeah yeah sure yeah interesting app
services know where it is always late
you're paying for that that's what we
own it I just realized that I sounded
very first world problems when I said
three seconds you like it had to go to
space like an SDK you're in a chat
window side is black man magic
that's funny what do you guys build next
what he you were working on e-commerce
pipeline my friend yes
I'm just going to build it out see how
far it takes me interesting to keep
chipping away at it and you're going to
call this time you've written that
problem either
yeah it's unfortunately my Elva try are
you going to call it ecommerce thing
calm
probably yeah Rob's e-commerce things
yeah gently
I got and you're just doing enterprise
stuff Liz no I have something really
interesting I'm actually talking about
on Friday and I'm showing it it's I'm
working with National Research Institute
in Australia and met them on a trip out
there and they wanted to move some work
they had on-prem onto cloud and it's a
genomic processing it's a it's a genomic
there's two types of genomic processing
I'm going to show one is for CRISPR
which is human genome editing oh yeah
for personalized medicine and another
one is a project we're working on with
machine learning as a service data
bricks are you really interested mark
yeah and that one is genomic on genomic
sequence sequence wide studies and this
is being used in Australia for ALS
research
also has some really cool stuff yeah
trying to tear into that problem is
that's a big complicated area Allah J's
editor coming up I'm working are we
currently using functions on a something
which is a yeah machine running isn't
she an existing project that so when I
was talking about whether there's a
service and I'm getting data essentially
I need to see that how long would cortex
to go from here to here and I'm getting
real-time data and trying to adjust as
you get that immediate broken and so I'm
getting all this data and I'm trying to
adjust the timing estimates I'm going to
get around there's a lot of service that
would lend itself to that massive scale
type problems like IOT the issues and
the Tipsy just to think about you're
just going to do that it's not you're
never going to know you're just gonna
get a bigger bill yes may I go get a lot
well Mateus Lyn Rob thanks very much for
talking to us today and everybody in the
audience how about a big round of
applause for our panel
and we'll see you next time on duck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
