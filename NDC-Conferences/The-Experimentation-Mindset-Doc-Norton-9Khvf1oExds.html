coming out
talk today's experimentation mindset for
you those of you that don't know me I am
doc Norton
I am co-founder and CEO of a company
called CTO - we do process and
leadership coaching for companies all
around the world most of our clients are
based in the US but we have we have
clients a couple different continents
so experimentation mindset I figured I
would start out with a bit of a
description of what do I mean when I say
mindset right this is something we're
starting to hear in our industry more
and more is just kind of at least I've
been hearing at the word mindset but it
doesn't necessarily explained well so a
mindset is the ideas and attitudes with
which a person approaches a situation
and the first time that I actually heard
this phrase in a way that that made
sense to me that resonated with me was
in a talk several years back at one of
the agile conferences and the speaker
was sharing the work of Carol Dweck how
many of you familiar with with Dweck's
work great so I will walk you through
quickly what what Dweck and her crew did
so they ran a simple experiment what
they did was they took groups of
students I think about fifth grade right
and it was early in the in the school
year and they gave him a math test now
this test was appropriate for their
grade level but it was a bit of a
stretch it was probably the material
that they would be learning about
halfway through the year and this was
you know very early in the year right
they had the kids take the test and turn
it back in once the tests were turned in
they randomly split them into two groups
and group a when they handed back their
tests they set a certain thing to them
and group B when they handed back their
tests they said something else to them
and it turned out that there's a very
small difference in what they said
but it had a huge result Group A when
asked would you be interested in taking
another test like this or a more
challenging test said yeah yeah I think
I could do that yeah I could do that
they continued to kind of reinforce this
message to the group a students and over
the grading period these students grades
went up they began to actually lead the
class they began mentoring other
students group B when they asked them
would you be interested in taking a
similar test or one that's even harder
they said yeah I don't think so
that's I'm not it no no I'm not
interested in that over the course of
the grading period group B grades went
down they started actually kind of
retreating from engagement in the class
so you probably this point wondering all
right what did they do what did they say
to group a what did they say to group B
so a group a when they handed back the
test they said you know you did pretty
well you must have worked really hard
and Group B what they said was you know
you did pretty well you must be pretty
smart the difference in this is a growth
or a fixed mindset for group A as simple
as it seems what you basically told them
was you are in control you did something
you worked hard and as a result you got
a good grade group B what you told them
was you have a finite capacity
you got this grade because you are smart
that has bounds if we test it we may
find its limit but hard work has no
bounds right so one group growth mindset
one group
fixed mindset and we can see what kind
of impact that had on these students so
this same test was then run with
different groups of individuals they did
it with pro athletes they did it with
with executives and company
in varying formats obviously they didn't
give them all a 5th grade math test but
the results were very very similar if
you treat people in a particular way it
establishes a particularly a mindset and
actually affects the outcome it affects
the way that they behave so I thought
this was interesting but I got curious
you know it is is this all there is to
it in terms of how we learn and when and
you know if we just teach our teachers
basically to treat students in a
particular way will they all accelerate
so how do we actually learn and I came
across the Dreyfus model of skills
acquisition is anybody familiar with
this has anybody heard of like xu Hari
all right so agile space Xiu Hari which
Alistair Coburn kind of publicized this
quite a bit is basically the idea of to
hold to break to leave and it is a it is
the way that we kind of learn anything
right we hold fast to rules we
eventually break those rules and then we
eventually leave those rules behind as
we internalize you know whatever this is
that we're doing so the Dreyfus model is
very similar to that it just sort of has
more stages to it and is a little more
steeped in Western thinking than Eastern
thinking and I want to actually walk you
through this so we all start off
whatever is that we're learning
imagine that you're learning to play a
musical instrument for the first time or
you know almost anything else when we
start off we are a novice right if you
have a very limited experience possibly
no experience whatsoever and we need
rules for anyone here that's you know
let's learn to play guitar in a formal
setting the odds are that your teacher
started off and said okay put your
fingers here pluck this string they
didn't tell you why they didn't give you
music theory they didn't tell you about
notes or chords or anything else they
just said do this mechanical thing until
you get better at it right very simple
rules right
we tend at this stage be impatient for
results and we're focused on how to do
things over over why we actually
you know why we're actually doing them
we move out of novice typically you know
pretty quickly and we get into being an
advanced beginner at this point we
actually have some experience we can
actually we can't yet find information
or more accurately if we can start
looking up information we can't discern
what's relevant and what's not relevant
right so imagine if you're you know if
you're learning a new framework or
you're learning a new language you know
and you of course stackoverflow stuff
when you're very new to this and you see
someone's solution you have no idea
that's actually a good solution or a bad
solution is that an idiomatic solution
or is that like some weirdos one-off you
know I used to be a COBOL programmer and
this is what I think Ruby's supposed to
look like or right it's it's hard to
know until you've got a little bit more
experience you can't really tell what's
what's relevant what's good what's bad
right eventually we move into competence
competence now you're actually starting
to build these mental models in many
cases if you're learning something
similar to something in the past you can
actually extrapolate those models and
use those as well so you know most of us
have probably the first first computer
language we learn took quite a while the
second one took less the third one took
less and then someone introduced us to
functional programming and our brains
blew out because we had to start all
over again right or maybe you went the
other way around I don't know but but
right when you change modalities
suddenly you got to start all over but
in many cases we can actually use prior
models and kind of map those right at
this point you can actually start to
handle the unknown you're still a little
bit methodical but you know you're
getting much much better with this stuff
but your thinking is still kind of
steeped in like right and wrong there's
a there's a right way to do it there's a
wrong way to do it I just need to learn
what that what those things are we move
eventually from competence into
proficient proficient now we're actually
interested in the big picture we can
actually grasp and apply Maxim's so you
know how many of you are familiar with
with extreme programming XP some of
their Maxim's right so you know yeah
guinea right you ain't gonna need it do
the simplest thing that can possibly
work when you first start hearing those
things in your first kind of
how to do this stuff you understand the
words but you don't necessarily really
get the meaning it's not doing you've
done this for a while that you start to
realize like oh yeah the simplest thing
can actually that could possibly work
it's not the easiest thing it's the
simplest thing and right you start to
actually understand what those Maxim's
mean and how to apply those in in your
actual work and now you're starting to
actually internalize all of these all of
these rules now the next stage is expert
to go from proficient to expert you need
to actually be able to break all of the
rules this is the period where you
really understand this and to get to
that next level you have to you have to
violate any any of the rules that you
once knew and really start exploring the
edges and the crannies of whatever this
is that you're doing right and expertise
is actually more rare than we might
think many many people are actually very
proficient at something but not experts
so we think about musicians there are
many musicians who are highly proficient
you can give them a piece of music and
they can play it you know on-site no
problem and it sounds absolutely
beautiful but it is rare to find the
musician who without music in front of
them can hear a piece for the first time
and anticipate where it's going to go
and what it's going to do right that
level of expertise requires that we
actually break the rules and experiment
enough that we've completely
internalized this and early experts by
the way are the worst possible teacher
because they're amazing at this stuff
now and they've got no idea why or how
right they cannot explain even the
basics anymore because they're far
beyond that but they also can't explain
this intuition they have about the fame
right so I've got a question for you uh
first of all how many folks here have
been in your current vocation for five
or more years okay so for those of you
you think about yourself in that
specific vocation right and you look at
this continuum weird and you don't to
shut it out just keep it yourself but
where do you feel you fall in this
continuum right are you
novice expert what now I've done this
poll and with the inside of
organizations and typically what we get
is people believe after about five years
in a in a specific role that they are
expert right I've been doing this for
quite a while
oftentimes you know I'm the lead
developer or I'm the whatever right I'm
now in an architect's role I know more
than everybody around me therefore I am
an expert the reality of it is most of
us I mentioned this before most of us
actually stay in proficient and in
corporate America and in corporations
around the world there's a very strong
reason for that to go through the first
few stages it's all about implementation
right it's all about getting it right
put your fingers here follow these rules
do things this way right and we're
concerned all the way through those
stages with am i doing it correctly am i
doing it right or am i doing it wrong
but to move from proficient stew Bert we
need to actually experiment we need to
break the rules right we need to explore
different ways of doing the work now how
many of you work in a corporate
environment where they encourage you to
break rules and explore different ways
of doing the work a few right very few
the reality of it is typically that we
put rules in place to protect ourselves
from the newcomers and those rules are
never removed so as we get better and
better at this thing we still have to
comply
with all of those rules and so we can't
really experiment and we can't really
move into expertise right so share a
story with you from from my own
experience my own life kind of in a in a
in a typical company perhaps so when I
was much younger I took a job in
telephone sales and I'm not that old
no I admittedly him that old so I took
this job in telephone sales and it
seemed like it was fairly easy my buddy
Tommy and I had heard about this local
company that you know the hours were
fairly flexible and basically just went
in and you sold magazine subscriptions
to people who had previously subscribe
to the magazine so it was you know was
pretty simple stuff right pretty pretty
straightforward and you could make
fairly decent money and it was way
better than lugging you know barrels of
gravel up and down stairs or whatever
other kinds of jobs were available for
you know 19 year old dudes at the time
right so join this company and in the
first week of course you know did a
little bit of orientation that'd teach
us how to do you know I don't know dial
a phone and and talk to people or
whatever but they gave us a script and
they said listen here's how this works
all you have to do is follow the script
and you know magic you make money well
this is gonna be great and I knew it was
gonna be great because it said so in the
script three times so I did what I was
supposed to do every day I got a bank of
cards I pulled out an index card on that
was a name and a phone number
what magazine I was supposed to sell and
for how many years I was supposed to
sell it and I had a script that I was
supposed to follow just dial the phone
follow the script money right so I did
that for a week
turns out it wasn't so great what we're
looking at here is weekly sales rankings
and you can clearly see I'm a little low
on the list my name happens to be below
this red line the way it worked there
was if you were in the bottom 20% three
weeks in a row you were fired if you
were in the bottom 20% four weeks out of
seven you were fired and this wasn't you
have a particular target you have to hit
and be above it this was strict
you know stack rank yanked the bottom
out type stuff right so even if I was
getting better and everybody else was
getting better I could still get fired
if I was in the bottom 20% so this
doesn't sound like a great setup to me
and I want to figure out how do I keep
this job because seriously my
alternative was lugging buckets of
gravel up and down stairs so I looked at
the rankings I said well Tommy's at the
top of the list I wonder if that's a
common thing so I looked over at
ptolemies desk and he's got trophies on
his desk and I look at the back wall
salesperson of the month ptolemy ptolemy
ptolemy ptolemy Janet Ptolemy Tommy
Tommy Tommy right like this dude is
clearly like the best so if I want to
learn how to do this job I'm gonna watch
Ptolemy right I am gonna watch the
master and of course I know that when he
picks up that phone he is going to say
hello sir madam my name is Tommy Noah
caucus but that's not at all what he
does he actually says good day my name
is Pat Michaels so
Ptolemy's is a liar what the hell what
says alright uh Tommy help me out here I
I want to get some pointers I was
watching and I see that like you're
actually not you didn't you don't even
follow the script and he goes well I
follow most of the script but but here's
the deal if I try to greet them with a
gender 50% of the time I guess wrong and
that really upsets people right and this
was the 80s in Midwestern United States
if I tell them my name is Talley Miller
caucus within a matter of minutes that
hang up but if I tell them my name is
Pat Michaels they stay on the line I
want to chat with me some more okay I
think I get it
so the way Ptolemy's has become the top
salesperson is he doesn't really follow
the script he's made some adjustments
that you know that work for him right
these are things that kind of help him
overcome his shortcomings so I'm gonna
do the same thing so over the course of
the next week or so I start playing
around with different ideas and
different ways of doing this so I'm the
jokester right I'm the angry aggressive
sales guy I'm the complete bumbling
idiot and most of all I'm just a nice
guy and sure enough no script it works
top in sales
I beat Ptolemy's right this is going
okay next few weeks I keep kind of
messing around with it but I'm at the
top of the list most of the time I'm
doing pretty well and now it's time for
my eight-week review good good actually
you know I've been thinking about it
I've got a few recommendations I could
probably make around how they can
improve things around here I mean I am
you know the top sales guy right
that review didn't go
quite the way that I expected it to go
so you see mr. Norton we don't just look
at your weekly sales we listen in on
your phone calls just to see if you're
following the script we record all of
those calls we play them back in our
quality control center to make sure that
you are following the script it has
become clear to us that you do not
understand the value of the script this
is our best practices our best minds
worked together to come up with this
script I would like you to think for a
moment how much better you would be
doing if you just followed the script so
I decided that I wasn't going to stay
and on my last day on the last call I
pulled the card and I was supposed to
sell mr. Jones or whatever two years of
field and stream magazine I started
dialing the number and I stood up in my
chair I stood up then I actually climbed
up on to my chair as the phone was
ringing and then something overtook me
and I climbed up onto the desk as the
phone was ringing Tommy thought this was
pretty funny so he scrambled to his desk
and then another and then another
Friday last phone call the day there
were probably half a dozen of us
standing on our desks making these phone
calls
in hindsight it might have been good for
me to mention to them that was my last
day but I finished that call and I sold
that guy three years of Field &amp;amp; Stream
by not following the script and I left
best practices are a misnomer the notion
of a best practice is actually steeped
in a fixed and implementation mindset
this idea that there is one right way to
do it they create artificial boundaries
for our learning right they are steeped
in this implementation mindset in
getting it right this is fundamentally
what our Garris refers to as single loop
learning now in single loop learning
which is what most organizations engage
in we have some assumptions based on
those we decide certain actions should
be taken and if those actions are
followed appropriately we will get
certain outcomes so we measure for
outcome if we don't get the outcomes we
want we try to get better at the actions
and this loop just continues right how
many times have you been in an
organization I've seen this a number of
times where the team absolutely hates
retrospectives hates doing them there's
no value in these things it is strictly
a grouse fest right all we do is get
together and complain we write some
stuff down on paper and then we leave
the room and two weeks later we come in
and we do the exact same thing
and we just keep doing it over and over
again with this conviction that
retrospectives are good we're not
getting the outcome we want we just have
to get better at doing this thing right
where maybe what we look at is what is
the objective of the retrospective what
are we trying to get out of that and is
there some other way that we could do it
right or teams that have code reviews
formal code reviews that are
unbelievably painful maybe we could do
pair programming maybe we could use pull
requests maybe right there are different
ways that we could actually get this
work done
but typically we just try and keep
getting better at the actions because we
expect that's gonna give us a better
outcome problems with this is that the
the improvement is very small it's very
you know very tiny if anything right and
if focus on getting it right actually
creates an environment where failure
becomes hidden we start to pretend that
we're doing our jobs well even when we
don't feel like we actually are and when
failure is hidden right we want to look
good so now what we've done is we've
actually introduced this fear of failure
into the organization and as we all know
fear leads to the dark side what we need
is double-loop learning in double-loop
learning what we do is every once in a
while we step back and we question those
base assumptions
may-maybe code reviews aren't such a
good idea
maybe if we want to share learning
there's something else that we could do
right and so we think about what else is
it that we could do and we change the
actions and we measure the outcomes and
if it gets better that's great but
everyone smile we go back and we
challenge those assumptions again the
thing is we work in a complex
environment right our jobs are there
even even what we do today software
development is different than it was
like in the 70s in the 80s right when I
started what we were doing was we were
on
meeting manual processes we were taking
you know filing systems legal docketing
systems and you know accounting systems
and we were we were making them
digitized today what we're doing is
we're discovering entirely new
environments and entirely new products
what we do is very complex and complex
environments change they change
continually so what works for you today
and your organization may not work for
you tomorrow you have to keep going back
and challenging those base assumptions
and trying new things that is
fundamentally the experimentation
mindset continue to explore different
ways so I mentioned best practices
before there's a few things I want you
to take away from this talk but if
there's only one this will be it I'm
going to ask you to deliberately drop
the phrase best practice and instead use
the phrase leading practice small change
large impact best implies it's finite
there is one best way to do this you
can't get better than best can you but
leading suggests this is what's
currently winning this is the way that
we prefer right now but there may be
another way that we discover is better
so oftentimes when I give this talk it
is at agile conferences and I'm talking
to people who are interested in or are
actively engaged in you know agile work
now how many of you consider yourselves
to be in in an agile or agile ish
environment you got a couple hands up
and I got a couple people saying hello
nose response I get from that audience
quite often is yeah this is all good
stuff doc but let's not worry about that
because we're agile right and if we're
agile then obviously you know we're
iterating and we're incrementing and you
know we're doing all these things
already right I mean come on look at our
graphs
it shows this is what we're doing we in
the agile space don't have an
implementation mindset at all right
we're not worried about getting it right
right I mean okay so maybe there's a few
frameworks and a couple of
certifications well ah right a few
certifications maybe okay so maybe
there's a ton of certifications
right the agile community suffers from
this as much as any other does right we
are so worried about the practices and
are you doing those right we've got got
more possible certifications in almost
any other industry that I know right so
yeah no problem here right but there is
some light there is there are some some
shining lights within even that industry
how many of you know this guy let me
know woody Zul yeah one got two right so
woody has become a bit of a hero of mine
woody worked for a company called hunter
labs and while there the team's that he
led they ran all kinds of experiments on
the way that they were delivering
software and the things that they were
doing and out of that some significant
change came and he actually did a very
good job to bring it back to a broader
community you may or may not be familiar
with some of the things that that woody
was involved in one of them is the no
estimates movement anybody familiar with
this so this is actual organizations
where they are they are delivering
software on a regular basis and no one
is estimating the amount of work
required to get any single thing done
and it actually works despite all of the
counter arguments it actually works and
the one that completely blew my mind
mob programming so I have gone into a
number of organizations and I've
suggested that they might want to try
pair programming and the answer usually
is what are you nuts we're gonna put two
people at one computer that's a complete
waste
you know we need we need everyone should
be it effect why not two computers for
each one person so we can double their
throughput right like we look at pair
programming ago well that that's got to
be a waste teams of eight teams of ten
one computer all working together sounds
insane right can't possibly work cannot
possibly be right
I used mob programming a couple years
ago took a team of individuals who were
all Android developers no iOS experience
whatsoever at the time had never seen
objective-c only Java one member of the
team that new iOS development mob
program for three weeks the entire team
was proficient and was able to actually
launch new new applications for our
customers right the rate of learning and
information exchange that happens with
this but my point really is that you
know there are folks that are actually
experimenting even within that space and
are bringing that stuff back to the
community so we talked about this you go
from implementation to experimentation
right and that's kind of true it's true
primarily because that's how we've
structured most of our educational
systems the reality is that you can
experiment all the way through so there
are a number of school systems that are
now doing this I've seen you know
Montessori has been around for quite a
while
I've been reading actually quite a bit
about schools in the Netherlands where
you know where they're they're
completely breaking free from any of
kind of the classic curriculum and
getting amazing results it turns out
that yes we can actually learn all the
way through with experimentation without
having to have all of those kind of
boundaries etc right just look at this
in in some companies and I'll go through
this kind of relatively quickly but you
know serve what are ways that you can
experiment within an organization but
on your team and you know broader I
think the first is kind of the obvious
right we can experiment with the actual
product itself so you know maybe doing a
B or split testing right if you've got
high enough volume of customers and you
can actually or or you've got the time
to wait to get to statistical
significance you could also do
multivariate right so you know a B
obviously you just got two versions of
the application and you route different
customers to it multivariate now you can
actually run several experiments against
each other at the same time and several
variances of those experiments against
each other at the same time the biggest
challenge of multivariate is you've got
to have enough volume if you don't then
the results are not statistically
significant groupon we ran multivariate
all of the time and with rare exception
it took us three days to get this to
statistical significance I have
customers now that I advise against it
it would take them six months so it's
not it's actually not worth doing but
but let's look at let's look beyond that
right that's kind of the easy stuff how
do we experiment with that that's I
think this stuff that we pretty much
heard about already right what about
like the soft stuff like employee
engagement we've actually in
organizations have run different
experiments we're starting with a team
trying different surveys with them to
see kind of what responses we get and
then coalescing on a standard set of
questions based on there was the you
know the what we're seeing across these
different teams then experimenting with
how do we actually report the results up
how do we action those those results etc
and having helping organizations
actually home grow their own employee
engagement programs which turn out in
many cases to be way better than you
know some kind of generic here's you
know 27 questions pay us $100,000 a year
type stuff team joy this is something
I've been experimenting with for quite a
while
different ways of actually measuring how
happy are the developers or how happy
is the team with their work which by the
way correlates to engagement but there
are other elements to this I've got a
totally different talk that's on metrics
and one of the things I actually found
was team joy was a leading indicator so
when we looked at things like code
quality cycle times throughput velocity
right before those things started to
trend in a negative direction we
actually saw a team joy take a dip first
so if we were monitoring that and we
knew hey something's going wrong here
pull people together start having a
conversation figure out what it is
that's going on so far for developers
the I think the most effective way that
I found to do this is porcelain for get
a little extension when you check in the
code you basically give an indicator
from 0 through 5 your opinion of the
code 0 being I hate this right why do I
even work here and 5 being this was
amazing we should open source it or
something along those lines you can make
up kind of your own your own scale right
you get the idea but here's the thing
we're not asking developers the f-word
right we never we never asked them how
they feel we're asking them their
opinion of the code but that turns out
to be a very good proxy for their
satisfaction with the job right if
you're working in a crappy codebase all
day guess what you're not very happy
most of the time right but if you feel
good about the work that you're doing
and feel good about the code that you're
working on so that was the easiest way
to do it one of the reasons I like that
was because you're capturing it in the
moment right it's not like I worked all
day on some code and then I had a coffee
break and then I went and I had a
cigarette and then someone spilled their
coffee on me and then you asked me how
my day was it was crappy day I got
coffee spilled on me right instead the
moment that I'm checking in the code I'm
saying yeah this is a5 or nope this is
a1 orientation and onboarding do the
same thing so had an organization where
there aren't their orientation
onboarding had
together by their global HR department
which were all fantastic people very
nice but people that were coming into
engineering didn't have enough
information so yep I know you know I
know how to fill out for my 401k and I
know what my insurance options are and I
have my badge and I know where the
bathroom is but I don't know anything
else about this environment that I
actually need like what's the product
right and what am I supposed to be
building so we worked with a number of
different teams had each of them build
kind of their own how would you orient
someone into your team and then
extracted the common stuff to central
classes and basically engineering built
their own orientation and onboarding
over time by experimenting with what
works and what doesn't work across
multiple teams interest leagues are
similar thing where this was interesting
things are basically communities of
practice with a much more cool name but
what we discovered was you know a lot of
organizations that do communities of
practice
it's a top-down thing right director
decides that everybody that works on
Java should attend this meeting once a
month at lunchtime it's mandatory and
here's what we're going to talk about
right and we weren't getting a lot of
engagement so we started actually
experimenting around with well what else
could we do how could we change the
agenda how can we give control back to
you know to the group etc and what we
actually did found was and this again
was all through just kind of running
small experiments and figuring it out
interest leagues are anybody can start
one on any topic that they want it runs
for as long as there is community
interest and it dies when there isn't
and in several organizations we started
seeing things like a front-end league
popping up and management was I didn't I
didn't even realize this was a
possibility here right or a closure
League people who were secretly you know
working in closure over here on the side
and eventually through that able to
actually find ways to bring closure into
the environment
appropriately and add it to the overall
stack etc but it's all you know all
stuff this community driven hackathons
same thing working we actually in an
organization found that there were
several teams that were trying to figure
out ways to do kind of you know FedEx
days right ship it days but they each
were doing something a little bit
different and you know this kind of
worked and that kind of worked and by
bringing them together and running
different types of experiments
eventually came up with a way that we
could actually do hackathons across the
entire organization 2000 developers in
this particular organization and how
could we actually make that work without
you know closing them down for for a
week
salad mentoring programs 360 pure peer
review programs all kind of the same the
same stuff right it's starting off with
something small starting off with a
local team experimenting around did this
work did that work what we do here may
be actually running this with two or
three different teams and then taking
what actually works well and then and
growing it out from there so some other
companies some companies are doing this
type of stuff I'm even familiar with
with valve right so valve I've got a
quote here from gabe newell who's a co
managers institutionalized procedure so
one of things that they actually played
around with was organizational structure
that allowed them to have no managers
and then they actually have done a lot
of work around very fluid and dynamic
teams right so at valve as in as an
engineer you're on a team you're working
on some stuff
hey we go out for beer I tell you about
the team that I'm on you're like hey
that sounds pretty cool so you come in
the next day take your desk pop the lock
roll it over to my area set it down lock
the wheels you're now on my team right
that's it that's that's how you move
around and they found that what's
through through setting up some
guidelines and whatnot they've actually
found that the stuff that needs to get
worked on is consistently worked on and
the stuff that probably shouldn't be
dies because everybody kind of walks
away from that team right one
organization where we actually started
playing around with these concepts one
of the things that came up
from management was whoa whoa uh we're a
little worried about this what are you
worried about this oh well we have some
managers that if we actually allowed
people to just you know like go wherever
they wanted they would immediately leave
the team so that's a real problem yes
that is a problem you knowingly have
crappy managers and are doing nothing
about it right the problem is not that
people will leave the problem is that
those managers are here and you're not
doing anything right so we help them
kind of figure out like oh yeah maybe
you're right maybe we we already have
the problem right these guys buffer
right so I think these guys are actually
as far as experimentation goes some
pretty crazy stuff so they're open about
just about everything right the very
open environment so obviously their
values right their revenue their pricing
models all that's kind of like oh okay
salaries you can see what everybody in
the company makes right email everyone
in the organization can see everybody
else in the organization's email right
that's that's open right and even
they've been working with this and
experiment with this really you know
this is part of their culture but
interestingly enough for them one of the
things that they actually found was they
had done a bunch of experiments around
feedback and in Prior iterations if I
wanted to give anyone feedback it was
done through a private mechanism right
and they made that open and the moment
that they made it open what they
discovered was that the quality of the
feedback went way down the only thing
that was happening was positive feedback
even that positive feedback was less
specific actionable right and critical
feedback just basically disappeared you
know it went it went dark somewhere and
so they realized like all right for
whatever reason they should we can read
each other's email but feedback needs to
stay private and so they actually moved
it back to private but they were willing
to do those experiments and keep trying
and see you know what works what doesn't
work right of course these guys
right Spotify their view of managers as
managers our mentors and how many have
premiere with the Spotify model right so
the things I love most about the Spotify
model if you know Anders Iverson he is
internal gentleman there who is one of
their internal coaches around agility
and organizational structure etc there
is no Spotify model it doesn't exist
right we wrote some stuff down on paper
at one moment in time and the world
grasped onto it as if like that's music
we don't do that that's not what we look
like anymore because they're constantly
experimenting they're constantly trying
new things you know what worked for them
a couple of years ago doesn't work
anymore because they have three times
five times as many engineers in the
organization because they are more
geographically distributed than they
once were because because because right
their context is changing so they're
constantly experimenting they're
constantly moving and adjusting and
adapting and they're measuring as they
go along is this doing what we expect it
to do and if it's not what else could we
try right so these guys are amazing to
watch I would you know keep an eye on
them whatever you think about the
product itself the way that they
actually run that organization is really
very interesting all right so we've
talked about a lot of stuff I mean they
basically give you a kind of four things
to think about is as you know as we
leave here today and then hopefully that
sometime for question answers and I've
covered all of these but but the first
is you know challenge your assumptions
right
you can run experiments out of at a team
level at a very local level it doesn't
have to be some grand change across the
entire organization in fact most of the
things that I've seen work really well
start local they start with just one
team and that one team noodles around
until they figure something out and they
share it with somebody else and then
that team tries it and then some other
team does something a little bit
different and eventually you get this
coalescence where like this is just the
way we do things around here
right so it doesn't have to be a grand
plan
thing but challenge those assumptions
the reason I put Tesla up here is it's
been a little while now but Tesla's
primary mission right is to lower the
carbon footprint
that's why Tesla exists so a couple of
years ago they look at and they said
we've got all of these patents that make
cars more efficient they make them more
economical right and lower the actual
carbon footprint of those vehicles there
is no chance in hell we are going to be
the one car manufacturer in the world so
if we truly want to lower the carbon
footprint we should release all of these
patents to the public domain so every
car manufacturer can use them and can
improve the efficiency of their own
vehicles and that's exactly what they
did now they did hold on to all the
patents for their batteries mm-hmm but
still going back looking at who are we
challenging some base assumptions and
changing the way they actually run their
business based on that right meek
failure acceptable right we want to
avoid we want to avoid the dark side
right we don't want there to be this
fear of failure so we need to make it
acceptable it seems almost contradictory
but when failure is acceptable success
is more likely and yes think big but
start small start local start at your
team it doesn't need to be a grand plan
it doesn't need to be a huge sweeping
change and again oftentimes I feel like
the failures and organizations are
because we try to make them these grand
sweeping changes and we don't learn
enough before we actually implement and
then it becomes about compliance right
the last one be intolerant of mediocrity
this is actually a core value for
companies used to work for and it was
one of the one of my favorite one of my
favorite core values you know I talked
about the best practices right and
leading practices instead but we're all
professionals expecting just a little
bit more of ourselves makes a huge
difference with that just keep
experimenting right just keep trying new
things that's it thank you we've got
about 10 minutes if there's any question
answer stuff I'm gonna pop up this slide
just that you can see if you sent an
email to CTO - it's on your slides calm
subject line experimentation mindset I
will send you a version of this slide
deck as well as links to all of the
research behind it right so there's a
bunch of bunch of stuff in there that's
you know what I'm saying is to some
extent scientifically proven thoughts
questions yeah and health of flight and
corporates yeah for example no
estimation at all while I find it quite
exciting to do I'm thinking okay how can
we actually apply it in an organization
sure yeah yeah so so no estimates
specifically I think there's a couple of
paths right if you're something you want
to explore there's a couple of paths to
no estimates there's actually kind of
two branches of no estimates in general
right so the one is that what we've done
is we're decomposing stories down to a
size that is very consistent small
enough that we no longer need to do any
estimations right basically just count
the stories now if you think about it
that's still estimating right but it's
not a bad start right focus first on
story composition getting consistency
getting consistent throughput right when
you have that and you've got that kind
of predictability right it's easier
you built some trust it's easier to
switch to the second mode of no
estimates which is work on the most
important thing until it is either done
or it is no longer the most important
thing right
and that is in the beginning that's a
little bit harder to convince the
business of but if we actually start
thinking about and we start thinking
about flow and we start thinking about
you know how prioritization etc it
actually makes sense to approach our
work in that exact way but the way that
I would typically do it an organization
is start off looking at flow looking at
story composition build that trust show
you've got that consistency it's much
easier than to make that switch to okay
now what's the most important thing
let's work on that until it's either
done or it's not right so a lot of these
things that's exactly it right if you
soon as you this that think big start
small I've got this end in mind what's a
little thing that I could do that nudges
the business in a particular direction
right and as people get comfortable with
that what's the next little nudge that I
can make and as people get comfortable
with that what's the next one that I can
make right so there are times there are
cases as an example I was actually an
internal employee at an organization and
I wanted to completely get rid of the
employee review process had I gone to HR
and said we are going to abolish the
employee review process over the course
of the next 18 months by iterating and
experimenting they would have said no
you're not and they would have fought
with me all along the way but instead by
just introducing the idea of hey as a
part of the process let's also get
feedback from teammates now as a part of
the process let's also do and hey as a
part of the process let's consider
eliminating this thing that there's no
longer has value because we have great
and over the course of basically 24
months we eliminated the original so
sometimes it's you're making those small
adjustments and I want to say you're
manipulating folks but but you know
announcing the grand plan sometimes is
is gonna you know right and you don't
know what direction it's going to go in
yes exactly the way that actually ended
up I thought it was gonna be like a 360
review thing and it really would like
formally was not 360s at all but it
didn't matter what what it did what we
ended up with was was right for that
organization back there I think it's
also a cultural problem we have to look
why estimates are a problem because
estimates are never treated as estimates
they're always treated as the fix thing
as soon as you give somebody an estimate
everybody forgets the meaning of the
word estimate and we actually treat it
as a fixed thing and that that's a
corporate cultural problem so maybe if
we look at the root cause why are
estimates a problem at the beginning
then we may find ways to take care of
that and change the thinking just a
little bit sure right so it's that's a
very good point right and and some of
that has to be has to do with just the
way that we think about software
projects - and and what we're actually
doing right oftentimes we approach
software projects as if they are
predictable they are not predictable
right and you know we're not I have yet
to meet a software developer who is good
at estimating how long the work will
take I have met several software
developers that are very good at hitting
the estimates they provide that's not
the same thing right if you ask me how
fast I can run a mile at my fastest I
can guess I might be wrong if you but if
I say it'll take nine minutes I
guarantee you I can do a mile in nine
minutes
right and I can do it over and over and
over and over again it's not the same
question and I've seen many many
developers who have convinced themselves
they're good at estimating because
they're good at hitting their own
estimates
what else I'm back here sorry I'm advice
maybe about of some beers last night I
guess it was kind of a question or an
observation but a few companies Avena in
the past have kind of struggled with the
sort of experimentation mindset and it's
been largely around the fact that
there's not coherent view of what the
purpose of the vision of the company is
you know what they're actually trying to
achieve and people are often in conflict
about this and it causes all manner of
sub problems underneath that so I'm just
wondering if that's something you talk
about as being important you know if you
want to look at a company I think don't
have that sort of thing in place is that
something you try and tackle first yes
actually that is that's that's that's
actually an excellent point and it is
very important right I have an entirely
different talk on the building blocks of
a knowledge work cult knowledge work
culture and I talk about autonomy
connection excellence and diversity and
connection and excellence tie into
exactly what you're talking about right
having connection to an actual cause of
vision understanding why we're doing
what we're doing and then excellence
being able to actually see measurable
progress towards the goals towards the
things we're actually trying to achieve
without those right like the rest of
this is just sort of you know
potentially waste right you've got
people working in all different kinds of
directions you've got all these
different factions Conway's law and
Sue's get all kinds of problems right
that alignment becomes very important
and it and it can even be for the next
six months that's the flag in the sand
let's March right we might not even get
there and the flag moves but we need to
be all pointed in the same direction for
a period of time and working towards
that yes
is there such a thing as doing too much
experimentation a company is there such
a thing as doing too much
experimentation ah yes I would say that
there probably is right doing them too
quickly so you're not actually like
giving time to really see you know the
kind of the results right one of the
things we did a group on we ran multiple
experiments in the from a product
standpoint and oftentimes you get a
spike of activity that shows a net
result right and so we'd say someone
would declare it statistically
significant we did great this is now a
feature in the application off we go
let's let's do the you know it's
whatever is whatever is next right and
two weeks later right the novelty of the
feature wore off people then realized
that it actually wasn't very useful they
stopped using it conversions went down
right so sometimes we were doing them
too quickly and we weren't actually
waiting to see what the results were
in other cases when we have absolutely
no idea where we're going or what we're
doing it's not it's it's that the
experiments can kind of be pointless
you know if we're if we're just shooting
in the dark right and have no idea
you've got to have some sense of where
where do we think we're going and then
are we getting feedback that says yep
this is right or not what adjustments do
we need to make or another more local
example teams that will go through a
retrospective at the end of that
retrospective they'll have like a dozen
things that we want to do right so yeah
let's use pull requests let's do TDD
let's do pairing let's do right and what
we and what happens is they change all
the things at once well then you have no
idea it which of the things you changed
had a net positive or a net negative
right if the overall is good then you
don't know what you know you don't know
what actually caused that right so I see
that quite a bit especially with teams
you know it's hard sometimes once you
kind of get the the
favor of like weight we can change
things they start changing too much then
you don't know what else
I guess with this as well certain things
I've seen in the past is bad experiments
you know like things too like
confirmation bias like an experiment to
prove that that's awesome yes do you see
that how do you calm by that or how do
you make people more aware of that you
know cuz you can make bad experiments
you know you can and I know and you know
in in some environments I've seen things
where you know the data even says right
like you built it they didn't come but
the executive says nope it's good and so
we stick with it anyway
and that's that's that's a that's a
deeper systemic problem right that
actually has all very little to do with
experimentation at that point that has
to do with you know hubris driven
product lines right if it's driven by
ego then we got it and we got a problem
from the from the very beginning yeah
yeah cool we're out of time
I'm around for the rest of the day and
I'm going to PubCon tonight so you know
glad to chat with folks thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
