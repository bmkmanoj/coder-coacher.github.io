senior platform engineer at the company
called unica's here in Oslo and joining
Unicode almost six years six months ago
and before that I was mainly a dotnet
developer now I'm working with the title
said communities Google Cloud orbit of
Java go and what I'm going to show you
today is written in bash so I'm trying
to hurt myself slowly in many ways
basically which is quite fun so the
agenda today is I'm going to show what
the problem is that that we solved with
this small solution as a hope or think
that more people might have that are
using communities and need to store
ticket somehow also our water solution
looked like to understand the problem
and a small them off tool that we have
open source so everyone can try it out
quite easily so first what is the
problem and understand the problem we
need to understand what we do at unicode
in only the high level we are sort of an
aggregator of many data providers and
which we take the different providers
and then sell it on the other side all
these providers here on the my right
side your left side are sending us files
in s3 buckets and to access those s3
buckets we have a lot of different
credentials PI partner and that we need
to manage them now so this is our way of
dealing with it before why she had this
thing we mainly put these things in
different configuration for every
project which is sort of a pain s to
to handle in the long run yeah so the
requirements for a solution is that we
of course don't want any crunches in in
the source code and if they'll be
working with kubernetes there is
something called community secrets where
you can exist or the secrets in Java
files
the problem is the secrets aren't really
encrypted in those files it's only
base64 encoded which is they are
encrypted but with a really bad
encryption so we don't want to store
there those llaman files or json files
you can use as well instead we need to
have the files encrypted somehow and
generate cooperations file on the need
basis it should be a simple as possible
and since we are quite small companies
would sell well not in 10 million years
here in Oslo we don't want to host
anything if we can sir that's why we're
also running everything in the cloud and
it should preferably work somehow will
come in secret and it should be one
location we can store everything so our
solution today's we at that this time we
only evaluated two things one was the
world project from Natasha Corp and but
they don't have any hosted solutions yet
host everything yourself if we want to
use that and not have any experience
with it either and it's now integration
with the kubernetes secrets and then we
also looked at get secret which is a I
think the open source project it's a
tool based on the GPG tools and using
get to Jack to store their credentials
and you get the encrypted ones and we
host it in the gift repo which is
something we already have so that was
what we settled on now there is actually
one secret
store available in Google Cloud called
key management something but that was
available after us so we should probably
long run evaluator but I'm not sure
we're going to
depends on how easy to use and our needs
and introducing that because it's
secrets we can tell it and all this is
basically a set of helper script to help
you work with get secrets and also
interact or could get the communication
right we've learned committee secrets
and I think that's time for a short demo
that was sort of not expected a quick
presentation let's see the same as you
so I'm going to show how to work and how
the script work you can get them from
this github repo if you want to open the
Wi-Fi is working it is so when you have
rapport you just need to initialize the
repo which you do by running the init
script and this is asking you for your
first a email account which should be
stored on with your GPS GPG tools which
you have to have installed on your local
computer then it's going to use the
typical de Gigi private and public key
to encrypt and decrypt your secrets so
now we have initialized a repo and made
the first initial commit as well and and
to actually get this thing work smoothly
with community secrets we are enforcing
a folder structure and where you store
your keys so they should be stored on
the secret for a specific could be
application or whatever I call it the
NBC here and then we also have a
subfolder so you can a different
categories for secret so this is the
folder I'm going to store my
and my first secret is hello.txt and if
that was the kid you don't want to
commit this to to get up because then
you have it on plain text don't get up
even though we have a private repo it
should be sort of safe but we want to
encrypt this and to do that we have a
small helper script but now encrypted
everything and created SSE hello hello
text secret which we can do a a here's a
fun little one and here's the secret
which is much harder to read and we can
now actually remove the secret and
decrypt it to get it back so that it's
back now so we can actually now we can I
should comment and push this the secret
file to get up wherever and it's
encrypted and it quite horrifying one to
two with and so that's the first one how
you actually add in a secret to this
repo next Park is how do you interact
now with a kubernetes and for that we
have this script code which is just a
bash script and I hope it's using as
much standard things as possible so it
works both on the Linux and OS X but we
have only tried it on OS X so far so but
I hope it works on Baskerville or other
distributions so what is come on here
I'm going I'm taking everything in the
MVC /sq folder and add that to the app
secret Cuban et secret so if if before
we run that this command let's do a cube
detail which is the Sailor TL I tuned
for
committees and look which security we
have now this is our sandbox environment
running on Google cloud so we don't have
any app secret as you see now and if we
run this script we should now have added
script to there is a secret to the
committed and we can see that actually
contains hello as well by doing goop CTL
ticket secret and as I said it's base64
encoded so if we actually square you
need to do this so it says hello so now
we have the secret running on inner tube
in this cluster which means that all the
containers and pubs and whatever in our
cluster can I read this secret if we
give them access to it so not have
access to this by default we have to
actually give access to the city to the
one and so that's the second part and to
give it something access to two secrets
you need to write a configuration file
for pubs which can be a set of of
containers and so in this definition for
a pod we create a volume called
app secrets and tell communities to use
the secret name that name app stick as
well as base for this volume then we
also mount this volume to this location
so now if we actually can create this
pod can show it's not here now we don't
have anything that's named MDC because
at the name of the pod and the C pod
so if you create this more now a photo
jumble
quite I'm great this is easy quite fast
because it is actually running in your
cloud will committed smell like what is
up and running scene you see here and
now we can execute the command to check
do we have access to the secrets in this
pod which was a goal and to do that I
have a small helper script to execute
execute LS in this folder which where we
mounted the secrets in this pod so these
secrets yes right that good we can also
show that it is posted correctly and so
we can actually access it so it says
okay in in this file
there was this content yeah so that's
all good but then we also might want to
update secrets which you might do and so
let's update this existing one with
hello well one thing we have to do after
we actually change the text of hello
we do need to do encrypt it again
otherwise if we'll get overwritten with
the old data so we can write secure hide
on the right folder in the right file so
now we really encrypted it with a new
content and if you see here it shows
that I have a I have a change in my repo
which I haven't committed and it's this
one here this file and what this file
actually said it's just we are sort of
using the git repo as a database as well
telling us where we have stored all the
secrets or for which application they
are used
so here we are saying that all the
MD CST secrets are used in the UC procs
sandbox environment in the QT secret
called app secrets and this file is used
to actually update all the secrets when
anonymous - or c'mon win the script so
now it's going to go through this folder
structure and find all the community
secrets file names and ask you Benitez
hey can give me the current existing
circus with this name and then update
just grant you that that I want to
update so now when after the date it
hopefully doesn't change I did change
the quadtest doesn't change immediately
because if you like synchronizing the
class term before it gets available but
now when we run the same command we get
hello world miss kinzey
I can do like distant associate so you
have hello hello world out so that's
easy way to update all the secrets so
let's go back to de slide and you can
also quite easily add multiple secrets
and visit us and so a quick pros and
cons list these issues get secret they
are known tubes because we know gets
into four so that was quite easy we had
to write a couple lines of a script
which was fun in a weird way and we did
manage to get inspiration with
communities and get gives us both an
audit log and the complete history so we
can easily if we write the wrong secrets
or marking revert back to the previous
secrets is quite good and it's also
distributed so if it crashes someone
else will have have the data and one
drawback is that more keys the more case
you have it's going to take longer time
to decrypt the repo and
something like that in running like this
great so far it's not an issue for us
but if you have say thousands of Secrets
we are we are sort of right below 100 so
it's still manageable but if you go way
above that it's going to be taken bit
too long I think
and also doesn't have any API in which
you can maybe listen to or things like
that so we have to do inside the pub you
might need to monitor the file to find
updates to the secrets manually and by
that there was quite easily stolen and
was really for us it made sense to use
this one but as we grow we might might
consider changing to the Google kms has
a code in goes out but jammu see and and
we can also use this in more than just
communities if you want to just a
question of how much work want to put
into it and I think that was all I said
work for Munich Austin we are hiring so
if you want to work with Google Cloud
things and a lot of data then just go to
this side the 20 jobs and see which
positions we have open and that's all
