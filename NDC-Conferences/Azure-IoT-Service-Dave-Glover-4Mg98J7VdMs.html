did before was much more about the
devices and so it's specifically focused
on Windows 10 IOT core really about so
microsoft form variety this session here
is more about the services and in fact
the demo I'm doing is going to be a
Raspberry Pi zero running Python and
Linux which is talking to Azure and I'm
going to show you a cup of a couple of
projects that I've kind of got out there
that might kind of give you some
inspiration so the focus behind this
session is really probably this
highlighted bit some here as opposed to
any kind of particular device things so
a good again they I think the thing that
we talked about the last session was
that the focus around Microsoft has
really been around I'm kind of
enterprise capabilities or building
these things out to such a scale and all
that kind of secured all these types of
things that people can go and build and
deploy real applications and know that
they're secure and manageable an
updateable on all these types of things
so to that end we are building out a
huge range of services up in Azure that
are quite focused on I OT and I will
talk about these so the first one we
have up there as IOT hub and made the
way I mostly think about it it's kind of
like a pub sub you can push a whole lot
messages and do and other people can can
subscribe to the events that are coming
out of it and you've got topics and all
those types of things you can go in to
find and it's a general-purpose
messaging hub for pushing it a lot of
messages suggestion a lot of messages
processing it pushing it out to the next
part of the business process that might
be doing now the thing that we've built
on top of event hub is this thing called
IOT hub and IOT hub does a lot of the
work that you could do it on event huh
but you'd have to go and do a lot of
work around it so we've done a whole lot
of stuff around IOT hub which builds on
top of event
but deals for example with all the
provisioning of devices and the
certificates for their and managing that
whole process and the database which
keeps all those devices in and be able
to bring them online or maybe that
device has gone rogue because you want
about a shut it down and not letting
learn the information coming to your
system IOT hub deals with all of that so
it's a provides a portal from mass
internet scale ingestion of data and
gesture and you can horizontally
petition I think I think by default up
to 32 or you can write to Microsoft and
say can I have more please and you can
define them up i think 512 a big size
number of these petitions and then you
can have all these devices pushing these
petitions and you get vast scalability
for these Internet of Things device you
can imagine building out some which is
just gone nuts and you want to bow to
get all that data into the system there
is a the other thing about this is it's
priced at commodity now I'm not going to
go into pricing here but if you go up in
d'azur you go up into the pricing
calculator you're going to say look I've
got X number of messages and you'll find
that there's a free scale so if you want
to play around with this you can do you
can go and register free of charge up on
a zero for IOT hub and you get a eight
thousand message subscription so eight
thousand messages per day subscription
and for playing around and getting your
head around what's going absolutely fine
you'd be amazed how quickly eight
thousand messages goes though you've
only got to start seeing them every like
10 to 20 seconds and you have eaten
update 8000 in the day so but just know
that's out there so you're only good at
you go up there you register you do it
to put your credit card of details in
but it's only for authorization so it's
only for identification we're not going
to take any money off you if you go over
there 8,000 you're not suddenly going to
be charged on your credit card it's
absolutely locked at zero and to your
side yep this is cool and I want to take
you to the next level and there are a
number of subscriptions out there up to
light I think the next one there is four
hundred thousand messages per day and
then there's you know I'm gazillion
messages per day I'm obviously
exaggerating there's a pisser pricing
calculator
to go and check so I OT hub is really
the fundamental building block for a lot
of the IOT scenarios out there now on
top of that there's obviously a huge
range of services and in fact this slide
I think is actually probably a year out
of date because you've only got a blink
and to know that there was a new service
come out for a zero so the other ones
they would talk about is stream
analytics is in one play drama stream
analytics okay so stream analytics let's
go I can tell you anything stream
analytics I think about it is real-time
aggregation so imagine you've got a
system that's pumping in data so you're
all these devices and sensors around
inside your business as its pushing and
data and you kind of want to get a
real-time sense of what's going on
what's the average temperature what's
what's happening in the water flow in a
particular valve or some like that and
you're not interested in every one
that's coming through its sub-second
ingestion into IOT hope you might say
I'm actually really interested in the
aggregate so over a window let's say we
go and set up a what's called a tumble
window you can set up like a tumble
window of five minutes and you might get
a whole empty messages coming in that
five-minute window and you want the
average of what that sensor is and then
the next five min x 5 minute next five
minutes so you can going to find these
various types of window types tumbling
window types so that's kind of what
stream medics about it's about the
ability to kind of almost and well in
real time be able to do data aggregation
and when you're going to look at the the
language of stream analytics it looks
awfully like sequel T sequel you got
select statements from statements
aggregate it's basically a subset I
guess of T sequel so if you're playing
playing around with sequel on various
platforms you'll look at and think I
recognize that and there's some great
examples all those companies so that's
what stream analytics is about it's
about you got stacks of data coming in
and you want a way of just literally
going into the UI and saying this is my
data point this is where my data is
being collected that's my input for my
stream analytics this is well what the
data to go and in the middle I'm going
to have
sort of query some sort of aggregating
queries okay every five minutes one of
the data comes in i'm going to aggregate
it then i'm going to push you out one
every five minutes and that's your data
every five minutes so that's that's
probably the meaning meaningful and for
your business so there's what stream
analytics is about and on top of that
you can also use things that power bi
and to power bi you can basically link
it to an output from stream analytics
and say okay now go to power beyond it
zoom up later on power bi ok cool and
you can basically it's kind of an end
user it's not an in-use it's a business
analyst tool and you can go along their
map out graphs and roast types of things
and i'll show you kind of how their
works I kind of touched on the devices
part and I think for pretty much
everyone was in here so just talk about
some of the security in there and I've
already talked about the editions of the
last session so that was the Enterprise
Edition mobile edition and that was just
kind of a bit of a recap for people who
hadn't come along now in terms of how
you might think about architect of these
things and there are a number of ways
imaging gum build solutions that are
kind of Internet enabled and it very
much depends on your starting point and
in fact that's where I spotted it
because I remember thinking I hunted
around for so so through it so there are
number of ways in which you get and you
might have devices that you in your
business and you might have had them
there forever or 30 years or whatever
there's some historic investment in
process control systems and they talk
protocols which maybe aren't necessary
such commonplace of protocols now and
what you can do what you can deploy out
there is something we call it a field
gateway so if you go hunting for IOT
field gateway it's a project up on
github and you can download all the code
free to use it and we have put in
effectively bridges that bridge from
things I at the OPC what we decided was
all a process control systems co-op is
another one from very though these are
protocols are built for very small
footprint devices which really had very
little processing capability almost no
memory
and learn that a flash rom and they can
just talk over a socket or whatever it
might be to start doing things so we've
got these devices out there typically
historic devices and you want some sort
of way to go to bridge those across into
things like IOT hub so the field gateway
is your friend and it's got all the
source code out there and there's lots
of examples out there and you can go and
build things and we've got examples out
there for MQTT co-op will join which
I'll show before and things of that and
those are basic providers and then on
the other side of that you can basically
say look I want to talk to energy hub
and for example IOT hub as its main
protocol is this thing called amqp yes I
think stands for secure and its advanced
message queue protocol system security
oh gosh no missing so much I'm ring okay
so that is that and it's again it's an
interesting protocol interesting enough
amazon use it as well so it's a protocol
that's kind of recognized across the
industry people like it's nicer
skateable works very well in
multi-tenant environments across cloud
and balances out that apologies so so
these platforms here can Cambria cross
into probably amqp yes or you might have
other platforms out there and the other
really popular protocol that's been out
in the wild for a long time is this
thing called MQTT has anyone spotted
this use these okay so it's now
interested does anyone know where MQTT
came from session IBM protocol and it
came out with the procession process
control systems so I believe in a knows
where it came from and I beam have a
program system called message queue and
this was declined and that's message
queue telemetry tell it to limit or
transport and it's basically over socket
and there's a bit of a connection and
you can do guarantee delivery and
acknowledgment all those types of things
and the building to the protocol and so
it's it's a protocol that you find a lot
of places as well you do find that
particularly things like Dino projects
and process control systems all the way
to how to down there you'll find MQTT
all these types of protocols and in
these flexible systems we as at about
six months ago now natively support MQTT
as well so if you've got historic
systems out there using MQTT and you
want to bridge it across all can have
that connected into IOT hub we support
those protocols natively into il t-hub
the other protocol that we support
hardly surprising is HTTPS so you might
say look the only thing I can do as I've
got just enough resources and a Shiva
probably quite a few more resources to
go and talk HTTPS and you can do it you
can do what does it it's probably a be a
pot you need to do HTTP port and you can
push the informations that right you
don't put you do a put in a post when
you yep and and the way in which you get
if you want to do command control you
basically pole you got up there and say
is there a new message no there's no it
isn't your message now this night yes
there is any brother right need you
start you know Turner Belvoir and things
of that it's not the most scalable
approach using HTTP and I think the
recommendation was and I don't know why
this is but the recommendation was you
polled around about every 20 minutes now
why is it 30 minutes lot 30 minutes why
is not 15 the port of group kind of said
you should think about 20 minutes where
is these MQTT and mkmk pierce it kind of
more session based and you can send a
message straight down and then you can
have your system immediately respond to
that messages come through and as I said
before down here we deal with things
like device manager provisioning and
identity and security all those types of
things and they obviously provide a
mechanism by which to get out get their
data at the other end so that's kind of
what the IOT hub is about it so it's
about providing effectively this bucket
of capability of ingesting messages make
sure they're secure making sure the
device is valid inside that system and
then be able to get out that information
at the other end now the thing about
what we're doing around irt hub is we
want to make sure that it's applicable
across of wide range of platforms so not
just Windows 10 IOT
not just the Microsoft ecosystem we want
it to be everywhere to that end we have
open sourced the ideas your IOT as us
Scalia 0i RT sdk and in that you can
download all that and you can build
pretty much any platform out there there
was an SDK for it and I've actually also
done won't a couple letter on not on
here does anyone play around with the
esp8266 and I've got one here my bag
somewhere yeah so if you come to my
github so github.com / glove boxes and
this chip on here is actually really
popular one it started in the making
community but you're also seeing real
coming real Prada come out of it just to
give you an example about
commoditization this is chipped here
which come out of China and it's
arduino-compatible it's also got
built-in Wi-Fi and it's got enough
memory in there to better do an HTTPS
and for an embedded device of for a
couple bucks it's amazing that you can
do HTTPS and secure transactions from
this little device here or cup you it's
got Wi-Fi built into it you can put
sensors on it and you can see I've got a
little B mp280 which is a little
temperature and pressure and humidity
sensor on and I could HTTP push that up
into as Europe and it fully secured so
really quite remarkable you can do it
from a devices as small as this now the
demo that i'm going to do should I have
to say I've been in Microsoft for over
20 years and this is the first time I've
actually done a linux and Python demo
and I've been kind of getting more and
more into Raspberry Pi and Linux and
I've actually kind of been finding my
way around it so on the desk here I've
got a Raspberry Pi zero is anyone seen
their eyes beep I zeros there like now
in Australia they cost you about 30
bucks but if you buy them from the UK
and you better pay like a ten dollars
shipping you can get them from
they call Pam orion i think they call
themselves and they've they're like
hen's teeth very difficult to get hold
of but you get hold of these devices for
about ten dollars plus out of ten bucks
to shipping you think about 20 bucks and
they're quite a nice little system and
you can get they run the next on them
and you can go and run and I do I run
mono on them so mono is the open source
version of Dom net and I'd kid not I do
run a reasonably sophisticated system on
mono on this style of device but also
you can go and play around with with
linux and python in this case so what
we've done is that we've we've delivered
a c++ as your SDK and of which you get
clone it onto your Raspberry Pi you
might think you've why would I do that
you do it and then you had the joy of
compiling the c++ library on the
Raspberry Pi and basically you kind of
get it running and you get a bit and in
the morning you wake up and the
compilers completed I think it probably
takes maybe two to three hours maybe
it's going to be a couple of hours I
didn't I must as I'd literally to get a
bit and then so it goes and compiles up
all the libraries for you and then you
go and compile up the sea libraries the
Python libraries which basically talk on
top of those see libraries and that's
how you get it and then once you've got
that up and running you've got a Python
platform where you can now start talking
to as you now the way that I like to do
these ones as I use a product it's free
charge on the web it's called bitwise
and it's a nice little client which can
talk SSH and SFTP and what so what I've
got here is you can see that I from
windows I can use code which is kind of
nice platform so just be clear I could
equally remote terminal to this so i can
plug in a keyboard and things of that
and I could use the Python editor on the
Raspberry Pi but it's really you got to
be patient because it's a slow platform
or it can go and use the way I'm doing
over HTTP
I can bring it into code and then I've
got this kind of nice platform and I
could even go and execute the Python
code i'm on windows get it or working
then push it across on to the Raspberry
Pi and you know it can be much more
productive and you can see down here
that I've got a key now I'm just jumping
around a bit so of Paula geez I'm going
to jump around okay so step back from
that so what I've also installed on this
desktop is something called device
explorer and again you can get device
explorer off the IOT SDK site and the
device explorer is not a product that
you would ship it's an SDK and we
provide all the software for it and you
would actually go and embed the
technology that we put into the software
into your product you would go and build
a portal for managing your devices and
you use the cause and you can go through
this code zrk that's how you can
register device that's I delete it
that's how I disable it that's against
security on all that type of thing so
this is what this product is it's not
the sort of products an SDK it's a
demonstrator and you remember before
that I said that you need to go and
register devices and there's a UI and
the end and we can go and call it I know
in DC Sydney in DC Sydney and what they
would do is they'll put it into the
device register you inside IOT hub and
you will see that there goes my NDC
Sydney and I could right mouse click on
it and I could get the connection string
and that's exactly what I've done down
here so you'll find one below it and
you'll see if I copy that that's how you
get the connection string and if I go
back to my Python code I copied and
pasted my connection string it up there
and that's why I got it and then that'll
go on the code will go look at that now
one of you might be some of you might be
thinking heck he's just deployed a
solution with a hard-coded connections
organism so we are actually bringing out
a connection a connection service
connection string service fort of a
better words so you better manage that
so rather you better manage if you need
to update it or whatever you need to get
rid of our updated or change it what do
we need to go and do you can go and do
that but in this case here you can see
I've actually put the code into the
application and if I and then some stuff
there around services and then basically
it just sits down here in a loop and
that I've got a hat so in the in the
Raspberry Pi world you call them hats
there's umano it stands for it's going
to wear things I hardware attached on
top I think sort of what a hat stands
for and there is a specification so
Arduino type shields raspberry PI's have
hats that's kind of it and in this hat
there is a temperature and a barometer
and a sheer light sensor in there as
well and a motion sensors you can kind
of figure out which way it's going just
some basic sensors and you'll see down
here that when i installed the linux
libraries for this viro hat and borrow
fat in fact they call it i get access to
a library if I just scroll back up the
top here it's called by Rahat importing
the light the weather and the LEDs and
if I scroll down back here you'll see
that there goes their pressure because
their weather temperature and there goes
a light level so that's kind of what's
going on there so and then below that
you'll see I just convert it to Jason
and push the message they should that's
the mission as you a method there to
come it's in the message out excuse me
so that's kind of how it's working so
it's amazing so it could be across all
those those platforms that I showed you
we provide SDKs in this example here
I've just used a raspberry pi but you
can do it across a whole range of
platform non-microsoft there can be c++
some bedded systems they can be linux
systems or windows systems whatever
we're provided a huge SDK and you can
get out there and build things now it
says losing his voice
if I go back to this device Explorer and
remember this is just for your own
development purposes it's not something
use of production skewing so what you
can see now is those are the items that
are coming from this raspberry pi so
this one's been PI over Wi-Fi is Bridget
onto my phone and from the phone as
bridge down to the internet so I'm just
using a hotspot of my phone and you'll
see that am I going cover so the light
level there is light at 42 if I go and
cover that you'll see it drops down to
zero and it will pop back up to 42 so
it's real time real time data and so
said that data is running on a
linux-based systems it's using the c++
sdk and we've provided a python library
and in this case I've gone and compiled
it up so that's kind of how that's
working and up here there is also very
rudimentary example and its really again
just provided so you can kind of see
what's going on and if I jump back over
to the dashboard have I changed your
scripts I don't we do about this
so I think I'm hopefully just rebooted
that and if I come over here and said
hello nothing matters for the typo
that's hello world and I'm there there
goes my spelling mistake so there goes
that message that got sent from as your
hub this message this device here was
basically had subscribed to the messages
and the message came down and obviously
I would use it to go and change the
state of something that was connected up
to this Raspberry Pi turn the valve on
to the light on what if it was change
the rate in which you go measuring it
could be whatever things out there and
you'll also see is that these are what
it's doing is sending a message and i'm
getting a confirmation back from azure i
OT hub to say yep got the message and
you could obviously go and change the
behavior of your app if it wasn't
connecting on to things of that so
they've done my first demo ever on
python the Raspberry Pi in Linux and it
works really quite surprisingly well
it's very good it's I'm a bit of a fan
of the next raspberry insane tibbetts pc
debian linux so that's an example there
of how that all works now in terms of so
in terms of tools that i use by the way
if you're going to be doing some of the
stuff for linux and you're using Windows
development environment there are a
couple of really useful tools and the
might surprise you the source of these
tools so one of them is actually a
really good application in windows 10
store and it's called or my name and
basically limits uses something called
mdns and it's multicast dns and it's a
way in which it goes in broadcast this
is who I am this is what my addresses
the same can find me and it's really
useful because if you just if you don't
have that there you put a device on the
network
one of our it's as ancient to it you've
got to find the address something more
like a my stuff it's a really useful way
I used to like bring up my home router
go down my router find out oh that's the
dhcp address of Scott and kind of get
jumped in that way but this is a really
useful tool the other really useful tool
is something cool as an apple product
and I actually use the Apple print
Bonjour application because Bonjour is
actually a mdns client and if you
install that on to windows and then
Windows now becomes a big weekend
resolves across the whole platform and
so you can go and so you'll see that I
often inside this application over here
you'll see if you were very keen of
sight it's raspberry pi 0 sh dot local
and it's a keyboard or the Apple product
which is actually doing the name
resolution and it makes it much easier
to work with otherwise you have to hack
around with IP addresses forever feels
like forever okay so that was the main
bit of that demo so the next thing we're
to talk about is stream elements and
I've kind of touched upon that already
its kind of this real-time capability
and the next thing I'm going to talk
about is power bi so what I'm going to
do is jump into as you as everyone
played around with as you yep cool great
okay so all I want to do is I created a
new resource or a new job called a
stream analytics and you define an input
you define an output and you define a
query so in the input over here I
defined it to be IOT hub the IOT hub
could live in my current subscription or
it could be in another subscription and
I've got the keys to it so you can do
like that the output in this case I'm
actually I could maybe push it onto
another process maybe a logic app or
some other but what I'm going to do is
I'm going to push it into power bi
and I'll show you how that works and
then I define a query and as I said
before if you've done any sequel I'm a
suspect most of us have had that joy or
pain it looks an awful lot like sequel
your ass leg statements and froms and
entities and group buys and you remember
I mentioned about these things called a
tumble window tumble window in this case
it got 30 seconds so I'm interested all
the temperature comes up and i'm going
to chunk it up into 30 seconds and get
the in this case here you can see i'm
getting the average temperature average
humidity light and air pressure and i
wanted to know what the what's this one
here the make certain the date of their
one now in this example I've actually
dealt with a problem that I tried and
multitude of ways to get around in the
end I found a very simple solution one
of the biggest challenges with ir t is
time they had to get at the time so I've
spent probably way too much time working
with ntp or real time clocks on these
things so that this type of thing has
has a sense of time the other way you
can do it depending on what your
business requirements are you can see
what if i don't care about what times on
the device it's not that interesting to
me what I am interested in is the time
that it got include into IOT hub which
is probably going to be rough at the
same time so that's what I've done so i
must so i moved away from trying to get
time correct on the device to say
actually i'm just interesting the time
it gets there reaches a device there
reaches IOT hub so that's one of the
things they're so and i did dig around
this so basically you can go and you can
see it's called event include UTC time
and it's just a nice way of dealing the
time because time and invariably in IOT
is a is a pain is anyone else taking
that approach that you try to put time
on to the device some devices they just
need to know the time because if they're
going to schedule something locally and
you want to do it at a particular time
but for maybe a lot of sense of
scenarios issue times all that important
on the device so that's kind of what we
got there
so and then I basically clever job and
start it up and it's just processing and
the only thing that's streaming data to
that portal at the moment is I think it
is someone's out there doing it is this
Raspberry Pi and the next thing we're
going to do and i have to say i didn't
get really too much of a chance to go
and check this
and I'm pretty sure that's not what it's
called
slightly worries me because doesn't
matter i'm just going to talk you
through so the reason I don't that I
think of actually mucked up my my stream
Alaric's job I think I've just mr. find
your name because I know data is going
into the hub because I can see it from
the IOT Explorer and I know that data
has been processed I think I've made a
typo in terms of what our names because
what I would expect to see is down here
a data set named Raspberry Pi zero and
there isn't one so it just means I've
screwed up somewhere so for the for the
want of this demo I just keep going a
little bit because I've got another data
set except i know the data is not real
and i meant there may be no data showing
up so so out from the output of that
query but just jump back over here
go to the query you can see I've got
Celsius humidity light blah blah blah
and device ID and geolocation and if i
come across the power bi all those
fields will automatically appear when
it's working correctly they will appear
in this drop-down menu and then it just
becomes a matter of saying now how is it
going to do this apologies for this so I
would come across here and select my
chart type and let's just say I want a
large heart come across there and how do
I do this again i say time creators is
on the axis and i say the device ID goes
on the legend and let's say its
temperature goes on values and because
as though data going in there but you
kind of get the idea that you can then
that there is some data that looks to be
old data I suspect there's one flat line
and because it's probably all probably
old data that I've got in there but you
can see that power bi gives you this
capability to literally inside the
inside of web browser go and define a
report and look at that data so remember
that data is kept it on all your vast
array of Internet of Things devices
they're getting pushed into ird hub it's
been summarized in real time by stream
analytics and the output of that is
going into power bi and clearly power bi
is not interested in them in the
millisecond data it's probably instant
hourly or weekly or daily kind of
aggregates and that's kind of what this
tool is about and it gives you a very
nice view of doing that there is a
desktop version of the power bi
designer as well but from memory it
doesn't support data coming out of
stream analytics certainly didn't want
our last a lot better so that's kind of
this whole into n scenario now a few of
you might be thinking that's hard work
and which is going to lend on to my next
part of my talk and what we have done
because we kind of figured that most
people want to go and do not too
dissimilar capabilities what we're bored
out is something called the IOT so it is
your IOT sweet now these uriah tea sweet
as effectively a bundling for what of a
better word of the services like IOT
Harbor stream analytics power bi and is
I think this machine learning there's
Cortana api's and they're all those
types of things you go and use to go and
build out of service so in that I OT
sweet there is basically a starter kit
to say look fundamentally there are a
couple of snow is that we've support and
I'll show you that in a second there
were two scenarios that we support we
support remote monitoring so you go and
literally click on that and say I want a
provision a remote monitoring and it
brings up a generic remote monitoring
with a couple of generic sensors and
then you go and change the the stream
analytics queries based on the data
you've got coming through and you're
going to change a few things in there
and we provide you the framework and all
the all the nice things that i showed
you remember i showed you that device
explore a pretty craig pluggy kind of
thing well this is the kind of that
commercial version so you can say look
Microsoft most of my solution looks like
that I just can take one of those the
other one that we've done is we've done
the sink called predictive maintenance
and again we kind of view that as a
really popular scenario people are
interested in if something changes I
getting a whole stream of data coming
through and maybe I've got a vibration
detection then maybe that would be an
obvious thing that it would say okay
maybe I'm running a lift system I'm
getting vibrations and the motors or the
escalator sort of it might be that data
comes through and then you can do things
or automatic events and
alerts and notifications all those types
of things and cracking your data so we
basically provide kind of two scenarios
and we're going to build on those and
kind of create out more as well so I OT
sweet the remote monitoring scenario out
of those two that I just showed you this
is kind of a bit of a screen snapshot so
you can go and geotag your data have it
haven't visualized you can see which
sensors are sending them you can go on
various charts or all those types of
things so again this is a kind of idea
that your your URIs maybe you're
building for your enterprise or maybe
you're a partner and you're building out
of your IV I should say and you're
building out a product you got to go to
market with and you're selling this and
then X number custom say look can be
tweaked this can you take that and you
got them you've got a basic framework
together and build on so that's all the
IOT suite is and again this is another
screenshot of all the devices out there
the metadata that you keep with their
devices and things out there what
platforms what versions one SDKs are
using and things like that and that's
pretty much it so hope it gives your
sense of IOT hub there is to make it
easy for ingestion mass ingestion of
data typically in IOT snows but there
are a lot of snows which kind of
encompass IOT you can go and build stuff
yourself so we're putting all the
building blocks on there so you've got a
ot hub you've got machine learning
you've got stream melodies your power bi
you've got blob storage for saving data
all those types of things or you can say
what heck actually Microsoft Microsoft
some were too invested that there's a
cost to using IOT sweet a usage costs
you might say well actually it's just
worth while I was just going to use the
one that's there now going to customize
it and all the source codes provided you
going to do with what what you want so
hope it gets your scent and as I said I
demonstrated their Raspberry Pi Linux
talking python talking about so wide
range of platforms out there and it
really is genuinely it's really quite an
astonishing set of devices that we
support I can find my slide that one
there
so kind of getting back to their there
really is a huge range and I see these
being used by startups and organizations
all these platforms and there's some
really amazing said technologies and
that's pretty much it so are there any
questions all right so we do you think
the I intellectual property well I mean
yeah yep I guess the reality is some IP
is commodity it's been commoditized so
we can argue we are the value of that
there is some P and then there was some
there is going to be some intellectual
property which hasn't been commoditized
with Israel value in it so i think it's
what's going on there was there was
changed from what it was five years ago
operating systems in core you can see
what what Microsoft's doing is why you
can still accepting the Linux world you
can see what's happening the Apple world
where they make the money on Hardware
not kind of a software so much so you
can even care to see their change and I
think it really comes down to us to find
why there's going to be a unique selling
point and how we put those building
blocks together and come up with some
solutions
I'm not sure I can comment yeah sorry of
client actors Oh connect oh yeah oh no
no absolutely I still absolutely there
yeah yeah we've changed the bundling all
that kind of stuff because i think it
was we put up with the xbox one and that
made us a hundred backs more expensive
than sony so then we kind of market
forces dictated their we unbundle them
yeah yeah and faking get your xbox xbox
yes I think pretty much
right okay yeah I'm sorry
right if you if you understood and give
me a business card after and I'll track
something down you can talk more about
it already okay enjoy the whiskey day
thank you much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
