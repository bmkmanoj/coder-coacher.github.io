ecology of social engineering I can
understand you probably going what is he
going to be doing with a psychology talk
at a technical conference and it's all
about expanding your mind or my case
packing the living bejesus out of us so
I need a volunteer
you'll do it
essence fun give a phone can you unlock
it first off please so ladies and
gentleman that's how your social
engineer a falling off somebody you go
and ask them for us then thank you so
much for actually making the point
appreciate it I was gonna flick through
your photos but you know it is very very
simple social engineering is if you
learn nothing from this talk it is dirty
little tricks to get your own way that
is everything that's gonna be using it
now I kind of thought when I originally
proposed this talk I came up with a very
nice title a very appropriate title of
the psychology of social engineering
after thinking about it a little bit
more and trying to say how do I
advertise this and market this to tech
people I said this will probably work
better hacking the human OS because
ladies and gentlemen we are all given a
human operating system when we are born
it comes in a perpetual beta it is
constantly being upgraded you constantly
discover new features quirks and bugs in
the system and as you get older you
discover that you forget things your
memory lose your losers you lose memory
you forget it's like you know when your
how many of you use Chrome in your
development how many were like 80 tabs
open at any given time right right
how many of you are wondering where the
music's coming from do you have an ear
worm in your head yeah now it's all in
your head just think when birds suddenly
appear all right I know all of your
going you bastards
that's gonna be in my head and the
easiest way to get rid of it it's keep
singing to the end of the verse how many
of you know of that one so ladies and
gentlemen this is me I am Nile Merrigan
I am the head of cyber security for
Capgemini in Norway and I didn't even
spend my
company name right well done you I am a
Microsoft MVP for the moment I'm an HP
insider as your advisor these are all
fun titles and you can't we need an
American I like when people tweet use
the little bird at me and don't give me
the bird and I do take emails that
Capgemini calm and you can visit my
website and all this it's nice so I try
to explain that social engineering is
all around us because I have a little
five-year-old son okay and he's awesome
but he kind of said he doesn't know what
I talk about he just thinks dad goes
abroad he talks to a lot of people they
laugh at him and then he comes home and
I get Lego it's a really good solution
papa are you going out traveling again
yes awesome
me leaving no so I said that all the
time we see social engineering it is
constantly in plain sight and I showed
him this photo and he goes that's a cool
Fox and I know it is but you see all the
naked people in it and he goes huh so
there's people in there it's there
people that there's people in there and
I hopefully this will work now yeah
excellent it does so he said there's a
like a leg there's some feet there's a
bomb and all this and goes there's
people and I'm like yes there's people
because why are there people there
dressed like a fox I said it's art or
that's what your mother says anyway at
least I don't know but this is this is
it and now he's like going does that
just that Fox have people in it does
that Fox have people out of like
reminder to stuff to never show of
five-year-olds like in this type of
thing but it kind of illustrates the
point that a lot of the stuff I'm going
to show you today is hidden in plain
sight for every one of you you've
probably seen this on a regular basis
but just don't realize how subtle or how
even obvious it is because you know how
many of you are kind of wondering well
is advertising really social engineering
and I would kind of argue that it is yes
because if you look at this picture what
do you see all answer come on
you can understand my accent I'm Irish
right you know understand
perfume well done hoots a - well don't
you
personal eyesight good job and but like
this is how do you sell a perfume you
can smell yes not with you though Thanks
bit forwards but she's right
sex and what it is is it's an aspiration
it is an aspiration other words I am
going to sell you an image or thought
that you could be this man you could be
this man with designer stubble a
perfectly knotted tie in an open color
shirt it's like it's a sartorial mistake
but still will live with us and there's
a woman leaning in going I'd love a
hamburger
take me to McDonald's or something that
effect but it is literally they're
saying you wear this you can be this man
alright it's for men this is a huge
aspirational thing it's like we are kind
of driven by this we want to find a mate
and it's this is what they're trying to
sell you smell it this you can be this
guy and this is what you're buying into
and it gets this is relatively soft
subtle if we go like dolce &amp;amp; gabbana
it's a bit more intense you could be
this man who broke this this is
something I got this I don't got this
okay come on you can do this hang on a
second this is where you got your wonder
is the speaker any any we could yes now
I'm told I have to stay here so this is
Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana okay this is how I say
very overt it was I swear to God what
did you guys know this was happening
last talk to alright okay this is not
good dude if you're it up behind there
flicking the switch would you stop I
know I did insulted you couldn't
characterize for I didn't mean us man
can count to 20 with his shoes off 21
minutes pants off
22 if he's got weird now are we good yes
do am i okay
don't move move I feel like you know
that you know when you got the old TV
box thing don't know where you go so how
was your talk now I saw a blank screen
it was awesome you all right you're
freaking out oh good I am it's a good
thing I'm Irish I can talk fast I mean
can't entertain the crowd anyone else
got a mobile phone I can play with if he
lost it you lost it I'm losing it up
here there's literally this subliminal
by the time they're finished what what
did you learn I want to be in the ocean
with piercing blue eyes are we good
should I just stand over there it's fine
do you want to stand there for the
entire talk now okay see do I have to
split for laptops it's not a laptop
issue oh that's all right it's not going
to fix the projector are we good standby
one should be speaking at this point I'm
afraid to freaking move
this is really gonna screw up my dance
routine that doing that so you got this
we don't got this
I'm honestly thinking we just run it
through somebody I'm a bit I'm a bit
worried about a guy touching my laptop I
just hacked I just hacked my cable you
yeah yeah yeah would you well so right
so I'll explain a little bit while I'm
here I'm trying maybe maybe it's just
this slide
for every man nowadays that's light it
doesn't there we go right quickly before
it disappears okay you could be in a man
on the Aegean Sea with piercing blue
eyes no chest hair and looking
phenomenal and smell like this okay that
is what they're trying to sell into you
now all of us know this right we know
that this is kind of fairly obvious but
there was a there was one company that
kind of said you know men need to smell
better because in the 60s men smelled
like dust bits we smelled like rubbish
Farms foundries we were manly and women
wouldn't come within 40 miles of us but
that was the way we were we were
brilliant like that woman's smells
lovely and someone decided wouldn't it
be great if men smell lovely too and
someone says that's a great idea what we
call ourselves
Bruce everyone heard of Bruce Bruce it
is a fact this is like a really wrecking
my head and hopefully this will come
along and do it behind there you're
really screwing up my presentation but
it's fine
anyway Bruce he said what we'll do is we
will get make a sense then men will like
and the thing with Bruce is if you go
into a room where anyone's wearing it it
nukes everything else in the room there
is no other smell in the room right
there could be a rotting dog and no one
would smell it all right that's it it is
unbelievably powerful it is literally
like it's a green bottle of liquid
plutonium you know it's weaponized this
is getting weird now the thing is the
advertising campaign was very kind of
funky because what they did was this for
every man who
Brut there's a woman who loves what he
smells like because there's something
about Ruth that's nice to be close to it
smells like a man and it was very
obvious it smells like a man so thought
they did as I said what are we gonna do
to make Bend by it will tell it smells
like a man
okay men go I want to smell like a man
so they bosses and then women said well
and wives and especially kids would all
do this and Jesus isn't getting weird
hmm
sigh why do you hate me this room
honestly I don't know what's going on
but anyway we'll continue talking
because I can do this too interpretive
dance as well it's not as fun though
let's try this escape dance so are we
gonna just like stand here or just do
stuff or should I just like tell people
go home don't know okay we'll say
nothing so the next one they came along
with was someone said let's up the game
right and who do you think up the game
everyone knows this come on if you were
given Bruce given bruited your daddy who
Old Spice exactly let's see hello ladies
look at your man now back to me now back
at your man now back to me sadly he
isn't me
but if he stopped using ladies scented
body wash and switched to Old Spice he
could smell like he's me look down back
up where are you you're on a boat with
the man your man could smell it what's
in your head back at me I have it it's
an oyster with two tickets to that thing
you love look again the tickets are now
diamonds anything is possible when your
man smells like old spice and not a lady
I'm on a horse and so they Double Down
smell like a man man I'm all right the
thing is that this is like if you want
to understand us men were given this and
this is a very successful advertising
campaign that works that transformed
what was a very feminine product into
what would be a masculine product this
was the concept it was a transition they
bought they made people buy into the
idea that you could smell like a man
all right they socially engineer people
to use soap and water and then smell
better okay that's what they did
and the thing is this is an aspirational
thing we do this on a regular basis when
we look at things like underwear okay
they they say by wearing Calvin Klein's
underwear you can look like this why
you'd want to look like this I don't
know most the thing is most men look
like this now you're all laughing but
it's true the thing is it's very obvious
like we went okay
he's the poor chap he's squeezed into
them but he got he did he did his
sucking it in he's doing well you know
he's like most men most men will only
discover a six-pack in the supermarket
they will never have one for themselves
okay but the thing we look at this and
we go oh yeah you know Photoshop and
actually did it so that you can see that
they enhance certain parts of his body
including his biceps all right now this
I I was kind of told this talk--i too
much skin may will go with us
so this is selling using you can be an
aspirational you can have a body like
this you can be a success like this by
wearing Calvin Klein underwear but
they're not the only people that do this
another another branch of advertising
does its exceptionally well and that is
car manufacturers this is a Kia SUV or
it will be when you see us it's there
right now I want to point out a couple
of things how that gentleman parks
dead-ass there we go gentlemen partly
that didn't hit the manicured lawn you
noticed all right and then decided I
can't find my keys we're gonna have it
out on the patio okay how many of you
own a Kia how many of you want to buy it
here but this is the thing and then
we'll say well that's using sex again
but what about other aspirational
techniques such as for example the great
outdoors and it will hopefully see a BMW
this is a BMW x6 most BMW x6 right do
not know what off-road is the most I'll
get off-road is probably a curb or a
speed bump okay or when they park
wherever they park okay this is because
they said okay what we're gonna do we're
gonna make it exciting and thrilling and
you can if you own this very expensive
car you can off-road like this why you
would want to how much does a BMW x6
cost in the UK a lot of money a lot of
monies we'll see a lot of monies okay
why you would want to park a lot of
monies where you would get very very
damaged is beyond me but Photoshop hurts
a lot now they are selling an aspiration
they're selling you a concept of you can
be outdoors you can do all this stuff
with this car you probably won't you'll
probably spend a lot of money for take
the fur features you won't really care
about or potentially ever use that knob
on the dashboard which we call an
indicator you'll never use that either
but okay and that is what they're
selling you but the thing is they're
selling you aspirations what about those
that sell you a problem first and then
sell you the solution hopefully it'll
appear this is getting very trying this
is like you know this is how to really
kind of show if a speaker can manage a
crisis on stage
okay at the moment I think I'm 50/50
okay
60/40 70/30 we're losing badly here kids
seriously dude is there anything you can
do I can run I can put my own protector
up I can run off my phone so men
magazines do this they will say summer
shred get ripped show you a six-pack if
you go googling for men's magazines like
this you will find out just a plethora
of six-packs
now it is exceptionally difficult to get
a six-pack or because it is a low fat
content it requires a lot of good effort
in the kitchen it requires a projector
that works but you also use effective
lighting the down lighting to a probably
definition but they are selling you a
problem they say you could be this
masculine you could be this good-looking
you could do this by this magazine will
show you how right but this has nothing
absolutely nothing on women's magazines
all right and I think this is where we
have a huge social problem because if we
look at this this is women's health and
this is one the most
I tried Cosmo and other things in Jesus
you can't put those on stage but like
they think it says eat up and slim down
you are we are free we don't didn't
think you were fat you are you even if
you dis is absurd workout you won't look
at her because of Photoshop we've seen
this because people are photoshopped on
this but they are selling you a problem
you don't even know you have all right
they're saying you could be this
good-looking
why aren't you happy in your own skin
because I'm not that person but they are
socially engineering or advertising to
you to say this is a problem we can help
you fix it you didn't know you had the
problem before you started looking at us
but now you know now we also have the
solution it is basically a dirty little
tricks to get whatever you want right
next slide let's hope this really hard
does anyone have any idea I'm watching
two technicians out there it's like how
many technicians take our week three
technicians oh Jesus it's the rule of
thirds now let's it's like they've done
extreme pair programming
they brought a third one in I have to
describe the slides now so I've got this
is like oh this is actually like you
know how do you discover tried to do a
presentation for the blind it's very
difficult alright but this is kind of
cool so what we have here is an anchor
in a boat when I show you it maybe
hopefully this is gonna be one of those
ones where I'm saying don't bother
showing the video it's just noise
sweating on stage so how was your talk
I'm 70 kilos later
what was it what's your secret stress
the stress okay I'm on strike I'm gonna
know here I have to try okay I can sit
down here if I don't know I'm gonna try
back here this will be an interesting
talk conversation how does this work it
could be like you know I don't know I'll
be good well I think this will be the
last talk in this room I think No so
we've all done now discovered who has
problems with their eyesight who gets
really bad headaches when stuff flickers
and when speakers get annoyed is there
anything I can do to help okay let's try
it so let's talk about let's talk about
let's talk about cognitive bias
cognitive bias is one of that we all
have different biases we all have
different things we do to kind of that
we innately do what we don't realize we
do we are biased towards our friends we
are biased towards our family in order
to accept their what they are telling us
is true we have another thing called
cognitive bias and one of them
specifically is called anchoring it is
when given a piece of information the
first piece of information you're given
about something it becomes the anchor
point for all other decision-making
processes all right it's like the idea
Scott
is a fantastic security researcher he's
the best and then everyone is a
reference to Scott after that all right
it's kind of that kind of concept hi
I can't be any worse than what we have
I'll just I'll keep talking we'll keep
going we'll be fine
I'm sorry so come cognitive bias and
angry is a very very strong thing now we
get we see we see this every day when we
are seeing things like for example when
you go look when you look to the slot
today for this point you had five
options the first one you has when you
read was your anchor point is it gonna
be better or worse than Phil hack is it
going to be better or worse than is Rob
Connery better and worse or whatever
that was your reference points we have
this all the time we see this amazingly
with things like for example our pricing
all right but like let's see if we
explain let's see if this works let's go
forward to this no we lost it back here
anchoring how we choose by comparing
with the nearby reference point in other
words the fit which fish is bigger if
both fish are the same point there it's
because they're inside in different
balls but the idea that you have a
reference point is very essential for us
to make a decision and the Masters of
using anchoring against you are Apple
see this is a very long delay does it
whoops
area so what you can see here is the
first one you read because we read from
left to right in most in most when
Western are kind of using that in text
we read left to right so we see eight
gigabytes it costs two hundred and
twenty-nine dollars all right two
hundred and thirty dollars give or take
a dollar but there is a common other
technique we're using the magic nine now
we look at the next one
it's two hundred and ninety-nine dollars
for thirty two gigabytes it's four times
the four times the storage of the first
one for $70 more all right what have you
ignored at this point the base cost of
the first one because at this point
you've accepted that 2:29 is the base
cost you're not challenging that it
should be up or down because the next
one is $2.99
following one which is $3.99 is twice
again of the other one it's not eight
times more it is only twice more because
you didn't previous point you use to
anchor again it's like a ladder
so they come the thing what will happen
is people will do one or two things of
the following they will look at the
eight gigabyte and going I don't want
the aka gabbai it's too small
the thirty-two looks like the best value
because it's only $70 more and it's and
it's four times the space the next one
is a hundred dollars more but it's it's
big and I kinda don't want to spend $400
or $399 on something so I'll spend the
one in the middle and that is a funnel
for you that they will buy 32 gigabytes
by default because most people will take
the best value what they think is the
best value and in this case for most
people it is gonna be the 32 gigabytes
but you haven't questioned the price
because you don't need to because you
have an anchor point is the first point
and it works and this is a really
essential points of how pricing models
can screw with your head and the worst
thing is and when someone puts all the
details in front of you and you don't
even notice
Wi-Fi is $4.99 $5.99 $6.99 $500 $600
$700 all right
below it is Wi-Fi 3G 69 79 89 we're not
even comparing that at 69 to 500 to 630
we're going from left to right we're not
going up and down because our brains
don't work this way we don't compare and
we have been given all the information
however we are using these as our anchor
points for what we should buy and this
is a common technique that is used by
for example cinemas when you have light
for example you can buy the medium to
regular large it's also something that's
used by for example coffee shops you can
have the small the medium the large the
large will cost you plus 3 all right and
that's a concept they'll use across the
board and the reason they do this is
it's dirty little tricks this is numeric
technique because our brains are fine
numbers Hart we've all know about the
magic 9 right everyone knows the magic 9
magic 9 is when you see five nine nine
what do you see do you see it's a lot of
people say you 600 a lot of us see it's
not it's not 600 you it's 599 it
six it's under six so it's not 600 it's
$1 short a very minor amount ninety nine
ninety five for example is still less
than 100 right the magic nine is means
that people will ignore the value below
that are after and just say that's it
that's fine it's not a problem the 99
even though it's still one dollar
give or take for rounding it is still
ignored so it's like when you go home
honey I bought these news about these
new speakers they cost me they cost me
less than 400 ollars how much they cost
you 399 now when I say it like that
people laugh that's insane they're $400
no no no no they're 399 they're under
for case in point
it's a dirty little trick now we can
also do this with like for example with
other pricing models like this where we
are going to say how much are we going
to get our users to pay so we put the
first one up which is the biggest one
and let people find that the lower price
because free is over here people don't
really want we we don't want people to
run with free okay Scott you probably do
this when you were trying to work out
pricing models for your new sitting your
new thing by the way uses software it's
freaking awesome and I don't get paid to
say that by the way but yeah social
engineering myself into a new paycheck
so most people will end up going for
Bonavita which is 2995 it's $30 it's
still under the $30 limit but it's only
5 cents because the reason is they will
look at this and go 199's that's too
much of a jump six nines too much of a
jump
I'm only doubling the price here and I
get I get five users so I've doubled my
price I get five users I get unlimited
forms a good night so this is kind of
like yeah I'm getting the best deal here
this suits my needs and that's and you
funneled them into that position that
they will buy from you at that point now
you're probably wondering what all this
has to do with social engineering these
are the types of tricks that you can do
to break people's brains okay now if I
show you this one which always makes me
laugh a lot it's the New York Times they
had hi they had this option to buy their
subscription you've got a basic
subscription it was $8.99 a month
remember the $8.99 you've got two free
things the power of free is exceptional
we had the all-access
$14.99 a month for things and then we
get the home delivery plus free dish
laxus for $4 50 a week ha ha ha
didn't spot that one did you he spot the
numbers we don't spot the week which
means there's now a different value and
the problem is that when they did that
originally they had the New York Times
had $89 for their digital content online
axis they had 129 dollars for their
newspaper delivery and then they had
$129 for the newspaper delivery and
digital axis which do you think most
people picked they want online for 89
delivery for 129 our delivery plus
online for 129 which one you think they
went over yeah why do you think they
went for delivery Plus online why is it
better value it's not it but it is
exactly what you thought because the
thing is you've got two things for the
price of one and the thing is it's I'm
getting the digital edition and the home
edition okay cool the digital edition is
all I really wanted but I bought the sub
day subscription cuz I wanted the two
things because it's nice to have I'm
potentially so they upsell do for $40
but did they really lose any money in
giving you two things not really because
they used the create the digital edition
and not used to use the digital edition
to create the print edition and what was
the end game of the New York Times to
sell more newspapers so by using that
little dirty trick and it's not a dirty
it's a very efficient marketing
technique they are doing it in such a
way that it makes it very easy for you
to buy more things now sorry
did it what smoothly oh wait this is a
really so there what am I asking yeah oh
I didn't even notice that one nice it's
even weirder I did I didn't even notice
that piss good eyes I thought I was
being very smart and it's like no you're
an idiot anyway let's talk about fishing
let's change subject completely it's
like it hasn't been a trying enough
presentation already oh god this is
gonna be a 1 Michael in the history
books I'm going you never doing this
again I'm leaving now we're finishing so
fishing
everyone thinks fishing is the nigerian
prince
sitting out in somewhere going hi I've
got fifty billion euros do you want to
help me get it out of the country for a
loan of five thousand yeah fishing is a
very interesting technique because the
the thing is it is about gaining trust
are using different techniques such as
FOMO fear of missing out this is a very
powerful technique you know last-minute
deal last time to buy people will
they're going when they are put with a
time constraint they will try and buy it
because it makes sense because now
they're it's why another one for example
another form of really good advertising
and really good market placement is when
you go shopping in a airport they have
what they call the magic 10 minutes it's
that point when you get through security
you've got through security they've
managed to not find anything that made
the thing go beep you know you've put
all your stuff back in the bag you still
have your passport you still have your
money
holidays beginning you're in a little
bit of exuberance you're happy and you
go buy stuff so that's why all the
tax-free is right beside security so
you'll go Oh shiny nice things and this
and all the previous advertising we
showed you is now used against you but
when it comes to fishing we are going to
use different techniques against you and
like I always say the the one where you
do spam email that's just boring that's
drag netting that literally as you hope
you find something the more targeting we
do when we call it spear fishing is a
more advanced form of fishing techniques
it's really stereo it's a fishing
technique which we use where we will use
information about you to gain
your trust and we get information from
everywhere because humans leave massive
digital footprints around the internet
all right think about what you put on
Facebook think about what you're on
Twitter at Google etc the most common
one of for example spear phishing which
I like to use is the idea of watching
check-ins you know where you kind of get
someone checked into a bar or someone
checked in somewhere okay so you see a
check-in and you go into the public
timeline you find this person's checked
in and you email them saying listen we
found your wallet
or we found some cards belonging to you
can you click the link on this picture
to see if it's yours and people go I was
out drinking last night maybe oh geez
did I lose something - I forget
something ok click the link and it opens
up something and all of a sudden I've
got some more information I just gained
your trust because I know something
about you and by using that against you
I can generate trust to you and that is
what will get you to do stuff for me
dirty little tricks to get my own way
the problem is that we do this is like
where we go spearfishing
we go looking for Pacific tea people we
will also do a thing called where we go
after like c-level execs we call it
whaling because there are big fish
alright our big mammals in most cases
but we use this a lot where we're going
to try and attack very high-level CEOs
and get them to do something for us or
we go after the most powerful person in
the company who is the most powerful
person in the company the administrator
the PA - personal minister to the CEO
and generally as always because the CEO
will go wherever she's told she'll go I
need you to be in Geneva this week
here's your tickets I need you to be
here for this meeting you have this you
have this you're told to go somewhere
you do it right the PA manages all that
but the PA is also the person that you
have we're going to try and attack
because they are geared up to answer
your questions hi my name is Noelle I'm
calling from Capgemini and listen I'm
trying to get hold of John do you know
where she is no she's out traveling oh
okay I'm I'll give her a call her mobile
one got information that she's out
traveling now I can use that information
to go and attack someone else I can send
an email from John to Finance which has
happened a number of times you say you
send it from the finance director you
send it to the finance department lays
on a
okay sometime around months end if you
can do it right you get them when
they're stressed and in mission mode
when people are mission mode you put
something in their tray they'll get it
done busy people get done okay
lazy people will go arkad on a time busy
people people who have to get stuff done
if you put something else in their trade
they'll just push it they'll move it
they'll move it will move it so you send
an email saying I need you to transfer
money to this Ukranian account at this
time because we're gonna lose a contract
make it so get it done I don't have time
to waste
fine get it done alright some Ukrainians
going nice very simple you think it's
funny number of companies get done on a
regular basis because they will be
sending information someone will send a
quick email on their behalf of somebody
where the other person cannot reply the
usual thing I can't reply on the phone I
can't do this have you heard like you
know the Western Digital scan please you
know with Western Union scam where they
say please transfer me some money I'm
unavailable it's the typical thing when
you hack someone's account you'll say
I'm out traveling I need to get some
money can you send this Neil it's a real
odd thing but it works because people
want to help now the thing is it's
because of this and because of all this
human error we have like this data
security problem because the thing is we
protect the infrastructure we protect
our IT landscape we protect like we have
firewalls we have antivirus we have
BitLocker we have all these mad tools
and we have Dave alright now Dave is
every single person in this room because
dave has done something stupid when Dave
shouldn't have done something we've all
done us one of my favorite remembers of
when I thought I was hacked
I arrived in Seattle I log on to
Facebook okay I just I could cut and
connected over VPN logged on to Facebook
and I went rice I didn't realize where
my VPN was going out of okay or it's
something that effect
and it comes up you have logged in from
Guatemala I said I didn't know I haven't
I'm in Seattle I'm definitely in
Guatemala I was like oh god I have to
rotate passwords I did something and
then I go okay I've rotated all the
pastures done everything I think oh god
what happened so I tracked back all
through what
my steps where I had logged in I've done
this I didn't I didn't connect my VPN
first because I was jet-lagged it's it's
a mistake
it was tired jet lag it happens okay
what happened I looked at it where is my
IP it said this IP and it goes in some
databases this is error honestly
described as being in Guatemala I'm
sorry I have so for me human error
could be a very costly mistake but it is
a very obvious thing that I have all
these safeguards in place for myself but
human error is one of the things we use
on a daily as a social engineer to get
us to do to get things done and also get
people to make mistakes because when
people aren't being observant they make
mistakes case in points this is the last
pass login it's a beautiful piece of kit
last pass like any other password
manager keep means I can free up some
memory so they don't have to remember
passwords except what is wrong with this
screen it's a website exactly let's see
if this works
OOP did live doo doo doo oh it's Chrome
extension dot PW forward slash colon
forward slash some gibberish it is what
we call pixel perfect fishing and what
we'll do with this is we'll do two
things one we will detect if you've got
the last past plug in first it's an easy
detect because last pass injects script
into this in to allow the logins the
other thing we'll do is then we'll do a
thing called tab napping we'll wait for
your tab not being in focus for a number
of number of minutes and then pop this
up okay
and you'll kind of come to this thing
you'll go oh crap I need to put in my
password I'll put in my past we'll do
something and I'll steal your
credentials now I have to factor off on
anything that has any type of sensitive
data on us and this wouldn't work boss
this is a very if you are tired or if it
catches you in the right place at the
right time this steals all your
usernames and passwords one shot we kill
dome and this is why we call perfect
pixel perfect fishin this is available
on github by the way you can go off and
download this yourself and it's
available for a number of different
logins now others like we see a lot of
the time or for other types of phishing
is we use things like iCloud iCloud is a
Fanta
resource if you're trying to fish people
in 2014 we had this massive data leak
involving a lot of celebrities in there
and their naked pictures being released
and this is because either to akan umber
of things
dodgy assistance but most likely through
phishing emails now you're probably
wondering Niall no one would fall for
Find My iPhone dot help I'm like they
probably wouldn't however let's change a
little bit let's create a cheapy s Apple
comm dot something dot my website calm
it's a subdomain all right you get a
free certificate you may thing and then
you shrink this down to a phone screen
the URL is obscured you see a green
padlock with htps apple you go this is
legit I put in my username and password
something happens boom and the thing is
people will do this people will fall for
this because there's like for example
this kind of idea we use SMSing our
smishing as they call it so this is a
couple of things one there has been
unusual activity in your account please
log in to decline the purposes of this
many things now if I was in London this
wouldn't be a problem
few miles London and this potentially
isn't an issue however when if I'm in
Norway and I see this I get a bit
worried right and it's not exactly
difficult to send a text message
but getting to click on a link like this
where it says you're a bank but it's not
your bank and it comes up with that nice
look grace well there's also the fact
that you can use SMSing to get it to do
for example how do you bypass two-factor
SMS authentication everyone familiar
what two-factor authentication
mechanisms is sure you have control of
the account many people send like
two-factor authentication like for
example they will send an SMS please
your your for example your gate huh blog
and uses to SMS or to Fi but how would
you bypass - maybe by doing something
like this we recently noticed a
suspicious sign in an attempt for this
email address from this IP if you did
not sign in for this location would like
to lock your account temporarily please
reply to this alert with a six digit
verification code you will receive
momentarily if you do not authorize this
sign in attempt
I've got your login I need your SMS I'll
just send unis I'll just send you a link
to say listen you're gonna get an SMS
and it's gonna look dodgy but just send
it back to me would you it's quite
simple and it is very very simple to do
you just go off and you buy something
like atomic SMS you do this you send off
an email address there's enough a
particular number and you're done
now the reason as the messing works much
more effectively than fishing by phone
by straight like emails is because
SMSing is considered more personal it is
coming straight to your personal device
we have moved from a kind of a situation
whereby we expect it we don't expect to
get emails to where we do and we had
lots of snail mail so now we get one
snail mail and a ton of email all right
that is our transition we have moved
over to the dishes it's but SMS is we
don't get a lot of SMS spam it still
costs money it's not free but still
people get it and the thing is and
people are more inclined to look at an
SMS than they are anything else the
ultimate form to generate trust to do
phishing is using voice as illustrated
by this so I invited a few of the
world's best hackers to try to hack me
and show me where my vulnerabilities are
and now I'm gonna meet them in Las Vegas
for Def Con the biggest hacker
convention of the year you want to do a
sample vision call what's phishing
phishing is voice solicitation and
basically what you do is use the phone
to extract information or data points
that you can use later attack let's do
it when you who are you gonna call maybe
I'll call your cell phone provider and
see if I can get them to give me your
email address I bet they're good I bet
they have my back but yes go go for it
I'm gonna spoof from your number so it's
gonna look like it's calling from you
okay
hi I'm actually I'm so sorry can you
hear me okay I my baby I'm sorry my my
husband's like we're about to apply for
a loan and we just had a baby and he's
like get this done by today so I'm so
sorry I can't call you back log in to
our account for uses information and I
can't remember what email address we use
to log of the account the baby's going
and in just 30 seconds Jessica gets
access to my personal email in and make
changes how would I need to go about
doing that you would have to send me a
secure pin through yeah other thing is I
don't think I'll be able to receive a
text message if I'm on the phone oh I'm
not on there either so I thought when we
got married he added me just uses my
girlfriend's name and a fake social
security number five one two seven to
set up her own personal access to my
account wait I'm sorry so there's no
password on my account right now can I
set that up she even gets the support
person to change my password thank you
so much for your help today so she just
basically blocked me out of my own
account
I'll get her fed up all right thank you
holy so they they decayed they just
gave you access to my entire cell phone
you're gonna have to go on and change
your password no because it's just my
name and all it took was a crying baby
and a phone call
ladies and gentleman women the ultimate
social engineer
IIIi joke I but the thing is that they
the things that were exploited here
first off no one likes hearing a mother
in distress with a crying child we all
want to help we are geared up to do this
we are socially a data a kind of
condition that we should help people in
trouble in distress and also I'm in
customer service so my job is to help
you and I could be a superhero so I will
all right the second thing is nobody in
their right mind would ring when they
and be evil like this would they no no
no no that's why voice solicitation why
you can get someone on the hook for
something like this especially by
putting just a woman in distress crying
baby
these are triggers for people to say oh
you need really need help okay and this
is the problem we are going we're going
to use dirty little tricks to get our
own way we are going to go contra to
what people would think would be good
manners and good behavior and why so
this is why social engineering can be
for many people so difficult to spot
because it doesn't it's not it's not the
kind of Oh someone doing that wouldn't
really be evil right okay and this is
when we start looking really into social
engineering we start having to use
whatever things we were given to get our
way now when I show people the things
like this this is a lovely pregnant
woman okay pregnant woman aren't evil
pregnant women are lovely they could
they're creating life they are perfect
in every way
when you get on a bus as a pregnant
woman most men will jump out of their
seats to give it to you because they
know it's difficult right this is a
thing we do right okay and for this
we're going to use this technique to
break into a building now there's a
really good social engineer and her name
is Jeff Hyde and what she did was she
said right let's try and get access to
this very secure facility and let's do
it by just general no non-technical
means so they they went off and they
said first off we're gonna do a bit of
recon right so the next they do off
things like for example social media
gave us detailed pictures of their
badges right so if you wanted a QR badge
or a badge for for this conference you
just have to go back to the NDC London
Twitter stream and you'll get one no
problem off you go and then you say well
we don't stir dive
got some internal kind of information
phone extension laptops they all this
type of thing now the thing is just said
this really won't get me into kind of
where I want to be now jess is not an
unattractive woman and she goes I look
like this right and this is what I'm
going to do I'm gonna pretend to be
pregnant and so she gave herself a fake
belly all right and she became pregnant
and this is awesome
because inside that belly is a ton of
Wi-Fi hacking gear she's gonna give
birth to a lovely router it's gonna give
free Wi-Fi to the world but this is
gonna be like Jesus Christ now this is
not enough because at this point you're
still have capacity to open doors so
what else do you think you need ya know
you need a couple of coffee cups because
if you're holding coffee like this is a
pregnant woman ankles are killing me and
you walk in like this most men will open
doors no problem won't ask a question
we're good like that
you know and off you go and remember I
didn't I can't remember who said it but
first but coffee carriers fill hands etc
walk-in no problem and the confirmation
was between the belly and a bunch of
coffee I had people opening are jumping
to open doors for me again dirty little
tricks to get your own way now as I told
you the start I'm Irish
okay and when I do my social engineering
thing I play up to my Irish stereotype
oh I in big R&amp;amp;D crater to throw a party
attach it lovely
that's I'm drunk is fine don't worry
boss where's the nearest pub and people
will be like literally go as fine he's
arson and there's never not a never an
evil Irish person that's fine
but like things you can't say things you
can't say in London I just realized that
the middle of a talk sorry
international incident okay so the thing
is we could use the very very typical
stereotyping of for example he's Irish
he's lovely won't be doing anything bad
in the 60s and 70s it wasn't so good
especially in London Irish people were
stereotyped as being terrorists okay we
were we'd like there's I have pictures
of signs no dogs no Irish okay it's an
easy laugh but this
is the case but the thing is now when I
go abroad i play on my Irishness all the
time because it gets me out of so much
trouble walk down the middle of
Australia drunk another problem is Irish
it's ok you know you can do dodgy things
you can get away with it and that is
because we're using a stereotype
everyone thinks American cops eat
doughnuts ok it's a common stereotype
people's brains have a bias and when you
confirm that bias it will be accepted as
truth there's a really weird thing you
hear a piece of fact from somebody right
and you say oh cool I heard that fact
and then someone repeats that fact
independently of the other person you go
oh I heard that fact not that's yeah and
I and I know about this as well and a
third person confirms us and then it
becomes true we also like to call this
thing Twitter it's true we in Twitter
wearing our own little echo chambers
right so this is a common concept and
this is one of those weird things about
the brain we have certain biases and
when we are told something and it's
confirmed by someone else it becomes
truth and logic and it's really weird
it's one of those weird little bugs in
our software another weird little bug in
our software is the fact of that if I
offer to do something for you you will
trust me let's think about this so the
idea is this if I ask you to do
something for me you'll help me and you
begin to trust me I can ask you to do
something bigger contra that if I offer
to help you first no what do you want
the initial reaction right I want to try
a weird experiment walk down any Street
and say who wants free money what's the
catch
why ok no one - can I borrow a fiver
yeah sure no problem
not a problem and the thing is this is a
weird thing the it's we call this the
Benjamin Franklin effect whereby by
asking someone to do us a favor we will
gain more trust than by offering to do a
favor for them first it is a really
weird bug in our software and it is a
common thing we do as social engineers
because people like to help hi
is this purchasing great hi I'm Nile
from Capgemini I listen um I'm having a
problem I'm trying to reconcile this
Peele
listen I just sent you an email with the
PIO and as an Adobe attachment can you
try and open for me oh you got it good
can you open it great Oh what happened
it crashed ah what version of adobe
reader do you have oh you've uh you've
aged
oh I'm using eleven maybe that's the
problem listen it's just before lunch
I'm gonna try and get this working and
but listen thank you so much for have I
really appreciate your being absolute
star super good bye a nun side in that
little Adobe attachment was a nice
little remote access trojan but what the
person opened it because they wanted me
to help them but by on generals they
would never open us okay if you ask
someone for help and you say can you
help me people will help you alright
if you offer to help someone no no no
dodo it is really weird so the takeaway
for you today
is that social engineering relies on
different psychological sociological and
physiological levers to get our way we
do this in the form of for example what
we call there's another technique for
example to get your way and it's very
very bad to use but it generally gets
your way in a very effective manner it's
used upfront aggression get in someone's
face tell them what you want and I start
as soon as they start agreeing back down
they think they're winning you get what
you want it's a very nasty technique but
it works because people are not
confrontational and except to the one
where you find the person that is and
then you're kind of screwed but how'd it
go
well good but this is a common technique
it's in other words like it's for
example you get into someone's face you
all right on the knee oh oh I'm gonna
help you a good good good good calm down
smile yeah bye-bye I did this once to
our neighbors who were having a party so
I rock up in my rugby shorts it's minus
10 degrees outside and like I mean bare
feet rugby shorts and a t-shirt it's 3
o'clock in the morning yeah rock outside
and I'm like excuse me do you know what
time it is he goes all running in check
damn you literal Norwegians it comes
back out it's three o'clock I said I
know it's three o'clock it's time to go
to bed get into bed go he was okay okay
I will do it thanks very much bye no any
man was like okay fine and he walked
away and he was happy that he avoided
confrontation
I was happy he went to bed and stopped
like smoking dope outside my house but
it was still okay but that was the kind
of idea we use different sociological
psychological and levers to get our very
effective way social engineering is
about dirty little tricks to get your
own way ladies and gentlemen thank you
very much for putting off with a very
difficult presentation to give I would
like I would like you to and I would
like you to open the floor to questions
and I would love you to write the talk
if you didn't like the talk come to me
if you did like to talk give me a green
any questions yes sir I know they
weren't my fingerprints on the finger
side there were someone else's I was
going to make a joke like your mom but I
said that would probably be mean mama
anyone else all right then ladies and
gentlemen class dismissed
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
