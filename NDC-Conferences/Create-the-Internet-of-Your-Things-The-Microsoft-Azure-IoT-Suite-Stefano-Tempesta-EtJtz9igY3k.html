people can come our welcome so good
afternoon
my name is Stefano tempesta this session
today is about the microsoft azure IOT
suite well or at least it was six months
ago when I started planning this session
and no applying is a speaker for NDC
things I evolved a lot since then
and now the IOT suite is actually part
of a global and richer offering from
Microsoft so if you allow me let's
change the name to with the Microsoft
IOT solutions because yes I will talk
about the suite but there is much more a
much richer offering in the IOT
landscape they will be really ashamed to
me solve now and it's so quickly ball
being that every month
Microsoft is releasing something new I
invite you also after this session to
attend the next 2 min I think they are
in room 4 we take globba they are about
services and devices for IOT so it's
very interesting to see how from this
overview we can go bit deeper into the
actual services and devices for
programming the Internet of Things so
what's the agenda for today I try to
cover all of this point the presenting a
case study first of all so how we
actually use the the IOT solutions in
azure for something that makes sense
from a business perspective and then
analyze a bit of the micro services
pattern a bit of a buzzword at the
moment I try to understand exactly how
that applies to the IOT world and then
we go deeper into the suite itself the
harbor which is a bit of a new service a
bit richer than the street itself I will
get into the details we touch about
machine learning time permitting and
then
few words about security because
obviously we want to have a secure
connection secure devices and so on so
let's get started and just 30 seconds
about myself I just to introduce who is
speaking today
my name is definite and paste as I
mention I lead that the engineering
department in EF education first I'm
based in Zurich in Switzerland
I'm a former soccer player I used to
play for FC Barcelona and this is where
we won the Champions League girl okay
okay it's fine fine people don't believe
me when I say okay I got it and you can
find me online I wish that was turned
off all right the case study now that is
something that I walked on in my past
experience we wanted to build a single
view of a user into a CRM dynamics crm
specifically the way we wanted to build
for our health beauty company basically
was to start promoting products this
Gissing is advice recommendation for a
better lifestyle so we decided basically
to circulating patterns of people
according to the different age and
location and promoting lifestyle
recommendations and making
recommendations in terms of products for
specific situations for example woman 40
years old traveling from home to work
today is a Sunday don't forget to apply
sunscreen number 40 plus B because it's
a you know it will protect you
blah blah blah so all these things
basically were based on analyzing
patterns typically using devices like
the Fitbit or the Microsoft band or from
your mobile device sending location
integrating with the world with the
weather forecast
service and then collecting patterns
based on different criterias like age
gender skin type you know if you are be
lighter if a bit darker the product
would be different location as I said so
all this information will feed my hub
which contains of the data or the logic
for making this recommendation that was
so it was already six nine months ago
when we started so at the very beginning
of the IOT functionality in Azure now
it's much more evolved as we will see
this pearance basically was start
collecting all these patterns using an a
hot dog to be on the backend using
machine learning for elaborating this
information and promoting this
recommendation to two customers through
the app and then extending these also to
to the rest of the family for example
making marketing partnerships for
promoting additional products and so on
now this is going beyond scope if I as
to say because obviously IOT here is
only part of it but is important to
understand that this experience started
connecting services services that are
like the weather forecast the location
service and the machine learning for
identifying patterns and making
production all these services now are
basically part of what I like to call
the micro services
texture is a bit of a buzz world like
SOA so I was a few years back
but basically is the idea is a promoting
independent components that can be
deployed typically over HTTP Reister
typically use JSON in a completely
independent structure this is not IOT
only this applies across the board the
web development mobile development but
it's particularly significant for an
Internet of Things solution where
resources are scarce and then you want
to optimize access to your website to
your CRM to your devices obviously
notifications and they have everything
managed through an Enterprise Service
bus which is part of the IOT solutions
in Azure where is that basically the the
advanced the big change that Microsoft
introduced in Azure
to facilitate IOT devices and
applications a couple of things for now
just to understand from a design
perspective and then we'll get more
detailed into the actual implementation
service fabric is a kind of enterprise
service bus that is based on the service
assisted pattern
well basically an application or a
device will publish subscribe to the
service bus sending an inquiry and
receiving instruction or commands when I
send an inquiry is basically sending
information that is being captured by
the sensor on the device that can be a
device tracking your location and is
sending the location to the server as
for for for communication say around for
example traffic alerts so in that case
the message is cued and there is a
reason for that
because basically some devices may work
on a low power so they may go in standby
they may not be able to receive
information in real time the bus would
basically kill the messages and when the
device is alert again we'll receive this
information which is the instruction
again all email receive a command a
command is actually not just our
information instead in terms of data but
it's actually an action to do something
an alert a notification is also part of
the mix and it typically applies not
only to the device itself
let's test subscribe to receive
information they can be any device you
know you can send an email and then you
receive in your inbox is not technically
an IOT device you know it's not it's not
a wearable device it's just an email or
an SMS but it's all trigger by the same
Enterprise Service bus now you may have
noticed this little funnel here this is
basically meaning there is security
applied to each message and the security
is basically saying as a publisher I'm
sending this information this
information is not granted to everybody
that subscribed to receive this message
but only applications and only devices
that are authorized to receive this
information are allowed to receive the
message that is in the queue and this is
done in a actually in a very simple way
by having a unique ID for each device
and granting this ID into the device
management capability of the azure IOT
hub as we will see in a moment so a
device with no ID basically it's not
allowed to be part of this game ok as
you just
briefly as your functions again like the
service fabric they're not specific to
our tea they can be used across any web
mobile solution but they are
particularly useful in this context
because by being completely serverless
and by being driven wrong trigger by an
event when an inquiring st. or a command
is sent back as a response we can
trigger a function that can activate
additional functionality for example I
can execute a machine learning algorithm
and extrapolate some data as we will see
as part of the demo later
so this microservices architecture is
basically something as a foundation to
consider before starting even
considering working with IOT because you
will notice that a lot of configurations
can be done without coding you can
register a device in the IOT suite but
when you want to get a bit more
sophisticated you start you start
getting into visual studio into coding
and playing with the service fabric with
the functions and with that IOT hub so
let's have a look at these IOT solutions
from Azure as I mentioned there are a
few things that are that were available
already six months ago and now we now
evolved significantly I will recommend
having a start really foggy nurse to the
Internet of Things starter kits I think
I've seen this a few days ago there are
five starter kits of predefined
pre-configure and you buy them and you
get a physical package with your
physical device in it that you remember
the good old times when we were young
and we like to play we
sisters and lathes and these kind of
things and circuits exactly what you
receive a box when you start the
plumbing all these things and connecting
there is a corner outside there so if
you want in the main area and if you
want to have a play with the Arduino or
the other devices please go they are all
based on Windows 10 IOT core and they
all come the starter kits certified for
azure IOT which basically means they are
pre bundle for connecting to the azure
IOT street now this is very basic you
get the device is for playing to get
familiar to see how that works we
actually will go to a simulation using
in english or studio obviously not with
a real device but with a simulated
device we'll see how that works
the sweet now that's sweet six months
ago when it was announced was oh wow I
can interact with Bing Maps I can track
devices I can send signals so the
concept not the principle that I said
before in terms of the micro services
the Enterprise Service bus that all come
into the suite and you need don't even
realize it just works and again there is
a beautiful domain that the register gif
tv.com
it comes with two types of solutions the
predictive maintenance is basically
saying hey this is my device I want to
have a prediction in terms of
maintenance in case of faulty
behavioral in terms of wrong data that
this ain't so that I can anticipate any
maintenance work so it's kind of
monitoring from from a maintenance
perspective the remote monitoring
instead the terminology monitoring is
bit confusing Lisa in my in my knowledge
of English language because it's
actually not only monitoring the device
but is tracking the usage of the device
and sending the messages that we have
seen before and responding with commands
and triggering action so it's a bit more
powerful than just from a maintenance
perspective because it's a runtime usage
and this is what we are going to see now
the azure suite them so let me get them
is which to here yep so if you go to
azure IOT suite calm and if start your
you need unless your account for that
yes so I'm logged in with my as your
account and you want to create a new
solution you get to solution types at
the moment that you can create I'm sure
more will be added in the future this is
our completely prepackaged and they come
with for simulated devices but you can
add also a real one so as you receive
the starter kit for simple then the
starter kit comes with a device you play
with it you plumb a bit it may you make
it work so there are some sense also to
- you know for - to monitor to measure
humidity or temperature or location and
then you connect these register to the
to do the solution in the IOT suite so
the press the predictive maintenance
anticipate maintenance the remote
monitoring connected monitoring your
devices so I have already created a
solution here for for so let me just
launch one of it
signing yes of course when when you try
to create it it will take 10-15 minutes
so i just pre-banned r1 otherwise we
will wait here for 10 minutes all right
so that's opening and basically there is
a connection to Bing Maps there is some
telemetry so there are some alarm
history what's happening here there are
four devices that have been register for
there is a solution again let me just
make a step back to create the context
here the IOT suite is a bundle of most
if not even all the IOT offerings from
Microsoft in one single solution they
call it sweet because you just open the
door as in you create your your solution
and we have everything plugged plumbed
ready to work with for simulated devices
you can add the real devices but is
basically all the services are connected
telemetry is the more important
obviously because the telemetry service
is using the event hub on the back end
is basically the device sending
temperature and humidity to the to the
server and this is happening on the AMQP
advanced Message Queuing protocol you
can do it over HTTP you just change
configuration but typically AMQP is the
preferred protocol by the eventbus
for for performance reasons mainly you
can scale this to the million of devices
so each device is sending information
every other second I believe in terms of
these temperature you mean it in this
case then we have a bit of the address
here it is excuse me the maximum
humidity register the average and so on
this is using power bi tools very very
simple nothing fancy but you know is
again another cell
that is integrated into the suite and
then they allow history here is
basically saying a bit of scrolling here
screen resolution doesn't help but
basically this device at this time as
register this value so as raised these
rule now what is the rule the rule is
basically saying anything you do
everything from from the screen here is
all all configure through the is like
the azure portal basically for this
device if the temperature is greater
than 38 degrees trigger action
this alarm temp ruler that from the name
you can guess is an alarm for the
temperature but it just a name just a
label what it actually does you define
later in the action for this device if
the Yumi humidity registered by the
sense of identify is greater than 48
execute the rule alarm humidity so the
device is a step back to the devices a
register here I have a for sample
devices but you can add you can add
another device again a simulated one so
that will help to play a bit with the
screen with the simulation or a
customers of physical one and then when
you add the physical one you started
registering the device you said to the
endpoint to connect to you your to
register with a specific I deep which
have to be unique and then the device
will basically be visible in the
dashboard and and even on the map map is
gone a little bit today so I then you
see there is a map a device here there
is another device here this red one has
probably raised an alarm so if showing
in red and
what is this alarms this alarms are
basically they they they met the rules
basically they exceeded the conditions
and now they erase this alarm a humidity
which is basically raising this alarm or
this other one is sending a message you
can configure different action actions
here this is a bit tricky though because
the action that you can see here
unfortunately cannot be configured
through these UI you have to go to the
azure portal into the event hub event
solving to the logic app so many names
to the logic app service and register
your actions these actions are actually
pieces of code dotnet code that you want
to write that do whatever is necessary
to send a message to raise an alarm
basically what what what I'm saying here
the suite is putting together devices
rules and actions and when you when I
will execute it triggers an action and
the action is a function hence the azure
function that basically is not net code
that does something it is something you
basically decide code wise and we'll
have a look into that when we when we
when we see a bit more advanced
functionality because this is really a
pre bundle app reconfigure suite and the
level of configuration is just in terms
of add the device said the ruler but
then you need to do a bit of coding of
the backend in terms of creating actions
or custom actions all right get some
doubts fears about today I ate a sweet
term otherwise we go into this is a bit
of a recap just to say that the suite is
basically using all these guys there are
a lot of services there is the hub
itself we spend more time in the harbor
in the next slide and in the next minute
the stream analytics which is basically
the functionality to to capture all the
telemetry as a device I'm sending my
information it goes into the stream and
it goes to the service bus which is the
event hub and then it go to the logic
hapless the guy where you can configure
the action to trigger in this case there
was a bit of power bi
there was an active directory because
the device is a register in active
directory with a unique ID there was a
big map storage is on a document B just
to make it fancy but it can be any form
of storage so this is basically all this
box here is the IOT it is a solution in
the IOT suite now it's very important to
understand that the suite becomes
pre bundle pre packaged and that was
great news
six months ago I honestly find a bit
limited limiting and this is why I
wanted to change a bit the scope of the
of this session from being on the IT
suite only to the entire IOT offerings
we are not able to speak about all of
these guys because it would take hours
but I try to spend a bit more time into
the IOT hub into the machine learning
because I think there is a bit more bail
is there and because it's connected with
the case study that I presented at the
beginning so the hub the hub is really
the beating heart of the IOT offerings
it provides a few things but the two
very very important in my opinion device
identity registry each device must be
unique because by living a unique ID you
can create clean outlines you can
authenticate and authorize the device
and because authorization and
authentication identification
authorizations are on a device basis you
can basically instantly block the device
monitor the device wipe data remotely so
there is a direct connection between the
device and an active connection between
the device and the cell the event hub in
the IOT hub that's important from a
security perspective as of will recap at
the end
it also can block and some little
unsolicited network information the hub
by the end up now coming back to the
first slide about the micro services is
an endpoint with some services that are
an external device or application can
can can consume if the device is not
trusted or if the client is not trusted
it can consume the macro micro services
so any traffic on the communication on
the network is blocked because the
device is not identified is not
recognized into the registry and
communication is bi-directional again in
the first slide the beginning where we
we were the service bus with inquiry and
then coming back at the instructions of
the command but the communication is
secured and all the messages are q are
killed because they may some devices may
operate on a lower power they may go in
standby they may lose some messages we
don't want them to lose messages
therefore we queue them into the event
hub and send when they are awake again
service fabric coming back this again
about I don't think we'll have time to
go into this today but is basically
complementing the IOT Harbor extending
the event the service bus of the event
hub outside of the IOT world so not only
devices but service but fabric actually
extended to any application and I am
keen or enforcing this message because I
see an IOT solution not only IOT as in
my little device that send the
temperature and humidity signals is
really a part of a overall solution
where there may be a mobile app but
there may be a website so you want this
information to be channel and trigger
actions and service fabric is the place
to do it using reliable services which
basically are typically not necessarily
per typically restful web services using
JSON messages and actors which are
basically a combination of these
services the act or some that are
indefinitely scalable according to
available resources and the service
fabric we take care of that for you is
not like a virtual machine that you have
to put in a cluster you have to load
balance you have to do a bit of you know
if maintaining the infrastructure to
scale these scales because is already
part of the cloud solution and actually
you don't need to pay extra in a zoom
you pay as you go so you pay for actual
consumption or the fabric of the the
service in the fabric alright the IOT
things let's have a look to assimilate
the situation now more from a developer
perspective I've created a solution in
Visual Studio yeah you can see something
here want to register the device then to
set to receive the message from the
device to the server and then from the
device itself to send a message a
message is win the
wind speed now what what do we need we
need some packages so they to create an
identity device you need these the
Microsoft Azure devices package so great
your solution your project look for
simplicity
these are console application but you
know it can be mobile app we can be a
website it doesn't really matter as long
as you use these this package so going
to your new get add and then let's add
this reference to your main program what
it does basically is okay let me I
connect to the service bus and then
register the device now the way it works
is basically let me go back to them to
the screen here what you will normally
do is from new come on
so this is the azure portal obviously
you've got new Internet of Things and
create an IOT hub this is a service now
I'm not creating because it would take a
few minutes but I have already one
available here so let me open the system
one when you create an IOT hub basically
you're creating the endpoint the server
that receives messages from the device
you have a hostname which must be known
to the device obviously and you are also
a few keys here to connect to let me
have a look if come up on screen yes you
have a few keys and connection string to
use for by the
the sellable application so back to our
visual studio called them what what I'm
doing here is basically saying this is
my connection swing that I copied and
pasted from the screen I have a registry
manager and basically I'm adding the
device all this up and a synchronously
with this ID and if the device already
sister just get the device information
this is the first step is the device is
not register in the IOT hub it will not
work once you run this so let's just run
these very quickly and you will see is
doesn't it does only just retrieves an
idea key once you get this key you take
the key and you put into the the device
itself so this is the other little
program where I put the device data key
of the device and now I'm connecting to
the endpoint which is a bit of stepping
here and there but basically is my
public name for the hub so the device
has to be known to the hub by its key
and obviously the endpoint of the hub
once the device does that now this is a
simulation so obviously dress code if it
was a real device it would do these from
the device itself
it basically just randomly
making making up some speedo or wind and
then converting into a JSON sending the
event and just doing this every second
so if we do if we run this application
you will see two screens one is the
simulated device that every
second is sending this message i'm
device 0-1 and this is the window that
I'm making up 8 9 10 9 11 10
bla bla bla and this is instead the
server side which is basically receiving
this message so going back to the
previous screen today to the original
slide of the service bus we have a
device obviously here simulated that is
sending instruction to the server the
server is receiving and putting into the
queue and obviously the message are
continuously received and this is going
through the IOT hub so if I now stop
with them I think was control see the
device would keep on sending messages
but the hub has been stopped them and
the last message received is now gone
but obviously now I kidded the device
itself go back to the hub which was this
one let me let me refresh the page and
we should see a few more messages that
have come into the hub which is this so
there are two devices connected them one
was from a previous session probably and
170 170 1k of messages have been sent I
mean this includes also previous tests
obviously so this is basically the the
hub itself that is monitoring and
receiving the application when this
happens if you if you remember in to the
previous screen of the IOT suite i can
set some rules to say if the temperature
or in this case was the wind spin if the
wind spin is
greater than 20 knots then send this
alert or this other action but now we
are doing here more at lower level so we
are doing into the IOT hub we are doing
this programmatically and now again in
this case simulating the device but well
basically getting device and the event
harbour connected there is something I
wanted to show so it is just here the
yes on the device side you need as your
devices client package that's all you
need to get connected and on the server
side which is this guy here on this plot
this project in the middle you need this
Windows Azure service bus which is the
event hub obviously is the service bus
that received the message and the way it
does the way it works very quickly and I
will share obviously this code after the
session this is really really for
reference is there is anything loop that
is stopped only if there is a
cancellation request and the
cancellation request was the control see
receive always the synchronously from
the event harbor and convert the data
because we send this as a message and
then in this case just display on on
screen in terms of connection we need
the connection string and there was
something here yes and then we create
basically a connection to the event
harbor starting from now which basically
means start recording messages from the
time from the current date and time I
don't care about messages that have been
sent in the past right okay
yes I mean this is now using the AMQP
protocol it can use sockets you can use
HTTP psoas - audio-video can go through
through two different channels different
protocols need to go and see on the
reference of the event hub but there are
many supported in terms of pricing yes
they are based on transaction so on on
traffic so behavior the the packet the
packet the the more you play yes
yes I would say probably fairly
real-time look this will scale to the
millions of messages I've only played
with messages like Jason messages so
text update on temperature these these
things location so these are a couple of
geo coordinates in in this in there in
the case study we will basically send
information about the current weather
the current location the identity of the
person but is a just message at the end
it can be 1 K 2 K but never get that
size of audio and video although I don't
see why not yes
yeah yes no latency is if I remember
correctly five milliseconds obviously
depends also on the network on the
quality of the network connectivity
butter wise the server side is the
nearly real-time out there your time yes
yes I see it's always the network the
the bottleneck okay machine learning how
much time we have another twenty minutes
now this area is again on the boundaries
of our team because again you can apply
it basically to any service not just the
internet of things per se but it's
particularly important because it works
well when you have a lot of data
obviously and the best way to collect a
lot of data is from people using several
type of devices in the in the case study
at the beginning that I mention we were
programming the Microsoft band or the
Fitbit or an app on your device to
basically collect this information now I
want to show you this a variation of
this app which is not exactly the start
which is which is kind of the one that
we use them and saying kind over because
that one will work on the Microsoft band
and then as I move will track my
location and do some preferences but
this one is a bit more of come on over
more interactive asking people for their
preference so let me get on screen
beautiful
that's the Apple that's the app here we
go and now this one is interactive so
it's basically saying which concern you
would like to address aging skin each
skin sensitivity acne sun protection so
then I'll select this one level of you
ABS Porsche - yeah but this is really
more interactive and say okay low level
because I'm saying most indoor is
raining outside not going out my skin is
normal skin boom this now sent the
service there is always send information
to the machine learning service based on
my profile that has been recorded before
so you know that I'm man 40 years old
the white Italian background or I'm in
Sydney is raining outside or whatever
and then it comes out with some product
recommendation if I follow a different
path it will give different results if I
am a different person
it would give different results this is
the results are all coming from these
machine learning using a recommendation
algorithm that I will show you in a
moment take this which has been a bit
interactive because as a person I have
input this information in a context
where all this is happening
automatically because the device is are
sending information about my location
about the weather condition and so on
and then obviously you have a bit of
automation in place which helps to just
to get this information without without
user interaction so let's go to the
machine learning things and see how that
works
screen challenge here but we should be
all right now machine learning that you
can see into this Azure and
website comes in forms of projects
experiments and web services a project
is approach a collection of different
experiments that you do an experiment
instead is a kind of combination it is a
workflow that combines different actions
that produce from input data are not
come there are different types which are
can remember on top of my head there so
apologies I need to take this up on
screen again which are sentiment
analysis basically more little buzz
words key words on social media
typically and identify sentiments
someone is expressing happiness sadness
anger around some comments that we made
demand estimation if I supply this
product in this quantity what is the
expected demand so I can be used for
forecasts or no sales outcome prediction
if I do action a what is the outcome
expected and recommendation which is the
typical Amazon suggestion people that
have bought these evolves about these
days and that and on the recommendation
experiment is based the case study that
I said at the beginning it consists of
two experiments one is the training of
the model and one is the prediction
itself the the training of the model now
the demoscene learning studio which is
there that you've seen here on screen
now basically works mostly in in a
visual way as you can see where you have
a number of actions on the left hand
side from data set
data transformation algorithm for
machine learning Python and our modules
and a bit of programming itself that it
is exactly in Python and in our our is a
functional language now the way it
worked is basically give me some data at
the beginning which let me see if I can
show on screen now which has been
collected by from the device so
basically the device is send this
information come on amigo and people are
different age different education in
different status occupation relationship
race white gender sex mainland made some
females and so on so all this
information has been sent from devices
that are in the in the ground and
collect this information and they send
here then I apply a bit of algorithm
from a machine learning perspective
without going too much into the science
of it but basically this is doing a
split of data where it basically
separated based the Inc the input data
according to some criteria and then use
the to class boosted decision tree which
is basically an algorithm for optimizing
decision based on a fork this is by the
two classes the classes are I take a
decision based on some criteria that are
set there and then I I split my my
decision tree in two branches the branch
that has the highest score wins over the
next one or the other one and so then I
keep the brain the winner branch and
then I split this in two and I keep on
going until by splitting branches and
the winner selected over the other one I
get to one final conclusion which is
basically meaning I'm training the model
then I scored the model scoring is
basically the final step in some way
where after training the model which is
basically give me all this data and
learn how to use this data scoring is
setting the final result the final
result let me see if I can see in here
come on is identifying a likelihood of
getting a specific product assigned if I
remember correctly let me open this so
based on all the conditions now a
male/female age place so which is kind
of skin type come on visualize get all
these data
like come on it's not coming out all
right let me run again just in case he
needs to be running so obviously once I
create this workflow I need to run the
workflow which has been already executed
before so all the training has been done
but let's see in case he wants another
one okay all done finish running view
the results is thinking hopefully will
come up now they the beauty of this
machine learning studio is that the
gives all these combination of other
actions a bit pre bundle the challenge
is knowing what to use there is a bit of
literature there there is a bit of
documentation in the context of our team
it beautifully beautifully connect to
all what we said before in terms of the
event hub the IOT hub the stream
analytics collecting all this
information if you remember the first
clip it comes out if we remember the
first screen of the IOT sweet weather
was the big map and the telemetry all
that information is coming in real time
and has been displayed in real time on
screen in the IOT street but on the back
end there was a document DB database
which is a no sequel DB for collecting
this information I personally have never
used documented before I can speak about
performance and suitability for these
situations I use hard to pull which sits
a bit better in my opinion terms of big
data because historically has been there
be longer the document B but you can
have all this information basically
collecting into a Hadoop and then do
your power bi on top of it gosh
all right some they don't really like
the output here I was showing some food
all right but basically that he was he's
kind of sleeping not coming out very
nicely what it will show is for each
cases of each combination of gender of
all the parameters and also gender age
skin type location the probability the
likelihood that a specific product can
be assigned or not and then this law the
beauty of this is that this can be all
making available as a web service so
automatically once Iran the the
experiment will create an endpoint so
the product predictions are vism which
is basically mice web service that has
been automatically created and exposed
by the machine learning studio I click
something comes up automatically with a
web service which is a restful api with
a key to protect it but you can invoke
from any device from any application and
make this information available to the
user it is what the Apple is doing the
app is basically saying give me this
give me this this API with this key and
then execute and so in the swing there
was a way to
maybe this one yes okay so basically
this might the poster the time to do
this my sample of the request messages
though adjust the message as you can see
where you see all the columns that are
transfer the values and this is the
response that I receive again in a form
of adjacent message so this endpoint is
basically been automatically published
by this machine learning studio in
response to a workflow that generates
that generates the the values which I
don't know if they are visible here a
acidities the score probability which in
this case would it comes out as zero but
basically well this is simple data this
can be read by your device by your app
and then display it as we were seen
before some products so if they come
with a probability higher then we'll
come up in the list of recommended
product so this has a a bit of an
integration between the two things
between the IAT award the machine
learning so I say is based on experiment
and then they publish into a web service
and as your ml dotnet is the website
said and it's a bit the way it works now
so create take the data set do your
magic with the algorithm in this case we
use a predefined to class boosted the
decision tree
there are several ones you need a good
understanding on machine learning to get
through all of them if none of the
predefined algorithm you can write in
Python on in are then you train the
model which is basically is a prepare or
information and do a bit of all de
normalization of data then you've called
the model which is basically to find
they define the output or not that in
this case the probability which is my
product recommendation now last word
about sorry any question about machine
learning is such a large topic that will
require the session per se and I try to
bundle these in 10 minutes
doesn't make really justice to it but is
going getting great visibility in the in
general in the III in the azure
offerings and now there is a new service
that comes out came out a few few weeks
ago the Cortana predictive intelligent
something which is basically using voice
commands to interact with machine
learning algorithm to receive
information also in boys
so getting even more sophisticated I
really didn't want to put this into the
mix today as well but what I do want to
recap is some key concept in terms of
security because probably come well look
some our common sense that apply to any
solutions that is either mobile or a web
or IRT but some are a bit more specific
so for example you need to have a unique
ID for your device that we said is
basically a device to event harbor
connection if you don't have a unique de
can't even connect and that will secure
your channel your security of
communication and allow for remote
wiping your device these kind of things
that obviously add the security to to to
the device itself and then some common
sense keep your system updated them do
auditing on your devices
the typical username DM by device
manager solution for adding all your
devices up to date in terms of the
security patches updates operating
system and then track the communication
path that telemetry functionality it is
not only useful for sending information
about you know humidity temperature wind
speed but it's also used for tracking so
the device is actually alive there is a
bit of a heartbeat is sending a signal
is working so collect information that
are useful but also collect the
heartbeat of the device subtract the
communication path because device is
especially they are your t ones tend to
and and should do to consume less energy
so they going offline or the going
standby or the in a low-power mode the
service assisted communication protocol
on our patterns that we have briefly
mentioned at the beginning helps in
queuing the messages and making sure
that they are received when the solution
that the device is online this obviously
is a specific to the IOT ward it doesn't
apply
not to mobile and web nothing that's it
that's again me when I was an astronaut
on board of the NASA space shuttle
thanks for listening thanks for coming
to this session I think there's been a
lot of things that are just a brief
overview again I remind you if you're
interested to get deeper into the IOT
into the Internet of Things to follow up
with the next two sessions in room for a
couple of minutes for questions so then
I stick around a bit doubts fears
I will probably do that through an MDM
platform rather than as a function if it
is a table data device yes if it is for
updating software
yeah the MDM I think will works it
better honestly yeah and if there are no
other questions thank you
and rest of the day beautiful later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
