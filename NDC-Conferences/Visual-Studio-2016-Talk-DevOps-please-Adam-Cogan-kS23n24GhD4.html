together I put a plan a little while ago
and we got an echo problem you know just
in case the sound guys don't know I
planned on it being you know solely
about visuals do 2016 but there hasn't
been a lot come out of Microsoft so far
so I will walk through that and then I
want to walk through devops and give you
so you know a takeaway of some tangible
tools and practices you can use straight
away a little about me I run a software
company in Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane
it's called ssw we are Gold Partner I am
a asp insider and MVP and I am involved
in running the xamarin hack days and the
anger hack days and a fire boot camp
which used to be just in person is now
online my claim to fame is I crashed the
Tesla and this well I shouldn't say I
crashed it I scared my wife into
thinking I crashed it apparently she
never reads facebook or twitter but she
was reading facebook that day I got a
call within a couple of minutes and was
just a test to see if she was actually
reading it alright so what's the biggest
problem marks I've have with BS at the
moment visionist year crashes yeah any
others download size yeah any others
startup time alright so um I just want
to just clarify first of all when I'm
talking now this vicious year 2015 is
not vyas 2015 I don't know why they made
it vyas because lots of us call the real
visuals govt is I prefer when we used to
use names like UConn and well that was
sequel server wasn't it but lot there
were lots better names just be aware
that that naming conflict but there's
there's a series of issues that have
caused marks of some problems that's the
dollars it costs so we now have a
community edition that's not crippled
they were losing market share the things
like sublime and things and they now
have vyas code they're losing market
share for people that want to run on on
Linux so they got dotnet course they're
kind of making a lot of innovative steps
but we still have this three hour
download and install problem only in
Australia right okay thank you so we
have the NBN in Australia two month so
they have got the download size to under
300 megabytes so that is pretty cool
right within within a minute you'll be
up and running if you click on a link
just be aware this is not the full
version of vicious year this is a light
or we might call it crippled version and
we have actually been through this once
before if you remember back in two
thousand three when we had office see
the little one on the spreadsheet here
this was first time use and it used to
download and install when you'd use a
feature well I worked so well they got
rid of it but we're back there again and
hopefully this is going to perform
better but in addition Microsoft have
had to deal with this problem whether
that that you you know when you log on
to Windows do you want it to log on real
fast or you'll and then every time you
go to do something it's slow or do you
want it to take a bit more time and then
when you use its completely responsive
you know the visual studio team also has
that problem but they've decided that
they're going to make it faster and it's
now three percent faster when you want
to get up and running and there's been a
fair bit of investments in zamel does
anyone who's got a care factor for zemel
in the room Wow alright so that's
seventy percent of the room that's
higher than I expected and it's it's
good and I think your guys will be happy
when you find out some of those mo
improvements coming but they seem to be
pretty focused on giving lots more
functionality potentially that might
even just run on Windows 10 to kind of
encourage you that way too because
they're trying to get everyone
to Windows 10 so they're going to
they're going to do it every which way
they can here's another problem you
don't have a solution or a CS proj file
you you know there's more and more code
bases like that especially for us when
we're doing or angular 2 projects these
days and this Python and no developers
out there what we have now is this file
open and you choose the folder only so
you don't need to see as proj or a
solution file you just open up a folder
or files which seems like a good move
okay if you want less spam and your
banking experience imagine you're
debugging and you keep dropping into
some telerik dll because there's a bug
in there and you can't fix that code so
it would be it would be better to get
rid of that and not see that not that
there would ever be a bug in a telluric
deal with their drunk so you can now do
this where you can add conditions such
as don't drop in here if it equals the
telerik dll or only drop in here if it
is this particular deal oh I'm worrying
about okay so that's I think that's nice
change okay I don't know if any of you
are sick of seeing this but one of the
small problems I guess is you have to
dig in for the details you have to you
know view details to get the inner
exception this is a bit of a modal
dialog and I'm digging into the details
is there any Pokemon users in the room
none all right don't worry this joke my
work all right never mind um the I'm
sure for hanselman that would have
worked I gotta catch them all other jobs
yeah this is okay i just went to
breakfast with Scot hands when he just
got off the plane and he you know he's
looking for he's looking for poker month
so we went along coogee beach and we're
trying to go and could you be but he
didn't want to go right along the coast
sir by the water was because there's no
pokemon z
so anyway this what this is our new UI
for this when you hover over this this
guy this will pop here and I who thinks
this is nice you see the inner exception
ok almost everyone that's great all
right so that's nice can someone explain
to me when there's an error why's it
green maybe that's just me but I find
that odd anyway so there's lots and lots
of investment in visual studio to do
with technical debt lots of the
conversations in the MVP groups and with
the probe teams is all about technical
debt I would expect that lots of the
stuff that comes in vicious to you 2016
not that I know it will be called that
could be called busiest year 2017 but I
expect that you'll see lots of stuff in
there about removing the pain of having
hard to maintain code there put this
stuff in here where you know you got
your coding convention since it's a
small step I would tell you to a degree
you could just go and buy resharper okay
what would you say John input by reach
up you don't know any other perks okay
oh there's also you know just code and
other ones John is very shy he doesn't
want to promote anything now by the way
how many people in the room are already
in resharper okay so seventy percent
who's on just code okay any others
nothing oh yes okay we have a few guys
now you just code ok not very well
obviously musicans he's a consultant and
he wants to our charge in once the most
possible hours all right good hacker
he's using notepad or are you I don't
know why notepad used to turned up to my
session but anyway so have you ever
wanted extension made history when you
go to a fresh machine you want to have
what the hell was that extension you can
now it I don't know why they didn't call
it history they
called it roaming extension major to me
I just go history and it would be
enabled if you logged in but anyway can
see more you know I went to go to
hanselman site to see what is his
favorite extensions you know he stopped
doing his favorite to list a couple
years ago yeah did he announce why I
think that's disgraceful he should once
you start doing a yearly tools list you
should be doing that forever yeah yeah
so i would say tweet handsome enters to
start doing his um his list I think
that's terrible um and I should remind
you if you are after seeing handsome and
at the end of the event on Friday night
he's over at the oak so jobs the yolks
hotel at SS w six to eight will be a fun
night with hanselman we're going to get
him drunk that's the plan move just
joking are you only drinks coke diet
coke yes now there's also pub comp so
you've got plenty of choice that's a
shame that they're clashing actually so
if you want one of the sad things for me
because my crops are always been into
giving updates on you know the UI
experience we won't be getting that much
for Microsoft anymore we're just going
to essentially Microsoft are not giving
us UI frameworks you know its angular or
react or whatever you're going to choose
that's outside of so you won't find
Microsoft giving you much of that you're
going to be you know using it for the
web api and you're going to be using
other things now in terms of a sample
we've come up with the sample Duncan and
stevo I think we'll be covering this in
their session tomorrow but essentially
it's on the latest its angular 2 RC for
its aren't using the CLI it's using.net
core rtm it's using material design a
bootstrap and it's using the ssw danyon
a free extension so that's just a way of
just a sample project to show you that
actually was built internally for the
for our guys the way that we build up a
solution so
and you can can contribute it to there's
two projects there's the UI project and
then there's the backend API project so
you can have a look at those they're on
github okay so what I want to do now is
I want to talk to you about the problem
in the past we have had in the old style
and developers testers business analyst
6 to 12 months ship software cancer
projects okay I should inform you that
this talk was originally written for
Kiwis for a ticket New Zealand so the
good thing is it's extra simple and you
should be able to understand everything
we do today so what we have now do we
have any Kiwis one okay too all right so
these days we are two weeks prints daily
stand-up means most of us are doing
scrum right or some some derivative that
who's in that camp okay it looks like
notice in the room actually there's only
one the Kiwi they're not doing scrum
there we go this talk is not going to go
well in New Zealand so even scrum Doug
who kind of give us the scrum garden
that they have improving the profession
of software development and a lot of the
thinking even with the scrum door guys
is about improving the profession of
software delivery okay a lot of the
focus has been that we have this rules
to better scram its discriminate steps
and I should actually put it at the end
of the session you can grab this but
I'll talk through this in a in a little
while because this is missing something
really important and it's this part over
here the delivery we're going to be
talking about that today so what scrum
solved was communication with clients
they've got developers and testers
together and it stopped this problem of
debs throwing things over the fence to
testers ok so that doesn't happen
anymore but in terms of what our
customers care about our customers care
about which part of this do you think
they care about
it's really that care if you're doing
scrum or Kanban or some other thing as
long as you are shipping okay that's the
most important thing and they want you
to be shipping quality and not stuff
that you fix one thing break another and
where we were a while they'll expect
maturity now okay this I think scrum is
the best thing to ever come out of the
u.s. don't you okay anything better
apple pie okay all right fair we got any
Donald Trump supporters in the room none
okay well he's obviously not the best
thing to come out so I think you've just
passed the intelligence test anyway
that's a good thing all right so this is
where we have we have developers they
the guys that throw the Sheep over the
wall we've got the IT ops there's the
guys that keeps the Sheep alive and we
got the business guy who thinks she can
fly all right now this is how we believe
that things work today we get specs we
add coffee and pizza we make software at
the end of the sprint we make a
deployment package we hand it over to
see sadness to deploy and then we work
on the next feature right and then we
hand it off to the sysadmin we get a zip
of the probe to deploy we provision the
cert or they provision the service they
follow the developer instructions we
deploy we inform the QA and testers and
we wait for the green light to deploy to
production now I've got to tell you I am
going to tell you exactly how it happens
on our and we hit we are doing a very
large tax software for pwc and let me
just walk you through the steps involved
in this this is how it works eric is the
the team leader that he gets the specs
he adds coffee Peter in a few red bulls
makes the software at the end of the
sprint they're meant to get it there by
lunchtime on friday they never seem to
they get it there right the death on
friday i hand it over the sysadmin to
deploy then they work on the next
feature but they're usually off to the
pub about that time so then we send it
off to our friendly sysadmin and we have
to work with nooses admins regularly
because every time
pwc sell to another company and they all
happen to be huge companies with very
strict policies about their IT
infrastructure we get a new set of
problems so we get it they get the zip
they provision their servers they follow
the developer instructions something
doesn't work something's out of date
something new some new thing we haven't
encountered they send this in an email
hi dev she redeployment instructions
don't work send me an updated
instruction doc they call the devs no
one picks up it's after work they send
the email they're off to the pub to then
on Monday they start working on the
problem on Tuesday to send an email look
it works fine when we forward sis admins
I but I have updated the documentation
to be simpler for you to follow it's a
passive aggressive approach and we
deploy hand back to the QA and testers
and now the testers get this now the
sysadmin czar angry okay but this is the
first time we've encountered a problem
they asked for a patch this buggy
there's some new problem that's occurred
we can't see what the problem is so the
devs want access to the servers to check
the logs and we you know they send an
email yes and then the devs say look
we've got we've got we've got it sorted
out here here's a patch we can't see why
it's so hard for the sysadmin sturdily
so the redeploy Thursday they go through
and this you know finally they get a new
version and this goes round the circles
okay so do we spot any problems not
enough not enough here okay all right so
the main problem that we have here is
debs and siblings are operating
independently we're back to this
throwing things over the wall which is
basically an the same problem in a
different format so there's the Trump
wall so it worked fine and Deb and it's
an ops problem so why is this happening
and it's pretty simple each team has
their own kpi's and metrics and goals
debs care about how much work they get
done and how many ppi's get shown at the
sprint review sysadmin
like getting calls at they don't they
want up time they care about up time
they care about less tickets logged so
there's conflicting goals here and the
consequences of inefficiency I got one
this slide from one of the Microsoft
guys and this inefficiency is apparently
I'm told forty percent of rework from
their studies and it takes two hundred
minutes on average to diagnose and
repair a problem and I love this slide
because it's a slight about inefficiency
and this is the slide so how do we fix
the problem and I'm going to tell you
kind of the simplest ways to get the
developers and the operations dancing
together and as one there was a guy in
my office just yesterday and he was
Steven was it came up from Melbourne and
he said I just want to tell you about
how we solved our series DevOps problem
in a project with 30 guys down in
Melbourne I said yeah tell me and he
said you know we just had a lot of
friction and they wouldn't do what we
would ask they always put us down there
down the list they were very
unresponsive in getting this service we
just had a very dysfunctional
relationship with them and then we
started going and we had a few beers
with them we start sending it at a time
and things got better I said aunt well
that's my story and I thought wow you
know he was so excited to tell me that
they fixed the problem and it was as
simple as having respect and spending
time together I will tell you that there
is a guy in our office whoo-hoo I've had
a he does a lot of SharePoint projects
and said deploying sharepoint and the
problems associated with that you know
me how many yes and one of the things
that I noticed when I talked to him is
sometimes I talked him he's so keen to
get feedback on what went wrong and how
to fix it and then other times I speak
to him and he's really not
the feedback he's he's you know I
basically want to speak to him when I
catch him and I want to talk about and I
always thought well I'm explaining the
technical problem I think my my
suggestions are really good suggestions
why is sometimes he's hostile and
sometimes not anyone got an idea why
would he be taking my feedback the
length of time since he's shipping all
right we got a smartass all right I
always thought I was in the right and he
reacted differently so one of the things
that I finally it should have tweaked to
me early sometimes I'm having these
conversations and he has a problem you
know he's still got the problem and I
want to talk through how to think
through it and some steps and other
times I'm talking to when it's already
happened I missed him and now I'm so
it's as simple as that the the time you
the time you get a guy no it's pretty
simple but you want to get someone when
they're ready to listen okay and
sometimes when they've got a bit of
downtime it might not be the best time
so anyway I just want to say some of
these problems is just having empathy ok
and you because what you're after is as
having synergy together so I don't want
you to think this is just all about
tools with this problem now what one
approach to think about is to switch the
kpi's around ok so you can say look the
way that you talk to debs is you care
about uptime first network stability and
then amount of tickets that have been
logged in the last week with problems as
another way is when you're doing your
sprint review the very first thing you
talk about is show me show me the
downtime in the last week before we get
on to the PB ice and the other way with
sis adnan's is or I want to talk about
how much stuff where the developers able
to complete the PV ice now obviously
this I'm taking this to an extreme this
needs to be blended but that is the key
I think to to starting the way that
you're talking to both groups so you at
least have the organizational goals
aligned
fair enough ok so we reverse that now I
want to talk about a little bit about
DevOps history in 2005 we started
talking a lot about ALM in 2008 there
was an agile infrastructure conference
and 2009 the flickr guys came and said
you know we had flickered that deploy 10
times a day people were incredulous
because it was a huge site and seemed it
funny and then there was a series of
events and tools that went out and we
got this Deb day devops days and there
were some key books i'd love to know if
you've ever any of you have read this
anyone read the Phoenix project okay all
right so half the room anyone read a
lean software development okay just a
few anyone read the lean startup okay
third of the room and the Lean
Enterprise just a couple all right cool
and then in 2014 we got some big
companies talking about this target Lego
nordstrom etc and then finally Microsoft
got quite serious about this and
released a whole series of stuff that
they'd been using internally for a while
running their services and we got
application insights and the like so if
you just think about this and if you
look at sysadmin if I was the sysadmin
I'd be particularly interested in this
and we got incest admins okay there in a
bit of trouble they're not here anyway
but you can see that DevOps is growing
and basically the developers are taking
a fair chunk of the cysts admins role
and this is a lot more a lot a lot more
interesting I found this interesting
when I got sure innocence business card
and the title on it said DevOps
strategist so anyone got DevOps in their
job title Oh a couple all right
excellent so um you can see that alm
it's not dying but it's certainly
stagnant and you can see that DevOps is
growing quite a bit all right now I want
to talk through the four stages of
DevOps that are talked about a bit and
that is stage 0 which
sorry this one isn't talked about i just
added this but this is where most
companies that you go and visit our they
have some ALM process they're using git
or TFS or Giro or whatever and they have
continuous deployment and stuff and
they're interested in proving their dev
ops and you know the first stages all
the manual processes must be documented
then we want automation and
repeatability and then we want to get
the metrics and then improve the process
with the metrics so stage zero is
basically simple stage 0 is source
control and we've got scrum or some
process and we've got continuous build
and that's as simple as is anyone just
at that stage and they haven't got pasta
in their company okay all right couple
all right so stage one is having every
single manual process documented you
know they might have an installer that
you run you might have some scripts you
run you know when the schema changes
release notes developer timesheets at
Donelson some something wastage in there
in some manner and manual testing is
there who's at that stage okay couple
all right stage two is automation okay
an automation is we've got continuous
deployment happening we'd probably have
tools like octopus in the mix we don't
have it works on my machine more we've
got you know we might be using
on-premise or a but we've got some
automated testing and there's been
negligible waste who is at this point
okay it looks like two-thirds of the
room properly stage three we are now
logging heaps we've got lots of logging
and I got to ask you who do you think
the best company up there at telemetry
is Microsoft okay any others I had to
laugh at this one I think the best
company out there at telemetry is Tesla
I loved reading this article this guy
had just bought the new model ex when he
lent it to his wife first mistake and
she had crashed the car on her first
drive and she called her husband said
look I just put in an autopilot and did
it it wasn't my fault okay if my wife
tried that trick on me I wouldn't
actually believe it but the funny thing
was you know got to the papers in Tesla
then issued a statement we just looked
at all the logs and she never put an
order part okay she might that she
wasn't she I think telling her husband
Arthur fee so anyway so visibility into
the application is what you want you
want all errors log every unhandled
exception logged performance metrics
everywhere the deployment process time
and user usage well as much stats as you
can gather and then you want to feed
this into your decision-making the next
next stage so who is at this point where
they're logging heaps and heaps couple
three four okay not too many right
there's those tools out there such as
ray gun application insights New Relic
and you know potentially power bi if you
custom do it yourself you know you'd
have asian using some of the deployment
slots functionality and things like that
who here is under new relic you really
just a few who's on application insights
a few any others seguin stats the piece
pellet stats d stats to you okay have no
that one alright and now it's a step of
improving the processes biometrics as an
example look this feature X is not a key
area but we can see that a percent of
the users use it we want to spend some
additional time on that feature because
we've got some stats backing that up we
are seeing that deploying and
provisioning is taking an hour that
affects 500 users we add that up and we
decide to buy hardware measure that the
time etc we see time treats are taking
half an hour developer per week 15 hours
of lost work wastage they're thinking of
some way of automating that reducing
damage from bad deployments we we go
through all those steps as well okay and
we try to see if there's a way that we
can limit bad deployments to twenty
percent of the users alright so in terms
of DevOps which company is the gold
standard handsome and talked about it
today in his keynote amazon i think most
people would say it's netflix and
netflix have been talking and doing this
a lot and they have very very resilient
service and they have that thing called
chaos monkey if you remember he talked
about that this morning and essentially
chaos monkey absolutely in 2002 so 2012
four years ago they released their their
chaos monkey as open source out there
and if you don't understand what it does
it terminates instances of virtual
machines okay pretty scary stuff and
they do this on their production stuff
continually they will have this thing
running that just kills VMs I don't know
if you'd like to do that but I certainly
would not like to do that and that's
where they are and that's why they're so
resilient that said I have update my
slides with yesterday by the way I had
to how many people here know what
Netflix and chilled means chill just
that's only a quarter of the room okay I
got taught by my kids I shouldn't know
what it means but I just having a chat
with Nick before he didn't know what am
at bc's over 40 that would be why oh
alright so um netflix were in the paper
yesterday Netflix's worldwide pushes
stranger thing fans to the brink I don't
know what that means stranger thing fans
anyway I love this statement I qantas
never crashes but netflix does okay i'm
a proud of Qantas traveler so I
oh the humanity not since the Hindenburg
disaster has there been a more climate
risk example of Technology overreaching
itself and leaving poor witless human
beings and their dreams in escape of toe
that's what happens when Netflix goes
down for the further weekend and it just
goes to show you it's even them killing
their VMs they still have problems at
periodically so it's it's a tough job
okay I want to walk through and one
thing because a lot of this is about
communication and when I walk through
our time pro which is just a tool that
we have and I just want to show you the
way the guys have set that up because i
think it's interesting there's lots of
things going on in our it's an internal
it's a it's actually it's a real site
it's at our internal timesheets and you
know basically we have lots of things
going on we need a single portal which
we do have with vs TS vicious geo calm
we got a backlog and continuous build we
got good communication going on we've
got octopus deploy and we've got
application health check which is a page
we go if there's ever a problem now
we've got exception howling going on but
really what we want is we want a nice
portal of communication the way that the
guys set that up is his that his time
pro and it's got a bit of gamification
here but every time so I want you to
just see a kind of the process that we
have and the first thing is we have
health check health check is just a pay
it's just a nuget package it's free as
you can download it but lots of people
solve this in different ways you can
just have a page that you go to that
checks everything's alive so you can
come in here and it will just we put
this link on all our apps and it's just
nuget package and runs through a series
of dependencies and checks there they're
alive okay so that's the first thing but
in terms of the coding this is the bit I
think it is interesting it's not as it's
quick bang for buck you the guys will
jump in they'll make some code changes
i'll check it in when they check it in
they can go to vs TS or you can go to if
you using get good help you could go
there and see the pull request but here
we have the the check-in
so code explorer and here is our chicken
you can see this chicken here is the
latest one Eric's has done some work and
he's checked it in he will also they all
use slack who's here is using sleight
Wow all right so we got at least a third
of the room on slack and they come in
here and you would see that that record
up here ok so the record appeared that
check can happen plus you could probably
go over to the build tab and see that
the build happen successfully not that
they would bother they would just see
this up here this new record appear here
in slight they could also go over to the
the octopus portal and that they could
see that it successfully automatically
deployed to staging or they probably
wouldn't bother they would just see here
a new octopus icon appears and says
hello that's deployed this this is
fairly quick and easy to set up and who
who has already set up all this type of
stuff couple three okay who thinks that
is super cool to have that okay almost
so oh yeah good point so I should just
say in reality we don't have all these
we actually when it gets busy what you
and a lot of team members are on it you
actually turn all these off and you only
have the the problem shot yes good point
John but if a demonstration purpose is
good to see how it starts up so I when
an exception happens and it's a nun
handle exceptional or some problem this
pops there it says hello we've got this
little ray gun icon it says oh there's a
problem and then one of the guys would
jump on that and fix it and then hello
this exception pops there one of the
things i don't like I don't know if you
can tell the difference between the
first one in the second I find it
completely obvious we have red hair and
green here it's pretty you can't really
customize the text here
with the a box functionality and you so
that's kind of how that works and you
know here's a Eric set this entire thing
up and some of the guys set it up
different ways I like the way he's done
this I might just play one minute of
this just so you get an idea it's a 30
minute video and he shows how he sets up
the entire thing but i'll just show you
just this little bit here reagan two
hours ago the errors that happen what's
cool about this is i can track these
errors against deployments so this is
the version that i literally deployed
two minutes ago i can go into that okay
there's no issues yet reported against
disappointment if i go back to let's go
back to say this one there's two new
issues associated with that so i just
want to stop it there and just show you
that's kind of one of the greatest
things about ray gun in that when you
deploy you can easily see just the new
exceptions that have happened since you
deploy because they're the ones you want
to jump on top off of course you usually
will have a list of old ones you haven't
resolved but they're the ones you keep
on top of particularly so because we
have this we can actually check sorry
that we can actually correlate in which
build all our errors being introduced
into the system okay this also shows
here errors that you've markers being
resolved that are coming back so that's
probably a potential for a unit test to
make sure that there's no regression
once and then there's ongoing issues as
well okay so you get this nice crush
pudding dashboard so you can sort of see
over time how many errors you're getting
how many have been resolved you can
ignore certain ones that always occurs
like 40 falls for example the other cool
thing about Reagan that we've got here
is use user tracking
there might not actually be any food
swollen let's see oh yeah we've got some
so in tracking your CH sort of average
little load times so now it's actually
using the system at the moment this is a
live active session but you can drill
into users and you can also correlate to
which users are getting which narrows as
well so it's pretty cool nice utility
you know I won't show you any more but
you get the idea and if you wanted to
know more about how that is you could
just watch that video but it's um it's a
nice setup and I think the devs really
like it compared with how we used to
have things well I do want to tell you
look there's lots of tools we can talk
about here but one of the most important
things I think is it's not just about
tools and it's a not it's also you know
we've talked about empathy but there's
also the way that humans think through
problems and I can tell you that like we
get a hell of a lot of traffic on our
website to to our rules now the first
rule Martin just remind me before was
the first rule in our site does anyone
happen to know rules are made for the
guidance of wise men and the obedience
of force ok I think and I think anybody
just following the rules would be kind
of crazy I was before I was in software
I was an accountant and in accounting
there's certainly a lot of rules you
can't just treat expenses as you want
you you follow the tax legislation and
before that I was in the army and in the
Army I was in infantry and there's
certainly a hell of a lot of rules in
that when you are in the army the
infantry you you can know if you're
you're a soldier grunt we were called a
grunt and when you do exercises you go
into battle you are you're at a
heightened sense of alertness you are in
battle you're you're being very
defensive however you're doing it
there's also another role they're called
a scout and the scout is a person
that goes up the mountain and they look
around there they have a different
mindset they're inquisitive they're
looking for alternates they're
questioning themselves which is the best
route what will they say you know is
that bridge makes sense across etc lots
of those type of things when if you want
to be a good soldier you need to have
good judgment if you need to be a good
developer you need to have good judgment
and one of the problems that humans have
is we are well it's talked about a lot
with confirmation bias and if you even
watch the footy and you're following
your favorite team and there is a
decision by the ref and it goes your way
you're not that critical if the decision
goes against you you're much harsher on
the referee if you are if you believe in
you know capital punishment and you read
an article which basically says
something else you quite dismissive of
it if you think about politics you know
you lean one way or the other if you
know we just established there's no
Donald Trump supporters here but there
are a lot of Donald Trump sports and
when you know they hear statements that
we would find particularly bad like you
know when Mexico sends its people
they're not sending the best they're
bringing drugs they're bringing crime
they're rapists some I assume a good
people are we those people will say well
I'm not racist of course he is just
encouraging people to follow the
procedure so it's fair and equitable
when other things happen like you find
out about say you know all these
failures and in business and Trump
University they will say well of course
everyone makes mistakes everyone fails
that's reasonable when you know even
when he says things about that Pakistani
can't guy they you know that would they
will say well you know maybe he's okay
but there's other ones that are problems
that's what we're talking about and so
it
when like when we are in the middle of
serious problems that are happening
that's not just that happens to all
people and when you have been given new
facts but you already have a bias that
you don't believe it's that problem you
discount it because you've already put
in your mind and you're not being open
it's a really difficult problem doing to
solve and every person pretty much has
that problem so yeah good judgment comes
from lots of bad judgment and I think
that's a good good statement when the
facts change I change my mind what do
you do sir and this is a this causes a
lot of conflict because as humans we
have real problems switching our mind
when we've already got a bias towards
one way or the other all right so I want
to talk about a couple of things just on
this implementation I want to talk about
the metrics now there's the metrics that
you can eliminate our to do with waste
and if you are using scrum e keeping to
your time boxes if you are if you're
going through the scrum process or
whatever process you're doing the
important people turning up to the
ceremonies how long are the test is
retesting the app like measuring these
this waste how long this is one that I
rarely see anybody ever measure how long
does it take to get a new developer up
to speed this is one I care about a fair
bit okay so what you want a new
developer to know as soon as it comes on
board and onto the team you wanted to
know when of the scrum ceremonies and
this is in our case what is the
definition of ready and what's the
definition of done what is this where is
the sprint backlog you know I don't want
you to come and ask me for the URL to
that is there an automated built and is
it working right now where are the URLs
for staging prod you know or octopus
where do I go to get started before I
write my first line of code on this
project where's the exception like
there's lots and lots in there's heaps
and we talk
I talk all about this on one of the
rules but this is a decent portal and
there's lots of better ones and lots of
worse ones but this kind of just shows
you straight away where to go to get
study click on this link and you'll go
to the induction for this particular
product and will tell you a couple of
things you need to be able to answer
those questions correctly where do we go
for to deploy to staging sorry well and
we can see that it's alive at the moment
everything's good where is the backlog
where other environments just look here
you can see there's the production
there's the staging I've just taken a
screen capture of a real one here you
can see that there this one has an
extension on the marketplace that
there's URL there in terms of DevOps
there's our deployment stuff to octopus
there's a UI test too silly notice
there's the exceptions to ray gun ask
Eric about that stuff performance
application insights and usage Google
Analytics there's all the URLs to
everything there it should be there over
here you got the scrum these you know
that's when the daily scrums happened
this is whatever and there's the
definition of reading definition done
that type of thing a little bit of an
investment in your portal is pretty
important I would say all right and a
couple of things that we're not there
yet our internal tools we aren't there
we don't have the the ray gun tiles we
don't have a pin site styles we don't
have deployed versions of octopus and we
don't have our top uservoice suggestion
on the portal so the portals not perfect
but that it will probably get better
because in June there was an update and
these vendors know about these things
but there's these rest api's you can
make these tiles easier now I expect
that that Porter will get better and
better with more third parties out there
you can get up insights thanks Martin so
you can already put your app insights
that um and this is the the in the
getting started is the sugar learning
that is just a list of all the things
that the dev has to do before kicking
off in getting alive all right so um I
just want
okay oh wow ah hold on okay so this is a
tool I think these guys are here but
feature toggling is a really important
thing anybody heard of a pro cord launch
darkly okay good so four or five you
have anyone using it not a soul all
right well you know about it now it is I
think it's a great product I really
think this is one of it because
basically what you want to do is keep
getting your stuff in production and for
beta test users using them to get very
early feedback rather than just you know
not getting feedback quick enough the
way that they manage all this stuff is
really nice so feature toggling is very
very important much more important than
branching in my mind I would think that
this investment is seriously worth and I
think this is a sign of maturity to be
using stuff like this so in terms of
getting unfinished code in production I
just want to tell you about github flow
I think it's incredibly important I
won't go through it but I will tell you
that we have a video on how to create a
branch for a feature branch for every
pbi and here is the the video it's just
on one of the rules it's done by a guy
called Steve Lee it's a really nice
video on basically all the steps to do
feature branching and how you know how
he recommends doing it so I would
encourage you to have a look at that if
you're not into it okay so um I I just
want to hold on all right so get I've
already told you to get your stuff your
team swarming around slack I have a
whole lot of extra slides with other two
all's in here that you can download and
take I think you'll enjoy it but I do
want to tell you we have a quiz just so
you can walk yourself through and give
yourself a self evaluation of DevOps
these are the same questions we ask
points and these are the things that you
can use to work at which ones you care
about which ones you don't so in summary
we've talked about what's new and
visuals geo we've talked about the four
stages of DevOps it is about tools and
it is about the way that you're
interacting with the your sis admins and
it also is the way that you're
evaluating new information I hope the
posters down here and i want to tell you
this is this was the original image and
remember how I told you this was missing
so the new version that we have here has
this bit on the right so it's just about
product increment now we consider this
kind of important because we put this up
and up in the war room with our clients
because we're always trying to show them
where we're up to because we want them
invested in the process but but this is
all about DevOps this right hand side a
couple of other things we have this
visual studio 2015 checklist we also
have an angular 2 book which is up at
the stand up stairs and I think Stevo
and Duncan and going through it in their
session tomorrow so a lot of this is on
our rules to better developed which I
think that you'll find a bit more detail
than when I've done today there's a
whole lot of links here and last few
things tweet your favorite tool love to
know if you're using tools i haven't
mentioned today I'm massively keen or
send me an email Adam cokin at ssw
comdur you or I've got a business card
if you want to take one we have a whole
lot of videos up at SS WTV it's a free
youtube channel with heaps and heaps of
great presentations and videos i think
that's if you're dot net developer our
angular developer you'll get plenty out
of it ah last thing fire boot camp we
have been running five
boot camp it's a nine week intensive
in-person training that's pretty
hardcore to leave your job for nine
weeks and we're doing it only once a
year now and pretty much most of the
effort is on the online course it's all
about angular 25 bootcamp calm and the
last one if you're after hanselman it's
on Friday night at our joint go there or
go to pub conf do one of them cool
