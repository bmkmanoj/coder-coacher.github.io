couple of phases here of a session or
dis did I will just do a quick recap
just for the people that weren't in the
first session but I'm not gonna go
through the same material obviously so
we'll look at some of these stuff we
have some new things I mean if you're
serious about mixed reality development
these are probably the things that
you're gonna be tested on really as in
you know as a developer so we'll look at
mixed reality toolkit which is awesome
some more gestures which are promised in
the first tour voice commands and how
that more of learn the designer voice
commands and the design of spatial audio
and then we'll look at space your methyl
and mapping and testing and I know we
all if we developers here we love
testing right now again questions I
thought I'll bring abrupt bribery so
usually with questions you get
Australian content and these are the
special ones this is the choc mint
mm-hmm and the chewy caramel right
there's not just any Tim Tams you don't
ask questions you don't get no that was
the first talk see the title is just
there's two two if you if you never
submitted for for conference before
there's two aims with the title one is
to get your talk in right be interesting
the other is to get people in your room
be interesting and that's it it should
also be descriptive of what you're doing
are you asking why the title was other
does Holograms in my bedroom because you
can put them anywhere you can use any
room anything right it was a trick I got
you
ah so yeah sure when you ask a really
good one
so we'll just do a quick overview of
essentially the five pillars we were
talking about before so we got gays it's
what it's not what your eyes are looking
at it's what your head is pointing it
okay we don't track our movement we
track head movement we have gestures
which is tap and blue right there's only
those two okay we'll do a bit more with
this in a minute there's voice voice
commands either you just say select
which just selects the things like
tapping or you can have see it say it so
if you see a label on a button you can
say that while you you're gazing at the
app and it'll trigger that command or
you can do a custom commands as well
which is what we did we've got some
spheres we dropped on everything sound
audio spatial audio is really important
for the experience you remember you
don't control the environment with this
right do you want to blend in you want
to appear as if you are an extension of
the actual reality hence the term mixed
reality so your sounds have to be
natural they have to be convincing they
have to fit whatever it is your
experience is which they obviously
didn't do in the first demos you weren't
here they were terrible okay we will
look at sound design as well a little
bit later and then spatial mapping which
is what makes hollow land Holland's
without spatial mapping there is no
hololens the four cameras on the front
that builds a 3d model of your world
that you're in or of the environment is
key to the spatial mapping I see the
whole ins experience using spatial
mapping yes on the ground or whatever
you can you can did you generally don't
because you don't know what other
lighting sources there are no no no it's
not that clever but in unity you can put
your own lighting source on things as if
there was a light on it right so you can
do that we're going to start with
looking at mixed reality toolkit which
used to be called the hollow toolkit so
I will probably call it hollow toolkit
many times most of the documentation
still says hollow toolkit but they
changed the name because it's it's for
all mixed reality devices right it's
freely available on github there's a
version for
unity and there's a version for Visual
Studio most likely you will use the
unity version so and I'll give you a bit
of background on it so there's two games
for Hollins again I don't think it's a
gaming device it does gaming well but it
has a lot better applications than
gaming but these two games fragments and
young conker are incredibly well made
they're the some of the best users of
mixed reality I've seen and they were
made as a showcase to sell the hololens
but they came out from the beginning as
soon as people could buy the whole
instead was fragments and young conker
came shortly after they're built by a
French studio called Sauber in Bordeaux
and they found out so fragments a bit
about what the game is you're a memory
detective
and you can see fragments of people's
memory hence the name and you spatially
map the room that you're in and
fragments of this boys initially memory
are shown wherever it can right so it
depends on what room you're in it'll be
a different experience every time for
example the first level they'll be a
hole in the roof and rain comes in
that's a memory of the boy you're trying
to find right it's very very very very
well made it's incredibly convincing
they found out that in order for them to
place things and have liked characters
like that come in and sit on your
furniture well they need to be able to
identify what a wall is what a ceiling
is what a couch is what a chair is so
they built a bunch of tooling around the
spatial mapping how logically to know
two surfaces like this is a couch and so
on and this means that they couldn't
very easily identify what where the
ceilings where the walls were the beds
were you know all those things they used
they built a whole lot of other tools of
scripts and in the end Microsoft decided
to put it all out as open-source and it
became the holo toolkit which is now the
mixed reality toolkit so it's a very
much a community effort it's supported
by Microsoft but a lot of independent
hololens developers mixed reality
developers are supporting this and as
they find bugs they'll update it as
there's new versions of API are still
updated it's very very very important if
you decide to develop for hololens they
even have their own logo now
that's how serious become but it gives
you these essentially these kind of
categories of shortcuts and helps and
scripts it gives you input so we're in
the first talk we were talking about you
know gaze and voice and all those things
and this gives you scripts that manages
all that for you so it makes it much
easier and much more elegant to
implement gaze and gesture and voice
sharing we didn't talk about sharing
we're not gonna talk about sharing today
but there's a sharing experience we can
have up to eight whole ends to see the
same experience it helps you with that
as well setting all that up spatial
mapping scripts that allow as we talked
about to identify what different things
are what's the walls what the ceilings
spatial understanding so that's the
spatial understanding spatial mapping is
in displaying the spatial mapping and
understanding and interacting with them
spatial sound scripts to help pluck
spatial audio into your application it's
not difficult but there's some helper
scripts around it it's not too much of
it
UI controls such as your cursors you get
free cursors because no one wants to
build a cursive really that you know
interacts and does things as you use it
a bunch of utilities whole ton of
utilities of very nerdy scripts and then
some build automation tooling as well so
I just want to quickly show you what it
looks like and you go to github and you
download whoops the mixed reality unity
package that's the file name dot unity
package and it's not very big if you
don't want the examples it's about ten
Mac or so and you it's a very common
thing to in your is used import custom
package and there it is so put on the
desktop as it is and you open it and it
decompresses it and shows you a bunch of
stuff that's in it now I'm not gonna
import it because that takes a while so
I've already done that to you nothing to
import get you another menu in here now
if you've ever gone through any of the
tutorials on Microsoft website they tell
you to go and change the camera to this
and change the background to black and
move it over and all these tedious
things you have to do every single time
because unity was not made for mixed
reality development but now it is used
for it right so there's a bunch of
things you need to do and you can just
do it now with a click of a button
configure apply mixed reality project
set
such as make sure it's Universal Windows
platform which is Windows 10 development
enable XR which is the the world 3d
building dotnet scripting all that stuff
that you would otherwise have to hunt
around and remember to do every single
time and remember you now get that for
free every little helper boxes and
everything as well close that and it's
the same with configuring the scene and
the capabilities that you want to use
very very useful but that's just a start
right you just use that for 10 seconds
when you start a new project the real
value is in all the things I'll just
make this a little bit taller here that
I in the holo toolkit so all this comes
as assets in use in your your project
and for example if you want us to do say
input we can go in their scripts there's
all different kinds of scripts for
editors for cursors gamepads
if you want to look at the cursor script
there's a ton of you know animated
cursor scripts and there's some
interfaces if you want to build your own
to make sure they adhere to the hololens
framework mesh code
hold this I don't know how many I'll
guess maybe 300 different scripts that
you can use and it's all managed and
maintained for you through the github
repo it's invaluable as a developer like
it takes a lot of time off the plumbing
for building Harlan's developments and
you get to you to build what you
actually want to build and there's yeah
a tunnel I won't want to go through the
whole thing does anyone have questions
on the mixed reality toolkit yes all you
have to import it again yeah yeah this
yeah it's not that elegant mostly as you
can you can ask the people that were in
my workshop this week I have a workshop
when I tested a couple of weeks ago
whatever a week ago a new version unity
came out broke the whole thing right so
I just went no I'm just doing it for the
previous version too hard but yeah my
point is that mostly you just pull it in
and be fine like they'll extend on api's
that were just mark them as obsolete
they won't remove or anything once in a
while there's a new version like there
was ten days ago that does break it
and you just gotta deal with it which is
annoying but that's part of it because
we're early adopters wrong so that is
the mixed reality toolkit not the whole
toolkit okay
cool
next up we've got gestures and we talked
about gestures because it there's this
tap right there's a little bit more than
just tap if you tap and don't let go
it's a hold you can hold on something
and that's good if you want to for
example scroll so you hold on something
and you move your hand and then that
becomes a manipulation right when you
move your hand in vertical and
horizontal so you got tap you got hold
you actually got hold start and hold end
you got manipulation in X and y-axis and
then you can also do navigation which is
a 3d kind of like you had a joystick you
can move things around so if you tap
hold and move your hand in 3d space like
in a box then you can manipulate things
as navigation in 3d space and this is
used very often for if you want to move
something you tap on it hold it and then
you move it over here you can move a bit
closer a bit further way that's the
manipulation so the navigation so that
is still the same tap right it still you
got you ready and you pressed gesture
but you just extend on them to make you
know advanced gestures I guess and there
again part of the framework I'll show
you you don't have to do you have to do
a little bit more because it's a little
bit more code yeah so I was just picked
again another Microsoft example which is
in something called Astro man and if I
can get him running actually I'll just
yeah that's the right one I'll just
start him out to you and get running yes
good question
so you're talking about someone puts on
the Harlan's for the first time what and
how long before they can use it yeah
most people within sort of ten minutes
some people just they can't coordinate
it like there's something some sort of
connection that just doesn't function
properly nothing wrong with them it's
just it's not natural for them you will
get all sorts of attempts at tapping you
know the duck or you know the pointing
or whatever but usually people when that
doesn't work and something starts
working you'll start doing that more and
more and it becomes pretty intuitive
it's it's not a natural gesture
initially but it becomes part of the
experience move your head
but you get used to moving like this
right oh he goes because you can always
see gestures in front of you so if you
move your head like that
it won't there's a cup of tap right so
there's a bit mechanical like that
moving in but it takes you know maybe 10
minutes 15 minutes usually my
twelve-year-old took about 10 seconds
right and you just used it and then
three-year-old looked at me one and then
walked off like it was the most natural
thing in the world I don't know oh we
got to plumbing arizim okay so in here
if you're in the first stop session you
saw the tapped event it's exactly the
same we have navigation started
navigation updated navigation completed
and so on and you just handle these
events with your own event handlers in a
and react to them accordingly so if we
say we go to the navigation started
event we just changed the position right
in this case we're just moving the
astro-man dude it's all really basic
stuff like this set some position to
something else because you know where
you're moving you get that you know
update which is 60 times a second you
get constant information about where
people's hands is that's the navigation
updated event so you always know where
they at and you can move whatever it is
they tapped on a hole or held on you can
move that accordingly it takes a little
bit to get used to just because it's if
you haven't done unity before this idea
of 60 times a second you can do
something is a bit weird but you get
used to and that's how you move things
it's
feels very resource-intensive but that's
how it works I'll just see if I can get
him if I actually deployed it nope
give me one more girl it's again the
tooling and this sometimes just gotta
restart everything for some reasons in
these artifacts that hang around and it
screws up whatever it is and if you if
it's too slow like this had to start the
emulator then the visual studio deploy
routine times out and stuff like that
it's just part of it any questions on
the gestures as such I know you got one
sitting there one again no no we do not
make our own gestures I'm just saying
don't it's it's a world of hurt because
I said this in the first talk as well if
you do that not only have to you have to
manage all the raw input and figure out
what the hell adjuster is you got to
make sure that that is super accurate so
it works every single time and then if
you get that far without losing your
mind then you have to educate users on
there's another gesture because they
wouldn't know right so there's this
whole like it just snowballs so I would
never ever do it okay so now we got
Astro man so this is the emulator I
can't make it any bigger because
Microsoft sorry and is very dramatic
whose astro-man it's a little bit
laughing there you go so extra man is
just another example of using some of
these more advanced gestures so I can
like the cursor is now in the middle I
can move around as I move off you can
see the cursor changes which indicates I
can do stuff so for example if I move
down a little bit here I can tap and
then hold so I'm just holding down the
Enter key
so that's now hold right if I didn't
stop moving left and right as if I was
moving my head he reacts to that he
starts spinning right if you spin him
fast enough he was throbbing his helmet
no not really that would be cool though
um oh yeah he spins fast and faster and
faster right so that's just a reaction
to how far you are from where you tapped
and he gets all that you get that in the
navigation updated event and I'll see if
I can get again more stuff you get a
heads-up display by this something I
didn't touch on the first talk see
there's this little arrow here you can
do visual indicators which is very
helpful because of the field of view is
so damn small any kind of indicator that
helps
whether it's audio-visual that helps the
user to go to where you want them is
very very helpful very important as well
okay so that's that's extra main we
think I can press ardent there's the
next part of this this is all a tutorial
the voice commands you can say explode
and he goes Bush that's not a joke you
can which is kind of weird okay I'll
just shut that up okay we
any more questions on gestures yes not
really no it's more in relation to where
you started you know because Easter
which which direction you're going
whether you get forward backwards it's a
good question I don't think you can I'm
not sure exactly they've changed as well
as well voice commands I'm not actually
gonna show you voice commands we're
gonna talk about how you design voice
commands because implementing him as I
showed in the first talk is really
simple there's hardly anything to it you
just have a keyword recognizer and then
you attach a string that's your command
and then an action that happens or an
event or whatever and that's it like you
don't have to do anything with the
framework you never do anything manually
because the framework handles at all yep
no no not yet
there are ways in unity where you can do
others than c-sharp script I think
there's an f-sharp implementation of
some things but I've never seen anything
except seizure for all languages sorry I
had minored brain on um you talk yeah no
it has to be English I did try with
Danish and put in Danish text rings or
whatever but it's just angle or angle
fired it doesn't work so if you can say
the Norwegian word with an English
dialect maybe it'll work but no it is
all English yeah okay so voice commands
really easy to implement pretty
difficult to get right or to get at
least obvious I couldn't actually find a
picture every boys command so this was
the best I could do I'm sorry
so there's a bunch of rules around
speech design that are really important
not just for hololens but in any kind of
3d experience I guess when you kind of
voice recognition what actions can be
taken through speech like you can do
anything with speech that you can do
with the tap but
does it make sense like you can trigger
stuff that that you might not be able to
do otherwise then it makes sense if you
save a bunch of taps if you say we're
gonna have to tap on six things and you
just do one one voice commands instead
that makes sense if it's not obvious to
tap on something but there's a label or
there's a you know something floating
that says hey say this yeah you know
make sure it makes sense don't just do
design for everything or voice commands
for everything um is it a good option
it's kind of goes hand-in-hand for
completing a task now if you need people
to you know use the hand anyway to tap
on something and you have voice in the
middle of it like maybe not maybe just
not do it this is important we talked
about this before with gestures as well
how do you users know don't just assume
that people would know all the ways you
can interact with your experience use
something like a little microphone icon
that sits over you know the hovers over
something make sure that you know if
they keep doing the same thing over and
over again and there's a easier way to
doing with voice tell them you know put
up a little speech bubble have a wizard
of some sort but you need to educate
your users otherwise how they're gonna
know is the app always listening for by
default the Holland's has voice
recognition turn on the whole time all
right so if there are scenarios where
you don't want it to listen you need to
make sure that you don't react to it
because the framework will just pick it
up what phrases this is an interesting
discussion because say the workshop I
did when you shoot a bow on some boxes
we did a voice written command to shoot
the ball right and they're very
intuitive that you guys know of it's
just cute it's easy but that's actually
too short because we all have different
dialects we all say it in different ways
and if you have a one syllable word like
shoot it could sound different from
different people but if you get context
so we ended up using shoot ball if you
have context of it it's much easier for
the voice recognition to great to
understand what you're saying so make
sure you don't have these very short you
know commands because they will probably
work most the time
but you wanted to work all the time
right interaction dialogue or context if
you ever used katana when they first
came out one of the big selling points
was that they have contextual
interaction so you could say hey Cortana
what's the temperature today and she'd
say oh it's 63 degrees Fahrenheit
I know six to you and you say oh can you
tell me that in Celsius and she'd say in
Celsius or what are the 10 best
restaurants around here and then she'd
tell you and you go out the table to the
third one so this whole contextual
interaction if you want that on here
which is really cool but you can have to
build it yourself right you don't get
that for free but it's a is important
x1 in some ways it makes sense you can
build up as hierarchy or voice commands
right but it's tricky and you don't get
any help from the framework
unfortunately you just get the voice
recognition and then I always put this
on because we forget it's developers
that we always have network connectivity
when we develop if you have a voice
command that triggers a cloud coal or
something and you suddenly don't have
connection you gotta handle that
otherwise the whole thing goes boom
right that makes sense yeah the design
of voice commands is this is more
important than implementing it's very
easy to implement
okay cool the next thing is spatial
audio and we we touched briefly on this
in the first talk and if you didn't see
that it's it's really not that difficult
all you need to know is that okay
there's nothing else to it so I don't
know what that means
it's from Wikipedia but it is how the
head related transfer function algorithm
is calculated and head related transfer
function is a binaural algorithm which
means it's it calculates how sound
reaches you two years and it's kind of
what this diagram is saying right if
you've got two listening sources or ears
and you have a sound as the sound moves
you can see that the distance here is
shorter than the distance here which
means that this sound should reach that
ear before that year
that's very simplified but that's what
it does and that means that when you put
it on and you have spatial audio these
little speakers here are crucial right
it's super accurate the
framework does all the spatial audio
calculation for you don't worry about
any of this mathematics but it's good to
know that that's how it works
all you need to know is that it's there
and we get pretty pictures of it this is
how Microsoft sells it yeah it's got
that whoo that's it you know
audio design is as crucial as it is with
voice design the audio of this there's a
few pitfalls and I'm not an audio
engineer by any stretch but I've had
enough experience now with this that I
kind of know what works and what doesn't
you need grounding you need to have
grounding of your 3d objects so they
become a natural part of this world like
we're trying to trick the user into
thinking that they're part of the real
world right that's the whole idea so if
you can ground your objects with its
sound so if you had a bird on the ground
make a chirp it a little bit right as
it's on the ground or pick on the ground
and it'll sound like it's coming from
over there
make sure you ground them and use their
tension we talked about this a little
bit before with with the visual visual
guidance if you users don't know where
something is you can use sound to guide
them it's natural thing if we hear a lot
of noise we turn right everybody does
you can use the same idea with this if
you say you're building a I don't know
zookeeper game and the line got out you
want to hear that right ok so use it for
user attention just like you would with
visual with your gaze you can have the
curse let's show you a there's something
over there turn right turn right
immersion obviously sound is crucial for
the immersion of a game again immersion
for the hololens does not mean lots and
lots and lots of sound it means the
right sounds okay if you have a hundred
different elements you don't want all of
them to have sound because it's
overwhelming and you won't hear any of
them the same if you have background
music the don't write all of you are
here in the first talk but there's the
background music and it just annoys the
crap out of you remember you cannot
escape background music it's on your
head right you can't run away so don't
use it and this it's absolutely
necessary and if you
use it grounded somewhere so that it
sort of M emanates from one spot
interaction design you can use sound as
a way of giving tactile feedback as we
come we can't touch to Holograms as such
but if we click on a button make it
click ok that that you can use sound for
that as well
gaez mixing is a good way of you know
you can highlighting objects so when you
put your gaze on something in highlights
and it goes you know or click or
whatever might be you in interact use
the other input methods with the sound
or your apps like we just touched on
that when you can actually touch on
something immersion iterate again
they're crucial for emotion right it's
the most important thing in hololens in
the high rollin spirit is to make sure
people a immersed and they believe in it
because we're mixing their reality it's
not a vr experience where they know that
you've taken away their real the real
the real world ok audio so that audio
yes we will use it in minute oops sorry
spatial mapping that was a bit quick
spatial mapping spatial mapping is what
makes a break the Harlin's you will not
have any mixed reality experience if you
don't have spatial mapping it's as
simple as that the spatial mapping comes
from these four cameras so sits on the
front they map the room you're in and
builds up a 3d model that looks
something like this lots and lots and
lots of triangles polygons you use this
spatial mapping in a few different ways
placement obviously if you want to put
something on the wall he's know where
the wall is you also need to make sure
that it sticks to the wall so your
spatial mapping is is okay see if I can
explain this right in virtual reality
you have one 3d coordinate system right
because you know where everything is you
built you made the coordinate system you
made the world and virtuality mixed
reality you don't you have one
coordinate system which is based on your
spatial mapping and then each hologram
you place have another spatial
coordinate system that is relation is in
relation to the overall coordinate
system and you place that using what's
called world anchors or so
winkers these anchors are in relation to
the real world because you don't always
get the spacial mapping correct with the
Holland's it's not a hundred percent
accurate so something I map over there
Mike you know initially say oh it's four
meters away and I place a hologram there
as I move around the space and realize
is actually on a three point eight but
if you start moving the hologram it
looks fake and people lose confidence in
what you're doing
so what this does is that you place a
spatial anchor with your hologram and it
angers it to the real world as in on the
3d model that you're building right and
then it just updates the distances again
crazy hard mathematics that you don't
have to worry about but that's how it
works
occlusion which is a nice way of saying
hiding stuff you can have characters go
behind things which makes it more
believable so for example young conker
we talked about before he will jump on
your real furniture go behind your couch
go underneath your table to catch all
the coins he needs and whatnot that's
occlusion physics you want stuff to look
real like when we you know did the ball
before the little paper ball you want it
to look like it's rolling down properly
you want proper physics spatial mapping
is used to allow you to have the physics
in relation to what the real world is
right so you don't you want something to
fall on a chair and just sort of stop
there you want to fall through
navigation you want characters to be
able to navigate your real space just
like you're on Congress can navigate
your room you want people to come in and
you know if you have characters they sit
on you chase or whatever it is so that's
what spatial mapping is really really
good for now let me show you how it
works this is the cool bit so whoops
just got to connect everything to my
hotspot music so that I can show you
camera
yeah so now I have both my computer and
the Holland's on a local network which
means I can now go here and I should be
able to show you make sure that actually
runs
okay
there we go
now okay mm-hmm they're with me they
lost the connection for it for some
reason
come on Google there we go
and I need to log into it so what I'm
opening now is the developer section of
the whole and so every single Harlan's
comes with these tools so this is now I
could you know shut down the whole and
from the web browsers ever want it to so
the first thing I can do is I can show
you what if you weren't here in the
first session this is just a bit of fun
and there you go so now you can see what
I see right so before we play some stuff
someone got googly eyes you know there's
a there's a space hat there space helmet
I think the monkey still here oh there
is hello yeah so there's a few things
around the room for the first session
right what I really wanted to show you
is this 3d view so as you can see it
moves completely in sync with what I'm
doing right if I move my head and if I
move around the space it'll actually
start moving around as well so that's
well nearly you know there but I can
update the spatial mapping and then
it'll show you what has been mapped so
far give it a sec did you do to do so
you go so that's the first sort of Bro
of it to find out went over here don't
worry won't hurt
all I'm doing now is just forcing the
spatial mapping so just you can see that
it works okay just to get a little bit
more in the room so we just get a few
more than this the first row so the
range on this is only about 4 or 5
meters right so that's why I'd only got
the first row when I was standing over
here using it if I update it now we
should get more people there you go you
can zoom in a little bit as well hey
with that more people and to make it
really creepy we do first-person view
you can see you
so that's that's how good the spatial
mapping is you can see is not super
super detailed but it's good enough so
you can easily see what's the chair
what's the floor what's the ceiling you
know people even there's no action
method right now to identify people okay
we'll just do that again so that's the
model it builds up you can save this
model on your device if you want it to I
just put in there and you know games
like fragments will save the spatial
room that you're in as the playing area
so you can come back to it you can also
use it for invalidating you can update
it for more freaking use more battery
all this other stuff but that's that's
where you work with and that's where you
place your Holograms in so that's what
the the debt the device knows is all of
that model that you build up yes yep
it's a very good question actually that
reset the service in town because that
was very important when you develop you
probably won't have you might have one
whole as device you probably like unless
you said all that I'll talk to the was
he you know he left I think they have 10
devices you can take and map a room and
you can import that into the emulator so
you have that room in the emulator it's
still running going to show you here
there's some tooling on the side here in
emulator where you can load rooms go
room here you can load a room it comes
to fault with five rooms that when you
install the M&amp;amp;L you get these five rooms
but you can just have your own as well
which means that as a development team
you can all work in the same room which
could be a real room you met so that's a
very good question you can't do that
alright so we don't run out of time
again
go okay did you so that was there's a
lot more to the developer board there's
a lot of different tools you can use for
testing and for you know um performance
tuning and all that stuff making sure
you don't crash the device but let's
look at testing and the main thing
you'll be doing is what's called
environmental testing because it's yes
you can write unity unit tests and you
can test your code that way but testing
it on the actual device is really hard
which is why this comes into it and
there's no this is again they said at
least Microsoft has kind of put out as a
guidance but there's no right or wrong
in what you test in terms of environment
it depends on where you expect people to
use it if for example this the the
shtetl app they use that it's very very
loud well you probably don't wanna have
voice control but you don't want to
voice commands maybe if you do you want
to test in that environment that they
work but something I lied because we
know sunlight is going to screw it up
because sunlight is UV and that screws
up the spatial mapping sick part of it
which is why it goes really haywire
mirrors are really interesting because
it bounces off either they come and they
sit out from the wall or you can goes to
go through mirrors have really hard
windows don't exist they just holes so
there's a few things like that you need
to understand your environment if you
have colored light what happens if you
have a green light or blue light or red
light like wherever you use it you might
use it in a laboratory where you can't
have bright white light or maybe you can
sound a big noise I said before you
really want to test where you're using
it if you have voice commands that are
crucial for the experience user movement
it's like user testing on web or any
kind of like users will do crazy
right
they will type in yes my name is you
know little bobby drop tables or
whatever the same with movement users
will do all sorts of weird crazy stuff
so you need to test this really well
make sure that whatever the users do
it's okay
and then physical environment this is
hard because you don't actually know
where people are gonna use it like you
don't know the actual physical
environment of what it's going to look
like at the time people are using it but
you can have maybe some estimates around
it but something if you were going to
place something on the wall what if the
wall is curved is
still gonna sit there is it gonna float
out it's not going to work those kind of
things that are not natural to us as
developers necessarily because we're
used to flat screens and code but
there's this list is pretty good and
there's a you know the website there
that gives you a lot more about
environmental testing one thing I do
want to show you is this perception
simulation and this is one way that you
can kind of automate what people do with
what a person would do sorry and I'll
I'll show you how it works so I've got
you need a slide that says I'll show you
how it works so we have this little
project you and I just need the we're
gonna run it on the emulator so I just
need the network address right there
cause that oh sorry I took to run Monday
night my bad that one
go oh of course I missed yeah so what
this does is that connects to the
emulator this is why needs the IP
address and then you can you create
what's called a perception simulation
manager and it's the perception
simulation as and we're simulating how
the device is perceiving the 3d world
hence the perception part of it and we
can then use this manager down here and
say something like manager just you know
pretend your whom human you get use your
right hand to perform a gesture which is
home so that's the Blum or head rotate
we rotate our head in some rotation
angle or we perform a gesture which is
finger press finger release that's a tap
so all those things you can do and you
can automate this so I'll just run it up
here start it and I'll make sure this
runs give it one sec building building
building mm-hmm oh well still building
there we go and go
right this is the demo God's there we go
so I'm not touching anything right go
come on still not touching anything
think Visual Studio is running out of
resources there you go so that's the
home and then we're home again and then
we tap we see the spatial mapping grid
of the emulator we tap again then we
move our move the head I think it is
remember E and then we tap and we think
we bring up the whole menu again there
we go so you can do stuff like that
completely as a user would the cool
thing is you can do the exact same thing
over and over and over again right as a
user you can never do the same thing
twice that's just impossible but the dis
you can very easy to set up in your
project which I'll go through because
we've got one minute left apparentiy
okay so okay last thing here which i
want to show you is these so you could
say well what's next right these are the
new devices that are coming out or one
of them this is still mixed reality but
as you can see you can't see through it
right it's more like virtual reality
this is called an MRI headset and this
is from a sir there's some from Lenovo
some from HP Dell Samsung probably a
couple others and it still runs Windows
10 it still runs Windows holographic
sorry see that's the wrong with Windows
mixed reality they keep changing it and
it comes with if you ever done the comes
with hand controllers that you probably
know and you can use the same approach
through unity using like building
Holland's app but for these headsets now
this slightly different API is and
slightly different development but that
would probably combine over time and be
the same and the idea is that more
people would buy these because these are
four hundred dollars that's three
thousand dollars but it is tethered
right but it's kind of cool because it
doesn't need any it's got to
environmental cameras on the front so
you can still see your room and you're
still map it and you can use that
spatial mapping inside your app which is
a bit weird because then you can see
your room in
side the via right but that's kind of
the next step that's where it's headed
so I think a lot more people buy these
then we'll buy the hololens
because you know three grand is just too
much but these it's we tried it properly
yesterday because you do need a pretty
good computer which I don't have he
needs like a very powerful graphics card
to run them like any other VR device but
it is it works quite well it's really
convincing especially the hand
controllers and you can it's very odd
you can see him in the experience on the
table and you can grab them even though
you can't see him and you can see him
it's very odd so that was pretty much
all ahead that's me again I'm Microsoft
MEP they give me stickers and stuff I
still have that on here loudest Windows
Phone guy in Australia I'm that guy I
actually have an Android phone now but
that's only three weeks old I Windows
Phone for god knows how many years I'm a
website blog if you want to read more
about stuff like this and other stuff
and I run a podcast called the Dean in
the pain with a guy I've never met
he lives in Alaska I've never been to
Alaska we met through Twitter and now we
have a podcast episode 54 is out this
week and it's anything tick I'm the tech
guy joel is not he's a bean-counter for
a medical facility and he just like
steak so yeah it's kind of cool I
thought I just broke it a bit because we
don't make any money out of it or
anything it's just good fun and I do
girls like causes I have one on Harlan's
development of course um which you
welcome to check out if you don't have a
close-up subscription let me know I do
have some free passes somewhere and
don't forget there's a party tonight
I've been asked to say this again
music by this very excellent jazz
musician that I don't know but
apparently he's very good but come via 6
o'clock I think it's dance so any other
questions before no nothing no all right
get out thanks guys
