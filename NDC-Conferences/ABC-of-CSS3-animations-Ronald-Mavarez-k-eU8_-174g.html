work for Capgemini Salonga as a
SharePoint developer slash dotnet
developer of logic whatever it has code
as you know yesterday we have a party
and I took Mexican hat by mistake or
accident so if you know the owner of the
Hat please let me know so he'll get it
back okay so time to speak about the CSS
now important stuff in CSS animations
you can define X quantity of states
right and then you define of coordinates
let's take you can have a lot of taste
in the middle and then you have the
final state so code you can have X
quantity of a stage that you want to
apply to that particular night mixing
the change that you do to those taste
goes automatically if you say for
example that you use in five seconds and
you have five states you define the
person and then you say I want this
distinct running the 10% of the
animation then the other facts and the
50% and so on yeah you can make as many
CSS properties as you want as many times
as you want and then we changing the
properties change gravely if you are
changing the color from yellow to red so
you will get the orange in the middle so
you know that you changed you know you
don't change color right away there is a
graduate something in the middle so this
is what we see here if you see a soft
part of the animation
they aren't split it into part they have
like this the normal CSS CSS file and
then they have something else called
keyframe in CSS part we have the
animation name which is this one around
selected right now we have the duration
of the animation you say how how long do
you want that animation to last you have
a delay if you want to implement some
delay on it you have the iteration you
can say that you want to run for example
two times three times or affinities like
this this example here and then you have
something that is called timing I'll
explain you afterwards what time image
then we go to the keyframe this is CSS
as well
normally people add this the keyframes
animation another CSS file but you can
have that of course in the same sign if
T 1 which is up to you yes we have the
name of the animation here we have the
state in this case we have the 50 per
second in 100% so if you say that you
want this animation to last for 5
seconds you will run these particles in
the first two and a half seconds and
then the rest of the time will be this
this animation here and what you have
now is out the properties so in this
case we are adding 300 pixels to the
left side and then we are removing those
300 pixels so let's get some action
before looking at the animation is
important that you understand that we
don't have any JavaScript code at all so
all the animation that you will see a
css3 basin the only jQuery code that I
have is the one that is assigning the
CSS class to the green controls when I
click on them and that's all but we
don't have any any JavaScript running
animations here so as you can see here
we have an animation name who is called
this one the animation stationed in the
right side I'll say that it will last
for 5 seconds and then in the keyframe I
say well in your 50% you will do will
add 300 pixel to the left side and then
you will remove them so we click on the
button it runs animation so it's go to
the right because you are adding pixels
to the left and then removing those
those pixel to the left when before
reaching there on the bottom now we go
to something a little bit advanced we
have 4 steps or 4 stage in the keyframe
side here so you can see how we change
the color for 4 for that button and then
we have the animation saying that it's
gonna last for 5 seconds so when I click
here in the left of 5 seconds is
implementing all the colors that I have
in the right side red yellow blue brown
so as you saw there let me click it
click the once again if I want towards
now so you see that the color generally
is not something that change right away
you have song animation then in between
and you don't have to do that the
browser take care of that animation for
you so now we have something tricky we
have five estate in this key frame and
we are changing multiple properties at
the same time while changing the
background color we are changing the
left and then were changing the top so
as you can see here when it reaches 25%
I want the left I want the left part too
to add 200 pixels and I want the top to
be tween zero right and then we change
the top so we are basically doing the
square effect so when I click there so
you see changing colors and changing
positions at the same time probably one
of the CSS properties that you can
implement is called reverse if you do
the reverse is going to run the
animation the other way around so if we
click here you can see how that works
it's exactly the same animation where
that we have seen well now we are using
the reverse property we have a another
property that is called alternate
reverse and in this case I'm adding the
iteration count so you can have that in
the in the in the your hand properties
or you can have them in their own
properties that is called animation
iteration count count so we have three
here the reason why we have 3 because
it's called alternate reverse so it's
running in one way then is coming back
and then stay tuned in the normal way so
we click there running in Reverse
then the normal animation and then it
goes back to the reverse once again you
can also have a delay in the animation
so let's say that you don't want data
animation to run right away so if you
define the quantity of seconds and you
have that two times he will understand
that the second one means delay or you
can use the the CSS property directly
that is called animation delay as you
can see comment in the line so I click
there we wait 2 seconds and then it runs
animation
the time mechanism when you are
executing the animation you have
different ways to say how do you want
that to start or to end they will lastly
say exactly the same quantity of time
but you can define if you want that to
start faster or slower than any other
timing thing for example if you see is
it slow fast as a slow start then fast
and then slow Emily and then you see for
example linear is the same speed from
the start to the end this one is with a
slow start a slow end and then slow
start again so if you want to see all of
them at once so you don't have that work
we click in this button here and you see
all of them are starting from the same
from the same place they are ending
exactly in the same place but they are
running the animation in different
different times with different timing
but all thing are using elastic for the
left photo for the same quantity of
seconds yeah and I did something really
easy because I was playing around with
the with animation thing so I was trying
to simulate the leaf effect like falling
from from the tree so you can see here
for example while doing some rotate not
a big deal and we are playing a little
bit with the margin so we put the
element down and go into the back and
right so if I click here it will be able
to see this and then you see it's not a
big deal but you can understand with
that way how how easy is try to
manipulate the the animations the
important thing about animations that
you need to be wise in when when
implementing the we implement in the
animation is your page because you don't
want that to do not want the end user to
take attention to a stop that doesn't
make the most two motions if you have a
lot of animation in your page they will
not read the content they don't have any
constant consultation with the content I
have some examples in my in my personal
website you see has some sample in my
personal website that is marvelous o-net
it's my last name so you go to my
battlenet you will see how I was using
the the animations down there
I guess that we can show some example
with Putin's mouth we don't have
internet here so he's going to take too
long so that's all guys thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
