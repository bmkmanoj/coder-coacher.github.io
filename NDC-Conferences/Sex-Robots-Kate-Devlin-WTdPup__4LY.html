climax of NDC Oslo and I have been
saving up all my best pun for you and so
I think that you are probably here for
one of several reasons it's all the
words sex don't be embarrassed
it's a very interesting topic and that's
fine welcome we're going to talk about
sex you saw the word robots because
robots are also incredibly cool welcome
fans of robots you saw the two words
together and you thought sex or once you
saw the two words together and you
thought or what the fuck and you see how
slow I'm sorry is that a real topic what
is she doing talking about this at a
software development conference it's not
even real well I've got 60 minutes to
try and convince you that it is real and
it's something that's happening and it's
something we need to think about and
I'll give you some examples and I'll
give you some things to mull over but
I'm also hoping that by the end of this
hour you will have your own opinions and
you will tell me them as well so when
Isis dive straight in find any foreplay
go again alright so quite recently
there's been lots of headlines in the
newspapers particularly in tabloid
newspapers they like to sensationalize
they're all about these sex robots that
are coming and this is one of my
favorite titles from the past couple of
months
favorite headlines and of XXX rated porn
online these sex robots could make West
world a reality and I would like to tell
you exactly why that is not true
I mean you've probably already worked
either that's very unlikely so first of
all hahahaha no there's not going to be
an end to porn online if mind geek have
anything to do bite it and mine geek are
the companies that run most of the porn
sites that are right there as an
umbrella company and I'm pretty sure
that they have a high enough turnover
that they're not going to be threatened
for the idea of a few sex robot
get the name right okay it's a lowercase
W in the middle realistic sex robots
powered by artificial intelligence
incapable of forming relationships with
humans are almost here right there are
enough there's nothing all that
realistic about what is out there and
I'll show you some examples so realistic
in that you know they look a bit like a
human might if they were made out of
plastic and that's about as far as it
goes we are not going to mistake anyone
for a robot or vice versa that's a
little bit almost here they're not
almost here there are some prototypes
and developments and there are some
variations on it but we don't actually
have widespread use of these and it's
not terrifying so it's a little bit
terrifying it's not terrifying not yet
it's not but it has a potential to be
terrifying so I want to tell you why
that is
you may recognize some of the ships that
I've got on the screen here these are
actually one of these average from about
30,000 to 12,000 years old they are
phallic objects made from stone bone
antler and find an archaeological sites
and so we know that for that length of
time people have been creating things
that look remarkably like sex toys we
don't know that they were a sex toys and
some very serious academics will argue
that they couldn't possibly be but I
like to think that maybe they were
because you know don't overlook the
obvious they've got we've got the right
shape and so yeah possibly possibly not
but what we see is that we have this
development over time the people are
thinking a lot about sex and of course
they are
because that's how we all got here okay
and I know nobody wants to think about
their parents having sex I don't want to
think about my parents having sex I
would like to think that they sort of
spontaneously evolved from you know
something else but it's a fundamental
goal of human behavior subconsciously to
try and reproduce
whether or not you as an individual want
to do that is a different matter we're
programmed as it we're to replicate we
got some very very long-lived stories
about artificial lovers and artificial
companions and it goes way back to the
ancient Greek and they have stories
about people creating a companion human
either bronze out of wax and having sex
with them they do have that story and so
one of the famous ones is Pygmalion
techne lien was a sculptor who didn't
really like the women that we were
hanging around his house hanging around
two streets outside and saw them as
being kind of loose morals and not good
enough for him so he created his own
perfect woman out of ivory brought her
to life with a kiss and then and then
had a relationship with her that's not
the first story it actually goes back
even before that there was a story about
a woman whose husband died died in the
Trojan Wars and she was distraught they
hadn't been married very long and the
gods being the Greek god said you can
have him back for three hours which you
know it seems a bit unfair but that's
what Greek gods are like and so she got
her husband back for three hours and
then when he had to go back to the
underworld she was absolutely distraught
so she created a replica husband I'd
have bronze and we know from the text
from this legend that for this myth
rather that she took this bronze statue
to bed and she did what was said
interacted with it so something was
going on and we know it was something
pretty bad well pretty bad pretty good
for her we know was something pretty
good because a servant saw her and
someone's her dad awkward who rushed
into the room and you know she was a
servant was worried she was having an
affair and he it'll it didn't end
happily so the father burnt the bronze
figure on a fire she threw herself onto
the fire afterwards this sets up stories
years upon you
years of dystopian stories about how you
shouldn't get involved with a sex robot
and we see it time and time again we see
it in one of the earliest films
metropolis where we have the robot Maria
who is very sexy performs exotic dances
but not good not good doesn't end well
we see it in with a disembodied AI like
in demon seed where the computer that
controls the house is able to impregnate
the woman and create their own child or
in spawn so we have all these horror
stories about what it's like if you step
outside that realm of human
relationships we have robots all rynders
today and robot is just a machine that
can automate certain actions and we have
domestic robots like Roomba we have
factory line production robots we have
surgical robots that can perform surgery
even better than humans can and we have
emotionally available robots ones that
you can sort of interact with companion
robots that kind of thing but we don't
of course have any robots that are
self-aware and of course as arguments in
the AI community about whether or not
that will ever happen and I sit on the
fence quite nicely there say that it
could happen but I don't think I think
if we do find eventually get machine
consciousness I don't think it's going
to look like human consciousness so so
the fray is we have these robots are
being integrated more and more into our
lives of course the robot doesn't have
to have artificial intelligence in it
and AI doesn't have to have a body it
can be it can just be software and we
see that people are actually quite
comfortable interacting with this in
fact sometimes they don't even know that
they're interacting with artificial
intelligence because it's just taken for
granted or it comes across as being
quite human like chat bots on websites
and we know that with the sales the rise
in sales of digital personal assistants
people are really come
all talking to machines in natural
language you'll probably have seen over
the past couple of days seeing pepper
wandering around pepper the robot this
is a little clip from London
so pepper is designed to be very
appealing to us as humans pepper has big
eyes make a stink of children quite an
emotional thing it has little and
calling it he already I'm gender and
pepper already pepper has a kind of a
high-pitched voice pepper moves by in
kind of not very nice natural fluid
human ways so we have characteristics of
of human beings in the in the form of
that of that robot and that's something
that's really compelling for us to
interact with so naturally because we
see those traits and psychologically
subconsciously we respond to the
human-like characteristics so we have
different classes of robots we have
robots that don't look anything like us
they just look like machinery and we
have humanoid robots like pepper where
there are human characteristics but
they're not realistically human and then
we have the Android and the gynoid which
are this very human-like realistic
robots the Android being the male the
gynoid being female if you want to
gender your robots and people do so
let's pepper Lo and pepper first reached
markets there was a bit of concern
because it turns out that in peppers
contract which is shown here in Japanese
I don't read Japanese unfortunately but
I have a translation it says loosely
translated you should not use pepper for
acts for the purpose of sexual or
indecent behavior or for the purpose of
associating with unacquainted persons of
the opposite sex okay pepper is a
passion killer and you are not allowed
to do that if you do that avoids the
warranty okay no sex with pepper but you
know this is think clearly someone has
thought about that someone is
considering that if you have to write it
into your terms and conditions that's
what I worry it's also quite a
heteronormative saying you know opposite
sex you know there's no there's no
severe side side of this this man woman
relationship man woman man robot robot
release
so what is actually out there in terms
of sex robots it's depressing really
depressing but they are in existence at
about 40 companies worldwide making what
they call sex robots and pretty much all
of them are making silicone poseable
figures of women they are not robots in
that they don't really move under their
own steam they can react they can mix
light movements but you can't they can't
walk of course because that's one of the
most difficult things for robots to do
they you know they do respond some of
them and they have voices that can you
can trigger feedback from them one of
the ones that came out a few years ago
was just Roxy true companion and Douglas
Hine the guy who makes it says he's got
you know thousands of orders for this
but amazingly no one's ever seen the
finished version other than the
tradeshow model so we're not sure if
he's actually producing these but I've
got a little video to show you and it's
quite a intellectual videos quite oh not
just the robot I'm Anthony laser from
asylum calm and right behind me at this
very moment inventor Doug arrived is
introducing the world to the rock okay I
can do that he she says not knowing how
to do this
okay let's start on again calm and right
behind me at this very moment inventor
Douglas Heinz is introducing the world
to the rock be true companion what he's
shouting at the world's first sex robot
this is a multi-year project and we have
been spending many many years working on
perfecting her lot seats for companion
is itself to the robot seeing as a
computer touch sensors pressure sensors
throughout her body
so Bernsen device hundred year and
luckily hands it is watch what's the
hope you enjoyed this is not just a sex
toy this is a companion we dealt with a
psychologist understand what makes a
strong bond between two people and this
is a very minor part in that equation
I'm sorry gracias and summer
in a place you can set that hand there's
different ways you can stimulate a woman
intial actually really the largest sex
of argument every person has the brain
right so that's the hardest challenge
for us is to provide the artificial
intelligence experience where you're
actually conversing and creating
relationship with an inanimate object if
you touch her espera if she was in
frigid feral mode she would probably not
want to do things but we now what would
she tell me if I switched her into skank
mode yes and there is the skank mode
it's called wild Wendy now from an
ethical side say we're talking about a
true companion here would it be cheating
on my significant other to have a Rafi
true companion that's the next only
question and it's up the debate Ken Roxy
made me a sandwich
she cannot make sandwiches she could
tell you to where to go to get a
sandwich it doesn't seem that everyone
here in the crowd is sold on whether or
not this is the true world's first sex
robot Honda well why not you this is
quite possibly the most retarded thing
I've ever seen in my life
the most retarded thing yeah her hands
kind of looks plastic it's kind of
worried about that but I think for
somebody who maybe you know it's
homebound it would be good so Roxy could
be a caretaker in a way I'm impressed
and you look great really yes what was
the most impressive thing about a deal
oh I don't know I just thought it just
it looks really fun you know yeah fun
for like interactions like you talked
about before see does it look fun to
bang as well a little bolt would you
ever want to have sex with it
if she was nice to me beforehand and she
let me cuddle her after definitely not
just imagine a motor attached to a
person's appendage that's what they're
effectively doing when you're engaging
with her but the very erotic engineering
it sounds like it if she was my wife
would she keep the last name true
companion or could we - eight okay so a
number of kind of disturbing things
coming up there I mean not least the
whole sexist angle even jokingly you
know it's not actually not funny because
this is what we've got this is what
someone has decided as sex or what she
look like okay so if you're a straight
man even though I'm feel sorry for you
this is what you've got the that was
sort of supposed to be the world's first
but the one that you've probably heard
about is the real doll and real dollar
company called best creations out in
California and they have a workshop
where they create these silicone dolls
as an articulated metal skeleton inside
and they don't market these as sex
robots they market them as love dolls so
people who are buying them they say
you're buying them for companionship it
just so happens you can also have sex
with them but they recently have have
come up with a system called Harmony AI
so they've got a doll that has AI in it
quite limited that can respond to you so
I'll just give you a little clip of that
or will I
why don't do it like that and it'll all
go terribly wrong
Oh
Oh
how do you feel about sex 6 it's one of
the most fascinating things in the world
I don't think there's anything wrong
with grip neither do wine there yeah so
that's kind of where we've got to in in
the kind of state of the art of sex
robots is this new release now you can
buy your own if you have about ten to
fifteen thousand dollars to spare okay
so if they don't come cheap
I'm hopefully I'm going out there next
month to to have a tour of the workshop
and chat to them because I'm writing a
book about it at the moment and this is
this picture I took in the Museum of sex
in New York and they had two of them on
display and they had immediately have a
male one as well the male ones are
marketed towards women are men but they
mostly bought by gay man no these these
dolls you can have your choice of up to
42 different types of nipple I don't
actually know if the nipples come in
pairs or she can have one that's
different from the other I'll ask that
when I'm right there but so what they
did in in the Museum of sex they had put
body parts on display so they had they
had the meal torso and female torso I
think from a bite necklace I and the
curator there at the time Sara Forbes
was saying that they got absolutely
trashed so that it was the female one
that was getting trash it was like
people mauling out them but the thing is
this is one of the objections that there
is is that it would be detrimental to
women that the if you treat a robot
badly you would probably treat the woman
badly in real life but in this case
you're you're inviting people to touch
in a museum then your people are going
to touch and it goes for any museum
display so I'll get more into the
argument later on about the
objectification but I think in that case
that it's really just that people were
very very curious and wanted to feel
what it was like and it's it's it's a
soft silicone
it doesn't stand up to that much abuse
the people who buy these take very good
care of them last year in December I ran
a conference in London called love and
sex with robots I didn't come up with
the name comes from a title of a book by
David Levy who is someone who's been in
AI for many many years
and this is the second conference that
had run and David Levy and the adjuvant
iakh run the first and I got involved
because it got banned that when they
tried to run at the first time so they
were running it in Malaysia or
Adrienne's lobbies and the Malaysian
police said in their way if you go ahead
with this conference we will arrest you
I mean that's not that three interesting
because Malaysia is an incredibly
conservative country so they decided
they'd move the conference to London to
a university in London and that
university said no we're not hosting it
either at which point I thought reported
and I thought well I work in one of the
most laid-back universities in the UK
it's incredibly progressive very radical
so I said to my managers is it ok if I
run it right yeah of course fine it's
like yes we're bringing sex reports to
London so in October of last year we
issued a press release that said very
factually what this conference has been
banned we're bringing it to London it's
an academic conference and it's for
people to talk about law ethics
technological developments implications
all that kind of stuff for use we get
headlines the top one
within days of putting out the press
release the arse of putting out the
press release suddenly within the
newspapers that we were running a sex
festival so I was getting phone calls
going can we come and see your sex
robots at your sex festival so you're
going to be so disappointed so we got so
then we know we got we invited people
along we invited the media to come along
and see for themselves and we ended up
with 50 academics and 40 journalists out
this
which is unheard of in academia and
actually there were some dreadful
reports of it mostly in the kind of
stupider of the tabloids but there were
also there was also some really good
stuff and surprising places
so these are just a couple of headlines
so and the facts
scarily real sex robots to replace women
as man can't tell the difference oh come
on I mean really going like sometimes
like a really Dynamat but seriously
everything you know i stupid and so and
i love this but a sex robot conference
that are highly respected british
university the comms team we love that
bit that we were highly respected sex
robots could reveal your deepest
perversions to complete strangers this
is from a talk i give about theater did
a security privacy did a protection a
bit more on that later but essentially
like anything if you pick the terms and
conditions without reading them you
don't really know what you're sharing
and when it comes to sex robots that did
it is pretty sensitive probably and then
this last one sex robots may literally
fuck us to death okay this actually came
from the very first talk of the
conference an academic called oliver
bundle who was talking about the
potential for AI to go wrong and it's
similar to nick bostrom is paperclip
maximizer it's similar to The Sorcerer's
Apprentice we do a little trick you know
we do a little mistake in the
programming we don't properly halt the
process and it can go out of control not
through consciousness not through
sentience but through sheer bad
programming because it's very difficult
to hard-code all the different nuances
so yes of course if we made a sex robot
who was determined that it's only goal
was to please us and then what happens
when it kept going and keeps going and
keeps going and yes that could
potentially happen so where is it going
now what's happening now where is it
going to go in the future right what's
our perceptions of it all I want to talk
a little bit more about the context
because this is happening it's actually
happening and we need to be able to get
to grips with that and try and shape it
so
start off talking a little bit about sex
technology called Zack Peck for short
and sex pack covers a few different
areas so we've got the hardware huh-huh
we've got the software huh I've got the
content so the hardware here is an
example in the top left this is a sex
toy but a company called mystery vibe
and it's a it's a vibrator called the
crescendo and it's malleable you can
twist it into lots of different shapes
along one axis which is really good
because it's personalizable you can
customize it to what you want and it can
be used by men it can be used by women
it's a very accessible piece of
technology and it's and it's great it's
a and it's a London startup and they've
only given up going a couple of years
that have made this and we actually see
quite a few startups and I working in
this area working in sex tech the one on
the right this is an app called field
and it is an app that's used if you want
to find partners if you want to find
someone for a threesome if you want to
meet up well it's like a hook-up app
basically but specifically in couples
looking for someone to join them in sex
and then got VR porn on the bottom left
there so the are porn disappoints me for
a number of reasons mostly because the
virtual reality you've got no physical
limits right first reality you can do
anything and be anything and what do
they do they do really bad regular porn
and that's so disappointing there is a
market there and trust me there's more
money in VR porn than there are is in VR
games honestly so the sex tech market is
worth about thirty billion dollars
worldwide it's expected to increase to
about fifty billion dollars in the next
two to five years so the most well-known
aspects of these sex toys and a lot of
them on.i Internet of Things sex toy
smart sex toys so it covers all aspects
and I think it also covers sex robots so
I see sex robots as falling under this
umbrella with the sex robots the
implication is
that someday they will have autonomy
they will be able to move on their own
and probably have some form of AI in
them as well so the idea is that you
will have a responsive robot and in the
future it could be a sentient one yeah
not way off my thing thinking is does it
need to look human I think there's
massive problems and having a very like
hyper realistic human I don't think we
have to go down that path so before you
say like who the hell is going to get
attached to a robot people get attached
to robots already we have companion
robots we have care robots so here we
have Cali presence machine in the
hospital
we have pero has anyone seen para before
yeah familiar with para para was a
little cuddly sea cub and when you
cuddle pero makes little kind of little
noises and whiskers move and you can
vibrate some stuff but very very cute
right
and so it's like having a pet that has
the therapeutic benefits of holding a
pets and pyro has been trialed in
nursing homes in in Japan and um people
form attachments to pyro people form a
bond and then that scary-looking
creature down at the bottom left that
that's robear here's a carer what that
can lift and carry people and quite
frankly I would not want anywhere near
me if I was killed so people get
attached we know that people get
attached to inanimate objects all the
time we see children with toys that they
are really attached to we see some
people get a little overly attached to
their cars I am incredibly attached to
my phone okay I'm you know not in love
with it but I can't have it out of my
sight so we know that people do form
bonds with technology okay you probably
don't want to get that close to power
but you could you could form a loving
and intimate relationship with it now
the fact that power is an animal is a
bit distasteful that's a whole separate
issue because what happens then if
people make these robots in the form of
something we don't want them to have sex
with like an animal like a child and
it's a big argument in the campaign
there is a campaign against sex robots I
don't like giving it the oxygen of
publicity because it's one person
getting really
angry and she doesn't need any
encouragement but essentially the worry
there is things like if someone makes a
sex robot that that perhaps looks like a
child like I'll get once I've got a bit
more on that later on so a best to make
real doll have said that the people who
are buying these dolls
they've been purchased but for
therapeutic reasons so by a nursing
Association by people who have been
through illness by burn victims people's
parents buying them for the socially
excluded children lots of different
therapeutic uses that will kind of help
integrate people into an intimate
relationship the the thing about the
therapy angle and yeah the people who
are buying the real dolls at the moment
are really caring for these dolls I've
got clip coming up someone with that and
and they do those of this one of them
has said that he bought it with his wife
because his life can no longer have sex
and so they bought this robot together
they bought this doll together and so
the stories of people have about their
attachment is really really quite strong
and this is a guy called Dave cut I've
been tattooing on Twitter for a while
he's a very funny for a ticular nice guy
and he owns two of these dolls that he
treats as girlfriend's and he will dress
them and he will pose them and walk
around with them and yes have sex with
them and but he just seems incredibly
fine with it when he talks about it he's
not he knows the dolls he's not filling
himself into thinking they're definitely
alive or anything so little clip here
which seems to show a relationship he
hasn't she I can do this this is why the
robots will never take over we can't
even get them you should to be honest I
mean we are still extremely supportive
of each other I love her completely and
utterly and she's exactly the same way
about me she can actually really enjoys
foot rubs that's probably one of her
favorite things and
she thinks her feet are like one of her
investing cutest assets and I'm inclined
to agree I think people think having a
synthetic partner is strange because
it's just so out of their realm of
possibility
that's for instance why I had the
psychologist come around and I spoke
with him for a bit is there a part of
you that thinks this is peculiar I just
think it's a matter of time before more
people are choosing the synthetic option
Dave she can't see yeah and she can't
hear yes one of the most fundamental
elements of an addiction is it provides
relief from pain yes what's the pain
here ah the pain I would have to say
would be loneliness really it makes you
feel good and and it's fulfilling for
you exactly and it doesn't hurt anyone
exactly so knock yourself out yes I get
it the relationship I have with Shi Chun
is formed by happiness you know if I
play along and pretend that she can see
she can hear that sort of thing well
that's what makes me happy you know
that's what makes me happy so I really
see no reason to change I placed an
order at the tail end of last year for a
second doll her name is going to be
Elena Elena Foster Cova she'd always the
wife Elena is the live-in girlfriend
it'll be a modern family the thing is I
really actually I like that idea it's
not hurting anyone he's gotten a lot of
happiness from this I'm sure are we to
judge him for that
like everyone my slides gift
you probably remember the Sony AIBO the
little dog and people got attached to
that to the point where after they being
gone through all the repairs they could
possibly do and they'd reached the end
of the lifecycle in Japan where funeral
services held for them and we know that
I mean that's not unusual weather so
there's a researcher called Julie
Carpenter who for her PhD research
detachment to military robots and find
that soldiers we're bonding with their
bomb disposal robots for example and
there's an anecdote that when one of the
bonds of bomb disposal robots was
wrecked they had a funeral for it like a
proper military funeral because it was
part of their lives part of their team
and they felt close and a lot of
soldiers will name their robots we're
especially with the wives and
girlfriends names as well so you know we
all got the tamagotchi effect it's a
known effect that people get attached to
the little Tamagotchi pets used to have
which quite a lot of people just tried
to kill a bit like playing The Sims
right you just just lock them in a room
on that and starve remember I didn't so
you know we know that and we know that
that people do get attached to this
technology David Levy who wrote the
books that sort of brought all this to
the public attention he has this very
dystopian of a utopian vision of where
this is going to go now David and I are
roughly on this inside when it comes to
thinking that these things are okay
although he's much more optimistic than
me and on a much shorter timescale so he
says many who would otherwise have
become social misfits socialite cast or
Murray even worse I'm not sure what the
worst is well instead be better balanced
human beings the world will be a much
happier place because all those people
who are and I'm miserable will suddenly
have someone I think that will be a
terrific service to mankind okay
mankind right I know you have more on
that too because this is the thing
you're marketing it's being made by man
for man so the near future was the
negative side of things as I said
earlier there's worry that and this
could lead to
people making childlike robots and just
currently a kiss going through the
Canadian courts where a man ordered a
childlike doll from Japan no history of
pedophilia under the court no deciding
whether or not that constitutes child
pornography no in many countries it's
illegal to even met computer-generated
images of child abuse and rightly so but
there may be an opportunity here and it
can go two ways one of the arguments is
that it could be used as a proxy so we
know that virtual reality has been used
to treat sex offenders it was a study in
the university of montreal where
rehabilitated sex offenders were put in
a virtual environment with triggers of
arousal and they were monitored to see
how they responded so maybe we can do
this
where's the sex robot maybe we can see
as a sex offender after rehabilitation
responds in the same way or maybe it's a
form of proxy maybe it's okay because
that's about labs but then again the
argument opposite argument is this whole
idea of the gateway hypothesis the
escalation that if you give someone the
chance to you know have sex as a
childlike doll they're more likely to go
on and commit an offense in real life
the two sides are at loggerheads there's
no right or wrong answer it falls under
the same kind of argument as do computer
games make you violent is watching porn
and escalation to abusive women and both
sides have got data and there's nothing
you know you can prove either
there's not one conclusive argument over
all what two months ago there was an
out-of-court settlement of a smart sex
toy so there's a vibrator you could
connect it online it's called We Vibe
and we vibe these separators was they
were collecting dear to every minute of
use and sending it to the manufacturer
okay now there's nothing like unusual as
you know about collecting data about
your product it's how you make about a
product they were they weren't just
collecting frequency of use they weren't
just collecting
mission patterns they were collecting
things like the temperature of the
device but it wasn't even that it was
the fact that they had linked it to the
registered email address so they had not
upheld any other protection on this
product night what if we can stand on
into sex robots is clearly going to be a
problem and after that another smart sex
toy scandal emerged when we find out
that the Simon vibrator which is a
vibrator with a camera on the end these
things exist right Dildar comes exist oh
yeah it puzzled me at first but there
you go anyway it was fun if you were
close enough you could hack the stream
of the video no this is a there is a
there's a white hat hacker right there
doing work to try and check for these
kind of vulnerabilities and sex toys and
he has got the what the project is
called internet of dongs and I really
recommend you go and look at it is
fantastic and he is he's actually partly
funded he's had a grant from pornhub but
to try and look for security flaws so
and he's doing brilliant work so who
owns the data and it's a question that
we see with all the products that we
sign up for even if your data is if you
if you're following you know the company
is following good theater practice what
happens long term what happens if the
company goes under it merges what
happens if there's a theater breach like
the Ashley Madison do the breach what
happens if you know you always get
nothing to hide you've got nothing to
fear I just think that's such crap and
you know what happens if you have this
data and you go to a country say where
some kind of Korea's president has
recently taken over and you try to get
in to the country and suddenly they're
finding information about you and that
you're not happy about it
this can happen so even if you're within
the law in your own country what happens
if you go somewhere else with a lot of
different or if they change I mean I'm
living in London and UK is one of them
the most it has the most surveillance of
the citizens anywhere in Europe and yeah
I've got nothing to hide but I'm damn
sure I'm not getting the government half
my data
okay my feminist rant 9 so we know there
is a massive problem massive problem
with women in tech and we know that
they're treated very badly and you know
recently last year artificial
intelligence is called AI as being a sea
of dudes which it absolutely is and
we're trying to get wet better ways of
getting women integrated into it but
this technology the sex robot technology
specifically is being designed by men
for men and the immediate reaction when
you talk about the sex robots is people
saying women don't want that well first
of all women have never had them
marketed to them in a form that they
might like and women are large consumers
of sex toys the sex toy market is
actually certainly in the UK is actually
split pretty much 50/50 a lot of people
assume that women are buy more sex toys
actually it's quite a balanced market so
I think it's problematic and we see it
coming up time and time again we're
getting this constant bombardment of
these sex robots always take the form of
the femme fatale seductive woman and I
pretty sure a lot of you will see next
marketer which is kids because I'll
probably put some spoilers in but ex
machina the the premise of the story
being eventually that that the robbery
ever the robot and is able to use her
feminine wiles together one way now it
has been argued that this is a feminist
film and I don't agree with that I think
that's a very bad portrayal of feminism
for how women get their own way and get
ahead but what I was interested in was
the marketing at all that this was the
u.s. marketing from two mighty inner
petals headed shamlian box Moxley meant
you don't direct sun seems so most
American it would be knowledge sq
missile group hobnob licensing not
excite you get yogurt the total although
America to go away
no it's not here we go okay ah what okay
sorry thank you didn't miss anything was
not for yogurt you owe me that right
there we go okay let's start off with
this to erase the line between man and
machine
now I don't know if you ever notice that
this is one that really pisses me off
because every time I see a constant talk
with man and machine written in it and I
want to punch someone all the kicks are
the letters itching you before the man
to make it fair okay
I never watch at home but it sounds
matter if you see my other machine yeah
well then you're excluding 51 percent of
your audience so to raise the line
between mono machines
man and gods
over the next few days you're going to
be the human component that's earning
tax day the hey eyes and look back on us
and when we look at fossil
I didn't feel better off bench amazing
you're in breakfast yeah you won't in
Japan of course now the question is how
does she feel about you you think
together did you give her sexuality as a
diversion tactic this is your insecurity
talking does not give in to let you know
that I was brought here to test you
that's Ava actually like what she's
defending waking me
we talk about the lies you've been
spinning me north lies
what will happen to me if I fail you a
test
okay so don't get me wrong I think it's
an amazing film I think it's really well
done I think the AI side of things is
portrayed extremely well I just have
some issues but it also raises some
questions and the bit that was in the
trailer why did you give her sexuality
and AI doesn't need a gender she could
have been a grey box and there since
reply I'm not sure that's true can you
think of an example of consciousness at
any level human or animal that exists
without a sexual dimension and that's
how I got into this topic in the first
place I was working on cognitive systems
and we were talking about human-like
computing and we were saying if you're
trying to model the way humans think why
are you not building in some of the real
fundamental goals because if you think
of an AI agent as having goal-oriented
behavior are goal oriented behavior is
about replication conversely if you take
an active view of AI if you're into the
ecological side of it it's about social
behavior and you don't get much more
social and embodied than having sex so
this is what kind of steered me into the
area it's only this year however that
people are starting to take it a little
bit more seriously so what's going to
happen in the distant future okay well
first of all the people who make stock
images are going to get really rich
because every time you see a story about
future AI you get one of these so there
are some good TV shows that talk a bit
about this and one of them is humans in
the UK as humans I think in this in
Sweden it was real humans so we have our
UK version of this and it was really
nice because it talked about moral
decisions of machines can we program a
machine to have love and affection and
care you know in this case there was a
better part the technological divide
because in this picture you see this man
has just lost his own companion robot
because it is malfunctioning and he gets
given us like a state care robots who's
really basic and strict and firm so I
can see like a two-tier system where you
know if you've got social healthcare you
get the really basic one and if you've
got private health care you get the
really glamorous one so we do have a
digital divide that is happening and we
know that and it's only going to
continue along this route
in the lower picture there's a robot sex
worker called Niska and she she kills a
man she kills one of her clients because
she doesn't agree with his sexual
practices so it does really a lot of
interesting questions around that so
what happens then if we have robots that
can think at what point we need to
consider consent at what point to
consider rights because well if we can
you know will we even recognize
consciousness we don't even recognize
recognize that much consciousness in a
lot of animals we're getting more and
more awareness of the level of
consciousness and animals you think of
something like an octopus you know
there's like the stuff that capable off
is quite incredible I stopped eating
octopus sign with beer can even though
pigs are really smart okay so you know
what happens do we do we have to program
you know if we there's lots of ethical
dilemmas this is where the philosophers
get really excited because you know it
should be could we program a machine
that is designed purely to love us and
to please us should we have it built-in
so that it doesn't have to you know it
could consider and they could withdraw
consent should have the right to its own
sex life or the right to family life I
know it sounds really far-fetched but if
this happens we have to think about it
can machine to love us is it enough for
us to love the robot and the robot to
react to us as if it loves us because
machines can't love us yet if ever so is
it enough just to get that response back
is that enough for us to feel attached
to feel rapport with the Machine why do
they have to look human so I don't think
they do and I think that there's a
problem with these real dolls and the
like is that they there's like really
strong uncanny valley effects so the
uncanny valley the closer something
looks to human the wider the gulf is the
more repulsed we feel because it's not
properly human and there are lots of
psychological theories as to why that is
one of them being it reminds us of death
so it's a taboo so I think we should be
moving in new ways we have got amazing
materials at our disposal we have smart
fabrics we have conductive paint we have
soft robotics we have so many things
that we can play around with and why are
we doing that instead
to make interesting things and that's
why I ran the sextet hack back in
December it was the youth UK's for a
sextet hackathon since then there's been
one in Paris and there's been one in New
York and we got I had a curve envision
ten people in a room sawing up vibrators
and my students you're amazing went oh
no no no we're gonna get a hundred
people and we're going to do this
subscribe
actually we've got fifty in the end we
had we had about 150 applicants and we
selected about 80 and 50 turned up
supporting teams working on innovative
sex toys and sex tech and we had
absolutely no limits and what they could
do it was held in a converted Church I
went down well with the newspapers and
to a few just before Christmas so we had
a wonderful time and this is a little
snip of snippet of what was what it's
like
okay so it's happening again this year
it's going to happen in December the
16th and 17th as far as I know we'll be
opening applications soon and I'm going
to give you a link at the end where I
ask you for ideas and if you want to
find out more about that you can sign up
to our mailing list but essentially the
whole idea was that taboo should not
stifle innovation so if I can just show
you a little one of my students who
helped run it Kevin but the core
question around the prevent that we
posed was should have you stifle
innovation we think absolutely not
events like this are really cool can we
get a bunch of really passionate people
in the room give them a challenge and
then just see what they can build and as
long as everything's respectful sex is
something that happens we should be
absolutely free to just talk about it
mostly very porterie stuff on tech
technologies especially that I heard
some people are doing exploring sound as
a part of sexuality and in that form
with the music and that's our source I
think it's going to be a lot of
interesting projects which explore that
stuff in unseen ways not just do those
and sex toys but more in a broader sense
and for how that could come in with
technology in computer science one of
the really interesting things about
hackathons is it allows people to
explore a bunch of ideas in a really
short amount of time quite often the
process of creating hard when creating
software of any kind is quite a long one
and what this allows us to do is not
only try out new ideas but also try
ideas that are terrible in a short
amount of time it's they're also good
for learning from failures so I was so
sure you'd want to know I'm running out
of time no I just wanted to show you
something
think relax we got lot surprises we had
sex toy companies doing it a lot of
prizes which was great as well and it
was a really fun event and we kept it
very very diverse very fair right equal
it was a by promoting tolerance it was
about having fun and sharing things the
winning team was a team working on soft
robotics and they created this thing
called love part and love pad was a
silicone breast that you could
manipulate and squeeze and it drove
little tentacles that could curl around
your body and it was it was so cool it's
done by air blowing into into tubes
just a little example of that I think it
doesn't it can work on different times
and if you try to understand when you
wish you would go around that breath but
if there could be an obnoxious in I
think you feel the vibration is about a
Chinese culture the kind of death royal
experiences in seven so this was
supposed to all be inside Wamba so
really cool stuff we had someone with a
team that made a sexual cryptocurrency
where you had two stimuli at a physical
wallet in order to generate your coin
surface the idea being that you could
pay attention to money or you could pay
attention to people but you couldn't do
books we had someone else created a
vibrator vibrating fest which read stock
market dinner so you could literally
write the system it was there were lots
of radical things so we're human in a
world that's like increasingly full of
machines and we can't escape that where
these things are all happening around us
we're working into nowhere into an age
of automation and we need to work with
technology it's being integrated into
our lives we can try banning things but
bombing things never works prohibition
never works and the stuff is coming and
we need to shape it and if we can get in
and steer it in the direction we want
before say the big the porn industry
gets hold of it the porn industry have
done some wonderful technological
developments but I would like to see
this feared in a different direction so
this is happening and I think we should
try and shape it in the way that we want
I would love your thoughts I would love
your ideas I've put up a forum it's just
through the quick forum about you know
some of the stuff I've talked about but
also specifically asking you what do you
think we could do have you got ideas do
you want to join our sex tape is on
going to find out more so if you go to
intimacy comm /dc ozlowe you can do that
and you can also join the mailing list
for our hackathon but I hope now in the
past kind of 50 minutes that I've
actually you know I may not have
convinced you that this is a really good
thing you might have your own opinions
but I do want you to think that it is a
serious thing okay with a lot of fun but
that it is something that is happening
it's not
a throwaway word and a newspaper
headline this is stuff with real-life
implications and hopefully one way or
another you can see the pros and cons of
it thank you happy to check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
