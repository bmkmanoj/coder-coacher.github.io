mean it means a lot to me obviously it's
my second talk on NBC and I'm still very
nervous the first time that was last
year so just bear with me bear with me
be easy with me anyway
my name is Kristen PETA that is my
twitter handler having a software
developer for around 17 18 years old now
and this talk is designed for developers
and it's about something that I learned
recently in the about 1/2 years 3 years
ago and changed my life drastically in
the way that I do my daily work and it's
very sad because I felt sad with myself
that I didn't discovered that before I
was because one day I just put sit down
with my partner she's about the
scientist and she started doing some
crunching numbers I was I hate that
looks really nice what is that and I
just discovered that I being an idiot
all the time ignoring that so it's about
that it's about people that have no idea
about no books specifically Jupiter
notebooks and title notebooks that they
discover that experience and return to
work and start using in their daily work
because while you check any data
conference any research conference in
the last year you will see always one or
two thoughts about Jupiter notebooks I
had no see developer conferences when
they introduced that to developer and
that's the reason of this talk to
understand why this is so great we have
to understand that it's about workflow
some of the steps that we do a1 all over
again every time that we are going to do
the same thing for example how many of
you are donuts or C++ developers in
Windows you see that dialog box so many
times in your life it doesn't matter
what you're going to do you are going to
create a new project you see this file
news you want to learn a new framework
you see this file nail you want to learn
next sharp you have to see this file new
with the char plugin to see new F sharp
project and it looks like of something
very small but the problem is that I've
been working as a technically for the
last five years and I have to do a lot
of the spikes trooper concept and
develop algorithms for the things that
we do and I got tired of this it's not
only need one of one radar writer the
idea from dead brains was announced one
of the features that they said is that
file new project was completely empty
just think about that right now
everything that you do this this create
a new project a scaffold and you play
with so many things that probably you
will need all you want and once you
create a project the cycle is exactly
the same you write a code experiment
you compile the code you execute the
code sometimes you cry and you repeat
from the beginning you just want to
learn how to do a hello world to just do
a print hello world how many of you
learn programming doing print hello
world exactly and it happens all the
time
that print sentence of print s is one of
the saviors of debugging for every one
of for all of us because three is too
fat for things like this a cliff say
it's too fat and all let me start with
NetBeans so now we live in a new world
the war of code editors we have things
like atom we have things ideas code
just imagine Microsoft is so conscious
about this that they create a tool named
vs code because I said these are stairs
too fast and if in the last two years
it's incredible all the extensions and
things and and people using the
Coldfoot their daily work in my case I
have not opened a full IDE in a while
it's just editors the next generation of
data happens since a few years ago was
the creation of what we call interactive
interactive rebels or something like
that and the best example Internet is
limpa and it was one of those things
that's so simple that you just like wow
I don't need now to create a whole
application we file new project to just
press this NuGet package to just check
this algorithm works to just experiment
a little with link and f-sharp and I
love link that for teaching I love the
impact for for education it's just it's
amazing it is so much using educational
partitioning stuff that you can download
templates that are designed to go step
by step so you learn a new thing
f-sharp link reactive extensions things
like that the character where you make
it so nice is the fact that you don't
have to deal with things like msbuild
you just write code at the top and you
see the execution and the output at the
bottom so much like that that you can
create your own viewers you can extend
the impact and we can show plots you can
show graphs you can show so many other
things that are not your stables so it
was expensive all and many people love
the impact I lovely impact but there was
another problem and is live
documentation or documentation let's say
that in your workflow or once you are
learning things you just need to take
notes this is important because you are
learning something you are discovering
something I just have to show this to
your boss if you are lucky you probably
have to deal with things like you
already discovered Magda and you use
markdown to tell
notes very easily at things like that
subtly in research or in most office
environments Magda is a luxury and you
have to deal with things like Microsoft
Word but I'll in life really bad to
display code so most of the time what
you have to do to create the report for
your boss if writing Microsoft Word or
even modern if you are looking see the
snippets of code that you have copied
the snippets of code pasting my bank and
it will be rendered as code pasting
nitrous of what I'm pray to God that it
would show the highlighting and justice
and hopeful cycle because there is this
disconnection between what you are doing
in your code and what you are trying to
show in fact the other problem is that
how you are going to track those changes
how you are going to show those things
with your colleagues to your boss
how you are going to request those
revisions most of the time what you do
is that you attach that document in your
email or if you are lucky you are used
something like Dropbox or even if you
are super lucky you use github and push
push your markdown document and wait
people to get your feedback so far we
have we saw all of those things but
there is something that is not as easy
to solve the code execution remember
that so far what we have now in the
reactor is sub bunch of the scripts or
files or a project a bunch of markdown
documents but say things that you are
doing or trying to explain copy/paste of
that code in that document and you are
asking to somebody in the other side
trust me it works
the source code is over there if you
want you can compile and check but it's
not that transparent you lost that
execution you lost the evaluation of
your code at the same time at the wrong
this is not a new problem this is a
problem that somebody started solving in
two
thousand won his name is Fernando Paris
he is a Colombian who was studying his
eighteen postdoc in Berkeley I think and
you know when you are studying your
poster do you have too much timer you
want to procrastinate as much as
possible and one of the things that he
did was like you know what I don't like
the Python in temperature there is I
think it could be much much better and
he decide to just don't study for his
dissertation the moment and instead
create a set of scripts in 2001 that as
far as I remember was something like two
hundred seventy three lines of code they
are in github as well like in his
account so you can check that you run at
the beginning of your Python interpreter
and he just gives you a lot of nice
things like highlight colorings like you
know color highlighting in your code
autocomplete but also complete at the
evaluation you can see the input and the
output together you can change that
input and output together and that thing
changed everything it was just a big hug
the story says that he just continued
hacking that he eventually finished his
postdoc but little by little he improve
it and becomes what is known as ipython
or interactive Python that now he has
more than 78 thousand lines of code for
those two hundred something that was at
the beginning what he was looking for
was a better way to execute code and is
that back I fightin gave you main things
like inspections at completion of a rich
history what happened better debugging
you can see like the things are
happening where the bugging but still
just an interactive shell it was not
what he wanted but that was the right
way because
he design I hope I don't know many
people with him designer interactive
Python sorry in such a way that was
plausible and all the people who connect
to the sessions that they were having in
fact it's as well one of the advantage
that is that it's completely separated
from the shell is that you can just do
parallel activities you can just have a
Python workers in other machines and
from the shell just put parallel
computing for them to process your
results result from Microsoft that we're
developing the visual studio tools for
Python have a chat with him and he said
like oh yeah it's very simple you know
what there is this protocol to implement
and they were like okay bye
and just two weeks later he just
announced an extension for Visual Studio
Tools for Python they use I Piper
because it was so easy to implement
Perry says that nobody they didn't even
need to say to ask them how to do it
they just did it and watched everything
nice now you we have ideas with that
flexibility and things like that this
was before Rosling by the way but he
says that from the beginning what he
wanted to do is emulate mathematical
notebooks
this is something there since 1998 and
the idea is that because they are
mathematicians they are writing
equations that they need to evaluate a
drawing done he says that he fell in
love with this idea what he was doing
his his pasta because he was he has to
use a lot of octaves a mathematic at the
same time and he wanted to bring that to
Python
little by little it was many years and I
ran 2008-2009 with the help of a few
other companies and people they could
invent that ironpython like ironpython
at that ipython interactive fighter in a
cute console so they have things like
this with the capacity to show you
graphs charts and more information the
same as by things like
solid a knife item with base turrets
somebody has a brilliant idea
what if we put that item in a web page I
mean it's already in cute it's
completely separated for around like
2012-2013 they did it and they call it a
tie not notebooks or ipython notebooks
and it looks like this notice many
things in this documentation this is a
live documentation notice that we can we
have full markdown support for equation
and if that is just markdown render in
different ways suppose latex as well and
the most important thing you can write
code at the code is executed in your
page is interactive and keeps the result
to just can send this to somebody else
and they are going to execute that they
can modify it and see the results this
is so valuable for for research because
if basically you can experiment with no
new things grabbed all the data from
your data sources see in a table a story
and manipulate that information see
immediately what is the result and
everything is in the same document to
see magic that you have the ability in
word to just write something out at the
same time see how things have changed on
the fly an express platter for in 2012
ipython just split and became what is
called Jupiter notebooks this is what we
are going to talk about today because I
pythons ipython is just the Python
kernel for Jupiter noble Jupiter
notebook is is the new thing you can
execute code
see the resources images sound is
extensible you can read the format you
can export whatever you do whole
notebook so you can create a filtering
word for example to gather information
you can reuse notebooks and read
notebooks between them so in that ways
your notebooks will become modules a
more important is a well the latest
version that is Jupiter hope supports
multiple users so you can collaborate
between people and they can see what you
are showing to them and they can get it
at the same time we will just see that
later
it's a politic and one of the things
that I say that is a product that
excites me is that you see the results
as live documentation if things that you
have with you and you are seeing what is
happening this is a very valuable tool
for things like learning languages
learning algorithms learning frameworks
showing experiments of your code to your
colleagues without having to deal with
file new stuff for demo quick demo the
fist first demo today let's see if I can
make the font a little bigger for you
yes
okay let's start from the scratch I have
another demo with our more complex
Nobu but let's say that you are just
starting and want to install your Python
notebook first we create a new visual
environment
this is add something very common
between Python users using virtual
environments it's just a way to isolate
your development from everything else
and now let's install some stuff with it
it's just that simple it's equivalent to
nougatine title you just Pitt install ad
Python all and it will install all the
requirements dependencies for ipython
it's a little big here it's like kind of
fast because I already did that this
morning so it's cash now that we have
here we are the environment we can start
the noble we just ipython notebook and
it will give you a message here I will
explain why that message happens
regarding or talking or something like
that is because security because
remember that now now is a
multi-platform sorry I'm going to use
the system I let's go to that URL
put the font here and this is the
environment that was all it was very
fast to install we will install Python
and will start that the falconer will
talk a little more about kernels later
you have this interface where you can
see your file system because one of the
big difference that we see in ipython
and Jupiter is that you don't need a
database he uses the file system it's
just simple JSON files that contain your
information there is no database to deal
with no weird installations nothing as
you see I did that like super fast if
you are using windows in Windows if you
use Python alone just use pip install
but I recommend using on a conduct that
is something very common between data
scientist I personally don't like
anaconda because the field that is it
has too many things that I don't use but
if you use anaconda Python notebooks is
installed by default with a lightweight
anaconda so let's create our own office
notebook notice that I have something
there saying no book Python - this is
because we are going to see later you
can handle many ok
Jupiter supports many different
languages and they are pluggable you can
just have bash or you can use F sharp or
camel things like that by default is
install only with Python - if you
install Python notebooks in Python 3
obviously the kernel that is going to
appear there is Python 3 let's create a
new notebook in Python 3 and this is
what you see all the time
the title is where you change the titles
put here hello and this thing
yep and now you have what is called
cells you have cell types is where you
type things if you type markdown that is
going to be the first one it it always
Magda so you have titles let's put
something nicer and you will ever way
into madam obviously you can just put
something else and it works nice notice
that you can insert cells at the top or
at the bottom that is important because
it's the ordering of a well evaluation
you are evaluating those cells you can
use the resource for one cell to a
calculation in the bottom by another
cell it's like it's like basically a
nice Excel another thing that you can do
is that you can embed this important the
multum flavor that you use is github
flavored markdown and that's important
for me I don't work in giggle but it's
important for me because most of the
technical documentation that you write
depends on code highlighting and certain
things that the flavor mark down by
github or the markdown the github uses
is designed for those things so that's
the flavor supported by Jupiter
notebooks that give us as well abilities
to do other things like for example
at an equation the equation supporter of
the equation language for the question
is later so that's a later equation and
it will rendered nicely you can edit
what it's already done
just double-click and you don't like the
name of this case I don't know let's put
it I I don't know even what it started
question about I mean I just copy/paste
from somebody else and no mathematician
the same with all the other cells you
can modify that content
another thing is that you can in this
you can embed equations together with
your markdown all together what it uses
is mad jacks
and now you it even looks like you are
an academic or something like that of
course you were not here for seeing like
how to render equation we are here to
see what happened if I put code let's
see
friends Fred I go Valley and I've just
tried to remember things here for I name
and you make friends notice that
immediately put the top for you because
he knows that a spider
it has assistance that this is important
as well for every level stay offer
different facilities some language even
offers autocomplete so it's the same
things that you are used to seeing in
uniform long IDE you have autocomplete
you have a system with a code
some of them like even tell you where
the ear errors and things like that
debugging facilities ping
this is actually a sample I remember I
did it so many times that oh you see he
hasn't fallen for my not print a bigger
on purpose of course another thing is
that you are not subject that just to
the language that you are using you can
see you can execute shell commands for
example to list the content of your
current directory just a pen with a bank
at the beginning and use here will
evaluate that there are options as well
to execute all the languages in the same
notebook for example if you want to
execute something written in bus or
write your own budget script to just
pass bash and write the bash come on
over there if I don't know director is
called
bla bla bla bla pushes my bike the devil
so I'm not really good at it as you can
see and one of the things that I
mentioned as well is that do display
information because it's actually
plausible by default we're supporting
all the people run Jupiter support
Matlock and plotters yeah
Madrid leap and other rendering
libraries in this case we just can
copy/paste this with not roll it it will
just
and you can see the chart done at the
same time I really like disability
because a few months ago I decided to
start learning compression algorithms
about compression so I wasn't really
nice to see a start like writing my
algorithm directly in the notebook
getting an image and see the compression
algorithm how it works I changed their
image
you know instead of just waiting process
fighting Visual Studio and see the
results this was like this is one of the
reasons that I really love it you can
see immediately what is happening over
there you don't have to wait for things
to finish compiling or anything there
are the options that we will see over
there but this in the next demo so let's
continue with my mouse here is again as
you see we I mentioned Jupiter a Jupiter
is just on a split from the guys from
iron pipe drawing ipython or interactive
Python the idea was very simple the idea
is that the people from like Titan are
going to be dedicated just to the kernel
of tighten the handle title while
Jupiter is more about the whole set of
the notebook application that brought
many many advantages because currently
Jupiter is not just Python it supports
dozens of languages last time that I say
was mover 100 languages we are going to
mention here just the beginnings of how
to write your own support your own
language to pour your own plugin for
Jupiter this later because I'm a
developer and I like that type of things
as I said Python ipython is just a
Python kernel for Jupiter Jupiter
support extensions and plugins is easily
it is nice to extend it is amazing it's
like the extension for doing a lot of
things to do to show interactive charts
so maps that just like pull the data
from somewhere else and show other
things etc etc and recently Jupiter hub
allows you to if you have an office or
you work in research or something like
that just installed your Jupiter hop in
the server and you can have multiple
users they will have logins they will
get in they will just collaborate
between them they can handle the
permission of their nobles the execution
permissions you can create read only
Nobles for certain users etc etc settle
everything in a network just imagine
just imagine that this is this is really
important because when we work where I
work we have a data science departments
and most of them are researchers and one
of the things that in the past I used to
call our a with Word documents most of
their ex academics so this speed of life
these Jupiter helps just make everything
so faster and they love it because they
just like working that prototype and can
discuss that with the data engineers
that I'm putting that into production
and things like that and they don't need
to wait to write a paper or anything
like that to make it happen I'm really
really happy of of that change in the
workflow for them and I want to
introduce this more to developers so
they start like doing all their own
despite and ideas as well in such a way
that everybody can see what is happening
it's not a replace for github but inside
I will see that in fact github has a
special support for Jupiter notebooks as
well Jupiter is the tool for that
analysis our research as I was saying
today one of the things that is amazing
that there is no research conference or
data science conference where they don't
mention Jupiter because it's dead - it's
easy to use you can share your
information with other developers is
very well-documented the documentation
or Jupiter notebooks are extends and
it's polyglot it supports many different
languages
so why this is not used by programmers
by developers where the true I don't
know I want to believe that is that you
guys didn't know about it but I really
like it because it additionally to that
we are used to thing in a different way
because we used to thinking things like
composability course needs to be self
documented we want things that are
extensible so we make them we can bend
them to do whatever we want and we want
something is completely open so there's
no problem that somebody's going to sue
me later because I'm ready I'm using
their format well Jupiter Noble is all
of that it's expensive all as I said
it's self documented because the
documentation is together with what you
are doing over there is not a comment
it's proper documentation
it's composable because you can you can
have a notebook that has all your
functions and another notebook that is
where you use those functions and
include it as modules link notebooks and
a good example is extension I will
mention this because in the next demo we
will see it but anyways and the
extensions are kind of not official
extension but officials that actually
brings you new widgets are new
extensions to do things that we didn't
margin which you Peter netbooks and I
will show you a few of those let's
return to the console
Oh
to make everything easy I have docker
image with the kernels that I need we'll
talk a little more about that in a
second okay
this is an installation of p of jupiter
noble with two kernels one in Python I
don't know that with Ruby but it's just
to show you that it doesn't matter you
can have multiple language it's a little
tricky to have two languages working in
the same notebook it was one of the
features that they wanted to add but the
problem that they hit and then they hit
that were very very early is that
languages have no between languages
there is no easy way to tell you what is
the result of the previous operation for
example Ruby's expression base based
language and every expression that you
put has returned tide while Python is
not so they hit that very very early and
they just scratch it but certain kind of
interoperate between them for example if
you especially the Python and are the
art is a language that sounds like the
pirate language but now is a language
are very issues a lot between data
scientists and statisticians and you can
interchange data frames between R and
Python so if you do your analysis in in
I you just can't do the presentations in
Python or totally do besides do the
analysis in in Python crunch the numbers
in Python because in much better to
crunch numbers anga and then display
everything in ggplot in are because you
can't change data frames between those
two languages you know every language
that support that feature but is
possible in our case in this case I
don't know R so I cannot show you that
I'm Python and Ruby the pig don't
interchange code
but I want to show you a few extension
such as I like this very very super
extinction one of the sanctions that I
may watch this it's just to change the
syntax highlighting it was like really
easy to do in just a few minutes so you
can stop the testing thing about the
extensions that we have is that if you
install env extensions instead of this
bunch of extensions that you cannot be
activated activate one of my favorite if
any of you are are in education or
anything like that is exercise basically
exercise what it does is that you can
create a notebook with exercises and the
answers of the exercise and put this in
your Jupiter hot or in github or
something like that for your students to
download the notebook and do the
exercise typical Noble is now using
education a lot because this is just
your students can just experiment and
they have like the questions I
immediately just write the answer and
see if the answer works and with SS is
easy for you to just create those
exercise for your students noting that
they are too is like too common they're
like two they suppose different madam
ice like tip vital meltdown is another
type where you can embed Python code in
your markdown itself without having to
create on a specific execution cell
another thing with that extension is
that you can let's say that you are
writing in Montana you want to show in
that markdown the results of one of the
cells you can just like put in between
square brackets the number of the cell
and it would put the result in line with
the Matt down table of contents things
like that once you run our notebook you
will realize that even when you are not
looking your notebook you will see that
there is something they are saying
running receiving a tab name running and
this is because is a multi-user system
now and what it does is that is pong
kernel somewhere else to communicate and
execute your code we will see a little
how it works in the background and what
it does there is that it was just wrong
until it dies
that usually happens with loan with
long-running notebooks so just be
careful and this is more like you have
to start looking at if you are using
that notebook or not and once in a while
shut it down just imagine that it's a
solar that is working waiting there to
see if there are more input you support
clusters as well as I was saying one of
the advantages of this especially if you
are doing a very heavy computation is
that you can have machines running
parallel Python on different kernels and
you just spawn the calculations to those
machines and you just get the result so
how all these magic works when we are
going to be a little developers know how
all these works this is the boring part
probably what is the short part as well
the way that they solve this or they
make this happen is the Copeland
execution from the presentation so
basically what you have is what is
called the Python kernel or the kernel
itself that do the execution of your
code at the notebook at the front that
is just a client of that on the dot
premise you will realize that your
notebook is just a client of your kernel
so you have something in the middle that
is forwarding the messages
the executor and you they are consuming
those things so that's the reason that
we have different clients as well we
have a cute client that we use the same
infrastructure and things like that I
actually have seen even a client for
Python notebooks in Adam so you just
writing Adam I pull messages to a
jupiter notebook colonel and get the
result evaluated if you look at the
documentation how to do this this is
what they tell you I mean still not
understanding what is that about
just didn't get it
and then our usual eyes that is very
simple is just the typical client and
server communication you have a client
doing request and get a response from a
colonel that is to a server so every
time that you evaluate something like
client yourself hey can you execute one
plus two and the colonel just returned
yeah the result is thirteen as you can
see this is a pretty bad camera because
one plus two is not 13 I don't know what
I was thinking the only difference is
that this is repeated in five different
subsystems so it's not just one server
that do all the institution you have the
first that is the shell that is the most
important is who does destitution if the
one that you say like oh give me can you
tell me how much what is the value of
this oh yeah sure no problem is this the
other is a your pop is only for
mutability every time that you mutate a
value for example that you have a
notebook that you are very evaluated and
you change that cell you need to notify
every consumer of those notebook because
remember that you can link notebooks
together that it change it so they need
to recalculate and the others are
standard in that is just handles of the
input/output between client and server
the control that is just what tells you
shoot down start restart the kernel
and a heartbeat just to know if that
thing's alive is that's the reason
because we see the running this is just
if you want to get into that it's pretty
simple there are two types of kernels
the first is called the rapping canner
or rapper canner and the second is the
native cattle will also store the native
kernel because I'm not going to explain
this it's very very nerdy but we can
talk about that later
like outside you know we're having a
beer or something like that native can
at least all those sockets that you saw
all those five things you have to
internet from scratch using 0 and Q so
you have to take care of the evaluation
you have to take care of the habit you
have to take care of many other things
if allele is a lot of work but it has a
big advantage you have the flexibility
to do whatever you want and you don't
even need to implement or to use Python
at all in fact the i/o kernel that the
i/o tamil sarika know that is used by
your camera language you don't even have
to install Python notebooks or Jupiter
to use it because you just copy all the
javascript file sorry needs and put it
together in the dependencies as you can
see most of them are good examples of
kernels that are implemented natively
for example the JavaScript kernel is
implemented as far as I remember we are
two ones using the node evaluation
ranging and the other is using the most
stringent the mozilla javascript system
there is one that is not there but i've
been using lately that is eternal to
learn fortune it's as well i part of
that just feel free and take a look at
the source code if just if you want to
do something but i don't advise to do a
full native schedule from the beginning
it's easy to just do a proper kernel
a rapper cannon is just Jesus Python you
just write a process and that you have
to inherit from a class named Colonel
that it comes in that namespace and they
already method that you have to fulfil
is to execute everything else is just if
you want to do Alto complete option or
history support etc etc but the only
method that you have to implement is to
execute Medicare nazar rad colonel for
example they're ready scanner that is
attended so you can issue readies
commands and look at various clusters
from your to paternal boot and this is
interesting I mentioned the rarest
channel because this is where most of
the conversation between developer
happens is oh but you know what I will
really love to have was talking whatever
about science says that he has its own
login format system like you can create
one kind of two brother colonel for for
your format if you already like
communicate somehow and you can just
like Google coin in Python notebooks and
just issue queries to see the results
you don't need to write a full screen or
anything from scratch
just use it there's another type of
kernel that is the rebel rattle this is
more useful shells for example this bash
kernel and the PowerShell kernels are
made in this way are you more advanced
yeah there is a part of PowerShell
kernel so you can just like play with
PowerShell beside Jupiter almost
finishing that to run job Jupiter now if
you want to start like playing with it
the easy way is just pip installed
Jupiter oh do you need Python and this
will install the whole Jupiter change
that very thing just take a few minutes
if you are using Windows the easy way is
using anaconda
because includes Jupiter notebooks in
the distribution and a context used for
by data scientist a lot because includes
as well a lot of data analysis packages
like panda an oompa side by Matt Bradley
etc another thing that i have to mention
here if you install in this way that is
my favorite
once you install this if you use things
like our javascript or similar you just
spit installed they are kernel and it
wouldn't start our and everything that
you need the same weight with the
javascript kernel most of the cameras
that we saw native that i've provided by
the jupiter guys another option is
docker there are multiple images of
Jupiter notebooks in docker one of them
that is the famous image it's really big
is 2.1 gigabytes but includes a lot of
kernels and includes as well all the
libraries that you will need for
analysis and another option is Microsoft
Azure notebooks those that have an
Asscher account you don't even have to
pay for this because the vet aversion
just gives you the notebooks for free
they support as far as I know Python are
f-sharp
yeah I think those three there was like
some discussion about supporting c-sharp
as well they the official kernel uses a
script CS but it's already free you just
go create an account and start playing
with your notebooks over there once you
have your notebooks another option to
share this with the rest of your
colleagues or to share your beautiful
notebooks with the world it's used using
envy viewable that is part of the
Jupiter notebook project it's actually
an open source playing so if you already
have notebooks and you want to install
in your in your machine for your company
go ahead to it and the idea here is
that you can just point to a github
repository that have no books and you
see the node would render unevaluated
this is important because then github is
your repository for research or your
repository for education you just write
your code push to give hope to a repo
and when people come to here's a like oh
no I already publish my my findings just
go this is the repo they point there and
they see your your repository render we
will see in a second and the other is
that you don't need actually now in
viewer and be viewer because seeing six
months ago we have supports Python
notebooks Jupiter notebooks natively so
you don't need anything it renders your
notebooks let's show you that here bless
you
and you can say that support like
hipster languages as well like Julia so
you just point to that repository and it
renders has nothing happen let's go kid
hop should be the posse toys because I
don't remember for having important yeah
they mentioned this
yeah this guy he is studying analysis of
whatever that is but we're just clicking
the decease outside let's see here this
is inside github itself we just create
the notebook and the notebook is
rendered you don't need any external
viewer or anything
everything is render directly into
github and I really like that and
another option is a new project this is
started just a few months as well it's
called interact is for those people that
for some reason they don't like the
interface the web interface of Jupiter
notebook this is more like a desktop
application that supports to be the
notebooks so I just connect through the
protocol and just it's a desktop app
it's the same mechanism if you want to
do something more advanced
like for example get information that
you have in your Python notebook the
format ipython notebook is completely
open
in fact for my personal blog I have a
static content generator I use Pelican
and when I have to just write some code
and things like that instead of the
previous workflow that I have that was
writing that code and then copy paste in
a markdown file now for cases like that
I've read that blog post the whole blog
post in a Jupiter notebook and then as
part of the the polish process that I
have I have a converter from the Python
notebook to me not even madam directly
into HTML and it will get all the the
styles and things letter form for my
blog I heard that people are doing that
as well to transform a Python notebooks
into Word documents I don't know why you
will do that but yeah there is a
possibility to do it
adding completely open you can read it
you can write it go ahead go for it
go crazy with it it's highly documented
so is in the parting the Jupiter
notebook documentation well I hope that
at least after this you will have the
curiosity to go and do pip install
Jupiter because that's that's what I
want you to do if you want to take
anything from this session is please go
and play with Python notebooks or
Jupiter notebooks you are really missing
something great I wish I will tell you
more nice words about it but I think
that I think that you have to discover
by yourself
thank you very much that was all I will
be outside just talking about more
notebooks and stuff over at programming
in Atari 2600 if you want to listen to
me how about that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
