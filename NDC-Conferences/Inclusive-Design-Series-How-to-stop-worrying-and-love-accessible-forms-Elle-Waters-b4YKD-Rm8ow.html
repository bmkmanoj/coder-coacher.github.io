started
and I'm willing for four people to
wander it afterwards so you guys have
been so patient and waiting and I have I
mentioned earlier this is a full-day
workshop I'm putting into an hour-long
talk because there wasn't anything I
could realistically say they don't need
to know more about this so I have
business cards like at each end
definitely and it's all in the slides
and stuff email me I will give you the
full slide deck and love to have
conversations with you about all of this
so yeah or not
it's not moving now like even not weird
this room has had some tech problems all
day so you think
nope it's flashing but not going
anywhere
this is crazy this room because you know
what's worse than blinking slides as
slides don't advance yeah I've never
seen this happen before
yeah go ahead and take it off and then
does it matter you can hit yeah either
one it's fine and it's right there
maybe that's yeah crazy let's hope that
it just works that's ok it's really ok
if it does that I will do the
old-fashioned way to get to the browser
and all that let's just leave it the way
it is all right so I work at a company
called simply accessible pretty
straightforward I think what we do it's
all we focus on we're very focused on
inclusive design development teaching
people how to build accessibility into
their process and so we go as nerdy
geeky UX e-business e-marketing scrum as
you go pretty much my name is Elle
waters and I tweet a lot at another mind
and you can reach me l at simply
accessible comm that's kind of a long
ish twitter hash name so i put in d.c
a11y in case you do want to like carry
on a conversation i have 3 talks
tomorrow on different topics as well so
a 11 why is the hashtag that's most
commonly used on Twitter for
accessibility great conversations
happening
little bit like the public plaza though
so you get weird street fights on topics
and things like that but it's a great
thing to be able to to know it's like
internationalization where it has I 18
in a 11 why's that there's 11 characters
in between a and Y and accessibility so
today this is what I'm hoping we can get
through we'll see how far we go and at
some point somebody might raise their
hand and cry out for mercy we'll see so
we have some things we'll go through
basic overview about web based forms the
building blocks of accessible forms form
fields and labels because it's kind of
the heart the meat of most forms then
we'll talk about custom elements and we
have a lot of code samples as well to
provide for you guys so that it's not
just theoretical you can actually look
under the hood and see how something's
being done hopefully this is a very
popular topic re so we will talk a
little bit about Aria we won't go super
deep into it because the truth is you
don't need to go super deeply into it
there's the thing no one tells you we'll
talk about a couple of complex scenarios
and then we'll just kind of start on
validation and as nerdy as it sounds if
anybody wants to go further and talk
more about validation I'll be at the
party tonight and we can have the
geekiest moment ever so let's do a quick
review because some of you guys may be
kind of new to the understanding of what
accessibility means you'll look on
Wikipedia you'll see a definition web
accessibility refers to the inclusive
practice of removing barriers that
prevent interaction with or access to
websites by people with disabilities and
when sites are correctly designed and
developed and edited all users have
equal access to information and
functionality Superdry doesn't really
tell you how that applies to what you do
our team basically says that it is for
every person for every device and it's a
pretty aspirational goal but it's what
we do and so we're always looking to
make sure that something is as usable by
as many people as possible so make
things work for everyone
we're
godless of their abilities so in the web
content accessibility guidelines there's
four principles perceivable operable
understandable and robust and in an
intro talk I go pretty deep into
examples and what that's like
most of these are pretty
self-explanatory if again if you want to
talk more about sort of the basics on
web accessibility we can do that it's
important to note that one in seven
people have a disability according to
the World Health Organization and Google
published this recently as well and
their accessibility page so from a
developer perspective that is 15 percent
of the world's population versus 3.9
percent of desktop Internet users this
number keeps going down every time I do
this particular slide so when your
business stakeholders say that
accessibility is not really a must-have
because it's for a really small
percentage of people you just tell them
okay that's fine I just won't test an
edge or ie of any kind all right is that
good because obviously there's a little
bit of a waiting there that makes it
worth considering if you have 15% of
your customers so it's not a binary
thing it's not black and white it's not
flipping of a switch and I know
engineers typically really appreciate
the clarity of standards solid code
predictable test driven kinds of
scenarios there are pieces like that to
accessibility but because the human
factor is a part of it there's a lot of
messiness in that there's a lot of it
depends out of that so because of the
fact that there's a lot of these
different shades of gray you want to
think about that when you're looking at
different scenarios and think about
testing with real users so how do you
make forms accessible let's dive in all
right assistive technology which is what
some people with disabilities use is
actually designed specifically to work
with well-crafted forms
so in a nutshell that means if you have
a shitty form that form will not work
very well with assistive technology
because how would they know what kind of
weird magical voodoo that you're doing
with your markup they're going according
to something so who defines what a
well-crafted form is here's some tips
use web standards best practices and
native form elements don't be afraid of
that we'll talk about custom elements
later ensure full keyboard accessibility
oftentimes with accessibility people
think about people who are blind who use
a screen reader that's usually the first
thing a user group that people go to but
there are many more people who are
sighted keyboard users than there are
who have mobility impairments then there
are people who are blind using a screen
reader use a visible focus indicator
either use the browser default or make
one better and use relative sizing for
your containers your elements your
typography and think in terms of
percentages or M's or rims for the tube
here could probably do that and use
elements as they were designed to be
used so again who defines what something
should do and how it should func it the
function so the w3c World Wide Web
Consortium consortium basically puts out
here are the specifications for example
html5 which we're huge fans of because
it's so much better you look and you see
how something was meant to be used and
you go according to the specifications
and you make that that much easier for
people with assistive technologies and
like science web standards exist or they
you choose to believe in them or not so
a lot of times people think of it as
sort of a nice-to-have
or an optional thing but that doesn't
change the reality that again you build
shitty code and yes you will have shitty
user experiences so one of the biggest
things that we tell people use semantic
hTML and the question with that is what
is semantic hTML a lot of people use you
know an IE D
and they're using say Visual Studio and
they're dragging and dropping controls
but when you're actually looking at what
your page is being built as on the front
end because 90% of accessibility lives
in that view layer you have to ask
yourself okay what is this thing and how
does it behave anybody tell me what is
this element a select yes and how do you
know that because it's you know kind of
roughly bar shaped and it's got these
things right these affordances right
a select typically does not function
like a set of checkboxes right the idea
is that you're selecting something
there's multi-select we understand that
but there's a certain expectation when
somebody comes to this element of what
they should expect like if I click here
what should happen yeah you see a
drop-down of choices to make that's
because we've seen it time and time
again and we know that's how it should
function so if you are presenting
elements in a form to your users think
in terms of what this element is and
what the expectation is of how it should
work
so on the counter side of that I'm a
button button type 'button I am a button
right pretty straightforward or am i
span class equals button thingy role
equals button or am i this does not
function very well for people who need
something to act like a button there's a
lot that you need to put into this that
comes by default with a button element
this is not a real duck span ID woody
class equals duck role equals fowl title
equals DC UK quack right that's not a
real duck this is not a real tan
many people would say this is not a real
president always opt for the real thing
first otherwise you never know what you
will get I hope that sticks with you
guys and you really think about that
the second principle to to consider is
progressive enhancement it sounds
old-fashioned these days people think
it's you know it was kind of a moment
where vite is super excited about it
jeffrey Zelman everybody yes and then
they're like now it's all about angular
react and amber and it's like whatever
I'm not really thinking about that
because I have this new thing
progressive enhancement still matters
this is a wonderful visual it's in a
Shopify article recently and I love the
fact that we're still talking about it
because it still matters you know what
you're eating are not candles what
you're eating is not frosting what
you're eating is cake and likewise with
progressive enhancement you need to
think in terms of the base the majority
of what you do regardless of what
technology stack you have the web is
meant to operate from a Content
perspective and content and that
semantic information is generally
contained within the HTML layer so that
should be very very heavy as far as what
your focus is then you enhance that with
CSS then you can enhance that with
JavaScript maybe back and forth
interchangeably and at the very end when
none of these solutions will work you
can look to Aria as a solution which
we'll go into a little more later if you
were to flip this pyramid like many
people do especially when they're trying
to design a web form for accessibility
they put a hell of a lot of Aria in
there then they JavaScript all the
things and they're manipulating the DOM
and they're doing all of these things
and it gets really really brittle and
really fragile and you're basically
shrinking the amount of people that can
effectively use your web form so we tell
people when we're talking to engineering
teams solve the problem the lowest in
the stack you can so hopefully this will
help make sense which of these could you
use to programmatically associate a
visible label with a text field
that's how that's what you probably
should use right but you could again
manipulate the Dom with JavaScript do a
weird injection make me a label you
could put an aria-label tag on something
or re labeled by you could put a fake
duck out there right and decide to put
all that stuff in but if you're looking
at the technology that you're using the
technology stack you're using the lowest
thing in that stack is HTML that has the
most support for the most amount of
users and will not break depending on
the device and the inputs and the
assistive technologies HTML works so if
it works use it the lowest problem to
solve the problem the lowest in the
stack that you can HTML is the framework
for accessible content so no matter how
crazy you get on your webpage that
framework is the thing that holds it all
together otherwise bad things happen
later on the roller coaster the second
or third thing is that source order
actually matters so I'm going to go
through a few principles in a row and
then I'm gonna see if this doesn't have
weird tech problems I'm going to show
you live what the experience is like for
a sighted keyboard user source order
matters keyboard accessibility and
provide a visible focus indicator so
here I am at my favorite site to pick on
Amazon probably has the largest amount
of technical debt of any e-commerce site
in the world and if I assume that I am a
sighted keyboard user it means I don't
use a mouse I don't use a trackpad I'm
gonna use only the keyboard to be able
to navigate and by by the way I
recommend this book awesome book called
radical candor and I'm going to
basically be browsing and looking at
this product so the first thing I'm
going to do is
as I'm trying to tab to that because I'm
going from active element to active
element and you know maybe I'm going
somewhere I think I see it
every once in a while but you can tell
that I'm kind of like very tiny bits of
visible focus like something becomes
underlined
something is a little bit of a dotted
focus ring and yet after that I don't
know where I've gone right here I'm back
to orders prime carte now I don't know
where I am again so we have this thing
and again either send me a tweet or
email me and I'll and I'll give it to
you it's not an accessibility tool it's
an accessibility testing tool if our
testers were looking at this they would
stop because they really wouldn't know
how much was effectively being used
because they can't see the focus outline
on things so we have this bookmarklet
called show tab focus and basically for
that page puts this big red box around
whatever has the focus so now you can
see it's on the search bar now I'm on
this I'm going through here and this
tells me really what the tab order is
and I go through it and I say okay again
I'm sure it's going to some hidden menu
and then you're you know you're kind of
looking don't judge that I have 12
things in my cart I'm a cart Parker with
Amazon all the time so now I'm looking
at this second menu and I'm going
through this and then now I'm not really
sure where I've gone if you see where
the focus is let me know because a
little harder the thing yeah yeah so
weird right because it's not going
typically source orders should go top to
bottom left to right on Western you know
pages and so I'm here and imagine what
this experience is like not just from a
sighted keyboard user even though yes
this is a pretty terrible experience
when somebody is using a screen reader
they're basically consuming content in a
very linear way so they're at this point
they're saying okay radical candor and
over one other million books available
Amazon Kindle alert
more then I'm in the share section and
then the next thing is I'm in the buy I
haven't gotten to a tile I haven't
gotten to an image I haven't gotten to
anything that tells me that I'm actually
on the right page and it's asking me to
buy it so when we're talking about
source order matters this is one of the
main reasons why it matters another is
people who are sighted keyboard users
sometimes are that way because of a
physical disability that causes them a
lot of mental pain and exhaustion and
physical exhaustion and so what you're
doing is you're putting this huge amount
of cognitive load and perhaps even more
physical pain onto somebody just because
they have to sit there and work 3 or 4
or 5 times it's hard to be able to get
to that so again I'd go through this and
sometimes this happens with modal
dialogues and you don't have to raise
your hand because there's no judgement
this is a judgement free zone but people
put modal dialogues as an afterthought
and they'll put up at the bottom of the
source order and then they'll just you
know make it display when it comes up
but that content is adjacent should be
adjacent in the source order because
otherwise you're asking maybe somebody
to go all the way to the bottom of the
page and then find their way back to
where they were so where were we
okay provide a visible focus indicator
now you can see there's a real benefit
to that because basically a sighted
keyboard user can't get through a page
if they don't know where the focus is
gone it's helpful again when you're
testing for keyboard accessibility be
flexible so I love responsive web design
not just cuz it's cool and not just
because now I don't need to wear my
glasses when I'm looking at my mobile
phone anymore cuz they're doing these
tiny little pages but because of the
fact that it occurred in the need for
people to think about flexibility and so
a lot of times people are looking at
designing for multiple viewports and
they understand the need to have to have
things flexible but to go a little
deeper with accessibility you need to
think in terms
container height and width sometimes
people just think in terms of height
think about both of those here's some
examples this is Ryan Airways airlines
are great too when you want to find a
lot of accessibility problems we work
with some and it's like the most
airlines and banks are like super
anxious experiences for people and so
what we definitely see are these
problems magnified for people with
disabilities so a lot of times people
with disabilities will have a need to
enlarge the text and the web content
accessibility guidelines requires that
you not just use like control plus you
know command plus to be able to zoom the
entire page because that creates a
scrolling experience and sometimes
people don't want to be in a mobile
viewport so sometimes it'll flip to that
if it's a responsive site and so people
will enlarge just the text and so this
is something there's a really good
add-on with Firefox and with Safari that
you can use where you can just select to
zoom in only on the text this is at 200%
which is on the its the requirement but
it's pretty much a minimum and you can
see that a lot of stuff starts getting
cut off and confusing for people but
we're really starts to affect it is if I
open up that date picker and I see that
they tried to put a visible focus
outline but hell if I know
which one of those actually has the
focus right that's crazy because there's
no way for me to know is that January
16th is that January 23rd don't know and
that's all because of the fact that they
weren't designing with flexibility in
mind so building blocks of accessible
forms back to this we'll look at HTML
CSS JavaScript and Aria this is the most
amount of bullets if any slides that
I've ever put together because there's a
lot of small finite details and I
thought it would be really useful to
kind of like empower you guys with this
information so from an HTML perspective
some of this is a little bit of a recap
choose the best element for the job
use a native element before reaching for
something fancy leverage semantic HTML
to communicate under the hood to
assistive technology so assistive
technology again is looking for if it's
a radio button I shouldn't be able to
select more than one right if it looks
like a radio button and it's actually a
fancy way of doing checkboxes then we
can have a different conversation with
your designers oh wait let me go back to
HTML on those furnish provide clear
instructional text this is important I
have an example I was going to look at
taking a walking tour of Oxford this
weekend and I found an awesome awful
example to share with you guys
and use a button to submit your web
forms no need to reinvent something that
already exists CSS do not disable the
default browser ring unless you replace
it with something much better the
default browser ring is pretty bad as
far as really it's this little tiny
dotted line it doesn't maybe meet your
brand standards you know it looks
different in different browsers and a
lot of UX people don't like that so then
encourage them to be able to design for
the focus state and in that think in
terms of focus States and hover States
and whenever you are typing hover also
think in terms of focus because what
you're really saying is something has on
focus a particular kind of visual
treatment not just on hover again I love
the fact that mobilis you know we're in
that mobile moment because this is
something that people have already
started to struggle with knowing that
there really is no hover experience on a
mobile javascript you use JavaScript to
add accessibility to an interface if
anybody tells you JavaScript is bad for
accessibility then they write bad
JavaScript that's the truth or they
don't know JavaScript can be really
really useful in enhancing the user
experience the biggest challenge that we
see working with dozens and dozens and
dozens of clients is that especially we
can talk a little bit too about angular
in this people don't manage the focus
and they don't really have an
intentional focus path that doesn't mean
and please God don't put positive
integers when you're tabindex + tabindex
all the things right because the next
developer who comes along will seek you
out with like missiles because they have
to maintain all of that
don't put positive integers
that but be really intentional about
what something's happening normally the
the focus should just follow the natural
tab order which should be the source
order but those times when you have to
programmatically do something and you're
putting tabindex equals zero or tabindex
equals negative one be really
intentional know not only does it go
somewhere but know where it goes when
say that modal dialog closes really
understand how to manage that focus
toggle important values dynamically
based on events so if something is
selected versus not selected we really
like putting visually hidden text that
mimics what you see visually so if
something becomes bright blue on a tab
and then you switch to the other one
make sure that you're using javascript
to change the value of that hidden text
because otherwise we'll always say
selected custom controls and all of the
expected keyboard usability name state
role and behavior you have a lot of work
to do if you have a custom control and
you're only gonna use that custom
control I have a really good code sample
from one of our team members that will
show you how to layer things because
yeah we're at that point now and manage
Aria state and we'll talk through that a
bit too Aria you use Aria accessible
rich Internet application only when HTML
CSS and JavaScript really can't do the
job so really investigate it and think
in those terms of progressive
enhancement managed your Aria state and
test test test most of the time we see
Aria it's poorly implemented and it's a
little bit like primary school children
running around with jackknives like
swinging things because they mean well
but what they actually do sometimes they
make an interface less accessible for
people with screen readers because
they've over engineered a solution and
they didn't test to actually see what
happened learn about Aria before using
it and test with really users so this is
a great quote that I love from Kevin
bonnet and I think this was on Stack
Overflow for me as a web developer
semantic HTML must always be the
starting point in my humble opinion
there's no excuse at all for turning out
only nested divs with JavaScript event
handlers and inappropriate Aria roles I
couldn't have said that better
but now you'll see why he's saying that
because there's all these things that
can create a more accessible form
experience before you ever have to get
to retrofitting your divs with all the
things that HTML comes for free so form
field and labels I'm going a little bit
of a clip trying to make sure we get
through everything so in your fields
every visible form field gets a label
and by that we don't mean just you know
first name out there but that it's for
an ID programmatically associated use
html5 we love html5 for native input
fields and then style them as you want
to html5 has some real benefits for
forms for accessibility so highly
encouraged design and implement native
file upload field buttons that's really
something a lot of times people try and
get super fancy with that and here's one
that's a little bit contentious and if
designers push back on this I'd love to
have more conversation avoid read-only
and disabled fields because there is
really spotty support for assistive
technology and what you may hear in one
screenreader you won't hear the same as
another screen reader additionally
there's some real problems with disabled
fields for people who have low vision
because by necessity they have to look
different visually and they're usually
pretty low contrast so that becomes a
very difficult proposition to be able to
have that and from usability testing not
just with people with disabilities but
people without disabilities they get
very confused about what is the state
why is it disabled what do I need to do
and it puts somebody on this sort of
scavenger hunt to figure out how to
enable the button and instead rely on
validation create really solid great
forms and expect that error message to
help people through the process if they
don't do it correctly that's a much
better user experience believe it or not
then read-only or disabled fields I
don't hear anybody in an uproar over
that so that's good all right labels
each labels
should have sufficient contrast that's
kind of what we were talking about
before each label should be unique
that's pretty one-on-one a lot of times
we'll say we'll teach these things to
development teams and let's say well
this is just like you know doing your
job well we're like yeah each label
should have Texas large enough and easy
to read again this is usually a design
related thing but it plays out in a lot
of different ways
don't use placeholder attributes instead
of labels if you really must do
something because your design team has
decided that they're gonna ignore the
years of usability testing feedback that
says that placeholders are confusing for
people and they'll skip right over them
and it's possible people are starting to
understand placeholder labels and maybe
the 70 year olds who are struggling with
them are not the 20 year olds who use
your application that's fair use a label
and you've seen this pattern out there
before we have floating labels where
they start looking like a placeholder
and then they kind of float up to the
top that's great because the biggest
problem even beyond the color contrast
of that or the confusion that it's
already been filled in the biggest
problem is that placeholders aren't
generally persistent otherwise you
couldn't fill in the field right and
that if the if that is the only visual
indicator of what that field means and
it disappears that's incredibly
confusing and so you end up triggering
this situation where people have to go
out of the field and back into it just
to be able to remember what it was they
needed to fill in so the floating label
idea is a really good way to kind of
solve for that and meet everyone's needs
on real estate and things like that
provide a clear indication of what
fields are required generally speaking
people use an asterisks we recommend if
you want to just you know really
turbocharged your experience use a
foreground image sprite use a an
asterisk image and use the alt text
required on it and that way people
actually know we're not yet at a point
believe it or not we're people in all
parts of the world who use web forms
understand that an asterisk means
required and for screen readers
sometimes it does read out star star
star could be confusing for people
provide clear instructional text
consider visual proximity of labels from
form elements and if I have time
tomorrow if you guys want to know or
there's videos online of us we have this
thing called the straw test that we do
where you're basically mimicking a low
vision user and trying to understand how
to fill out a form and when everything
is far far apart it's very difficult for
people who have the screen zoomed in to
really high magnification they may never
see that submit button for example
so consider grouping things together
visually in proximity for one another so
this is my walking tours of Oxford
experience and so I was looking at this
page and I came across this and I'm
really not sure what to do with that
like it was a good attempt they're
trying very hard to you know give me
something that's persistent tell me the
information here's the format but I have
no idea which one I'm supposed to use
and then additionally if you go back to
this there's a button or when our mouse
over here there's like a button right
here and I don't really know what that
does and so I clicked on and of course
it brings up a date picker and I thought
okay I guess this is always people
trying to engineer solutions without
realizing that that's just that's just
impossible for people to understand
don't do this please
so let's talk a little bit about custom
elements it's really something people
love to do and we really kind of
struggled with it because custom
elements require a hell of a lot of work
to build in all the things that come
with native elements with that said
custom form elements are really
introducing barriers because it's an
idea that the design is more important
than the function and that's that's the
truth and this becomes again there's
awkward conversations with designers you
want really beautiful stylize check
boxes and they're not okay with the kind
of check box that you know comes out of
the box oh that's kind of a pun
so what if our designers say that this
is ugly
this is terrible hooray we live in a new
wonderful world so there are custom
looks for your native form fields now so
I have a code pen from one of my team
members and he shows that basically
you're taking a native element and with
a little bit of wizardry back and forth
you're able to style it in such a way
where it can look however they choose
for it to look your designers so if you
go to si teach study s slash custom -
form - field you can see it it's a
really good example and you'll be able
to take it where you want
so they people interact with the native
control a screen reader user would
interact with the native control which
is not visible and you're basically
hiding visually hiding but making it
available to screen readers we do this a
lot with things like infographics and
charts tomorrow I'll be talking about
that where it's you know the super super
sophisticated looking infographic and
the best way to be able to make that
accessible to the most amount of people
would be able to have them able to
toggle between a table format like a
data table or the pie chart that you've
just designed if that's not something
people want then you put that data table
in the background you basically code it
and then you make sure that it's
visually hidden so that the people who
need the pie chart will see the pie
chart people who are using the source
code then you're hiding the pie chart
from them and they're using the data
table it is wizardry so Aria yeah Aria
the first rule of Aria is don't use Aria
more often than not say 90% that's a
fake statistic 90% of the time people
are using Aria because they don't
understand how to use markup CSS and
JavaScript and that there really is a
solution and it's a more accessible
solution there are some specific use
cases that make sense to use Aria so for
those of you guys raise your hand if
you've heard of Aria before perhaps
so maybe a little over half of you so
Aria was put out as sort of a bridge
specification the idea is that there
were a lot of things that were coming
out in design that were being coded that
didn't have native for like native HTML
things like tabs you know there's no tab
element in HTML 4 for example and so
because of that Aria was meant to be
able to provide more information about
what this particular object was and what
it was meant to do especially the more
dynamic things got the more people
started to lean on Aria html5 has a lot
of the stuff that Aria 1.1 has and
that's one of the reasons why you don't
usually need aria if you do and must use
aria then we ask that you're judicious
in your use of it think in terms of that
progressive enhancement and we say be
polite not just because my company is a
Canadian company but because there's
such a thing as an aria live region and
polite is something that's much better
than one that they used to call rude
that is now assertive so again reminding
you of the stack a little bit of Arya's
alright so here's the four major use
cases for using Aria Aria hidden is used
for content that shouldn't be available
to screen reader users but should be
visible decided users one of the best
examples is the one that I was sharing
before say you have an SVG chart that
chart besides the fact again tomorrow
we'll talk about SVG hella complicated
very difficult to be able to make sure
it's fully accessible one of the best
ways to ensure that it's fully
accessible for screen reader users is
that they never encounter it now more
modern screen readers will interpret
Aria but you do have to consider your
user base so if you're if you have
people who are using old versions of
Internet Explorer and you can see that
through your browser statistics more
than likely they're using old versions
of screen readers so again there's other
ways lower in the stack that you can use
Aria hidden I mean that you can use
instead of Aria hidden but this is a
really good use case for it when you
need to hide something from a screen
reader user because it's just not
thing that they should be interacting
with and you've created the accessible
HTML version behind it like a data table
there are cases where you can provide
labeling for fields with complex label
and field relationships so here's some
two scenarios for that one is somebody's
told you to make the web forms that you
have these legacy forms accessible maybe
you are a part of the EU directive
perhaps or you're in America and you
have a section 508 compliance
requirement or you work for an airline
there's lots of laws and regulations
that say I don't care what your release
plan is for your new application this
needs to happen right now
so for remediating things this is a very
effective thing because Aria doesn't
affect the existing markup and as a
result of that you're less regression
testing you're not having to redesign
the whole experience so this is a good
use case for that
another one is Aria live announcements
for on-screen updates that screenreader
users can't see but are apparent decided
users so good scenario for that would be
like you have a shopping cart and on
this side it's dynamically updating say
all of my Amazon purchases and I see
this as a visual sighted user I'm able
to see that it's you know becoming more
than the price of a small car and I need
to maybe hold back a little and yet
somebody who's using a screen reader
isn't going to have that if their cursor
and their focus is on something else
so again Aria live has a polite function
and it waits until the screen reader has
read out that content that they're on
and then it will tell them the
dynamically updated content and then of
course things you absolutely can't do
with HTML CSS JavaScript alone and it
affects screen reader users so
occasionally and and occasionally it
will affect people who use speech
recognition voice recognition software
Dragon NaturallySpeaking
even though it's a Productivity tool
it's most recent version has come out
with some limited Aria support so if you
get pretty complex into that there's a
lot of decisions that you need to make
that's why we said be judicious so Aria
hidden when content make
issues are duplication for screen reader
users has a screen reader friendly text
equivalent then it's safe to use Aria
hidden and so what we generally do is we
create a class and CSS it's called
visually hidden and that hides content
and then we also again SVG is a great
use case for it and also re a hidden
equals true don't use this if you don't
have a text equivalent because then
you're basically blocking a screen
reader user from getting anything and
don't use it for things that receive
focus because if it receives focus
somebody will have their cursor go there
and then they won't be able to
understand what's happened so this is a
little code snippet for you to be able
to use again we'll ship all this out and
if you look at it we can see this is
again this is a situation where we would
have recommended if this were being
built from scratch better techniques but
let's assume that you needed to
remediate this because there were no
labels here and there were some problems
here and sometimes you know mm will read
out as millimeter for some screen reader
users so here's an example label for
birth month email span Aria hidden
equals true Spanish visually hidden date
of birth month required format month
month let's assume that was something
you wanted to do that gives them the
same information that a sighted user has
and it doesn't have them need to be able
to look at mm as the label for them are
you label this is an explicit
relationship this is a one-to-one
programmatic relationship and it may
override the label elements we generally
don't recommend this like you'd have to
present a really good case as to why to
use Aria label instead of a label
element the thing that's really useful
that we prefer is to use an actual label
element and then just use that same CSS
class to visually hide it it's
accessible to more people because people
may have older technology and they don't
have Aria support on their computer and
this allows for it but if you decided
this is the way that you wanted to do it
then here are some examples on how to do
that
advanced Aria labeling when when people
don't really think in terms of the
information hierarchy then they
presented you with a load of this so
oftentimes really complex tables have
these one-to-many relationships and it's
very difficult when you're just trying
to put the markup together and you say
here's a label but it has to apply to
these three different fields right so
Aria labeled by has the ability to be
able to have a one-to-many relationship
that's the difference one of the key
differences between Aria labeled by and
Aria label Aria label is generally not
visually shown re labeled by is usually
referring to something that is already
visually on the page somewhere does that
make sense kind of so again we're
looking at office number the thi D is
Cindy and so we need to be able to say
okay for phone office number and phone
we need to be able to make sure people
understand that that's about Cindy so
Aria labeled by Cindy office alright I
described by recently had some problems
with safari support now it's a little
better it used to pause this is my
favorite aria tag there's a nerdy
statement my favorite because those
required formatting pieces of
information are not usually in the tab
order and so because you're not gonna
put tabindex equals zero I'm like every
piece of content to form you might but
it's really not something you need to do
so in order to make sure that people who
have screen readers and they're reading
the page aloud through their screen
reader they're doing it like we said in
a linear way and your designer has said
this content that's required format
needs to go visually below the field and
we don't like the focus ring coming on
to it so we don't want you to put
tabindex equals zero this is a way to
programmatically associate content with
something else and so it's really useful
because you can look at it we'll say
okay it's good for error messaging
password must be at least eight
characters and you're able to say okay
I'm gonna put the field focus I'm gonna
put the focus here when it's a single
error because
where the focus should go but maybe
there's information about the formatting
or whatever and you want to be able to
programmatically associate that
so maybe reset password is label this
information could be put inside the
label and then you know styled to look
like this or you can use Aria described
by which again big fan here's the code
sample Aria live my second favorite so
when information should be announced to
users but not receive focus so that's an
important consideration again this is
about anything it's a live update if you
have a modal dialog you should move the
focus to that modal dialog because
that's interrupted the users task flow
but again if you have a shopping cart
and you're adding up things and say
you're buying a ticket a plane ticket
and you'll see on the side as that
information is updated all of that is
useful information but it shouldn't
interrupt the flow of what the users
doing so this is really helpful again we
usually also put visually hidden because
we don't want that information to show
up Aria live polite role equal status
search results updated for example don't
use this for content like I just said
where it needs to be told this has focus
otherwise people won't understand so
that's a good example showing one of
three that's an example we use Aria live
a lot for for Aria love quite a bit for
autocomplete features again we have an
autocomplete feature to that if you guys
want to look at one that's a really
really complex kind of interaction this
is I think helpful for you guys to just
keep in mind because some things
override other things and so this is
sort of the order of operations when it
comes to how screen readers interpret
Aria specifically Aria labelled by Aria
label and Aria described by pop quiz
assistive technologies like screen
readers require that Aria be used to
convey semantic information to users
true or false it's a trick question
that's me especially at the end of the
day I'm standing between you and a lot
of pints right at the party usually
false right usually HTML can do the job
but it depends because in some cases
that semantic information does need to
be conveyed and Aria is the right way to
be able to do that in those limited use
cases so complex scenarios how am i
doing on time I've got time yay complex
scenarios grouped form fields right date
of birth day month gear especially when
it comes to validation this becomes very
complicated because you're like am i
throwing all this into an error where
does the focus go what really needs to
be the label here so don't use field
sets and legends again controversial
waiting for people to come up in arms
this actually creates a huge amount of
verbosity for screen reader users it
doesn't matter how you style it the
truth is headings with if you have a
focus full heading so this is one case
where you would want to put say tabindex
equals zero and use those headings
provides tremendous semantic information
for people and they don't have to hear
it because if you have a field set with
a legend that means that that legend
will read aloud every single form field
within that field set and some of those
people will do it for like required
format so it would be like date of birth
mMmmm
didi why why why why or mmdd etc and
they'll be like de mm DD and it just
keeps repeating and that's really
difficult when you think that somebody
is listening to your page you want to
give them the most concise easy
intuitive and fast way to be able to
complete a form and that's adding extra
each field should still have its own
label so how do we do this
yay so we're looking at this and you see
that it has in this case this is a
simple way again no Aria was used in the
creation of this form so you have a
heading tabindex equals zero date label
then you have a labeled day
ID'd a label for months ID month
label for a year ID year simple easy
won't break no matter what browser
somebody is using for this it's not
gonna look weird it's really just
standard multi-step forms so again code
sample for you guys to take a look at I
think that's a code pen yeah and so
again we like to use things like
visually hidden because this is adding
that extra information current step for
example right because visually you're
conveying hey that's got like a really
cool looking ring around it etcetera and
it's you know we also put this up in the
title of the page as well updating it as
somebody goes through so we recommend
breaking long complex forms into chunks
that's pretty much a user experience
best practice at this point people are
much it's much easier for them to go
through several pages that are
digestible then you're at the top of 500
form elements so unless you work for a
government organization in which case we
should talk because I've emptied for you
it's really something you can design for
visually and programmatically indicate
the progress of the form so I can tell
visually what step I'm on so
programmatically I should also be able
to know again that visually hidden text
you know current step : step one account
information that's really helpful then
you go to step two and it would be
current step company information include
steps in the page title mention that the
other thing to keep in mind is think in
terms of your heading structure that's
really important sixty percent of the
time people and that is a real statistic
people who are navigating a page for the
first time with a screen reader do it by
using headings they're not doing it by
using skip to main content because they
don't know where that's gonna land them
they don't really understand what your
page how its structured and so they use
headings because they have really cool
shortcuts that I wish we all had operate
used to have this but but the idea is
they can get a list of headings like a
table of contents and it's really
helpful for them so really beefed up
your forums thinking in terms of the
heading structure as well
allow users the ability to go forward
and back in the process
another thing that's common with people
using screen readers and people who have
cognitive disabilities is they will
navigate back and forth and back and
forth to understand kind of the context
and the lay of the land and what's
expected of them before they ever fill
out a form or they may need to go back
and check something
so give people the ability to go back
and forth in a process before they
submit manage the focus between the
steps we've talked about that so that
it's not lost or stays on now hidden
content so if you have a page carousel
and it's an image slider that's going
through make sure that that focus
doesn't actually linger on the things
that are now not visible in the page
because then you've basically got
something far off that has focus and
people can't even tell where they're at
include form validation for each step
instead of waiting for the end of the
form big fans of client-side validation
that's kind of obvious we in the
usability testing talk I do tomorrow we
talk about our Oh Balkans talked about
premature inline validation a problem
that many people seem to have and it's
you know it is really one of the bigger
problems that people have when they're
on a field and we think clients that
validation is great after its leaving
focus not before they've started typing
anything in here's another way to be
able to approach the same problem use
text fields as an alternative to complex
form input so if you're having
difficulty with this slider oftentimes
people have difficulty with date pickers
especially because no two are the same
even on the same website at times we
really recommend that you give these
text inputs to people as a fallback
sometimes people just prefer that but it
allows them not to have to figure out
how to slide something to exactly 144
they can just type it in right so again
examples for both of those basic
validation all right we'll talk a little
bit about validation then let's let's I
think I have a couple more minutes for
questions and discuss
to help your users succeed there is a
research project that people found that
people who have an error on a page and
they recover from it well have more
brand loyalty than people who've never
experienced an error on a form and that
same on that company's site which I
found really interesting because it's
about the willingness and the the
absolute care that you take with your
customers and your users that you want
to be in this with them and help them
succeed errors happen so validation on
forms provides timely helpful feedback
to help users complete all form fields
in the right format here's some basic
validation best practices error message
proximity is near the form field
absolutely validation messages should
have sufficient color contrast so if
you're picking a red make sure that that
red is really has enough contrast I can
give you the statistics or the numbers
for that error message text should be
easy to understand
one thing to keep in mind with error
message text you know this is required
probably not super helpful versus first
name is required more helpful it's more
specific avoid html5 based error
validation due to inconsistent assistive
technology support right now that should
probably change soon but for now we say
it should you should probably avoid it
so if you have multiple errors on a page
we recommend an error summary bucket
basically and so you're basically
creating the error at the field level
and then also grouping it together at
the top I have a good example that's
been tested in lots of different ways
through usability and with some of our
clients and it works really really well
sinn focus if you have an error summary
send it to that error summary so here's
an example this has an extra little
thing in case you want to do it but
that's not necessary so this is really
helpful for a lot of reasons we've
changed the page title let's say to the
following three errors require your
attention and this is a heading the
following three and I'm going to require
your attention this is a
foreground image sprite that has
probably the alt text to something like
error its bulleted list so that means
we're creating semantic HTML and that
somebody's using a screen reader knows
that there's three things that they can
expect on that list if they didn't get
it from the text they'll get it from the
semantic
you know ul of that please provide a
first name this is super simple and
straightforward to understand what the
problem was and there's an on page
anchor link to be able to set somebody
right there in that field you can't have
a date of birth in the future that's
pretty straightforward right error
messaging skip to the next item using
the down arrow this is kind of an
optional thing we found with a lot of
people we were testing with people with
cerebral palsy and we found that it's
very difficult for somebody if they have
a relatively long form and they have an
error on say the first field and an
error on the 27th field you're basically
asking them to tab all the way through
that so one of the things that we found
is if they filled this out fix the next
error last name they select that it
brings them down to the next thing
that's an error super helpful that's not
required these other things are much
more fundamental so again there's a link
for it you can take a look at it break
it open look at it look at the HTML for
it I have a guide to creating forms for
angular that are accessible and I would
love to send it to you guys I also have
a guide to creating accessible Maps
which is technically like a whole lot of
form elements love to send it to I also
have a ton of other free stuff that's
just like you know guides that we've
created that we think help people and we
want you to succeed so please definitely
email me I'd be happy to share that
stuff with you this is a relatively
nerdy talk but I'm in a group of nerds
so I figure that's good
and want to know any questions so yes
the last slide with the error
information you had there aha
which was good yes don't know the next
one
Oh for the errors yeah yeah this one you
wouldn't provide that from the beginning
of this ayah when you go into that page
right this is if an error has been
caused on the page so this is before is
that what you're asking this is if I
tried to fill out this form I can go to
the page itself if I tried to fill out
this form and it triggers an error
because I've submitted it and I had
three things that I didn't fill out or
and or two things I didn't fill out one
thing I put like a date of birth in the
future
this is upon the page refresh the focus
would go here and this is a heading
that's dynamically you know populating
all that stuff is that what your
question was
yeah you're trying to fill up the form
first and then it works right and this
is just error messaging in the interest
of time I probably should have put the
first form page into what it looks like
but the interest of time this is just
the error State yeah of what it looks
like afterwards okay any other questions
oh god these lights yes I think it was
very interesting and it said about
fieldset and legends never use them with
with forms yes is that like a general
case in every with every other elements
as well for example a table would that
is no tables use tables for tabular data
use tables in the field in a legend and
feels it oh oh I thought you're saying
should we just throw all the markup like
no generally speaking you don't need a
fieldset and legend with a table what
you're trying to do is make sure you
have headers and ID's and it depends on
how complex your table is aim for
simpler tables but generally the table
headers are the things that help people
understand how to programmatically
associate the fields with one other I
had an example of a of a table that I
think has the markup that's needed for
that it was showing something else but
let me see if I can find it it's not the
table
no I'm gonna try and find it really
quick I'm trying to remember what we
were using it for but just basically
with a no that's a dude I had a table in
here somewhere I'm trying to find it
there we go so you see how it has th
right that's what's needed to be able to
make data tables accessible is be able
to define these things you wouldn't need
to put a field set or a legend around
this because it's all one element a
table is right and it's got the pieces
inside of it that answer your question
yeah partly I was kind of wandering in
the field sets and legends in general
because we have one example where we
have a like a mailing address I know
it's like a panel on a page and it looks
very nice to have like separate by this
line around the title and then so a
field set and legend or HTML so they're
conveying semantic information but what
you're describing to me sounds like a
visual treatment is it not yeah so I
would say CSS is your friend because you
can create the same look with CSS and it
doesn't commit convey this is a fieldset
here's the legend that kind of thing you
want to you want to stick with HTML for
the meaning CSS for the look and feel on
that so okay thank you sure other
questions
arguments yes hello hi validation should
be triggered by focused out or doing the
typing it's not doing the typing it
should be when the focus leaves because
during the typing is when people get
that kind of feedback and they're like I
haven't like a good example is Twitter
which I love obviously if you're signing
up for an account and you start typing
name that you want before you finished
it starts throwing it into an error
state and like said Earl Bakken called
that I think was in 2009 premature in
line validation and it's a very funny
blog or a blog post but it's basically
giving somebody a problem before they've
even caused the problem and you don't
actually know until you've left the
field that it's actually a problem like
not really right and usually it's just a
programmatic thing right you just make
sure that when it leaves the focus then
you get that error message other it
leaves that field because otherwise
you're throwing an error state when
somebody's just now starting to use
something now you might have something
like when you have password strength and
that kind of stuff there's some there's
some states where you're part way
through and you already know it's wrong
and you could we could talk about that
on a case-by-case basis but generally
speaking you don't want to have errors
caused unless you're sure that it's an
error questions yes hello hi we are off
we actually all the time we use
bootstrap and I'd like to know what your
opinion is on the user experience with
bootstrap is it adequate enough should
we do extra or not the short answer is
yes and yes bootstrap has some great
accessibility built into it for the less
complex things when you get into the
more dynamic JavaScript heavy customi
widget II looking kinds of things that's
where it starts to fail and so I would
say for the basic semantic structure for
the things that you're looking to do
from those you know first couple of
layers of the technology stack great but
when you're looking at doing things that
are say really JavaScript heavy I would
look at first jQuery UI because you know
it seems out of fashion these days but
they have some really solid
accessibility built into it so for
example if you were to use like
carousel or the accordion function you
would use bootstrap only for the HTML
and jQuery UI for the JavaScript yeah
yeah okay and I don't know where the
state is of carousels for jQuery UI but
I know we have an example so ping me and
I'll send you the example because I
haven't looked recently at what library
it's using but for the most part if I
had to pick just one JavaScript library
to be able to help me with things it
would be jQuery UI because like I said
they just they put a lot of work into it
why I'm a real - when you get to a
website and just as you've started
reading then you get this sign up for
our newsletter interrupting your flow
there's a non-disabled user yes what's
they experience like with assistive
technologies usually bad but well that's
usually the case right so for most
things like what is a usability problem
for somebody without a disability ends
up becoming an accessibility problem for
someone with a disability now with that
said you know those those awful pop-ups
and stuff like that they may not
actually get focus and so a person with
a screen reader may not even know that
it's on the page they might get a better
experience they might get a personal
announcing that it was the same website
is probably gonna have a modal that has
that dimmed out screen and they won't
set the focus and trap the focus in the
modal and so somebody will be like
cruising around on the parent page
that's blacked out and they won't
understand why they can't move forward
so it's like kind of a you know like a
double-edged sword I mean I think it's
awful I also think I tried for years to
push back on one client that had like on
page load a modal show up and they were
like we'll set focus totem like still a
crappy experience right still terrible
and so I was saying basically and I
think we've got a little bit of
justification after doing some usability
testing that it it interrupts that
person's expectations and that's a big
thing for accessibility is that people
need to know what's about to happen and
the idea that they're going to this
signup thing thinking they're going to a
home page is enough to where our team
would probably flag it as an excessive
the issue so maybe we'll fight the good
fight together and we'll get rid of
those don't see anything else thank you
