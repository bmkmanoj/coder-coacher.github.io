Indianapolis in the United States and
today I want to talk about a little of
how react native is a happy medium
between native and other hybrid
frameworks where you have an excellent
developer experience like you have tools
on the web and then also you have a
great user experience in the end so
you're not sacrificing one for the other
as in many cross-platform and other
solutions here's my contact information
I'll show it again at the end just a
little bit of about me you can find me
pretty much anywhere on the web by
googling my name my background in mobile
development started in 2014 with Swift I
started learning Swift wanting to build
applications and then I started working
for consulting companies so I would have
to write for both platforms at the same
time we used a variety of tools we did
Cordova ionic PhoneGap things like that
the performance was never quite there it
never felt like a truly native
application as it did when I built Swift
applications and yeah I feel like we
were sacrificing one thing for the other
so we could share a codebase and build
things more quickly and especially when
we were building mock-ups or prototypes
to send to a company and things like
that so then almost two years ago I
found reactant ativ and I had already
used react for the web so I was kind of
used to the paradigm and I loved it I
loved it more than I do react for the
web it makes a lot of sense to me it's
there's a lot of different benefits that
I'll get into later but it made I want
to say life easier for us in consulting
it led us make 60 frames per second user
interactions and all these other things
that we wanted from the hybrid
environment that we would need to write
in a native environment to be able to
get on top of that one of the greatest
benefits of react native is being able
to you reuse my web skills that I
already had learned from the web in into
native
so what is react native it's at the most
basic level it's a way to build mobile
applications in JavaScript it's
cross-platform so about 80 to 100
percent of the code that you write will
be exactly the same for Android and iOS
it's declarative so if you're doing
things like animations and things that
require a lot of compute you don't want
to be doing that all in JavaScript as
far as the computation so you can you
can kind of write out what you want to
do in JavaScript give it as a command to
react native and underneath all of these
things like drag and drop features stuff
like that will be run in native for you
so you don't actually have to write the
native code to run native code and get
native performance it uses the react
paradigm so how many are you guys
familiar with how react works and
components a few people okay so that's
basically how it works when you look
side-by-side reacting react native it
looks extremely similar except obviously
you're not rendering to a Dom you don't
have regular HTML elements and stuff
like that but I'll show a comparison in
a minute it's also learn once build
anywhere so the idea behind react in
general was that you could learn this
one way of writing your JavaScript and
components and you would be able to
build it on a lot of different platforms
so for example now you can build it on
the web you can build it in mobile of
course desktop you can build hardware
IOT applications there's react VR
there's all these different platforms
that you're not necessarily going to be
reusing all of your code but you'll be
reusing all of your skills between the
platforms so this is basically how the
react paradigm looks the the parser I'm
using here highlights it a little bit
funny but
it's basically you're using a lot of es6
and react so you have your imports at
the top of the file and then you define
your classes and functions and that's
what you return and render to the screen
and the view and then you can make
JavaScript functions and you have your
logic and your view in the same files
together and then you'll render it to
the Dom or the view and here's a very
simple example of how the react paradigm
works this is just a button click or
example so it shows there's some
built-in methods with react like the
constructor function add is a custom
method and then in the view that I'm
returning
I'm keeping track of count on state and
then I'm when I'm when I click on a
button I'm referencing this dot add
which is calling my own custom add
function oh it's not scrolling on there
for some reason yeah so I'm calling my
own custom this tab add function and
then I'm rendering it to the Dom here
and this is almost exactly the same in
react to native so here is the same
thing in react native making the same
kind of class the same imports the only
difference here is that I import from a
react native API so view and text here
are analogous to a container element
like a div and an h1 or a paragraph tag
on the web and then I can just render it
I wrap it in a view tag or a container
and then I have text and just hello and
then instead of rendering it to a Dom I
render it to react to native which takes
care of handling rendering it to a
native view for iOS and Android and
here's the same button example the only
difference here is that instead of
you'll need to handle a touch event so
react native has a lot of different ways
of handling touch events by default I'm
just importing touchable opacity here
and then when I press on press this is
this is supposed to be camel cased my
parser is making a lower case but so on
press it runs this ad and it will set
State and add one to the counter so it's
almost exactly the same you just have to
account for things that are different
inherently on mobile screens and then of
course you'll render the component to a
native screen by default react native
also uses a lot of web api's so it uses
a flexbox api by default it'll display
everything in flex flex is a more modern
way to layout web applications that they
made because there were so many problems
if you've used floats and that kind of
thing before then it was just a
nightmare to layout web pages so they
made it as a more modern way to because
people were using more and more complex
layouts so it didn't make sense to use
something old-fashioned react native
took this intuitive design and ported it
into react native so you have display
flex and flex direction column and these
are by default in all your reactant
native components which I'll show in a
second when we look at an app so here
are some of the benefits of react native
that companies and people find from
using it you get a lot of code sharing
as I said before all of your UI views
are actual native UI views so the look
and feel of them will be exactly the
same as if you were writing a native
application you also get a lot of built
in developer tools if you're used to
chrome debugging for example you can use
debugger logging things like that you
can even use react and redux dev tools
and react native
so here are some of the things that are
polyfilled from the web so if use you
know any kind of front-end framework on
the web you'll be used to navigate our
geolocation fetch api's web GL you can
use any NPM or JavaScript library I
usually use redux and Axios in my
applications anything that doesn't touch
the Dom is valid and react native so
anything from the web that you use for
State handling or logic or underscore
and all those things anything in
JavaScript you can use and react in
native and some things of course react
native will do checking for you under
the hood so things obviously display
different between Android and iOS so a
lot of the default API is in react
native as well as the libraries you use
will do a check like is the user using
Android then render it this way if it's
using iOS then render it some other way
and that takes into account the
differences in both styling and in the
user experience of both platforms so a
few reasons why you might want to choose
this over regular native development
here is cost so it's expensive to
develop native applications because it's
a longer time you're developing two
different code bases and also native
application native application
developers are more scarce and they're
more expensive time to build is also
longer and to be able to maintain two
separate code bases is also takes longer
and it takes more people and cost more
so that's why if you look back you know
for the last decade people have been
building these hybrid frameworks there's
Cordova there's so many other solutions
and they fix some of these problems they
have a much faster development cycle
some company said that it's you know ten
to one they can do it
a tenth of time is building a radio
regular native application you can also
reuse your same web skills developers a
lot of times you can even reuse the same
web views that you used on the web so if
you have a mobile friendly application
you can reuse those same views the
problem is and why most top apps in the
App Store are still written in native is
that these don't really feel like the
same as a native application so they
don't have the same animations they
don't have the same user experience and
so users even if they're not conscious
of it they can feel the difference
between a native and a non-native
application so this is why Facebook
actually originally tried something like
Cordova back in 2011 and then they said
we can't use this this isn't performant
enough for our application and that's
where react native came out of the
project once they had made react they
had it in mind to hey we want to make
this a learn once build anywhere so
we're going to do the same thing we did
for the web making it more performant
and we're going to take that to react
native and mobile and now it has a huge
community and tons of large companies
backing it so how to get started with
react native the easiest way to get
started if you want to try it out is
there's a website Snack Expo geo and
you'll need a mobile app in your phone
called the Expo app it's a lightweight
app you basically go to this site scan a
QR code post something Mary wait one
second
and you scan this QR code on your phone
and you can do it on multiple devices at
the same time and you can then make any
changes you want and it will live update
oh I'm cute I guess here so it will live
update on any devices and also this
simulator that you have on the side as
you make changes to the application and
you can use anything from the reactant
native API in here and you can also use
some things from this Expo team that
created this resource so you can use for
example a reactant native camera module
different hardware api's because it's
running on your actual device so you can
test out all these things and actually
before I build components in my
application like once I get designs from
a designer then I actually build all my
buttons and things like that in here so
I can I can see it live updating on both
Android and iOS and then I know if I
need to do tweaks on either platforms to
how things look this team who built this
they also have a desktop application so
you can do it on desktop and if you've
heard of create react app it was a way
to simplify the form only infinite
complexity of trying to create react app
on the web where you had to set up all
your own tooling and it was just a real
pain to set up an app so they made it
easier react native did the same thing
the only and you can download the expo
app on your phone and their desktop CLI
and do the exact same thing that you did
on expo for the web so it's basically
their their desktop version of this the
only problem I have with this and it's
that I won't build a whole application
because then I can't embed native code
or use libraries that have native code
in them which I inevitably do in every
project so I prefer to just mock up my
things Expo for the web and then write a
regular react app so how to write a
regular react up I want to say harder
because I I have some background in
mobile development so I already had
things like Xcode and Android studio but
I was trying
- usually I do these kind of talks with
only JavaScript developers or newer
developers because I teach a local group
in Indianapolis and it's it's fairly
difficult to explain to everyone how to
set up Xcode and Android studio and run
emulators particularly I've had trouble
with that on Android so if you don't
want to do that then absolutely create
react native app and though the web
application are a great alternative but
these are just the steps that you would
have to do
now I don't know where one
so music
there we go
okay
and I think I need to
no that's not dating
okay so for a project setup you would
basically after you have you know Xcode
and all that stuff set up its react
native in it and then your app name and
what it does is it sets up all your
Android and iOS build and then you would
run it on whichever platform and the
unfortunate thing is you can only run it
one one emulator at the same time
because it uses a specific port for both
so another reason why I prefer
prototyping things in the web first so
you run it on iOS or Android and then it
brings up
okay
so it'll bring up this screen so it
gives you a default boilerplate
application with an entry point index J
s so this will render your main file app
J s and app j s is just a boilerplate
which will run on both Android and iOS
it's it shows you some things like it
imports the platform so you can select
which platform you on and do different
things on each platform and then it
creates your default class and gives you
some default styling to get started
so I'm gonna go ahead and turn on some
dev tools commander control D brings up
the dev tools and I'm just using iOS
because this is a new computer I don't
even have Android studio yet but it's
pretty much the same for both platforms
I can just turn on you can turn on live
and hot reloading by default and then
start to make changes and they will
automatically hot reloading is just
really convenient if you're like five
screens deep in an application and it'll
just patch the code for you and not take
you all the way back to the home screen
generally speaking you'll be building
both you could set this up in a few
different ways but generally speaking
you would be building both applications
Android and iOS
using the same files and just do
checking where you need to so you'd have
a source file probably drag the app into
here and now it's showing me an error it
filled the load because it's trying to
import a module that's not there
oh yeah so let me just when I run but I
already ran this so I'm not going to
again because sometimes it takes a
minute to start up so when I run react
native run iOS or run Android then it
opens the emulator for me automatically
and then it opens this package er which
will compile and bundle and keep
recompiling and bundling changes as I
update the application for me that will
also handle configuration in iOS and
Android and there's ways by default that
it'll update your plist and your
manifest and all that stuff for you if
you want to so
another thing with react native
sometimes it gives you the error the the
easier to read error in the red part
here directly on the simulator sometimes
it gives you easier to read error in
here they've been doing a lot of work on
how they present errors and generally
speaking I can either find out what it
is here like in this case consumed in
unresolved module app so I know it was
because of the app this error I really
can't read right now but if I do
something like let me just change this
it should say oh it's doing it here
again I guess they updated have the
display errors but it shows me exactly
the line and where it is in the code
sometimes it will be right here and you
can click on the exact file in line and
it'll take you to that file online and
call them in your editor to see where it
is so I just have to change it manually
refresh and it comes back in a react
application you can also do it gives you
web like debugging tools by default so
it gives you some instructions here
basically telling you to open the
console so if I want to this is just
warning me that it's running in the
background because I have it on
different tabs right now so in my render
function I can do console log message
and it pops up here I can also use
debugger and step through functions and
it will pause my application so nothing
loaded yet it's going to posit the
debugger and let me step through as it
normally would in a JavaScript
application so there's a few other ways
to log let me turn off the remote
debugger first
okay you can log directly onto the
application using console dot warn and
this will give me a little yellow
non-intrusive error just saying hey this
is a reminder basically and then I can
clear these and there's also console dot
error you can throw your own errors and
here's where it shows me app KS line 24
column 18 this is where the error was
thrown from and I can go to exactly
where it was thrown thrown from in my
application so inside this application
what you might notice is there's a lot
of styling so you have to style each
individual component there's no
inheritance there's no bundling a big
CSS file separately which is a little
weird at first some people don't like it
I think it's a great way to be able to
maintain code when I used to write more
CSS I would inevitably have a lot of
things overwriting other things or dead
code that's not used anymore that's
still there
so having it small and inside the
component a makes it so I don't have to
set up anything with CSS you know I
don't have to setup sass and compile it
and everything and B it makes it much
easier to maintain so I only have the
styles that I'm actually using at a
given time in my component and I'll get
into style and components in a second
because you know sometimes these Styles
get a little bit long at the file so you
don't want them inside every file so
there's a couple ways of handling that
too
here it is
yeah so how does this work under the
hood it's it's not compiling to a native
binary like something like xamarin does
you actually have a JavaScript engine
running which is running on the J's core
and then you have another thread which
is your native thread and that's running
code written in Java Objective C C++
which is generally you know all written
for you by the react native team and
other libraries that you're using and
then you have this bridge which passages
which serializes and passes commands and
things over the bridge of course that's
the slow part of the application native
is very very performant JavaScript is
also quite fast but since it's built on
one engine the react native team has
optimized it quite a bit for using it
with react native and then another way
they make it more performant is they're
making react native declarative so many
of the libraries you use for example the
animations library you declare your your
animations up front in JavaScript send
it over the bridge once and then all of
the user interactions are handled on the
native side so I have an example of that
in a second and some libraries like
react native navigation which is open
sourced by Wix that's also written
entirely in native so you do the same
thing declaratively you say this is how
I want the navigation to look and feel
in JavaScript and then it's all handled
on the native side which actually allows
you to make it feel like it's an actual
native application versus a JavaScript
application there are also things
written in JavaScript of course the code
that you write is probably going to be
almost entirely or entirely in
JavaScript and then some things from the
react native team some things that don't
need quite as much performance if you
have a small list for example you don't
need to hide things off-screen this is
written entirely in JavaScript and you
don't feel a performance hit and there
are some libraries that have a mix of
you know native versus JavaScript or
some combination of both I used to use a
non native navigation library
but I felt like there was some jank when
there were certain animations and
bounces and things so I started using
react native navigation and it worked a
lot better for me so styling components
like I showed earlier there's there can
get to be a lot of styling in a single
application which is kind of annoying so
what's a good really good way that I've
found to handle that is so you have your
components directory or something
wherever you put all your components and
then I have specific components that I
usually build upfront like headers
buttons things like that are the most
basic examples it depends on the project
of course and then I'll go ahead and
make a wrapper I'll just show this for a
second mm-hmm so here for example I have
a styled button I have all these Styles
associated with buttons that I want to
just pull in and reuse throughout my
application so all I have to do is pass
in the text for the button and then an
on press function how do I want to
handle the button click and then I can
reuse this component wherever I want
without having to copy new styles
everywhere and I also do this a lot of
times with component wrappers if I'm
going to have container styles I'll just
do all my styles in a container and then
pass in the children components and then
they'll be inside that styled container
another thing that's nice is certain
things you want to look different on
Android and iOS so you can have for
example a button dot IO SJS and that
will only be used in an iOS application
so you can just import button from
button see if I have an example this
here it is
so here I'm importing temp I'm just
writing temp and then it automatically
sees oh there's temp and radius and temp
i OS j s so for Android it's only going
to use the temp Android and for iOS it
will only use the iOS by default which
is kind of nice so that's helpful for
styling because that's really where I
need to differentiate most of the time
between its besides small nuances and
things like there are many different
keyboards and stuff most of the time I'm
differentiating based on style so it's
nice to be able to have to usually
almost identical style components but
just small differences between Android
and iOS you can also do this for
checking what platform so if you want
different styling between platforms you
can do that in a single component and
just import platform from react native
and then for iOS or Android you'll check
is the platform OS is it iOS then do
this if it's Android do that and
platform dot select for iOS I have a
setting you are using iOS for Android
you're using Android there's also a
library for Windows Phones that you can
no one's ever asked me to build a
Windows application but if you you know
want to build a Windows application
there's an extension for it there's also
checking under the hood so a lot of
libraries that you use like this date
picker will show up being a native date
picker in iOS and the native you know
cat the little calendar view they have
an Android and the clock picker which is
which is just a library doing this under
the hood and using react native API so
it's checking
hey what platform is this use this react
native API if it's the other platform
use the other one
you can also use react developer tools
like I mentioned before you just install
it
NPM run dev tools and then this is from
the the jiff from the github repo but so
you can basically scrub through it as
you would in the web see all the
different components you can see the
props and state associated with those
different components so this is a great
tool for for debugging State for
updating things on your application
we'll live update on the phone screen
which you can also use with the
inspector so let me just use the
inspector real quick it's also an
inspector which has some chrome like
features you can tap any element here so
I'm just going to tap the heading and
then it shows me if I have margin or
padding associated with it it shows me
where it where it is located in the
application and I can kind of click
through this is this is just an
objective-c native UI component that it
renders to so it shows me the font size
and margin and everything I can see all
the styles associated with it if I'm
using the remote debugger tools then I
can also update those styles as I would
as I would but you can also do that in
the code editor it's the same thing yeah
so debugging already showed that
this is one of the coolest or most
useful features that you can embed to
your own and other people's native code
and react native provides a pretty easy
to use
native API for it you will of course
have to know Java or Kotlin or Objective
C or something to be able to write
native modules and then you just use a
wrapper and you can call these
components that you make and native code
from your react native code and I put
links to both the docs because they have
two really good examples of how to do
that in the docs for Android and for iOS
and then here's an example of how to do
use other people's native code so even
if you're using maybe a hardware API a
new font or something like that you'll
inevitably have to update something in
the plist file and in the XML so instead
of having to do that manually most
libraries I use now and react native
will do that for me all I have to do is
install the library I want to install
via NPM and then use react native link
which handles the configuration for me
in the native code so I can use all this
native code without actually having to
write or configure it for myself
generally unless I have to update
permissions or something ok
there we go
so oh it thinks I'm writing in HTML so I
added very nicely added a closing tag
which I didn't want so this is a web
view if you already have maybe you have
a mobile web application and you want to
reuse some of the screens maybe you're
transitioning this is a really good way
to kind of slowly build react native
into what you already have so you can
use a web view and oh this is really it
parse this really weird I'm I'm using
reveal Jas and doing this oh wait so
anyways all this is right here is wait
so I need to have a URI which will be
something like github comm inside my
source and it will display inside
whatever container or the whole screen
or whatever container I put it in we
will display the entire web page and I
can interact with it normally as I would
on the web and that will be displayed
inside my application so if I have a lot
of web views already and I want to make
some and react native you reuse some
from the web or maybe I'm building an
application where I need to embed web
pages into the application I can still
do this the only thing is then you will
have the same performance issues that
you have with using traditional hybrid
applications because you're using web
views again
another cool thing you can do with react
native because it's built on JavaScript
core is push over-the-air updates for
maybe you have a bug fix or some kind of
small new update that you want all of
your users to have they won't have to
download an update you can push it
without getting approval from the Apple
Store which could take a while it's
variable and you know that all of your
users will have that specific update you
cannot use this for hardware api's
you're not supposed to make huge
breaking changes with this but it's a
very good feature and you can sign up
for free Microsoft has a very good one
that's always free but there are others
available too and here are some of the
companies using react native these are
the three biggest ones Facebook of
course Airbnb and Wix they all have a
ton of great talks online they
open-source a lot of modules written in
native code for me which is awesome
because the more I used react native
when I started using it maybe two and a
half years ago no two years ago
Android wasn't 100% ready it was out
there but you know you couldn't use a
lot of the same features on iOS because
they've spent so much energy building
all these things for their huge user
base then they open source all these
native modules and then you can just npm
install them and react native link and
it's working in your application Walmart
is also using it they said they get
about 96 percent code reshoring between
platforms which is awesome because you
know they have millions and millions of
users Bloomberg Skype these are two
large applications as well Tesla it's a
really nice user experience this cord is
one of my favorites they've been using
react native for years now they first
came out with iOS about a year later I
think they came out with their Android
version and react native it's so smooth
and so native feeling before I read
their blog post actually I had no idea
that it was built and react native so I
want to actually
I'm gonna close this editor I'm going to
show another application real quick I
see 40 minutes
so to open or to run a new new app I
have to terminate not necessarily the
simulator but I have to close the
bundler the react native packager and
then I can react native oh wait react
native run iOS
this is just a dummy application I built
a while back if you haven't heard of
parkour it's a sport mm-hmm it's a sport
that some people do so basically I used
this back when I was playing around with
the animations library you can spin
bounce I didn't have the dragon here but
you can actually drag and drop and it's
all very very smooth and performant and
react native here's an example of the
same datepicker sometimes the emulator
is janky but it's never janky when I use
out an app actual mobile application and
then I have an events list by react
native has default ways you know for the
web if you're loading like thousands of
items you want to load them
incrementally only what's on the screen
react native has some really nice api's
that do that by default with the various
types of ListView so you can either
render them all at once or if you know
you have a variable number or perhaps a
lot of something you only render what's
on the screen which also helps a lot
with performance another great thing is
using fonts so for some reason years ago
I used to have trouble putting custom
fonts in but with react native I just
tell react native where my assets are
and then I just run react native link
and it sees that this are npm
configuration is inside my package JSON
and then it'll set up the fonts for me
so you can see like this is a custom
font and by default you get like I don't
know maybe 80 fonts with iOS but you
only get you know Roboto and serif and
sans-serif and type something in Android
so a lot of times I will use a different
kind of font and I'll just put the font
file in a folder
use an RM p.m. configuration and then
link it and it's all set up in my
project to use and I'd use it exactly
how I would on the web
I'd use font family and all those other
things the difference let me what the
difference is of course all the styling
is JavaScript
so it it's camel cased it has to be
valid JavaScript because it's a
JavaScript object and of course you
won't have things like hover and other
things from the web so there are some
differences flexbox is handled pretty
much the same except it defaults to
column instead of rows for the web which
handles mobile development but you can
reverse that to yeah and a lot of these
things are the same that you would use
on the web let me see
yeah here's the font-family it's called
free Holi
so yeah the there's a few things like
you know emulator crashes and a few
other things which I found when I used
to do mobile development too but
whenever I do run react native link
usually I'll have to restart the
packager because it'll throw some random
read error that you that's unreadable
but you just know okay well I put some
native code it wants me to restart it
and yeah it's kind of annoying that I
can only run one simulator at a time
those are the two most annoying things
and here's my workflow example generally
I will get mock-ups from someone else
sometimes I have to make my own mock-up
there's some great design frameworks
like bootstrap or foundation but for
mobile and I have links to those on the
next slide and if I can use one of those
all the better and then I create usable
reusable components using stacks in the
web and I'll put them inside either a
styling folder or a common folder a lot
of times I can copy/paste things from
previous projects not the business logic
obviously but just the styling and then
I just update it a little bit between
projects I can even copy paste a lot of
my code from the web and just change it
to render to mobile api's instead of
using yeah instead of using things from
the dom also my entire redux setup is
just copied from the web it's exactly
the same as i use and then i plan the
folder component structure setup yes
lint stuff i do for any project anyways
and yeah and then i start building and
it's pretty easy because it gives me
most everything by default I do have to
install react dev tools which I always
install to react and redux dev tools and
here are some links that I find helpful
my favorite
styling kits for react native and then
expo oh it used to be called sketch it's
now called snack snack Expo die oh I'll
fix the naming before I post it and then
if you want to learn styling and math
native there are two really fun games
you can play to learn flexbox and it's
actually quite easy and intuitive to
learn how to lay things out in flexbox
and you can also practice it with this
cool github library called catus it
gives you all these different practices
for seeing how to layout things if you
want to learn more about react native
these three ways are the best that I've
found the Facebook developers channel on
YouTube gives a ton of great content and
all the the react well you can go to
their videos and search for react native
and they have all the talks from
different react conferences and things
tell call he's my favorite react native
speaker he's been a huge proponent of it
for years now he recently gave a really
good talk about performance in react
native which is 28 minutes long and it's
definitely worth watching
and then there's react native newsletter
which I have here so every month you'll
get a newsletter yeah assorted good
things basically different cool things
in the react Native community events
media and this is a great way to stay up
to date pretty easily spend a few
minutes scrolling through this every
month or so and see all the updates this
is one I'm excited about AWS amplify API
for react native since I use AWS a lot
yes that's the newsletter here's another
cool thing that I forgot to show earlier
but people have built lots of games in
react native using the increased
performance and
ease ease of building over native so
this guy built a Minecraft setup which
is awesome
and he actually gives a tutorial here on
YouTube for how to do it and you can see
there's some really difficult things
that you wouldn't be able to do in
traditional hybrid like this gradient
and everything which is kind of
difficult to do but because you can use
the underlying native gradients in
reactant ativ then it actually looks
really cool yeah so here's my
information again do you have any
questions like what
I haven't used one that someone else
didn't already import to react native
but I'm guessing you just use because
any native code you're gonna have to
wrap in the native wrapper for react
native so you can pull in that API and
just wrap it in that and use it you can
if if you use Expo it will show your
logs on the device I don't know because
I test Hardware api's on my device but I
don't see the logs on my computer so
that's a good question I'm wondering how
I should do that okay thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
