banking app for a customer we have and
the technology of choice was salmon and
of course being a online bank security
is paramount so we had this third-party
SDK that we had to integrate the word
soon but we hit a bit of a roadblock
trying to integrate with it it only work
partially sort of in salmon and we were
having like a really hard time trying to
debug what was wrong so of course given
some time we were kind of frustrated so
I tried another approach one morning I
decided to recreate the app in react
native because I was kind of really
weighted already and it worked
totally fine so basically in one morning
I recreated the whole app with the same
functionality before I went to eat lunch
so hi everybody and welcome to my talk
about react native my name is Christian
and I'm a senior consultant at NOAA net
where our consultancy firm here in Oslo
working primarily with net but today I
want to talk about react native which is
a framework by Facebook for making apps
with JavaScript now ten minutes is not a
lot of times I just go into the basics
and then I'll follow it up with a couple
of key reasons for why I think you
should be using react native so the
boring bits first getting started just
with dogs the instructions may vary
depending on your OS but the most
important list is installing the CLI
react native CLI and for iOS installing
Xcode and for Android and Winston do and
a couple ester SDKs so once you've done
that you can go to your command line and
type reactionary in it and some project
name and this will create your hello
world project which is a starting point
for your app and once you've done that
you can go to your command line again
and just type react native run iOS or
run Android inside your working
directory and that will open the app in
you
or emulator or device depending on what
you have connected so as you see here
here's be basically a hello world view
with some basic information on what to
get and what to do next and if you want
to edit this view the app called all the
vehicle itself is located in the
generated project so we have two
JavaScript files which are generated
other things that are generated as well
or to native projects for one for iOS
one for Android as well as the init
command will download several NPM
packages and install them into your node
modules folder so if we drill into the
package JSON file which describes these
dependencies then we only will you see
to react native of course and react j/s
which is a pair dependency of react
native now the last bit there is kind of
important because react native does not
work without react is it directly
depends upon react yes so when you're
making the app you're basically writing
a JavaScript app and you're writing a
react app using components gas-x State
and props and you also have the virtual
DOM and the different algorithm working
under the hood now the scope of this
talk is not to teach you react Jaso dive
directly into those concepts other than
to say that if you already know react
yes that's awesome that's a plus but at
the same time if you don't totally fine
too because it's really easy to get
going with the react native app and it's
easy to learn as you go along and
basically that's what I did so the
interesting parts comes up when you talk
about the differences between the two
which on the surface at least aren't a
whole lot so I have an example here here
is the same component written in both
react.js
and react native and of course the
render function returns JSX as it's
called the UI code but of course you see
the difference is with react yes it
returns HTML with react native it
returns native elements which are
defined by the library and so your
typical div
becomes a view tag and your span tags
become text and so on there are of
course of their minor differences and
some bigger ones but I won't go into
them now the only point here is my only
point here is to illustrate that both
are using react components with the same
life cycles state and props things you
will know from using it in web so just
like with react yes you can use
components inside other components and
send in behavior and values through
props from parent component into child
component and in this way you can
compose together many react components
and using a domain logic to the side
here is a certain Society in plain
JavaScript and in this way make a
complete app and that's the basics of
react native I could there's many more
concepts to talk about but that's the
basics so to get back to the points I
made during the intro why did we choose
to go for react native and what are
potential reasons for why you should
choose it I have a couple of key reasons
them so first off quick iterations so
with react native it's easy to prototype
in your app and then quickly iterate
that app towards something that is
production worthy and you can do this
because you really need to compile the
app so I have an example here here's
your basic calendar app with a view that
keeps on coming up and I hike and remove
and I can add etc and if I've gone into
the dev menu here and enabled hot
reloading which I've already done then I
can change any style this nostalgic you
have code any part of the Java Script
and it will instantly update in the
emulator or device so for example let's
say I'm not really that satisfied with
the font texture I can say it's right
there
same with the text who knows what
decrement greens so let's call it I add
save and it updates and as you may see
the color keeps on coming up which means
the state of the app continues and it
can do this because it's only hot
patching in the bits that have changed
and this gives you basically this means
you for example can be on a screen which
is far into some navigation tree and you
don't have to reload or recompile the
app and then navigate all the way back
to that screen in order to view your
changes it's just there instantly and
this means a quicker feedback loop and
you're more productive so that's number
one number two you can reuse existing
web development skills so you might be
familiar with hybrid apps and just like
there you can use Java Script but you
also have access to more advanced year 6
and year 7 features and to make it even
more like making a web app you also they
have also we implemented several
familiar functions like set interval set
timeout console.log stuff you might be
familiar with but I think probably the
coolest thing about developing react
native apps is that I can debug with
Chrome which is really powerful so I
have an example here as well so let's
say I gone into the DEM menu I can type
the menu and enable remote debugging
which I'm already done then I can go to
this form here which is basically a
sign-up form so looking into the code
the first input field the first name
field has a callback and it's the
unchanged text preparer and that is
bound to the on change name function
here on the component and that will in
turn use console.log to log out in the
chrome console so if I open up that one
basically it gives you some basic
information on what to do but if I go
into the console here and I start typing
it's logging out not so amazing but
something you would expect from web but
I can do one further I can go into the
sources and add a breakpoint into that
function and if I then go back to the
app and continue typing it will break
into the same function and like web I
get calls back I get scope variables
everything I would expect and this makes
it really easy to debug the logic of
your app which i think is awesome other
things this is a JavaScript app so you
can use mmm packages from the J's equal
system and this is huge in my opinion
because this there's already a lot of
utilities available for both web and
nodejs which you can reuse because we
use everything but most another cool
thing is to first see sharp developers
error it's easy to add static typing
with type scripts or flow which gives
you
for example I've done that in my demo
app so I get both intellisense warnings
compile error errors and so on Third
Point cross-platform code so with react
native the same code will run on both
iOS and Android it's JavaScript code but
what may not be apparent here is that
the same UI code will render on both iOS
and Android but was either what's really
important to remember is that the views
unlike hybrid apps are not running
inside a browser or a webview they are
actually rendering native elements so
basically the JSX code is translated to
native elements and will render as such
and in that way make the app look like a
native app and not only that you also
get native animations with the native
driver which means the app will feel
like a native app and in this way
basically a react app react native app
is indistinguishable from a native app
so at this point I probably sound like a
huge fan of reactive which I am I'll see
if I am nothing bad to say about it but
is it a silver bullet
no definitely not it depends on your use
case but the scope of that discussion is
a bit too long so I'll rather invite you
to come up to me later after the talk
and discuss it with me so conclusion
react native allows you to write a
cross-platform app which is
indistinguishable from the native app
using a single language javascript using
scales and tools you may already be
familiar with and it lets you be
productive in this way
questions yeah yeah absolutely
for example any type of games anything
like that makes no sense to use react
lady
there are there like I said you have
native animations but some of the
animations are rendered with JavaScript
so if there's some huge performance
issue you need to tackle then that might
be a thing but even then react native
will probably give you the speed you
want with the virtual DOM and different
algorithm already being so quick and
honestly like comparing it to something
like salmon which I've also work with I
don't want to talk bad about something
if you have just a c-sharp team that may
suit your use case but yeah basically
that depends depends depends on what
your team knows but I find JavaScript to
be a sort of language that unites many
many developers so we have some
front-end developers some girl some
c-sharp then maybe rectly will unite
them to be able to work on one common
app yeah any other questions
you mean like it like a like a like a
universal web app or something like that
totally fine I mean it depends on what
your customer wants
I've looked somewhat into that and it
looks compelling in its own way but it
it may be more difficult to actually
work with native libraries and stuff
like that if for example in this banking
app we had to use a security SDK which
was kind of important and the whole
point most that we wanted easier
fingerprint logins and stuff like that
and that enabled that so again depends
on your use case and react native is not
a silver bullet is it yeah a lot of them
are I mean since it's open-source a lot
of them are provided by other
contributors in the open source world I
have two libraries actually Oregon
Google Analytics and one for Android
buildings so look up those if you want
but a lot of it is already ported so I
mean the only I can't think of anything
that's not important actually and it's
not really a matter of porting it's more
about building a bridge between
JavaScript and the native side which is
pretty simple actually
I'm not sure how I am on time but done
yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
