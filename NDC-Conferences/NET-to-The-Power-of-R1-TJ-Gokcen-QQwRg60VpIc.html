coming to this first session we're just
gonna talk about art today and in this
first session of the day I'm sorry to do
this to you but now I apologize in level
that's out of the way there's a bit of
echo sorry
my name is TJ and I work for a company
called equate we own the company I own
the company and we basically help
companies become agile in quality and
customer sent centric through data
analysis and software development that's
what we do so I want to talk about what
we are going to do today we're gonna
talk about our and why it's important
why is this hype about art and then
we're going to look at what is our I'm
going to look into statistics of it and
after that we're gonna have a little
brief intro just run couple commands on
R and then we're gonna do a showcase our
what it can do especially if it's it's
graphic capabilities and what it can do
and cannot and then we're going to build
a little dashboard MVC app with our
integrated in it and even though
everybody says or you cannot really use
it in production we do it all the time
and this simple application will show
you and believe it or not that dashboard
doesn't it m is the application is the
shortest and the fastest and the easiest
part of the whole talk you see how easy
it is once you get the art part out so I
just want to ask you before I go any
further how many people here have heard
of our ok
how many people are using our ok the
people who are using our are you all
data scientists
okay the answer was basically you just
wanna you're looking into ways of
integrating our with.net and if we can
pull some the results the analytic
results of our into that Net
Applications okay well hopefully I'll
show it today because today we're gonna
stay in Microsoft ecosystem all together
we're not going to look into any other
IDs although I might mention them and
we're going to just work in visual
studio so hopefully that will answer
your question and give you some kind of
guidance so how this can be achieved all
right so let's look at why are why why
is this our thing so important for us
for years we actually looked into
collecting data correctly because we had
a huge problem in the history of if you
look at the computer science in the 80s
and 90s the systems were not stable the
applications were not stable so we were
trying to get data actually the
important thing was to get the
applications work and get it right but
now we actually overcome this problem
and if you have been to these sessions
yesterday you know that we are actually
collecting too much data we are
collecting data from people from
websites from mobile applications error
logs usage logs every kinds of trends
you know we're collecting and we know
how what Amazon does for example and
they are actually the perfect example of
collecting data so we have too much of
it with too much data we now have couple
problems one of them is what we call big
data we have so much data that we need
to make sense of this data somehow and
then on top of it the big data focuses
on general trends and tries to make
sense of the big picture then we have
what what I call small data small data
focuses on
individual trends so if I have to give
you an Amazon example for example when
you're looking at the general trends who
how many people buy what kind of books
and all that that will be analyzing big
data if you just look at TJ what TJ is
doing in Amazon what books is purchasing
and all that that would be the small
data and with both of them on the rise
and companies not just software
companies but manufacturing companies
retail companies are getting into
collecting this data and trying to make
sense of it
now data science is actually becoming
more and more popular and when data
science becomes more popular the tools
they use kind of get focused as well and
for years the number one choice for data
scientists was a language called Python
how many of you have heard of Python
almost all of you how many have you used
Python cool so you know what I'm talking
about Python is a general-purpose
language as you know so you can actually
do some data analytics as well as get
into web applications you can do web
pages and web applications with it it
can still be argued that it's number one
tool it is popular because of its
awesome packages especially on the data
analysis side although nowhere near as
are and then we have art with this very
high tech logo that looks like it just
jumped out from 90s art came alone and
you might wonder at that point what our
code looks like I don't know if you can
see this but this is basically art is it
intuitive easy enough do you think we
can just pick it up in the next half an
hour so with that logo that I just
showed you and with that code in mind we
can say this about art the best thing
about our that it was written by
statisticians so basically when it comes
to statistical analysis are is really
have any equal in that sense so it has
awesome tools for data scientists and it
is shining in that what is the worst
thing about our well again it's written
by statisticians so if you look at our
code our packages or if you're looking
into the ways the patterns that we're
using in our day-to-day UI building
applications well do not expect that in
our our code is a bit less structured
than what we're used to so and there is
a reason for it because for data
scientists programming or how they
program is second to data analysis for
them the important thing is analysing
the data and getting the correct answers
back so if you look at our n pythons
popularity between 2013 and basically
last year we'll see that R which is the
orange line will see that R is actually
on the rise of it up until 2014 then
about 2015 onwards it declined in
popularity now it's gaining back again
and can you make a guess why you think
it actually declined in 2015 no actually
I don't know if it's related or not in
2015 Microsoft has purchased a
revolution analytics and it's a very
leading our tools company and they
started to make some integrate our into
their packages which we will come to
that at the end of this talk it looks
like at that time and it may or may not
be related I'm just saying this because
that's just a trend we have Microsoft
purchasing it because open-source people
generally have this prejudice against
Microsoft it might have led to its
decline in popularity but then when they
saw later on how Microsoft is
integrating our and is actually
respecting the open source property of
it they actually it started to become
again and on that one Microsoft is
actually doing a lot of great things for
example they're working on a new math
library for our that takes better
advantage of the Intel chips and people
know this so if you look at the data
scientist tools that are being used
today in 2016 we see that are is
actually leading the way with Python
second hand behind but if you take them
all together at a data scientist tool
you'll see how much far ahead they are
compared to other ones what's surprising
to me is we still have Excel here and we
still have a sequel server yes no I
don't think so
I think they just look nice if they're
all white then it could be to be honest
with you I didn't check that out but if
you look at it it could be data
scientist tools and this looks like more
about C cool stuff and this is Hadoop
tableau and tableau tableau and for
example R is kind of close and because
they both analyze the data so this is
this one this one actually is based on K
do nots Paul that's the number of users
who answered they are using this tool
you cannot see this but the whole
population size is about 3,000 2895 I
think and here it's about 1,400 people
1450 is using R and Python is about
1,300 but mind you that's just one poll
and the population size is quite small
three thousand is not too big to come to
a conclusion correct conclusion but I
still wanted to show you this and then
second one is about the language ranking
from our site called OEE spectrum this
is a technical engineering and science
news site so they do this poll again on
their users they say hey which languages
you use and on that one C actually comes
out on top and you can see their things
rankings but what
important areas are is at number five
now there is a big difference between
our and the rest of the tools because
our is the only one that is
domain-specific language or cannot be
used for anything else other than data
analytics everything else can be used by
for a variety of different applications
and that's really important to know so
basically are just being in this niche
market still is holding on and it's
actually rising I think it was sixth or
seventh the year before the questions on
stack flow when we go on this about our
has actually reasons for the six percent
from last year so last year they were
you know they're almost doubled almost
46% more questions on staff flow and
then on academic circles are is used a
lot and we can see this by in 2016 there
was about thirty nine papers that
mentioned art who used are in their
statistical analysis calculations in
2016 that number has risen from 39 to
244 that's a big job so our is getting
popular popular basically so what
happens is there are scientists today
end up learning both of the languages
because python and r are used together a
lot and this is basically how it goes
r has a lot of awesome packages which we
will see for data analysis and the data
scientist goes and analyzes the data in
R then but in its own form R it just
produces a picture or a table right an
image or a table a graph with that it's
not merely enough for the executives to
have something you need to put it in a
dashboard or in some kind of a format
that the executives can understand so
what they do is they give it to some
developers who has Python knowledge and
who can develop web applications for
Python why Python because python is has
the closest number of packages in terms
of statistical analysis to R but
you can see how bad and wasteful this
process is because you're working code
in one language and you have to give it
to somebody else who has to do the same
thing produce the same thing in another
language and put it in a web application
so what we're trying to do today is
hopefully overcome this and show me a
way that hey we can just use our as is
so let's go and look at what our is but
we have seen this beautiful logo but
let's go now past the logo and take a
brief look at what our is our is
basically an open source statistical
language and I will come to that
language part in a bit is it a language
or is it something else
just as we have NuGet packages or has
their own you get packages so to speak
and it's called cran for strength I
don't know how you read have you to call
it um I'm not English natively speaking
so you can call it anything you want but
it's basically stands for comprehensive
or archive network same as NuGet
packages you just go and install
different packages that you want to use
for and those packages though are not
like you get packages in the sense of
functionality they're mostly statistical
analysis packages that you use which we
will again see we said it is the de
facto standard for statistical research
so it's used heavily in academic circles
it has a father language that it's
called s so I don't know if it's
important trivial it trivia for you it's
coming from a language called s and now
we have R it looks like we're going
backwards so hopefully in few years we
might have a queue we don't know that
yet so I said is it a language or is it
something else and that is important for
to understand R is it is our a language
on its own or is it or is it a
statistical environment that just uses a
language and this is an important
instinct to make because to use our it's
not like picking up angular it's not
like picking up react right too
actually get most out of our you need to
have knowledge of statistics if you're
gonna program in our so today what I'm
going to be concentrating on is in the
company that you have you have some data
scientists you have some people who know
are and they use these scripts they
create these scripts for data analysis
and they've given it to you so you're
gonna use their scripts although we're
going to look at the scripts and how
they're structured as well so R is an
interpreted language and domain-specific
language and we said python is
general-purpose so is there another tool
that data scientists use you may ask and
I will say hey I'm glad you asked
and I'm gonna tell you it's called SAS
it stands for statistical analysis
system and it's a software suite again
for data scientists it has all the bells
and whistles but it is very expensive or
is open source and sois Python and so
therefore both of them are free so at
this point we may also ask hey why do
the scientists need a language can't
they just use one of the languages but
that we already have and be done with it
for example you know database language a
c-sharp or Java no actually they can't
they use a language the same reason why
we need T sequel to just as you when you
when it comes to database manipulation T
sequel or sequel language is the best
language for that purpose so is R is the
best language for statistical analysis
because it does manipulation on tables
better than anybody else it does vector
operations vector is a very basic data
structure in our we'll see in a couple
minutes and it does data manipulation
and interactive data analysis better
than anyone else so that's why they
needed a language to do some statistics
so let's look at statistics and we'll
say hey hello statistics
statistics are good because they
actually help you get your point across
they help you get your point across even
though it may be meaningless
you still make better sense when you
give something in statistics and put it
in some visualization and it actually
gives you impressive stuff as well when
they are put in a graph but more
importantly statistics help us make
confident decisions when we have limited
information so let's take a look at this
let's take a look at what I mean by this
let's say we want to know the average
weight of all people in a country what
do we do in this case well we can just
go and weigh everybody one by one but
for practical reasons we can't do that
right it's impossible to go through
everybody in a country and weighing one
by one and then divide it to the number
of people and get an average weight so
what the statists a sample and they try
to be as diverse as possible and they
calculate the average weight of that
population and from that from that
limited sample they go into the general
and they say hey ok this is the average
weight of this population and they do
this using some statistical tools but it
is very important for data to be
unbiased and clean and that's why
statistics statistics and data
scientists spend a lot of time and I
mean a lot more than half of their time
on cleaning and pruning data that they
have because it is very important to
them so basically we need to use the
right statistical tools to make
decisions with limited information and
on top of it we said the worst thing
about are that it was written by
statisticians well they do not think
like programmers they do not think like
mathematicians either even though they
use math they have a different mindset
and
for them it's all about data integrity
and what the patterns are in that data
but statistics has a part of lives is
part of our lives and has a lot of
things that we use most of the tools and
concepts we use today are coming from
Statistics how many of you have heard of
either of these guys okay well the ones
that you do you will know that doctor
wrote to dr. Deming is a student of dr.
shewhart and dr. Schubert is coming from
1930s and dr. Deming is obviously from
40s on words and both agile and lean
tools that we use today have roots in
these guys and actually I will go as far
as saying that Lean Startup the idea of
Lean Startup have something have an
experiment and then test it and then
release it test it and then go back and
change it again is coming from short
from 1930s if you want to find out more
about these two guys or how they
actually affected edge Arlene and all
these moments I will have asked me
anything at level two at the SSW booth
after this so now let's look at our in a
nutshell um I'm thinking you board over
the slides a bit but let's go to visual
studio
so miss your studio I said sorry
Microsoft has bought an application a
company called revolution analytics and
revolution analytics has a program
called our studio and that is actually
the standard in using our everybody use
it it's a free studio it has a
commercial offering as well but since
Microsoft purchased our sorry revolution
analytics they actually have released
visual studio tools are tools for visual
studio they also released Python tools
for visual studio so they have both of
them just in case you want to know and
this is the one that is installed with
it you have to install the art tools for
visual studio and then are itself the
are engine itself as well as a math
library which is called mkl for all this
to work and you can get this easily if
just go and say install these are tools
for visual studio so we run our code in
the our interactive window here and most
of the times you need to realize are is
basically designed for one computer so
the data scientist gets and does
whatever it needs to do and it actually
runs it on its computer and it does the
analysis it spits out some data or some
image and then that's it he's done with
it right then he uses in its report or
dashboard or whatever to make sense more
of it or to explain it so it is usually
or historically used in one computer so
if I need to look at it are the first
thing you will see is this little sign
and it basically says problems this is
easier it probably says hey whatever I
do here just assign it to this variable
this is the same as X sorry this is the
same as equal so if I run this code and
I can just run this by a control enter
selecting it you see that it says hey
okay I'll run this code for you in the
interactive so now I'm gonna look at hey
give me what X is
of course
give me what X is and it has given me
the X values that you get this up a bit
it's a bit better so now we have the X X
numbers here and you can see what I have
and this is called the vector right the
vector has to be the same data-type but
if I do this and if I go and ask for X
again you will see that it does the same
so once you see that's the first thing
though in all of the our codes that I
have looked at or seen nobody uses the
equal sign they always use this
assigning sign so first of all do not
get off you know put off by when you see
this sign is actually it means equal so
that's the most important thing we may
see it oh my god what is this so then it
makes a bit easier so if you look at for
example some of the things that art can
do I want to get the second highest
value in our so and it just gives me 93
right so and I want to get the third
element and it turns out to be it's
still 93 and you can see it here or I
want to define a vector with Fahrenheit
in degrees so I have a bunch of
Fahrenheit C means combined so it just
combines these values and so I have
bunch of values in Fahrenheit that I
want to put on so what I do is right now
I have this temps I put it in them in my
temps variable and if I go and write
this it will give me what what the
vector is now there is an easier way to
see all of this data in art our tools
this little thing is I usually have this
all open it's just I apologize the
screen resolution we
here is pretty low there is this thing
called variable explorer and whenever
you put something into a variable it
actually gives you all of the variables
it has look I've been using n because we
used it for the sorting and we had temps
variable and we had the X right so last
one was the temps if you remember we put
Fahrenheit values in it so I can look at
this I can drill down into my data see
what what it was I can actually look at
item details and it gives me in a table
structure that I can look at and if you
click on the things I can actually sort
it by clicking on the column names and
on top of it I can actually click on
this little X and it will put this data
into excel sheet for me so it gives you
some really nice tools around the bar
and this is out of the box this is free
for everybody and it gives you some
really nice tools to look at the data to
explore its it may not be necessary in
you know when you have five rows like
this but when you have a few hundred
even a few hundred gets really
complicated and you may want to look at
data so another thing with our is we
said everything is retro so what I'm
gonna say remember this is a vectorial
thing right variable and I have bunch of
values in it I have one two three four
five values in it so when I do - 32 when
I say hey subtract mind 32 from this
vector variable what do you think will
happen yes exactly it's going to go and
take 32 from each and that's important
to know because if you want to do one of
them just one of them you have to
actually extract that variable first and
then do the subtraction or whatever
calculation you want to do so if you
want to do conversion to Celsius
we just go like that and again it does
it on all of them as you can see I don't
have to go I don't have to put it in a
for each or for loop or whatever it does
it all just like we would do in any
sequel so if we define two different
vectors and I have two different values
here so I have X 1 and X 2 and right now
they have values if I want to find the
difference of them I can just say this
and it will give me the difference
between each one of them between 2 and
1/4 and 3/8 and 9/16 and 27 and if you
have different sizes or vectors you will
get another way to push on them so let's
look at some other examples so far so
good on they are this is just the basic
very simple are things the reason I'm
showing you this is for some reason you
come across some are code do not be put
off it actually you know I just wanted
to get you familiar familiar with the
syntax of the code so I'm gonna be
looking at US elections their heights
people's heights and we're gonna go from
2008 to 1948 and we're gonna see how
easy it is to do this in R so I'm gonna
actually go and clean my screen and I'm
gonna clear my variables so these are
the heights of the u.s. election winners
since we're in an election year and
these are the heights of the opponents
so let's run this and now we have this
data in our winners and opponents and if
you look at our variable Explorer we
have our winners here awesome
and we have our sorry we have our
opponents and we have our winners and
those are their heights so what I want
to know is first of all hey how many
records do I have in each so we can just
use this little code to say hey ok we
have 16 years but one thing we do not
have we said hey we're going to look at
this data from 1948 to 2
thousand eight right we don't have date
years in this data so we have to assign
data years to them so we just say hey
just give me a sequence from starting
from 2008 it just reads like English
give me a sequence from starting from
2008 go back to 1947 and just subtract
it by four but as you can see our just
is really really easy when it comes to
operations like this it's just one liner
and we will see some pretty complicated
graphics created by 15 lines of code 20
lines of code at most so and with this
now we have the years I'll just show it
to you here we have all of the years it
just did it for us now what I want to do
is actually on this one when it's the
winner these two 188 actually belong to
President Clinton and apparently he is
189 not 188 so what I want to do is I
want to change the values of the fourth
and the fifth rows and basically I just
say hey just go to my Boehner fourth and
fifth row and assign them one in 189 so
once I do that and look at winner right
now as you can see I have two 189 on the
fourth and the fifth rows and now let's
get into why R is so great we can get
mean value of the winners and the same
as we can get the mean value of the
opponents we can get the difference
between we can get the difference
between winner on opponent just by just
as we have done with the other example
and it just basically gives us and I
have to write difference
so those are the differences between
each one of them and then I can actually
say hey did the taller person one on any
given year and if you look at it I need
to expand this a bit if you look at this
it will say for each year if it's true
or not but as you can see at this point
the data is still very disconnected
right the years are somewhere if they
want some or not is somewhere else the
weights are on another variable so that
this kind of looks like it's all over
the place so now what we're going to do
is we're going to put this in a
something called a data frame to
actually make more sense out of it so
when I do this I get data like this so
here I say data frame just think of them
as table that's the easiest way I can
explain and what I said is hey put the
years the vineyards opponents difference
and everything because I know the number
of the roads are the same on that one so
it's just gonna mesh them up and put
them together and to make things easier
actually because this screen is thing
let's say let's make it to YY
so now it actually has put everything
all together even though they were in
different variables so you can see it's
actually pretty easy to use once you get
some handling to do some data
manipulation and play with the data so
now because we're statisticians we want
to see what's the percentage of the
taller candidate winning and it just
gives us hey first of all I want to know
how many that they have won and it says
the total candidate has chance of 75%
winning than the shorter candidate and
then I don't have this package and I
don't have good internet so right now
I'm just gonna pluck this we're gonna
put it in a graphic then what it did is
it just put a Clutton thing here the
opponent heights and here are the winner
heights but as you can see it's really
really easy to make graphics and
visualization of data with our so one
last thing I want to show you in this
introduction to R is R has some datasets
in it so again let's clear this up to
help you out to to demonstrate what I
can do so one of them is called USR
arrests and that actually gives you an
murder assault and all those you know
crime types and and some numbers with it
how many of them and this is just a
demonstration data set that R has that
you can actually get a lot of
information from just to play with or
you can google this it's very easy to
find out you I can find how many rows it
has it has 50 rows I can actually return
a vector with number of rows and columns
so it says hey you have 50 rows and 4
columns here
and I can put this into a matrix and
once I put it into a matrix and as you
can see when I don't put it into
variables it actually displays the data
right in the set for me but now I have
arrests and I can actually now get some
what the data is what the type of the
data is and this type of the data is
important because we need to kind of you
know you don't want to compare apples to
oranges and all that then we can get
some summary statistics and as you can
see with just one code and this is
really important for statisticians to
know that and you get all the medians
and maximums and first quadrants
third quadrants all the data that you
want to get from R and of course what's
data without visualization so now I just
put it in a our plot that probably
nobody else but the scientists can
understand but as you can see the plot
data it's it's small but it's just to
demonstrate how data visualization works
with our
so with that introduction to our let's
take a look at some of the
visualizations you can actually achieve
with our this is from Wikipedia
Wikipedia I think this is the expect
since male and female life expectancy at
Birth on different countries and
somebody just said okay there are
scientists there is a lot of good places
on earth there is a place called our
bloggers and they actually just put up
some code and some studies because you
know just as we code for huh being they
do these kind of things for happy on
their spare time the data scientists and
they put these codes and they're really
good to study and see how people are
using different packages so we wanted to
get something like this tool like this
graphic and what we do is we actually
again go back to our and this is the
code that actually gets this done I'm
not going to run this because I cannot
connect to plotly here but I can show
you the data that comes out of this is
this so that code produces this and the
good thing about this is is this this
graphic is interactive and you get this
again out of the box I can close down I
can look at Africa I can include America
Asia and all that and you just get this
out of the box and I think that's just
awesome
with practically few lines of code and
you can see how you can use different
packages we will go into this
and then another graphics and this is
there was a European football
championship just few months ago you
were 2016 in France and this is a study
on the players of country of birth and
where they actually play with because
you don't necessarily play for the
country that you're born in and they
just wanted to see the correlation and
the data the relationship with this and
the good thing is this data is scraped
from Wikipedia so they even use any
other data source or you know they
didn't make huge data before I go and
show you the code of this if you look at
this graphic just a bit zoom coming in
and you can see how many they're
connected to different countries and all
that so just just another example of the
visualization capabilities of our and
what you can produce and the data
actually is span across multiple things
what he does is I can show you one of
them he basically just goes and gets the
first we get the data into CSV files we
scraped the data from Wikipedia into CSV
files and then basically it goes through
all of them and then creates the circle
it's a bit more complicated than the
other example but so was the graph and
while we're here I just want to show you
a couple more things this is a code that
goes into state populations I wanted to
just do a very simple approach oh I
wanted to show Australia map with states
colored and state populations right
simple enough I just want to do this and
I'm just going to get the data from
Wikipedia and you can see this here I'm
gonna hit this address and this address
is actually here I'm hitting this one oh
sorry
State Center I don't have this open I
can't connect and I'm not gonna bother
but believe me I will put this on github
you can actually try it we're gonna get
this Wikipedia code and then we're gonna
read it into a table as you can see
we're gonna get the HTML table what
happens and then we're going to do some
transformations on the data and then
we're going to put it into a map and
your result is going to be look like
sorry this so this spits out and the
reason I showed you in this is because
if I run this it's gonna give me it's
been giving me some
some trouble because of the connection
issues that are being having but when
you run and you Canada as I said you can
download it from github and run it on
your own computer when you run it it
gives you something like this
with the population so I can actually
maybe it's down a bit so you can
actually see it put population and it
actually colored the states according to
the population that it has and once you
go over the states it just basically
hovers over the state and gives you the
population and again this is only in few
lines of code that we had here this is
the code that produces that graphic last
but not least and this is the list of
airports this is for Adam because he
likes airports and anything that has to
do with Airlines we're just going to go
to Wikipedia in this one and we're just
going to get all of these airports we're
going to scrape these and we're gonna
put them into our data set and then
we're gonna plot this in Australian map
and the code that does this is basically
this again we install whatever packages
we need to do remember these are our new
get packages and then we go to this web
address we scrape the data we put them
into data frames and we basically just
look at different data States combine
the states get the column names and we
have some libraries to do and with some
jello coding now this is what happens
basically what we do here is at this
point if you look at the Wikipedia it
only has the name of the town and the
name of the airport and some airport
codes it doesn't have anything else but
for us to actually correctly plot this
on the map we need latitude and
longitude values so this code it
actually uses the Google map Gigi map
package and it goes to web and for each
address it actually goes hey where is
this town give me a longitudinal
latitude for this town and it just gets
two plots and then it puts it into a
plot this alone takes about ten minutes
so that's why I'm not gonna do it right
now but I will show you the code the
result and on top of it we have a little
jQuery library called data tables how
many of you have heard uh no tables do
you work with data tables in your
visualization well this is what what it
does the library DT is the data tables
library and I'm going to put my data
into data tables table so I don't
necessarily always need to spit out a
graphic or an image I can actually spit
out the table as well and then here I'm
just gonna put it into a map so when we
look at the data this is the data table
one as you're all used to we can have
pagination and all that and I can
actually do normal filtering and this is
just out of the box that a table
functionality and this is the resulting
plotting graphic now on this on this map
I do have a couple problems because I
don't have anything in Queensland on
anything in Western Australia and the
reason for that is I didn't spend too
much time in pruning the data remember
we talked about pruning data making sure
the data is clean and here I actually
did not get the correct results and if I
look at the whole world some of them are
in like China and all that so it just
got the wrong names a couple of them are
in the States I think they turns out
there are same town names as we do in
the States and it just gets them but
just by printing the data more making
more specific of the data and all that
you can actually get to that
so with that I just wanted to get into
our dashboard application and I want to
show you the code for that and what
approach I took to build a automated DBC
dashboard with our we're going back and
forth all right last but not least and I
say this is the easiest part of
everything that I have shown you
actually what we do with our is we
actually have a project here solution as
you can see I call it Northwind
dashboard I'm going to be using
Northwind database and there's a guy
from New Zealand Sergey do know I think
this is based on his example from few
years ago but our package and the code
structure has changed quite a bit so
what I did is I actually print that data
a bit I actually made it automated and
fit more into the MVC framework and so
thanks to him for providing this data
for us too and what we're going to do is
we're actually going to run this on our
page and at the beginning
it looks like this so we have nothing
right now in this code the way we work
with this is on our solution we have an
analytics package and this is the our
project we have all of our code there
which we will run through and then we
have our MBC Northwind dashboard project
this is a vanilla out-of-the-box I did
nothing to it I just basically said
create new and it even created I didn't
even touch those it created all of the
about and and you know what not for me I
just got rid of them and it uses
bootstrap as we will see the way it
works is we have a home controller and
just that on the home controller I
created a class called our script and
this is where I run each of these
scripts this common KPI what I say our
script run common KPI it goes and runs
this code what I say trance KPI it goes
and runs this code so if you look at
this our script
basically what it does is hey I'm going
to now this is important because it
needs to find something on the server
and there were we were having some
discussions how can I get this into
local locality this is how we get it you
just define where your file names are
going to be and this is on my on my hard
drive and then we basically done say hey
you know what your script there's a
script executable and this is our engine
this is the our engine and we're
basically saying this program to say
using this our engine run the script in
this file and that's all there is to it
when it does from there on it's just a
normal standard shell execute and it
closes and it it turns back to the
controller and basically that's that's
all it does and on my index now if I
just get this
on my index I have something called Lord
HTML you might realize this it's not
render partial or anything because this
code that I will just show you one of
them it actually spits out on an HTML
but it doesn't spit out an HTML that I
can use or I would like to use or in any
format so what I do is to turn it into
an HTML I just created a little HTML
helper that says hey you know what get
this string and then I'm gonna put this
in two data frames and then basically
just turn them into tables which are
your standard bootstrap tables nothing
else so we just turn a data frame into a
HTML table so we could actually
visualize it on the webpage and that's
all there is to it and if I look at this
common KPI
what I do here is I use couple of
libraries that I need to use and I
connect to my database then I say hey
run this view on sequel and it does so I
use here a bit of sequel server to get
the data that I want because I just
massage the data a bit from sequel
server because it's northfield has you
know a bunch of tables so I just need
the view that I need and then I close my
connection I go into some of the
calculations that I need to do and then
basically I say hey you know what you
also have a HTML directory like this and
here I have a directory that says on the
content I created an HTML content and
it's going to put the HTML fields or
whatever it produces there so I know
where to read them from and after that
it's I just choose the same name as the
script that I'm calling so I can
actually see what I called without
looking into the code and then it just
spits out the HTML and it sets a working
directory that working directory is our
thing
and you just need to set it for so it
can work on that directory other than
anything else otherwise it's gonna I
think go to its own directory and now
that I have I think I didn't save this
now that I uncommented this code when I
run this that's actually gonna give me
some table with some trends on it and I
will write a blog on this and I will put
this code on github sure sure in bunch
of stuff for example we use in some of
the cases the caching of the MVC pages
so that that helps and you can also use
we just use the readers for caching the
data and spitting out the image and all
that
are you going to further
well the question is at this point the
UI or the application UI just spits out
this into Aztecs and it's not aware of
this 270 because the data is created
that way is there a way to use this data
or sort it out I would say if you're
just going to do UI sorting you can just
put it into the data tables as I said so
you can use there is nothing that
prevents you saying that you can put it
into a jquery table or whatever you want
to use in the second one is once you
have the AR you can actually write it
back to some kind of our table you know
you can I use as simple as possible but
I can use some daytime tags on on our
table and I can put that data back from
our to sequel after I do everything then
I can actually use this application to
read the data from sequel it does yes
yes for that look at two things one
there's a application framework called
shiny so you can take a look at that and
you can actually build some of the
things and I do believe there are some
JSON libraries in our there are about
there's close to I think 10,000 packages
in our so don't try to do to yourself
chances are there are more than few
packages for what you're trying to do so
all you got to do is just go and take a
look but of course always take a look at
the review of the packages too because
with that many packages the quality is
not always you know good so to speak one
thing about R is R is considered to be
slow in some cases because of the
languages it's not written by
programmers it's a statistician language
but all of the packages that good ones
are written in C so that makes them
really really
and we'll also see how Microsoft is
overcoming the some of the art problems
with some of their offerings lately so
since we're coming to the end of our
presentation I'm actually gonna just go
ahead and and I always click the wrong
so basically at the end of it wants to
follow this through you will get a bunch
of different images and I will show you
here actually because of the thing it
didn't render correctly but as you can
see I can have two different tables and
then I can have my graphics as well and
those graphics are basically are just
spits them out as PNG s
and I just read them and from there on
its a simple read from the server and
again that PNG and all that with the MVC
zone caching structure you can actually
play with it and make sure that for
example you may just need it in the
morning and you can or you can run it as
a service at night and just spit it out
and then don't have to do anything but
this is right now our scripts being run
by MVC I told you this would be the
easiest the quickest one of the whole
thing so to wrap it up
Microsoft is serious about our and you
can tell how they're integrating into
their ecosystem we have seen visual
studio we use Visual Studio and nothing
else for building our packages and
building an MVC dashboard with it power
bi also users are you can write run our
scripts in power bi Cortana analytics
suite you can use again our in this
suite but most importantly lately on
their latest offering sequel Server 2016
there's an AR engine and with that our
engine we have all kinds of
possibilities now our engine in sequel
right now it runs as a script so
basically whatever script you have in
are you put it in in a string variable
in sequel server and run it like that so
it's it since infancy it's hard to debug
with Visual Studio I didn't go into
those details but if you go in I think
it's John lamb there are tools for
visual studio director or product
manager he actually has a nice video
explaining all the
tools for visual studio and you have you
can debug and all that so you get all
the debugging capabilities with that but
with Windows and sequel server you get
to our server and but you don't have an
our server per se as a separate product
it just runs as our services in sequel
Server 2016
so once you install sequel server do not
look for our server per se it actually
runs in sequel server as our services
and if you really really want to take
data scientists science on and because
as I have shown you are in its own you
can yes go and pick it up you can use it
in different formats but if you don't
know statistics if you don't know what
answers you're looking for really it's
not too useful for you yeah we can do
some nice stuff and all that although I
think you can use it still for some
graphical capabilities so learning it
even a bit gives you a big advantage
because it's graphic capabilities and
parallel but if you really want to know
about the data science know that
Microsoft has a data science summit
coming up in Atlanta Georgia end of
September so you can just go and take a
look what's happening there last but not
least
well not last last four slides if you
want to look at some books on our pick
up some books I find these to be pretty
good when you're beginning our and our
by example the art of our and
introductory are they're pretty good but
again you need the data science
capability for that and I will just wait
for people to take pictures I will put
this up online too
but you need also data science and there
are a couple online excellent sources
for that bless you
there is one called EDX
I think it's EDX comm they give some
data science courses and they are
developed with Microsoft so they're
pretty good they're pretty cool and then
there is another site called data camp
and they have they give such excellent
free are sources to they have paid ones
as well but the free ones are good for
beginning the beginner courses are
usually free and one minute overdue I
have asked me anything session at level
2 at the system will you TV both and
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
