morning everyone hopefully that'll
settle down who here is using react not
many that's good what I want to talk to
you today about is let you know what's
coming in the new version of react so
there's this thing that's been talked
about in the react community for
probably over a year may be coming up to
a year and a half two years called react
fiver it's been a long time in the
making and there's a heap of excitement
about around the react community by the
end of this session you'll know what it
is and hopefully you're a bit excited
about what fibre is and how reactors
actually reappropriation Xand the
reasons it looks the way it does so my
name is Jake I work over in Perth at
seven West media specifically I work
under WI news so I helped build the West
calm day you get annoying oh well
suggestions I'll see if we can settle it
down over the next few minutes so I
helped build the West calm day you which
is a news website we started this
project just about a year ago and WI
news actually didn't have any of their
own tech all of their tech was
previously out sourced so we started a
team and we decided to use react to
build the news platform it's been a very
interesting year with built a new site
from scratch integrated with the print
CMS and we use react with server-side
rendering so really new technologies so
I got involved with react kind of a
couple of years ago in London doing
financial trading systems previously I
was doing WPF and MVC and a mixture of
other things and react was being one of
the first technologies for quite a while
that just got me really excited and year
I'm still loving it so one of them this
court describes quite well they one of
the rationale behind react so Dykstra
says our intellectual powers are rather
geared towards master static relations
rather than our ability to process
things evolving in time so what does
that actually mean well if we just
simplify it back down the reason we like
server side and request response
traditional MVC apps is it's like
ordering a beer you just ask for a beer
and then you get it and then you ask for
another one and you get it it's
stateless you don't have to worry about
things changing over time single page
applications tend to be more like this
where as things change over time you get
all this state that builds up in your
DOM and and it sort of evolves over time
and it becomes really hard to
rationalize so at Facebook they're
really struggling with this react as a
framework built and supported by
Facebook and it was a homegrown solution
to this problem they just found that
their apps were getting when website was
just getting really really complicated
especially on admin side of things so
they wanted to just try and change the
paradigm that they were using to build
web applications it actually took
inspiration from a couple of different
things but one of them is the way games
actually work so games have a game loop
what they do is they process input
update the state of the game and then
they rerender it's too expensive to try
and figure out how to change the what's
rendered on the screen so they just re
render at 60 frames a second react
actually takes that it's like how can we
apply the same model to our single page
applications where I've got my
application state and I just want to
re-render it
we already had that with handlebars
right who's used handlebars before cool
old-school templating javascript library
uses string interpolation essentially
and you pass it some state and you get a
Dom out the other side awesome rendered
text so they started off by reinventing
the wheel essentially but there are a
few reasons why handlebars doesn't work
for any sort of reasonable application
every time you re-evaluate that template
you destroy the whole dom and then
recreate it so you lose any sort of
focus or scroll position all of that
sort of stuff it's also the dom is
really expensive to interact with
templates also are not standard syntax
so each time you go to a different
templating library they have a different
way of doing string interpolation or
binding to things different way of doing
loops and conditionals and every time
you want to have some sort of extra
logic in your templates you have to
invent a new way of solving that problem
so for a number of reasons we don't want
to go down templates ain´t libraries
like angular and knockout j/s took this
a step further where he created your
model and you've got your template and
then you bind between the two so when
your model changes you can update bits
in the Dom kind of gives you the best of
both worlds still quite hard to reason
about what's happening in your
application so when they're rebuilding
react they came up with a few design
principles that they wanted to anchor
react on the first one is composition we
all know sort of the the recommendations
around we prefer composition over
inheritance that's a good way to scat
build a app that's easy just sort of
scale and reason about so composition
and react had to be first-class we
wanted to be able to just build using
components bring them together easily be
able to refactor and and just build our
application up from all of these little
parts
they wanted a common abstraction as well
so they didn't want to include
everything in the library because then
you you don't let the community figure
out the best ways what what are the best
patterns to do and let things evolve
over time but they also didn't want to
include nothing in react because when
you've got a library and you everyone's
building applications if we have three
ways of doing state management the
lowest common denominator for react is
what comes in so all of these different
libraries if they say you've got
different ways of passing information
through different components
if react didn't specify how to do that
you just would have a lot divergence in
the community and that sort of stuff so
they wanted to include a minimal amount
of features in there but enough that it
was powerful and gave you a really good
base to extend that they also wanted to
get make sure we had escape hatches so
rather than being a all-encompassing
framework that has all of these solves
all of these problems as soon as you hit
a limitation of react how can you get
out and do it the way you've always done
it so make sure there's these easy
escape hatches so we don't run into
these are limitations Facebook currently
have over 20,000 react components so
every time they make changes to the
library that's gonna hurt them so
stability was in terms of API was super
important they needed to be able to let
react evolve over time and get better
but not constantly be spending all of
their time refactoring all these
components so make sure it's stable but
the library can also evolve
interoperability make sure it can work
with the existing community we don't
want to create a separate ecosystem that
can't interrupt with the rest of the web
scheduling this one is one of the most
important things when it comes to fiber
the API for react once they want the
library to be able to make good
decisions on when things should happen
so you'll noticed in data binding sort
of paradigms if you're getting a lot of
updates you have to you then your
application slows down and it's up to
you to stop all of these updates
happening so you don't kill the
performance of your application reacts
API has been designed to invert that you
should be able to tell react what you
want to do and not have to try and
throttle things yourself
so shadowing was first class the library
should be shelling when work happens
because it can make better decisions
hopefully the new can so over time the
rip from the library can improve and get
better and your application just gets
better with it there's a lot of
developers at Facebook right so
developer experience was super important
we don't want cryptic error messages we
want to be able to debug it easily we
want to be able to like point people in
the right direction so we've actually
got our developers being productive and
not wasting time on silly issues so
really nice you'll notice when you start
using react when something goes wrong or
even if it's not going wrong but you're
using the wrong pattern it'll be telling
you hey you should be doing this click
on this link to know why that sort of
thing so it's constantly informing
developers on how to do things better
and finding detecting when you're doing
bad things and encouraging you to fix
them and then debugging so when
something goes wrong with react because
it's all component orientated with
really explicit data flows super easy to
sort of see which at which point a
component poisoned the tree so to speak
so you can go in and see are this
component here has changed the data
that's being passed
down so with all that said how does
react actually work we have a react
component here
I've lost syntax hider highlighting for
some reason that's frustrating I'm not
sure how to fix this let's go there we
go can people read that not really
let us interestingly enough my slides
are built-in react as well
how's that everyone read that excellent
so at the top we have an agenda react
component who's seen a react component
before call a lot of people excellent so
this is known as a stateful component
and we extend we use es6 syntax and
extend react component the only
requirement for a react component is it
has a render function and this tells
react what this component actually wants
to display on the screen because it's
all JavaScript we just returned a
representation of what we want rendered
so if my current states loading I want
to return a div that says loading we can
also compose our different application
components together so if I was building
the NDC schedule builder we can have a
schedule component consuming normal HTML
Dom elements and like custom components
exactly the same makes it really really
easy to extend over time we can then
pass what are called props to are these
custom components so I'm passing down a
list of talks that I've saved that I'm
interested in all of the talks at NDC
and you can also pass functions as props
so this add to schedule is just a
callback so when the scheduled component
wants to add something to the schedule
it just calls this prop it then sets
state so when you extend react component
that component is allowed to have state
the way we set state is using a function
called set state when we talked about
the design prints are all around
scheduling this is a really keep design
decision so I can call set state as many
times as I want and it's up to react
when it actually takes that state
calls render so you can change the
different you can hook in and say okay
react I'd like you to just render using
set animation frame and just render re
render my app at 60 frames a second much
like a game it's probably not going to
give you a great performance doing that
but it's an option so using set state
that can happen and all at least
different components and react can then
batch all of those together and do a
single render pass it's up to react how
it actually performs that because that's
asynchronous and it gives you no
guarantees this is one of the things
that a lot has allowed react to
re-implement it score without breaking
the public API so I call add schedule it
calls set state at some point probably
within a very very short time react will
call render which then allows me to go
from a loading state and just render out
what's happening so very declarative you
have your state and when you render it's
pretty much a pure function state goes
through a render process I am my
rendered application much the same as
handlebars this is called a stateless
component so it's just a JavaScript
variable that is a function so everyone
using es6 typescript cool so for those
that haven't seen this this is a fat
arrow syntax this is just a JavaScript
function it's called a pure component or
a stateless component because it just
takes props and then produces some
markup quite simple
finally we have lifecycle components so
lifecycle methods so here I can hook
into component will mount this happens
when my react component is going to be
mounted into the Dom but it hasn't yet
there's other ones like component did
mount that after my components been
mounted into the Dom it lets me know we
can also have component will unmount so
the really explicit lifecycle methods in
react to make it really easy reason
about when things are coming in I can
subscribe to changes when it's going to
be destroyed I can unsubscribe that sort
of thing so in there I'm executing an
async method and then continuation so
I'm fetching the agenda then once I've
got it I'm setting some state once again
which will cause the rerender and that's
react in a nutshell Oh anyway so let's
get back to the original question what's
fiber so react has two things it has the
renderer on one side and then it has the
reconciler on the other so when we
return some JSX which is the XML kind of
thing within our render function it
creates what's called a virtual Dom now
this is just an in-memory representation
of what you want rendered so I have a
div that creates a div element when
react gets given that element it will
actually create a div in the real Dom
the thing that turns that object
structure from just a JavaScript object
that says I want two div with some text
in it to actually putting it in the Dom
that's the role of the renderer we have
a Dom renderer we also have like a Dom
to string or two string renderer which
you can use on the server so rather than
going document or create element and
actually building up a Dom it can just
render it to a
String much like in an NBC app or
something like that but that doesn't
help us make changes over time we're
constantly re-rendering our app and what
the virtual daams responsibility is is
when you create a new virtual Dom react
will actually differt with what the
previous virtual Dom was it'll then
identify any changes that have happened
between the previous render and the new
renderer it'll then create a patch which
it'll apply to the real DOM and that's
one of the breakthroughs of react
so what fiber is firstly is in react 15
and below these two things were just
part of react they are tightly coupled
things like react native had to dive
into the internals then override a bunch
of internal stuff so it would actually
work react 16 and fibre separates these
two so now there's a an official
documented renderer API which makes it
really really easy to extend react so it
can be rendered to other things there's
actually a huge amount of renderers now
and it's since react 16 has got released
or the beta there's been a heap being
created so react native that allows us
to use the same components right in
JavaScript except it projects it renders
out to a native component so that could
be Android iOS Windows 10 app store
you've got all of these like
opportunities there
we've got react VR which allows us to
use the same react components and
actually render to a VR environment
react canvas allows you to actually draw
things with react react PDF you can
render your components into a PDF
document
there's also react word for those sort
of things a novel one that I saw a
couple of days ago is react FS which is
allows you to render to a file system so
say you wanted to create a templating
library or I am
like something like yeoman that actually
bootstrap to a project you can create a
a representation of the files that you
want using JSX
and then say rendered file system and
it'll actually create all of these files
and directory structures on disk but the
most novel one that I'm looking at at
the moment is we have a few designers
and they love sketch and there's always
this problem of we've got a component
library with all of these react
components and they've got this library
of all of these sketch components and
when we're building we have to like
measure and see what the margins are in
sketch the people nice people at air B&amp;amp;B
have been suffering from this and they
thought well we could use react to make
this better so their component library
can render to a sketch document so as
they make changes to all of their
components that they're using to build
the site they're actually rendering
these out to sketch components and
sketch documents which is a rapid
prototyping design tool which means
things are always in sync pretty novel
concept and it allows you to render to
the web or to sketch or PDFs and it's
the same components pretty powerful
concept so fiber was separating those
two and it's now super easy for you to
actually write your own renderers the
other thing that that fiber is trying to
solve is javascript in the browser and
the node has a single event loop we
can't get away from that the world would
break if we tried to make JavaScript
multi-threaded so this is going to be a
limitation of the environment going
forward this causes quite a few problems
over time the current rendering model
inside react they call the stack
renderer and what happens is it starts
at the top and recursively goes down
through all of these components
and renders them what this is is a
triangle that has a whole lot of smaller
triangles in it and then smaller
triangles again and then finally has a
bunch of circles in it with a number so
there's two types of animations going on
here
there's one that is making the whole
thing smaller and larger and the other
one is every so that's happening sort of
every 16 milliseconds or so too
you want to have a nice smooth animation
but we've also every second we're
incrementing the number that's in all of
these little components reactors not
great at handling this because you're
changing everything and react can't
optimize it so it's trying to re-render
that entire complex Dom tree and do a
virtual Dom diff six every 16
milliseconds and it just can't keep up
so you're ending up with really long
JavaScript frames which blocks the UI
thread and you end up with jank so when
you start seeing your application
getting really complicated with react
this can be a side effect that you're
scrolling and you're janking because
it's taking too long to do this render
the question was as this reacts
implementation of tree shaking so tree
shaking in JavaScript land and web pack
is where I require a whole bunch of
different modules and but there's more
code in all of these modules that my
application won't necessarily be using
what tree shaking allows like web pack
to do for instance is go through and
statically analyze and see what hasn't
been imported from your application and
safely remove it so it's similar to
uglify which removes dead code except
uses the new JavaScript module syntax
which is the import and export to be
able to do it in a safe statically
analyzable way so fiber is more about
the actual reconciliation process
I've got my old V virtual Dom I've got
the new virtual Dom I need to be able to
make changes to the actual Dom how do I
do that current implementation is
top-down synchronous it just recursively
bubbles down until it gets to the end
and then it applies the patch fibre is a
complete implementation of react
it's pretty amazing I've been working on
it for ages and they're just releasing
react sixteen and it's a drop-in
replacement they have upgraded it to all
of their twenty thousand odd components
is running on this and has been for a
little while but what fiber allows them
to do is actually each of these
components becomes a fiber or a unit of
work which allows them to start doing
these render passes and once they've
used their elapsed time give control
back to the JavaScript event loop and
then ask to be scheduled again they'll
then do a bit more and then go back they
also want to be able to cancel work so
when I'm doing this inside and outside
animation and these little guys are
updating in there I want to make sure
that I'm actually dropping animation
frames so I'm keeping up rather than
trying to to try and do everything so
this is known as a conflation like you
you're probably using it in your own
applications whenever you've got a like
search box where you start typing and
you're doing d bouncing or throttling
that's a form of conflating the the
inputs so you don't ruin the applicant
like your application experience because
reacts design principles getting back to
the scheduling one you're just telling
react that you have some state changes
fiber allows hopefully in the future
it's not enabled yet but fiber will
allow react to make smart decisions
about when which updates are scheduled
when so just by applying five
with these new options you see the
previous one you got all over this jank
turn fiber asynchronous rendering on
much much smoother the way it does that
is each fiber can actually be assigned
priorities so remember we said we were
trying to render every 16 milliseconds
well we want that to be given a really
high priority but updating all of these
numbers across all of these that's only
happening once a second it probably
doesn't matter if it's 50 milliseconds
later
so fibers can be assigned priority so
synchronous which means it's done inline
synchronously you can also say it's a
task which is will mean it happens
before the next tick it's an animation
this fiber should be completed before
the next animation frame in terms of
JavaScript that's the difference between
like set timeout I'll set immediate and
then requestanimationframe you can then
give it a high priority low priority or
off-screen so react knows that it's in a
like react Dom knows that it's in a
browser a browser has a viewport what
happens if fiber could automatically
assign a higher priority to components
that are within the viewport rather than
stuff that's out of the viewport that's
a possibility with fiber and that's why
the community is so excited we at the
moment react 16 has come out it's still
using synchronous priorities for
everything they don't want to break the
world they want everyone running on the
new version of fiber to make sure that
it's compatible and all of these react
applications around the world can work
without having to change anything
hopefully over the next year we'll start
seeing them turning on asynchronous
rendering and a lot of these other
prioritization and people experimenting
with what the possibilities are
this is really frustrating since I've
rebooted all my ass colorings are gone
we support fragments in fiber what
fragments are is inside my render I can
now actually return an array with div
key of 1 and div key of 2 one of the
current limitations that strives my
designers nuts is that you have to
return a single element which means you
constantly this component I want to
return two things I have to wrap it and
div so one of the side effects of
current react applications is you
normally have a heap more divs than you
actually require react 16 supports
fragments which is returning an array
instead a lot of people are pretty happy
about that the next one is error
boundaries and what error boundaries are
is now I can say component will catch
and when it's got doing its render pass
this component essentially becomes a
try-catch for all of the components
under it
so if for instance they wait you get
down and there's some malformed data and
a components render function throws
it'll continue bubbling up until a
component does this which then I can go
this set state had error of true inside
the render function I can go this dot
state if this dot state dot add error I
can then render something that just goes
oops
this allows you to gracefully handle
errors I know it's not not to just
continue bashing angular but um when I
was using angular and anger this was one
of the things that were super
frustrating you'd have a
error somewhere and you just get a white
screen and it would take you forever to
try and figure out what's actually gone
wrong fiber because it knows we're in
the render tree all of these units of
work is it can almost give you a stack
trace between what components caused
what errors and that goes back to that
developer experience there's a site that
I've been going to for I think it got
created in September last year which is
is fiber ready yet this is a bit fuzzy
so you can't read it but is fiber ready
yet calm finally it's been saying no and
they've been graphing the pass rate of a
unit tests within react so slowly they
got it quite close to completion and
then not quite obviously they discovered
some design problems made some changes
which broke a heap of tests and this has
been going from red yellow with warnings
slowly over to green finally I think
about a week or two ago they they got
that whole all of the unit tests passing
using the fiber reconciliation engine
then they released the beta so this
doesn't have the new scheduling engine
turned on it is still using the old
synchronous flow but so most
applications should see a small
performance improvement but probably not
a lot once the world is using actually
using the fiber reconciliation engine
and react 16 hopefully they'll start
releasing the asynchronous rendering
behind feature flags
so I wanted to leave a fair bit of time
at the end the workshop that I did on
Monday and Tuesday there was a heap of
questions relating to the react
ecosystem and how it fits in and and
where to go so I'm going to open it up
to the floor for questions
that's react fiber I hope it excites you
it's it's the potential for the
JavaScript community to do some really
cool stuff with this is amazing so thank
you any questions the question is can
you use typescript with react fiber so
all of our projects are written with
typescript react has a concept called
prop types so you can actually say prop
types equals and give it an object and
then define that my prop is a react prop
type of object for instance that's the
way you do type validation with react if
you want to use it with typescript you
can actually specify it becomes a
generic component and I can just say
props and state and then I can define an
interface which is props and I can say
my prop of type whatever so react works
very well with typescript and fiber
actually did not they made no breaking
API changes over a complete rewrite of
react so your existing Taipings will
work fine with fiber there will
eventually be hints for prioritization
and that sort of stuff but that's not
out yet so the type definitions will be
create updated when that happens you had
a question
yes the question I'll sum down to
something a bit smaller which is
essentially if you're trying to pick
frameworks what would you consider
essentially because all of these
frameworks are learning from each other
yeah I think it's it comes down to what
you like what you want out of your
library Frank angular as a framework has
a lot more it has patterns around how to
do data fetching all of the testing
patterns are defined react has not done
that they wanted to create that lowest
common abstraction and then let the
community kind of define the patterns so
that's where you're seeing react change
like the ecosystem is going through a
lot of change but that's outside of the
library itself the other nice thing is
libraries like pre-act which are a yeah
they're there it's a small small version
of react essentially it's an open source
project that's that's API mostly API
compatible with react except it's a 3k
module instead of sort of 40 or 50 which
I think reactors with libraries like
that if you've got like a complex grid
that can like that will benefit from the
virtual Dom approach you can actually
mix and match so you can create an
angular component which houses a react
component
and that's the way that the migration
path between angular 1 &amp;amp; 2 works is that
you start creating angular 2 components
inside angular 1 components and slowly
take over I think the most important
thing is is sort of understand your best
practices and and learn the fundamentals
one of the reasons I love reactors it's
all in on JavaScript so you have to
understand JavaScript what warts-and-all
yes I like now ember has picked up
virtual Dom there's a heap of virtual
Dom libraries like view and and whatnot
it's it's sort of spreading a fair
amount any other questions
yep so the question is around
server-side rendering there's a concept
called universal rendering which is
allows you to have your same JavaScript
application run on the server as on the
client so if you go to the West combo
you and you turn JavaScript off you'll
get a render of that page and you can
click around and the site is functional
that's because we actually render the
entire react app on the server as a
string ship it off to the client the
client JavaScript bundles then
initialize and our single page
application starts the react
Reconciliation engine will notice that
there is already a Dom there where it's
going to mount so it hydrates that into
a virtual Dom it the rent does a
client-side re render reconciles those
and then applies any updates to the real
Dom you're now then running in a you
know a single page application mode
where it has hooked into the event
handlers the second part of the question
was do you think that's worth it in
terms of complexity there's a lot of
moving parts
it relies on web pack to tell you what
your assets are and a whole lot of extra
work you have to on the server you have
to know once you're finished loading
data so you do an initial render which
is all in a loading State load some data
do another render pass which has all of
their data transfer that across to the
client and then start up your
application for us it's critical because
it makes it removes a lot of the
downsides of a single page application
in terms of the user gets a white screen
until the JavaScript app has started and
done that initial render we also need
really good SEO so all of the bots can
crawl it and also if you post post a
link in Twitter or whatever and it needs
to get that little embedded card that
requires the server to return all of
that information so if your site is
content-driven site then without a doubt
it is worth it if you're building a
single page application like a line of
business application or something that
just has a login form before you can get
into it I wouldn't worry the complexity
is probably not worth it anything else
yeah
so the the question was angular has
zones which is a similar sort of concept
would Facebook consider pulling the
fiber prioritization engine sort of out
so it was consumable in other libraries
honestly I don't know my background is
I'm working and using this stuff day to
day I have a fair interest in it because
we're buying into the technologies and
our team really believes in reactants
sort of the paradigms that it brings so
in short I don't know if you do want to
learn more there is a talk by by Lynn
Clark if you search that what is react
fiber
she's a developer at Firefox and
focusing on sort of performance in their
gecko engine and whatnot but she also
has a Twitter account which is code
cartoons so she turns all of these
concepts into little code like
animations and cartoons if you want to
dive deeper she goes into reacts
reconciliation process at a lot deeper
level than I did today and it's really
really interesting and she does a really
good job of explaining things using
cartoons and and making it really easy
to digest and understand
Lynn Clark
any other questions yep yeah so yeah so
the reason it the question is why is
this test not TSX is because I wasn't
supposed to be showing you code here
this was a module with a string inside
it which gets pulled into my slides so
I'm using a library called spectacle
which allows me to specify it's a react
library that allows me to build my slide
decks using react
just because build everything in react
right anyone else interesting question
so the question was when do you think
all of these frameworks will become
obsolete due to emerging technologies
like web components I would say in the
case of react they go hand in hand and a
very complimentary so web components are
an idea that you should be able to build
your own custom HTML elements so say
you've got a HTML input that comes
shipped in the browser it's not just
it's actually a bunch of smaller
primitives that has JavaScript styles
and other HTML elements below it to make
up that component right so web
components have kind of existed in the
browser for years what that allows you
to do is create it uses a technology
that we shipped a while ago called the
shadow Dom that essentially says hey
browser
make all of the markup and j/s and
styles within this component invisible
so it just looks like a custom HTML
element and all of that stuff goes away
so you can actually consume web
components inside your react components
and they solve a different problem react
is all about the mental model of how you
treat state in your application and how
you compose your application together
web components are about creating
reusable functionality that comes sort
of extend give you better primitives to
build your applications on so they kind
of have two sides of the thing and they
work quite well together
cool thanks everyone I will be around
for the rest of the conference probably
hanging out in the github booth or the
track J s booth come find me and also if
you don't know about pub Kampf it's on
Friday it is a great event that I'll be
speaking at if you come find me and ask
a good question I have a and are
interested to go I have a free ticket so
come find me and if you're interested in
you can go so these are all fun talks
that aren't recorded it's at a pub
there's free beer it's a great event I
highly recommend attending so that's
Friday evening thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
