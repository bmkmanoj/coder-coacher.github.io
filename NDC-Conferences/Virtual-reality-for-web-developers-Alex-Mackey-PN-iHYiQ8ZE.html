for sticking with us to the end of the
day it is a long day and you've done
very well
to be here and I'm very happy to see all
of you I won't waste your time over the
next probably 45 50 minutes or so I'm
hoping I've got a lot of entertaining
and useful stuff which maybe even if
you're not using it tomorrow or you're
very lucky if you're using some of this
stuff tomorrow hopefully will excite and
inspire you and to work on a few things
so yeah Who am I my name is Alex Mackey
I work for the consultancy ratified all
the stuff I'm going to show you will be
at my website simplest best card UK and
you can also follow me on Twitter or ask
me questions at Alex Jay Mackay
if you should say wish so what are we
going to put talking about today well
we're going to talk about four main
things here and we're going to start off
I just want to give you a whirlwind tour
of the world of VR we're going to look
at some of their history and we look at
some of the different devices and we're
going to look at some of the different
development options you have because
each of these they've got their own pros
and cons we're then going to try and
answer the question why web feel like it
seems a little bit of a crazy thing to
go and do why should you write this
stuff in using web technologies well I
hope I can show you somebody advantages
and persuade you that this isn't such a
crazy idea as it sounds we didn't look
at a framework called a frame this is a
Mozilla based framework that makes it
incredibly easy to create these types of
applications and finally we're going to
wrap up with some good sort of general
VR developments and tips now first off
who actually owns a full for your
headset one person with shared device do
you have sir the PlayStation VR okay
cool which is kind of interesting in
itself apparently about 150 HTC vibes
were sold last year so the majority of
people do not have a headset right now
which isn't so surprising because really
they're friggin expensive and you need a
decent machine in order to run them so
some of the stuff I'm going to show you
today this will work on mobile devices
wherever it's a Google cardboard based
device I'm just a sort of container with
some lenses or maybe something a little
bit more than that the Google daydream
or the Samsung gear right up to full
headsets
so you don't even necessarily need to go
and target these devices it's gonna go
and scale up and work accordingly so let
me give you a very brief history of VR
so I think it's human beings we've
actually been trying to create different
realities for much much longer than you
may have thought so there is this trend
amongst artists in sort of the eighteen
hundred's period and so go and create
these absolutely enormous paintings and
the idea being that these paintings were
so large that as you are standing in
them you couldn't help but be
encompassed so this particular one is
over fourteen meters in height and it's
40 meters in diameter and we see some of
these types of works with everything
from scenes of medieval villages right
up to a sort of battle scenes and I
guess we still see some of this sort of
approach when we look at sort of things
like IMAX theatre and so on as well you
have a really big picture and it does
start to feel you know like yet maybe
you're in that scene already if we're
going forward a little bit
I called Winston um in 1838 he made an
important discovery and he found that
the brain actually processes two images
and it goes and puts these together
which gives the sense of death now some
of you may remember this thing here who
had one of these during their childhood
so this is um view-master stereoscope
for those of you haven't seen this is
actually pretty good for its time I'd
love to see a modern one but what it did
was he had these different discs and
these would have different scenes maybe
some city from around the world maybe a
movie or something you put it in this
view master thing and it would give you
like a feeling of depth so it's kind of
like a sort of afridi sort of experience
but this discovery is still used in sort
of some of the modern devices today in
order to you know stop giving that sort
of feeling and you're actually there but
this is my favorite device at all this
is the sensor armor and this is from the
1960s and a guy called Morton Heilig guy
went and created this thing and he'd
Eames this originally it may be sort of
car showrooms or building showrooms and
so on it never really took off about six
of them were actually made but it was
way ahead of its time
so this contraption here it adds because
it had stereoscopic 3d it had fans for
simulating winds and
sort of atmosphere noise somewhat
intriguingly it had a smell generator we
can only imagine what might have been
involved in that it even had a UV light
which will go and sanitize some of the
apparatus around this as well and this
thing came with six films included I'm a
coca-cola bottle which I really wish I
could show you what it was
so it sounds entertaining so I'm gonna
fast forward a bit there's a lot of
stuff that happens around the 60s
particularly around sort of science
fiction writing and we start to see you
know people using some of these terms we
see the first head mounted display in
the 60s there was even a flight
simulator developed around this time
period but fast forward to about 1991
and some of you may or may remember the
virtuality arcade group machines these
were sort of characterized by there was
this large plastic platform that you
went and stood on and it had I guess
they were ahead of their time but
somewhat sort of disappointing and
disorientating games that you would play
but really in terms of the consumer
device market it really kicks off we're
sort of oculus rift and HTC valve and
sort of later part of 2015 now for me I
started becoming interested in this
stuff from a display by the rear group
now this is from a conference called
last conference and what they have set
up is they have two platforms here and
there's a plank of wood in between and
you put on this headset and you will
cross the plank and as you're walking
across this it makes it look like you're
walking between two really high up
buildings now I'm not particularly
scared of heights it's it's not
something that particularly impacts me
but I was somewhat surprised to find
even with some fairly sort of basic
graphics that this was enough to find my
legs shaking and it started gonna be
interesting and I thought hey this
stuff's progressed a little bit so I
went out and I bought a HTC vive headset
and one of the things I like to wear
show people they've never experienced VR
is a particular game and this game is
called Ritchie's Planck experience I
think and
let me go down to some here and the idea
of this game is very similar so that's
set up and that I showed you earlier you
grew up in a building you walk around
and you walk up on a plank now these
great graphics they're not you know
they're not absolute maybe there's sort
of triple a you know top games right now
but they're still good enough to go and
create that series that sort of feeling
of vertigo and and these and so we're
not still dis game and one of the things
that I had to do is of it I said to my
wife said come play this this is this is
awesome so you've got to go and try this
one out now with this game one of the
really mean things you can do and that
I'd highly recommend doing it's just go
over to someone I just just give them a
little tap just give them a little
person say it's almost worth the
ridiculous price of some of the
equipment alone we're still married by
the way so let's talk about brains and
I'm gonna put it to you guys that
something does not have to be real in
order to influence us and by influence
us I don't mean just by like the next 30
seconds or so I mean actually create a
lasting impact and change in perception
and we've got a lot of examples of this
already we've all enjoyed maybe a good
book
we've watched a movie maybe a beautiful
piece of music this has meaning for us
and it's actually changed how we've
perceived and interacted with the world
so this got me thinking that we're
starting to move to you know something
that's starting to feel quite realistic
here you know we can create feelings and
vertigo here as we go and sort of walk
across planks and so on what could we
actually do this with this and it turns
out there's quite a lot of usages which
I'm going to touch on very briefly so
one of the interesting usage is training
and I'm going back to my videos here and
the military and police force quite
enjoy this so they have this set up here
a very large warehouse the participants
they go and put on a backpack a headset
and various sensors and this and then
enables them the military to go and
projects different sort of scenes and to
these guys and girls and so that they
can go and simulate various different
setups here
without going and creating sort of
expensive you know scenic and so on you
can actually play something fairly
similar yourself in your Melbourne they
have a big warehouse where you can go
and blow the crap out of zombies it's
quite enjoyable
I assume Sydney has something similar
now quite apart from military and police
usages for this and we see this being
employed in the medical world and one of
the sort of earliest usages was this
game called smoke world now this was
particularly interesting so it's not
even particularly sort of realistic or
maybe I'm sure the right word is it's
clearly a game here it's got a very icy
cold feet and you got fresh snow balls
with penguins and woolly mammoths and
stuff and they gave this game to some
people undergoing treatments for really
serious burns and they were somewhat
surprised to find that even though you
know it's a relatively sort of basic
game there that this game started
distracting people and the patient's
reported that pain reduced by fifty to
ninety percent in fact some people
undergoing some of these awful
procedures didn't even realise the
procedure was finished because they'd
become so involved in fry and snowballs
or penguins which is awesome so this for
me is where it's particularly powerful
because unfortunately some of us are
going to have to go through some really
horrendous experiences like treatment
for burns maybe it's a child undergoing
chemotherapy if we can take these
unpleasant you know realities and go and
replace it with something better then I
think we should it's been according to
across surgery we're surgeons performing
various operations quicker and when they
can go and simulate them in VR we've
even seen it employed so it go and teach
children to cross the road safely now
parents tend not to like it if you grab
their kids and go and try different
models of going to get across the road
from one side to another with real cars
but being able Square and control this
reality enables us to gain certain
perceptions that in this example
children will pay more attention to the
distance the vehicle is away than the
speed it's moving compared to an adult
and but I've been able to tweak this we
can start to work out better ways in
order to go and produce Road education
who's afraid of spiders you live in
Australia you actually should be afraid
of the first fighters so it's been
deployed in various various
psychological context is so in
psychology you've probably heard of
something called exposure therapy which
is basically about treating a phobia in
sort of a controlled manner so in the
case of Agra phobia person puts on the
goggles and maybe sort of early levels
they have a spider in a jar it's not too
scary the spiders trapped it's it's not
real they still know it's a headset so
it still gives a sort of relatively real
experience so here we have level one and
the patient or maybe participant it's in
the desk and spider safely in the jar
there now being able to go and control
this iPod for them not having to worry
that all these spiders are gonna start
crawling around your therapy room means
that the psychologist and going control
things that's actually quite unpleasant
I heard I really care about spiders
verificar they're particularly like that
there so this is a really promising in
the fields of psychology been able to
you know go and tweak and work with this
finally certain strange stuff that I
found as part of this there's a South
American company that based on medical
scans will allow you to meet your unborn
baby in VR
okay but this dude here so he wanted to
set the world record for being in VR
which currently stands at 25 hours which
actually seems achievable that you know
but it's currently 25 hours but the
proviso is you have to use the same game
apparently and he chose this game called
tilt brush which is about creating stuff
in 3d space he had their somewhat
predictable results that he was really
quite unwell at the end of it but he ate
pizza and he peed in a bucket so he
didn't have to put down the headset but
he was okay and I guess he got the
record after this also found a very
strange game
now have you ever wanted to pretend to
kiss an alien tentacle thing here I
can't say I have but the object of the
game is you move around and you kiss
these tentacle things the Internet is a
strange strange place so let us move on
quickly from that so after all that how
do you actually get started
with developments in this area well this
free main or two main categories of
device I'd say so we have the sort of
mobile and tablet based devices which is
your most accessible option it's the
cheapest it's the least performant but
it also has some advantages it's not
tethered to a machine you can go and
walk around with it everyone's got a
mobile this is a session focused on VR
and one person at GE had a sort of
headset device so you can see that the
moment that the full headsets you know
there's not too many out there because
they're really expensive they're awesome
I think there was some price cuts
recently with the rift device and I
guess that's also gonna influence the
HTC vive and it's also a very
competitively priced one from Lovano
that's about three four hundred dollars
then that's a pretty good price so I
haven't played with definitely the
device yet the full headset obviously
they're a lot more expensive and the the
Viper was about thirteen hundred dollars
or so and you also need a reasonable
spec machine in order to run this thing
it will run on a lot less machine that
they say is minimal spec I ran it on
probably a three to four year old to
Alienware desktop yeah it didn't run
great but you could still get some idea
turned down all the graphics options and
then more recently I got a Alienware
laptop which runs a lot nicer now you do
need to be careful because obviously you
start getting this horrible flickering
thing which can make you feel quite
unwell which we'll talk about later
somebody comes through development
options I think there's maybe four sort
of main categories of options we have
web which I'm going to start talking
about very shortly I promise and we have
unity I think these are the two main
options and for your sort of amateur
developer in this area in addition
we've got various SDKs such as a Google
cardboard SDK the various game engines
real engine there's a there's a heap of
them but these are all going to involve
a lot more sort of investment of your
time
whereas web and unity I think are a lot
more accessible a unity I've done a tiny
bit of playing around with this I really
like it it's a great to notice right
word framework but it's it's free for
certain usages it's got a big community
it's got good tutorials it's got a lot
of assets it is a good option I'm not
going to deny this it also exports to
WebGL I haven't any personal experience
of how successful that sort of export is
but you can run some of the games rafail
to a player which is probably the sort
of default watching your use for unity
based stuff some web well in technology
an option is answer to this is often
because we can but it's not a good
answer there are some advantages to this
and I think the main advantage is that
in order to run some of these
experiences your users they don't need
to go and download any plug-in or player
it will run on multiple devices and
platforms and it makes it a lot more
accessible to people you know there's no
barrier to entry you go to my website I
can hopefully immediately go and run
this experience right away this is the
second main advantage and for me this is
probably the biggest I would say I
probably have hardly any free time in a
moment with two little children whilst I
would love to spend a heap of time
learning unity it looks awesome my
background is web development and this
enables me to get into this and start
playing around with this using the
skills I already have without having to
learn a whole new heap of things I can
use Java scripts and HTML we'll talk
about how in a minute and I can also
make you some existing web libraries so
for example maybe you've got you've used
the visualization library d4 ejs there's
all sorts of libraries that we use every
day and web development and you can make
use of these again if it makes sense
it's an open distribution you don't need
to publish your app on the steam store
or whatever the equivalent is for I
guess you can do bifur Bofur
survive the applications also tend to be
fairly large you know you're talking a
gig or below somewhere below whereas the
web we've got this whole sort of
distribution model already you know
there's a lot of infrastructure already
we're quite familiar with various
techniques such as caching and so on in
order to keep our application small and
we don't need to download everything at
once necessarily either as well it also
works well on lower spec devices another
option you might want to consider is
maybe you're developing some VR solution
you intend to develop using some native
means this could be a very effective way
of prototyping your application you
could put something together very
quickly see if it's going to work maybe
even serve as some kind of specification
for the team that's going to build the
full application like anything it's also
got its disadvantages it is less
performant than some native options if
you want you know a top-end
really immersive experience you're
better off using some of the sort of
game engines or unity to do this there
is limited control integration and I put
a star on this because it's not
completely true so some of the framework
stuff I'm going to show you today
it works with five pedals you can use
the gamepad API to go and work with
various controls and devices but it's
always going to be slightly behind
whatever the next development is in this
area it is experimental so that means
it's flaky is highly likely to crash the
specifications is changing and there are
a couple of issues with it okay I want
to show you a couple of quick examples
of what you can do with this I don't
trust conference Wi-Fi so hopefully yeah
this dongle is going to connect very
shortly and we will go right into the
showing a couple of examples of the
things you can do with this so this is a
framework called
a frame which I'm going to talk about
very shortly and this is an example and
you can this is a museum which we can
move around in and this is all running
in the browser and ever think of course
the notice is this is just running on my
laptop here but this same experience
will work on your mobile if you go and
visit this page on your modern Android
or iOS device it's it's reasonably
detailed we have animation and special
effects effects it would probably be
more detailed but my laptop's not really
sort of geared up for 3d development
another example I want to show you is
this snow globe
example so this is produced by a year
company and showcased through a frame
and what they have is kind of a snow
globe here with a New York scene which
you then go and move around start there
and what it may not be sort of
topographic some of this it's still not
bad and you'd be quite surprised that
house with something relatively simple
you can still get that sort of immersive
experience with some of this so what do
we need to go and create our web-based
virtual reality experiences well we need
some ingredients in order to go and put
this stuff together the first of which
you're probably not going to be too
surprised it does involve some
JavaScript and second is WebGL has
anyone done any sort of raw WebGL
programming a few people yep so this is
some code here and I have divided this
up to make this slightly easier to read
but the results of this code is this so
it's a reasonable amount of work if you
want to go and take this approach for
developing your experiences and you can
imagine whilst there is some setup in
there and I've made it a bit more
readable it's gonna be a fair amount of
codes if you want to go and write say
that city scene or the museum scene
so in whilst it's interesting to see
what's happening I would recommend you
go have a little play with it just to
see what's happening for the majority of
us were probably not going to be working
in WebGL directly because there's a heap
of code
so my recommendation moment would be to
use a framework called free Jas and this
makes WebGL a lot easier to use so this
is a free Jas example of adding a cube
to a scene it's a lot more readable we
have a box geometry there's kind of a
sort of skeleton of the shape we give it
some parameters we put a material or
maybe sort of covering around this and
then we go and combine these things to
go and create our cube before adding it
to a scene it's fairly easy to get into
there's a lot of good examples and
tutorials if you have a fluoro site
subscription I wrote an intro course on
this which will get you up to speed in
probably about an hour and a half or so
so we've got a good way of rendering
free year 3d graphics and stuff now and
something that's relatively easy to
write and maintain but we've got a
problem because our person's got their
headsets on and we don't know where
they're looking and this is where
webview art comes in and finally we have
a device orientation events now I put
this one in a dotted box because it
depends what you're doing if you're not
interested in developing for mobile
devices don't worry about it
what the voice orientation events
enables you to do is it enables you to
detect when someone starts moving the
device around and so like if I go and
tilt this if I rotate this and you could
then use this information in order to go
and update what's projected on the
screen which is what's happening behind
the scenes with a lot of frameworks that
work with this in addition there's two
other technologies that may be of
interest we have the gamepad API and Web
Audio API creating a truly immersive
experience I don't think it's just about
necessarily visual aspects you've
probably all seen in various games and
movies sound effects and music are
important as well and this might offer
some more control in that area if that's
something that's of interest let's talk
about web vr so it was invented in 2014
and by a guy called Vladimir Vukovich he
was also behind WebGL so there is sort
of a link between these and it was
actually released to a mint
20:16 we currently see v 1.1 found in
browsers that support it in terms of
browser support it is somewhat limited
at the moment but this is changing so
Firefox as of last week supported it out
of the box so straight away you've got
an option to go and run it if you want
to run it on some Chrome based thing you
need to download a special version of
chromium you then download another
assembly which you put a location in
your computer and then you need to
configure some flag options it's not
hard and there is instructions for it
but I would really recommend go with the
Firefox option it's a lot more stable
it's more performant this is currently
at the time of me talking about this the
best option for looking at these
experiences and then we also have
support or coming support in edge
version 15 so it has got some big
vendors behind it people are strolling
to get on board with this standard but
it is porn everything right now no this
is some of the options you need to
enable in Chrome probably the best thing
to do though and because this is
changing all the time is if you go to
this slight web Theodore info and then
it's got a selection of different
devices and then depending on what it is
you own they'll give you detailed
instructions on how to work with this
type of thing another option and your
mileage may vary with this is a chrome
plug-in which does web via emulation so
I'm going to bring up an example we'll
try we'll try this one here so this is
using some of the webview our API is to
get some information and once you
install this plug-in you get this
webview little thing up here and I'll
bring up the browser tools and I've got
this new webview our tab here and what
this enables me to do is go and move
stuff around and simulate some of these
events here now as I say do your mileage
may vary with this I tried this with
some more complex examples and it didn't
work so well but it is an option it's
free give it a try see if it works for
you
and to a very bhakti presentation so
what does web viewer actually do well
web VR has two main purposes it will
give you device capability information
and also positioning information of the
device so that's depending on the device
where the users looking where they're
moving their head around where they've
moved in the room and it will also
enable you to display content on the
device file WebGL it has a number of key
objects that you're going to make use of
if you're developing with this approach
and the main one is this object called
VR display which represents a device
that's connected with this we have VR
display capabilities which will give you
some information about some of the
different functionality that supported
VR frame data via pose eye parameters
field of view stage parameters and then
there's various windows event so you can
plug into like if their head someone's
connected or disconnected the headset
and so what your first call though is to
actually go and see if there's support
for web VR at all and you do this and
we've heard navigator get for your
devices sorry that should be get for
your displays
get VR devices was deprecated so this
will give you a trophy for C call here
and you can detect whether a support for
this exists in the browser but once
you've tested whether there is support
in the browser you've got one more thing
to do because once the browser might
support it it's quite likely the user
doesn't own a device or have a device
connected at the moment so this in its
promise will give me this displays
object here which is on the right and
you need to test whether the actually
any items in this right here and if
there is then we can go and get off sort
of VR display here and that's kind of
sort of the the route object in V odd
web VR that we need to do anything with
the VR display has a couple of
properties and methods this is an all of
them I've picked a couple
so just you can get an idea of what's
involved in some of this we can request
first positional information and then we
have these animation frame and present
which I'm going to talk about in a sec
how do you actually work with this well
first of all you need to go and get your
displays and navigate to get VR displays
and then you need to request present
permission now this needs to be
triggered by a user action you can
imagine if we ever get to the point
where we're all browsing the web of some
type of headset if every advertiser
could pop up some kind of virtual
experience it would be pretty horrendous
so this actually needs to be initiated
by some kind of event click of a button
or so on once we've got that permission
we use the requestanimationframe
kind of similar to canvas and then we
can go and submit various things to go
and be rendered now there's a very
detailed tutorial on Mozilla x' site if
you want to dig into how to work with
this with raw WebGL and webview are now
the problem with webview is that you get
a lot of numbers back who likes doing
matrix arithmetic and working with
arrays of 16 numbers of position in user
let's solve this isn't something I
personally know how to go and transpose
and it's not something I enjoy working
with Eva but if you do want to go and
wear this position and information you
have access to this raw data in order to
go and perform the various
transformations because you're going to
need to go and take this position
information and then go and use it to
update your display and in fact it's
more complicated in there like some
games they'll perform like a performance
trick well they'll try and predict where
the user is going to be looking in a few
seconds time in order to avoid
calculating all these frames and with
this you can start to see why you need a
fairly high end machine in order to go
and run some of this stuff because in
order to come up with a decent
experience this needs to be calculated
very quickly otherwise you get this
horrible jerky sort of experience which
no one wants to use but I think the
majority of us apart from producer will
enjoy working with a frame where
more than some of that raw data directly
of course frameworks have their pros and
cons and when the main advantages of
frameworks is they come with a heap of
functionality we don't have to right so
we don't have to worry when we're using
a framework about maybe detecting
different devices maybe it cross-browser
issues or although hopefully there won't
be too many of those at this stage these
type of issues so there's a heap of
functionality out of the box so things
like working on different types of
devices and so on
you'll get that support hopefully and
the other great thing about frameworks
is they have some kind of community
around them and this can be useful
because everything from being able to
ask different questions to documentation
to other people developing plugins and
add-ons and so on in kinds of VR
development on the web I think there's
four main frameworks I'm going to show
you two of them today free j/s it has a
number of examples for working in with
different controllers and headsets so
you could certainly could just go riff
3j s if you want to use this approach
the moment I'm going to show you today
however is this framework called a frame
I've also got a touch very briefly I'm
react via I haven't used this one
extensively but if you like working with
react j/s it's got a very similar model
and you might enjoy working with this
framework it is less mature it's been
around not as long as a frame there's
less written about it
I can currently only get there sort of
hello world one working on the Firefox
nightly sorry not the nightly the the
new roots of Firefox so it's still
fairly early days for this but it
certainly looks very promising I never
even saw the fragment called Primrose I
haven't done anything with that at all
feel free to check it out so let's talk
about a frame so a frame was created by
the team over in Mozilla and it's
actually built on top of free Jas so
we're very frame you are still using
free Jas behind the scenes it's just
optimized for crating VR experiences you
don't even really need to necessarily be
a developer to go and construct scenes
using some of the a-frame stuff it is
very very easy to you
and but the really great thing about a
frame is it supports everything from the
mobile to tablet right up to a full
headset and without you writing any
additional code around this what does it
look like well he's probably the
simplest example here we have a year box
here I've specified some sizing
parameters I've given it a color and
I've given it a position on the screen
and this is all contained in a scene tag
here and what does this look like well
as you might imagine we have a year cube
on the screen I'm gonna close that down
and we'll go to hello a frame here with
that I guess that was four lines or so
we have a cube here I can go and drag
and go move the screen around here I can
go and use the WASD keys I can down move
around if I had a headset attached so I
could click this and it would run on the
headset I
it also comes with a GUI editor which
I've just forgotten the shortcut keys -
I won't worry too much I can't find it
it comes out the box with a editor to
enable you to go and move the
positioning information and stuff around
so you don't even need some code
necessarily for this sorry one second
there we go visual inspector troll Alton
I was the shortcut I was looking for so
I'll bring that up here and out the box
just by referencing the iframe library
we get this and I can move around so I
can see my scene I can go and select my
item there I can go and play around with
its position its rotation I can go and
expand the scene hierarchy so even if
you don't necessarily want to write any
code you can go and use this thing out
of the box you can use its going tweak
your scene go ahead and see how various
changes will work a frame comes out the
box and with a heap of primitives armed
so you get some text you get some very
sort of primitive shapes you can load 3d
models in and so on
so go back to you and the slides now a
frame is it follows this sort of
compositional model and it's referred to
as a entity component system and the
idea being is reuse so say you were
creating a game and you had some kind of
barrel of toxic waste which will kill
the player when they touch it you might
create some kind of behavior or
component which will kill the player and
then reuse that across multiple things
so everything from your barrel of toxic
waste to maybe some spikes or something
you place in your game maybe you create
a different component eerie glow which
you know create sort of a lighting
effect which you can then use across
multiple components and a frame sort of
follows this model and you can create
your own sort of primitives and elements
this is all the source code that's
involved here for a created in that box
so it has some default stuff going on
here around the sizing of the box and
then in this init function here it
betrays its free jeaious origins here
and anyone's only free j/s we can start
to see what's going on here where we
start to use the free jet geometry in
order to create this this is how there
we go and position the objects the code
behind this again behind the scenes we
use this object 3d here this is
something you have access to in a frame
which will give you the underlying free
GS version of the object so even though
you're using this nice framework you
still have complete power of free Jas in
order to go and work with things if some
functionality is not present that you
need so one of the demos I wanted to
create the first things you need in a
frame I started to wonder okay how do
you go and put materials on things
what's involved in in that and how can I
go and create an animation so we've got
that simple example there a spinning
cube and with first some material and
all that's involved to go and put that
together I've got a brick texture here
and I'm using this assets tag now this
assets tag here is kind of a clever
thing in the it will start cashing
assets
making sure that they're not requesting
multiple times I don't have my box here
and you'll notice I've included this
animation attribute here to go and
rotate it it's got this sort of kind of
nice declarative model and then probably
the next thing you might want to
consider is how do I actually interact
with my environment so I've got two
cubes here I don't know how well it
comes on the screen but there's kind of
a sort of a circle there for selecting
things that sort of simulates where I'm
currently looking at if I go in look if
I go and move this in refresh that get
rid of that zoom hopefully if I go and
move that down I go and select my cube
he'll go and change the color of that so
you can interact with your environments
as well now this is doing something with
synthetic events here so I've created a
component here called random color on
click which I've specified at the top
here and then I've got my cube and I've
all my two boxes there and I've got an
applied this sort of behavior or
component if you will to each of them so
you can see how you can start to get
some reuse across some of the assets in
your item and then the other thing I
brought in is this cursor now because it
doesn't really exist it's not like a Dom
element that we're clicking on on a
webpage we need a frame to actually go
and simulate these events and perform
the calculations as to what we're
actually selecting so the cursor takes
care of all the complexity of this for
us now if you're doing this in free Jes
it's a little bit more complicated and
you need to project raise and calculate
collisions and so on and then up here
standard JavaScript code really so we've
got adding an event listener as click
and then I went to lips off a bit of
Stack Overflow code of what's the best
ways to generate a random color we sent
the attribute and we go and set the
color to this so you can put these sort
of behaviors to together to start
creating some really quite complicated
applications
and we got really small
we'll have that back to 100% please and
one of the things I wanted to look at is
what would be involved in creating some
type of game so its might take a little
bit of time to load and so I put in a
model here we set those mountains in the
background there there procedurally
generated so does 90s its behind there
I've applied a year skybox so it's kind
of a cube with a texture if I don't know
if you can hear it but this is also a
sound playing in the background and I
can move around that scene I can look
around and maybe it's the basis for some
type of game or experience that want to
correct but what's quite nice about this
is really there's hardly any code to go
and create this experience and up top
here we reference the a frame library
I'm referencing an A Frame extension
which is goes and draws those mountains
for me I've added a bit of fog just to
make it a bit more atmospheric
I'm bringing in some assets some images
the models that I'm going to go and
import I've positioned the camera I've
used the mountain and it has various
options for generating some of that
stuff and then I have my entity which is
the spacecraft that's flying around here
and I've simply applied a couple of
animations to it and so really you know
there's hardly any code there it's all
declarative it's very easy to go and see
how that's working so if you want to
concentrate more on creating these type
of experiences I think this is a very
sort of accessible entry point to this
the item I use this for another nice
thing about VR is potentially it could
be really interesting in the field of
data visualization so this is a
theoretical example of some developer
job demand across Australia it's not
real data it's just crap data that I've
put up in an array
and I can go and move around this you
can probably just make out that the sort
we've got this nice sort of sea effect
here so I think there's a some nice
options here you can do different things
with a little as well just to add some
interest one of the other nice things
about a-frame and if you go to you on
your mobile if you've got a not
particularly recent even simple is best
not Cody okay / a-frame you'll see that
visualization demo going move your
mobile around and you'll see that you
start looking around that scene as well
and you can see how easy it is to go and
create these experiences people don't
necessarily need a headset maybe you've
got some kind of product on your website
maybe you're a building company you
could start allowing people to look
around some of you know your
constructions or house options so on
there's there's all sorts of things that
you can do with this let's talk about
react via now this is still relatively
new I don't know how well that shows up
there we have some import statements at
the top there and and then we have our
component and we've got j6 stuff that
we've returned there now if you're going
download react VR you install it through
NPM I'm going to start this up now
because it takes a bit of time sometimes
and and we'll go to and I'm gonna open
there in Firefox because it doesn't work
in chrome and they'll be running up in
the background react VR comes with a
load of command-line tools one of which
will create this sort of hello world
example for you when you go and type it
in wait for that to load up and
it's got kind of this sort of
checkerboard approach there we can move
around it yeah it's not a bad approach
it's kind of subjective but it seems to
perform better than a frame you'd need
to do maybe some testing but it feels it
feels more performant
it just feels smoother when you're
interacting with some of this stuff and
if I've got the code up and I can show
you what's behind that so this is the
default code that react VR will generate
for you there's some imports here of
various different modules that
chessboard pattern is that panel thing
there and then we have some text which
is that hello world text there so I
think one of the things I like about
react is it's very good sort of dividing
up your application and creating these
sort of reusable components and if you
do a lot of work we're free at Jes this
might be sort of a fun way of playing
with some of this or even making use of
some of your existing react.js code and
libraries as well
so I want to give you some general tips
for VR development no matter how you
choose to go and develop these whether
you're using web technologies maybe
you're using unity or some type of game
engine and a number one tip is do not
make your user feel unwell no one is
going to want to repeat your experience
if it makes them feel sick
and there's a number of things that go
into this so if you start whirling like
the vision around maybe you you want to
like start creating I don't know some
simulation of a roller coaster or
something you're gonna need to be very
careful with this because people don't
tend to like this type of experience
they don't tend to the you've all
probably experienced some point travel
sickness where things don't match up
you're going to make your users unwell
the other really important thing that
can contribute to this it's the
performance of your application the
brain will recognize if things is sort
of run into slowly it can actually be
semi painful to go and work with an
application that's not running properly
and I found this out when I was running
this on a machine that was way lower
spec than it should have been for the
device you get this kind of any Aloha
I've got a bit of a headache here I'll
put this down so even if you have to
start pairing back your experience and
reduce some of the complexity and
immersion of it it's probably worth
doing to go and keep that performance
high it's really important to contribute
into the users enjoyment of it unless
you start your day like this the other
thing you're going to need to be really
careful of is how people interact with
your application people come in all
different shapes and sizes have various
different degrees of flexibility maybe
you have some less able users as well
and if you're making all your users
reach up really high in order to go and
access some common function in your
application it's not going to work so
well it is still fairly early days for
VR development and it's not like it's
been through those sort of repeated
cycles of sort of websites where we've
come up with these different standards
of wave ways people work and interact
with applications or maybe an iPhone or
Android app it's still fairly early days
but do consider this and be careful I'd
also avoid text it's it's not completely
horrible and unpleasant but there's
normally better ways of doing it and in
the current generation of devices it's
not the nicest thing to look at on a
device particularly for maybe some of
your users that don't have perfect
vision as well so I'd probably generally
avoid that as well so in conclusion I
think the main advantages of sort of web
technology approach to some of this is
that there's no plugins required you can
go and run this stuff on multiple
platforms and devices it enables you to
use your familiar technologies that
probably many of you your web developers
you're using every day maybe you're
using react Jes every day to write your
applications it's not that much more of
a step to start playing around with this
and creating 3d worlds and stuff if
that's what you want to do but it does
come at a price
it's less performance and stable than
some native options so I'd like to leave
you if another for for me one of the
other really interesting aspects of web
VR is it's open it's an open standard no
one company owns this thing this means
that any of us can contribute to this
there's nothing stopping you going to
the standard put in suggestions
contributing to how you would like this
to work and and its development some of
these sort of vive and rift focused
things these are you know sort of owned
by some of the manufacturers and they're
gonna have a big input into this
resistance for everyone this is across
devices this is bigger than that and
maybe just maybe this is like the first
step to what will become some of the
next generation of web experiences right
now we're all used to browsing these
things on web pages and stuff they used
to say how that will be in five 10 20 or
even more years time and maybe this is
the first step to some of that so thank
you for staying with me to the end of
the day I'll be there by party if any of
you are attending there I hope you've
enjoyed the session and the first day of
NDC I wish you good night and any
questions
there's not a well the closest I'm aware
of anyway is a frame that's going to
handle some of these types of
interactions but one of the things I
tried doing was creating a game in three
j/s when I was more sort of more focused
in that area and I immediately found
what you're saying so once you start
wanting to deal with things like people
dragged in say I had like a sort of
command &amp;amp; Conquer Fink so I wanted to go
and drag pieces around and stuff and
then you realize there's nothing out the
box and you're gonna have to start
writing some of this the math behind
this yourself you're gonna have to
handle someone pressing the mouse
picking that up dropping it can they
drop it on there whereas something like
unity it's true they'll give you a heap
of stuff around this and they'll make it
a lot easier for you so at the moment
it's still fairly early days and that
type of thing look it is serve better by
unity at the moment no doubt
yeah the Luke WebGL is pretty well
supported now so that that bits not a
problem I'm not aware of what the
precise issue is I find from what I've
seen sometimes browser manufacturers
they've got limited resources and they
just wait to see hey is this gonna be a
thing they'll wait for the standard to
mature before sort of jumping on board
so particularly Microsoft tend to take a
more cautious approach generally they'll
wait for a standard to sort of stabilize
that never like okay we'll go for that
or it's got enough uptake and we'll
dedicate some resources to support in
that particular option but with it being
in Firefox were already coming in chrome
and it's in Chrome for Android already
it's not going to be long before it's
supported in two pretty major browsers
then we have edge which is okay I don't
know if anyone's still using Safari but
so it's pretty well supported how it
will be very shortly now that that
Mountain Fink is a library that you can
just grab and it's a one-liner to import
it he said a couple of options the
heightened sort of distribution of
mountains and then I played with some of
the lighting and frogs to folk sort of
effects to get the effect that I wanted
yeah
it uses something I think that ones
Perlin noise which is kind of
interesting how it works if you into
that type of thing cool well we'll wrap
up there and thanks very much for
listening have a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
