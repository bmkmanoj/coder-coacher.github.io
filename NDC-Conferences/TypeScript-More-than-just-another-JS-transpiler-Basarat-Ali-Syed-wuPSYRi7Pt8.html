my roommates going out of town tomorrow
so if we want to come back here after
Ehrlich's party oh okay yeah sure that
sounds good to me
all right it's a date see you then
Richard what's wrong nothing nothing
literally it's all good
your roommates are right you really hate
space no no no no I don't it's not hate
hates a strong word
um truth be told I do have a slight
preference for tabs but that's only
because I'm anal and because I'd prefer
precision well not to pick a fight here
but if you really care about precision
wouldn't you use spaces but whatever
once it goes through the compiler it's
the same thing right yeah yeah
technically yes I guess I just I just
don't understand why you anyone use
spaces over tabs like if it's all the
same why not just use tabs because it
could look different on other people's
computers tabs create smaller file sizes
all right I run a compression company
trust me I've devoted my life to
minimalizing file sizes it's what I do
I mean I do not get why anyone would use
spaces over tabs I mean why not just use
vim over Emacs I do use vamo for Emacs
oh god help us
okay you know what I just I don't think
this is gonna work I'm so sorry I mean
like what we're gonna bring kids into
this world with that over the head
that's not really fair to them do you
think kids we haven't even slept
together and guess what it's never gonna
happen now because there is no way I'm
gonna be with someone who uses spaces
over tabs
Richard Wow okay goodbye one tab the
eight space
Oh oh my god I'm sure what happened I
just tried to go down the stairs eight
steps at a time okay though
see you around Richard just making a
point
all right that's the weird thing about
using YouTube probably not a good idea
hello everybody my name is Beth and this
is a talk what I've said thank you for
waking up so early in the morning and
coming to watch this talk before I begin
how many people here use JavaScript for
the day-to-day job please raise your
hands
all right a lot of you do that's good
because this talk is for you how many of
you use a transpiler for a JavaScript
nice how many of you use typescript as
your transpiler all right so good
audience how many if you use spaces
that's a joke
so I use Pacers by the way tabs books
joke the thing that I want to make very
clear in this presentation that
typescript is just JavaScript I've been
told that I need to stay here to be in
the video and essentially providing a
better initial experience when you start
using javascript because javascript is
not a perfect language we all understand
that it has a few what stuff that makes
you go like what instead of like having
nice cats and horses being in how many
cats purring horses you get stuff like
javascript does has the concept of
errors like I'm sure we've all seen
something like this happen to us
we you call some function on something
and it does give you a nice error that
this thing doesn't exist on that
particular object and we get nice stack
traces as well so you know exactly where
something went wrong however it does
have pitfalls that in a number of cases
it won't actually give you an error and
it's up to you to figure out where stuff
broke like LASIK um here's an example
that a beginner Java developer might
very well write on his own he'll be like
I can just do add to erase what do you
think is going to be the outcome of this
thing
not quite again not quite it's actually
going to be an empty string that makes
sense like type error would have been a
better thing
however we will actually get an empty
string you add an object to an array
like this this is exact this is
definitely a type error this makes no
sense you'd want an error in this place
you'd want a stack trace at this place
but you won't get it and you'll have to
debug your variables to see what they
hold and what operation is where did the
operation go wrong what do you think is
your outcome of this thing it's what
it's essentially going to do it's a
JavaScript is essentially what it is
going to convert both of these to a
string and we saw that an array converts
to a string as an empty string and an
object converts to a string is object
object so that's why why you get that
thing there and of course like in
arithmetic a plus B is equal to B plus a
but this is JavaScript this is a
programming language the meaning of
addition is driven by the operands and
in this case the operands reverse so
this is essentially not the same as the
previous one and it's a number which
again makes perfect sense you
expect the type better but it's a number
you add to objects
it gets even funnier because if I run
this through my browser over here you
get testing which is what I show here as
well we'll just noted the two objects
two strings and added them together but
if you run it through ie you get not a
number because that makes sense and of
course once you get not a number it's
going to stay an order number small
number + and number is not a number
number star number is not number
numbered white not number it's not a
number it's all on a number JavaScript
does have a few good things for example
the addition of numbers into strings
makes perfect sense it just the
departing a number to a string is a
something that we understand naturally
and JavaScript supports that as well
you can add negative numbers to strings
as well and they can catenate nicely as
well and we use this to power our user
interfaces to show numbers to users all
the time however anybody want to take a
guess what the outcome of this
particular expression is like and and
we've seen like once it's not a number
it's gonna stain on a number just it's
and your user interface is still gonna
work you won't get a nice stack trace
but the user might not understand what
happened and like you show this to a new
JavaScript worker and they'll probably
say that o we have linters we can link
this I would like he passes to es saying
it will gladly give you an error but
consider this case where we have an odd
function now the function on its own is
actually perfectly fine there's nothing
wrong with this function its how the
function is actually being used which is
actually going to be an error and again
you can say that I can link this with my
linter as well just do minor flow
allowances and then I'll show you this
example where the variables are coming
from elsewhere gonna be like where
they're coming from it's coming from the
server
doesn't matter its external to your
system and we deal with external systems
all the time and we want to write safe
JavaScript code which doesn't magically
break in certain cases and that's
essentially what that script is that
script is a linter for JavaScript all
the examples that we saw previously like
these things did not make sense to any
of us if you give them to the Tatra
compiler it will actually be a compile
time error now that script takes any
piece of JavaScript code and I will just
go ahead and open that script playground
so this is on the type K plank dot org
website on the left hand side you get to
write that script and on the right hand
side it produces the generated
JavaScript now the great thing about
typescript is that any valid JavaScript
is valid typescript
however typescript adds additional
syntax essentially for linting so here
I've gone ahead and said that foo is
something that must always be a number
so type careful not let me and assign
something that is unsafe to it
everything in this code right now except
for this particular annotation is just
JavaScript and you can get fancy with
your annotations as well so I can say
that it must be something which has a
member bar which must be a number so
then you would actually have to like if
you assign a number to it it's going to
be an error it must be an object that
has the property bar of type number on
it so something like this now that's
fine congratulations you are now all if
you already need a skip in on a tight
script that's the only syntax that we'll
use in this presentation let's take a
step back and really understand that
shifts value proposition it offers two
things first of all I've said this
previously and I'm going to say this
again again throughout this presentation
that it is just JavaScript with
additional syntax and that additional
syntax
so you'd a scripted a the JavaScript
next that additional syntax is primarily
for linting that's always safer and like
so understanding these two value
propositions a transpiler and Alinta
your first question might probably be
that why is it why use a transpiler
anyways a lot of you like like the hands
that went up in the beginning of this
presentation of people that use
javascript many of them used a
transpiler anyway so i don't think i
need to do much convincing there what a
transpiler essentially allows you to do
is to use modern JavaScript syntax that
might not be available in all the users
browsers in your codebase today and
there are practical reasons for this it
the new syntax does help prevent a few
bugs and does provide a nice syntax for
common JavaScript patterns for example
for a functional language you seem to be
writing the word function quite a lot
and the next version of JavaScript
actually gives you error functions where
it's a lot less terse and because you're
creating functions constantly it's a lot
easier to do them now there are other
things that actually prevent bugs as
well like this is a very common
programming interview question presented
over here we you give this code to a
developer and ask them what is going to
print so what this code is doing is
we're creating a bunch of functions that
are going to be stored in an array we
loop thrice and then we create these
functions and these functions capture
the variable I and then we go ahead and
call these functions so that function is
going to execute for each iteration so
for coming from C sharp or Java you
might actually expect that the outcome
would be 0 1 2 because we created three
functions with different variable eyes
however the VAR keyword in javascript is
function scoped not block scope so the
variable I is actually shared between
the three loop hydration then you get
the same output for each of the function
which is 3 3 3 like this code this War I
is exactly the same as if someone had
written this thing over here and now
it's much more into you table to see why
it's going to be 3 T 3 now you use the
let keyword which is new with the new
version of JavaScript you don't actually
get that Erika's let is blocked scoped
so that let I is actually going to be a
new variable created for each function
hydration and then it's a lot more
intuitive to what a c-sharp or a Java
developer might actually expect they've
got to be and we use multiple languages
in our day-to-day jobs so it's nice to
have consistency across your programming
languages so you don't have that
continuous mental shift that are this is
Java this is too different from my other
language and like so the JavaScript URIs
might argue that they're going to get
better JavaScript in the browsers
brothers anyways eventually and that's
when I'm going to actually use the
syntax I don't need to use this today
and the two key arguments against that
are that there are going to be new
things within the JavaScript
specification that are going to prevent
bugs for example I showed the let
keyboard over here and additionally if
you want to keep your skills up to date
it is good to be using a transpiler
and you're going to have to cross this
bridge where some stuff runs in the
user's process and there's some stuff
that is in specification that's
preventing bugs and you're keeping your
skills up to date and one of those
bridges is batch script so that's the
whole of the transportation story the
two key value propositions for type
skateboard that it's going to give you
transpiler
and Alinta now as soon as we talk about
the linty the first thing that comes up
is the name the type script the type
within touch gift and that starts the
whole religious argument about static
versus dynamic types and there are a
large number of augments people make one
of them is that I have tests well you
have tests for most of your codebase it
doesn't really like it's good to have
tests for things that a sinking and
typescript
is essentially like linting is a form of
testing another claim is like so like
and tests can be wrong as well so
this was JavaScript and the test run
over black ice oh I'm fine so you want
something more than that and that's is
what bad script is another key
motivation for actually having these
type annotations within your codebase is
that it provides better documentation
like take this example this is a very
famous function right now left pad that
I if you look at the signature the types
are in the names like STR it's a string
length it's a number like you get that
intuitive thing it's just that it's not
mentioned in any significant way to your
transpiler to make sure that no one uses
them in a wrong way
and like no like this is perfectly valid
JavaScript this works just fine however
you don't write JavaScript like this you
actually mention your arguments upfront
so that the person who's going to read
the code is going to understand what the
motivation which will have behind the
function was and like I've said this
before you give JavaScript I'm sure it's
going to happily transpile it for you
the type system is completely optional
so give it a tax cap it'll be fine
but you get the opportunity to actually
help document your code and essentially
make this available for IDs and
essentially testing another claim that I
hear quite commonly is that I have
conventions I don't need any type
annotations all my users always have
user ID all my users always have display
name so I'm always consistent there so I
don't need type in additions you can how
are you going to document these like you
can write them like this within your
Docs or you can actually just add a type
annotation and then your code is self
documenting so again type scape the
annotations are essentially documenting
your conventions and there's a lot of
pain that people have felt with type
systems in the past type care does not
attempt to be the was most sound type
system like other languages I don't want
to mention the names Hesco it tries to
be convenient in that you write
JavaScript code and
it won't make it painful for you like
other languages so this particular piece
of code this is valid JavaScript and
this is perfectly valid typescript as
well and like I've shown this before I'm
gonna show this again and again before
it burned into your retinas and you can
at any point annotate any variable as
any and from that point on types it
would be quite about it like you can
write code like this as well that food
can be anything and you can assign a
number to it you can assign a spring to
it you can assign a regex to it you can
assign whatever you can imagine to it
and then you can call whatever function
you want to call on it and if you
execute just this piece of code is going
to fail at runtime but you don't ask it
to be quite about it and it was so like
if you're a right JavaScript as I've
said you can do it all day long no
problem and another great thing about
the typescript ID system what makes it
different from the other type systems is
that it's structural how many people
here have used Auto mapper how many of
you have had an auto map an entry that
is just x + y without any qualifications
alright so you don't need to do that but
I've skipped because it's structural so
if just because the names differ between
the two things if the structure of the
two types is the same cross assigning
between the types is perfectly fine the
types are purely structural they're
purely for documentation purposes they
do not exist at runtime they do not have
the names impacting their runtime
semantics another concern that you might
have about typescript is that we're
going to outlive my project like my
project is a 10-year project I don't
want X get to die in the middle of it
well what same work are you going to use
I'm gonna use angular well that's you
think that's cap are you going to use
ember well the glimmer engine with the
number is using typescript cycle GSU's
the side script how many people here
have heard of this framework alright how
many people actually use it alright this
is I haven't person said raise your hand
when I apologize that give me your
simulator
there is a synthetic base like quite
commonly I raise this that maybe like
people are talking about managing
leadership or basis is the question that
have you considered typescript and then
let's say that I don't want to learn
Scala or I don't want to learn
CoffeeScript who wanna learn dot or
something else that skip is just
JavaScript we feel familiar with
JavaScript all that you're doing is
using pet script as a transpiler with
optional annotations if you want to
again that diagram is it in your retinas
yet and there is a comparison between
like so how many this is a simple piece
of code that I showed previously how
many people here think that this is
valid JavaScript like if I give this
code do my JavaScript engine do you
think it'll work so there is additional
syntax over here which it didn't work it
said again unexpected token semicolon
and that additional syntax is that
number in addition over there however if
you give this to Babel today opening
somewhere it'll happily cross valid and
these are just the defaults
I haven't changed anything over here I
do not mean to have that check mark I
guess they have the bad fault now that's
because the people that make these tools
they understand the value of types Babel
by default supports flow types and this
is exactly the same type in addition
syntax that he used with typescript
however Babel is very focused on being a
transpiler if you want type checking you
actually use an external tool like flow
with Babel so over here we said that
food must be a number and then we assign
the string to it and Babel will not
complain that's the dog of flow in
babbles mind however you give the same
piece of code to touch kept and we have
seen this before it'll actually
complained that string is not assignable
to ever so typescript is your
one-stop-shop transpiler and linter and
one so if you're using something like
babbles today is absolutely no point not
to try a typescript you don't have to
use it but just give it a go
and it is like these annotations are all
about that ending types key value
proposition is not a strands collation
that's a secondary proposition the main
proposition is linting and the ide
tooling that it provides and when I jump
into the demos you'll see that so just
pick up any library that you've seen out
there for example like jQuery this is
pointing the jQuery Docs you can see
type annotations everywhere like this is
essentially documentation that you have
to keep in your mind if you want to be
successful with jQuery they react as an
example so the reaction documentation
that has types littered all over it so
when it the string is something that
returns a string and takes a react
element code mirror so how many people
here are familiar with code mirror
all right so whenever you open dev tools
in chrome code mirror is essentially the
code editor and that was crashed all
right
it's the editor that you see within the
sources panel within there - it has one
of the best documentation in my honest
opinion and the reason why is because as
soon as you look at the stuff in action
you know exactly what it's going to take
like you know doctored get value is
going to take a separator which is going
to be a string and it's actually going
to return to your string like get value
for a documentation management system
you might think that it might return a
lines array to you but that a notation
tells me up front that is actually going
to be a string and like pick your
favorite library look at its
documentation if you like it I'm sure
its documentation contains types that's
why you like it otherwise you wouldn't
be able to understand what does it take
what does it return what is going on so
with that the how many people here have
heard of definitely typed all right so
this was the product that started in
2012
immediately after typescript was
released and what they've actually done
is they've gone ahead and added
documentation that can be used by tasket
for all the major libraries out there
for example let's just take a look at
the documentation for jQuery and this is
like that all the stuff about jQuery
that you would have to keep within your
brain if you wanted to be sure that
nothing would go wrong with jQuery and
then you would actually have to pass
someone else's commit to your codebase
and review them and make sure that
they're using jQuery is the way it's
meant to be used so with that
it is by Microsoft but it's the new
Microsoft so it's all open source I'm
running it on a Mac it works everywhere
it's just JavaScript it's written in
touch script as well which is again just
JavaScript so are there any questions at
this point all right let's just jump
into the demo so so over here
I'm just going to go ahead and open a
J's phone can you see the file back
there can you see it now can you see it
now all right
so this is a JavaScript file it has a
bunch of errors in it
they are intentional but the key thing
that I want to point out is that it's
hard to review like this is a JavaScript
that you have to review from the new
developer you feel your player that
object I define properties when call
does anybody see anything wrong with
this line beyond the fact that the new
developer is adding stuff to a window
that's because you're not expected to
memorize the signature of object or
define property from the leimia brain
however type scripts already contains
the definition for this particular thing
and the kind of structure that it
expects and it's going to go ahead and
point out that read-only is not
something that you add to define
property what is something that you add
to object a different property well
that's just lead this and let tax click
Auto compete it for us all writable
sounds like something that the developer
might have wanted to use and now it's
fine
being a non-native English speaker I
don't even know how to spell right about
correctly so it's nice that I don't have
to all of this stuff that the JavaScript
runtime has I don't have to have it in
my brain it's all being limited for me
and being autocomplete it for me so I
can focus on my actual application
can understand that delivery method what
it does that's more significant to me
than understanding the browser ad sync
receives and the exact semantics of the
browser API and making sure that no one
actually uses it in the wrong way so
here's another area does anybody know
what the error is within this line the
error is that parts int actually goes
ahead and takes a string however
document get element by ID returns an
HTML element you the developer probably
wanted something like text content and
then so that's a string and that that
that's what they wanted
masked or something like that that's
just like this this is another example
which very well might not actually feel
that runtime everything might give you
an an where they actually meant to use
the binary or instead of the bit or
operator which is like this is quite
common way of getting a default value
from something and that that fixes the
error that I should caught up front but
if you look within this file send
updates it has a comment it says that
email address an email address or an
array of email addresses to chip with
now that that's that's something that
you want to document any code like if
you were writing good JavaScript that's
what you would write anyways but what
you can do now with typescript is that
you can actually go ahead and document
this for the compiler as well you can
say it to the compiler that make sure
that anybody who calls this function
passes me a string or a string array you
don't have to read this particular
comment and pass the meaning of that
within your brain once you become
familiar with the types of syntax it
becomes much more natural and what's
going to happen over here that purpose
is going to actually figure out that the
function body conforms to this structure
as well if you think about it the
function signature that's just a theorem
and the function body is the proof of
the theorem like if I go ahead and
annotate that something must be a string
that this function must return a string
that shit's going to actually
essentially do a test on the function
and make sure that it returns a string
which in this case it doesn't
so with that simple inhalation of
converting that comment do a type
annotation that's just going to go ahead
and figure out
there are miss usages of the parameter
within the function and over here does
anybody know that the error like why
would this not work like this sounds
like a perfectly valid comment if it's
an array loop over it that's that's duck
typing like why would that not work
does anybody know yeah and that's just
go ahead and figure that out so like a
proper way to discriminate between a
string and a string array with es5 is
this method so array dot is array so
that would actually go ahead and within
this block there is no way that email
address cannot be an array so that she's
going to go ahead and figure that out
and it's going to figure out that email
address must be a string array and
there's an else over here and that's
just going to go ahead and figure out
that within this block it must be a
string because there's not a string
array because that's in the previous
block and then you get more errors
within this code does anybody know the
error over here yes that's error here
thank you for that this is why you start
skipping demos does anybody know the
error here so it's the issue is that
it's actually welcome index that's a
signature of for each and they will swap
around so what was happening was that
RDX was actually the string and valve
was the index within the for each like
so this is something that the universe
might very well write and we've just
seen that like if they push this with
like okay let's just push this
production let's make it a testings
problem well you can add pipe on
additions and just fix it there and then
you don't even like this is essentially
code coverage for this particular block
that if you write tests for it that test
is only going to get so and become a
nightmare to maintain because if you
want to change something you have to
change it to as many if justified why
did you change the test why did elite
the test cuz it wasn't working
you should have fixed the code that I
skip it's much more natural so that's
just a quick demonstration does anybody
have questions about this particular
thing
all right
ugly let's jump to the next one so what
I am going to do now is I have a very
simple react app written in typescript
so how many people here are familiar
with react alright so that number is a
bit low so three people everybody does
not react but you might not actually
know why react is awesome so the reason
why react is awesome let me just before
I go there let me just explain the setup
and just show you exactly how simple to
set up as it is if you just initialize
an NPM module so NPM in it you get this
packaged edition npm install wetback
before you bring in web back into the
project and then within start I have a
pax - - watch and what that's going to
do it's going to pick up a web backdoor
config in the same folder and the web
backdoor config is even simpler we have
an entry point for our application and
then we have an output bundle with which
web pack is going to generate and we
then tell web pack that just take if a
module is also RTS or TS x transpile it
with TS laura that's like so that is
essentially copy/paste I don't imagine
how that can be any simpler than that we
have a very simple industrial HTML with
that which is actually just going to go
ahead and load that bundle yes and then
we have our apt or TS X which is the
main entry point for our application so
with that if I go ahead and in a
separate window just run NPM stock that
is going to go ahead and run wet back in
watch mode cool so like that's
blindingly easy I'm just going to go
ahead and copy the path to this HTML
file I don't need to even need a server
I'm just showing this HTML file to the
browser directly what I will do to prove
that this is that file is just I will
console.log hey and DC peeps and you
actually see that logged within the
console cool now the reason why react
I'm a big advocate of react is that it's
just JavaScript here's an example of
something that is coming from yet so I'm
just going to go ahead and have a div
with hello world inside a fan and I'm
going to go ahead and console the clock
now this syntax sort of scares a few
people and it's essentially very similar
to something like so let me just show
you what it logs out you'll actually see
that it's just an object that's being
created nothing fancy about it it's
essentially very similar to something
like console dot log something like like
type is a div and then it has some props
which has some children which is hello
world that's all that is like the two
objects that are going to get logged out
they're very similar it's just syntactic
sugar on top of that but the great thing
of using this is that it allows you to
use all your JavaScript tooling for
maintaining your HTML stuff as well so
you can have a cohesive story for an
application with just one programming
language and touch get suppose said out
of the box all that I've done over here
is created a tight ship config file and
just told it that for the GSX syntax go
ahead and convert that to the react
version of transporation so so that's
very clear that's just an object and
then what you can do with the GATT is
you can actually go ahead and ask it to
convert it to any format so for example
I can go ahead and convert this object
into something that you can set as an
inner HTML for something so I'll just go
ahead and bring in react on server
and I'm actually going to go ahead and
react Tom server dot render the string
so I'm just gonna go ahead and store
this in a variable foo is equal to this
thing done console.log foo you saw this
before I'm just going to go ahead and
render the food to a string as well so
now if I go ahead and run this you'll
actually see that it there's an idea
nice div that you can potentially set as
an inner HTML for something in addition
to rendering to a string you can
actually have react render to some
element within your Dom as well so
within our index.html we just have this
one Dave with an ID root I can get a
handle to that div quite easily with
document dot get element by ID root if I
just lock that out you'll see that
they've logged out that's fine what I
can do is ask react to render foo do
that Dave
and now you'll actually see hello world
being shown up as it if so are there any
questions about that
No so so the great thing is that it's
this GSX that you see over here it's
within a TSX file so it is what it's the
GS x index plus that I've steps index
supported in that as well and the only
transpiler that you need for this is
static if you saw the web backdoor
config there is no Babel reference over
here it's just TS flora so for any TS or
TSX files you toe-touch get to use sorry
swept-back to use touch script and
that's only transpire that selection
over here yep so this is something that
is very similar to something I mentioned
previously that if you give a js4 with
type annotations to be able it'll
happily transpose it I'm not a big fan
of that I'd like to have my GS files
only contained J s index nothing matter
if it's es next index that's totally
fine with me but I don't want
non-standard track es syntax in a J's
file that's why I prefer to have that
syntax in a TS file and use something
like that script instead of something
like flow additionally with JSX syntax
it's quite common for people to actually
put that in a J's file and then just
pass it through rebel with that
conversion as well the task a team has
gone to the decision that because it's
actually different from TS as well as a
TS the main motivation for TS is having
type annotations the main motivation for
having TS x is to have type annotations
and JSX supported
so that's just like so now you can go
ahead and update your resume on LinkedIn
that you know react what you can
additionally do because it's just an
object that's being passed around like
it's very easy for me to convert this to
a function so this is a function that
returns that Dave so now I actually have
to go ahead and call that function and
you can see that it still works fine now
with that you can actually have the
function take parameters as well so I
can just go ahead and say that it is
something that has message inside of it
now because this stretchy bits gonna
pick up the fact that within your code
base somewhere you're actually calling
this function without passing in all the
objects so it's gonna enforce you to use
message over here which must be
something so I'll just go ahead and say
hello NDC and I'll actually go ahead and
use that within my component as well so
now if I run this you can see that that
essentially what I've done is I've
actually created a react component
without ever actually creating a react
component because it's just JavaScript
what you can you can take this further
and that's what the original sample was
we just go ahead and take two properties
so I'm saying that properties is
something that must have a compiler of
type string and framework of type string
and then when you go ahead and so I
could very easily do this as well hello
and as soon as I do this it's a function
that takes two properties types it's
gonna complain it's gonna say that it
must have a compiler which is something
and then it must have a framework which
is something else or whatever and this
would work perfectly fine as well
however what I am converting this
particular function call into JSX syntax
is going to do is I'm creating and again
an object instead of actually creating a
function I'm telling react that render
the hello function with these particular
properties so I'm not actually
immediately invoking the function I'm
just giving that object specification to
react and then
react is going to render it when it
needs to so that's all all the GS X is
is a better way of creating an object
you can write that object yourself if
you want to it's just more painful
now with that so that you could use
babble with this as well then you
wouldn't get any even get them
discriminating experience there but if
you use type skip what you actually get
is compiled on safety so for example if
you go ahead and misspell something over
here you're going to get an error that
our compiler is not a property that this
particular component accepts if you
misspell the component name that is
going to complain this variable is not
defined I don't see any hello / hello so
ver here there's only a hello maybe you
were meant to use that and then
additionally the type subject as well so
if I go ahead and say that compiler must
be a number and if someone calls that
wrong that shit's going to go ahead and
complain that we keep trying to give a
string to a number you're probably
making a mistake there so it's really
about that agility of your developer to
do this is really about developer
tooling touch scripts key value
proposition is the key is the linking
and the type checking for your code now
additionally what you can do is like
have has anybody ever tried to rename
stuff in the JavaScript did you enjoy it
so yeah we touch get the experience is
something like this so if I just go
ahead and fix my compiler error I can go
ahead and rename compilers to something
else and it just works like so you can
get the non-native English speaker to
name their variables whatever makes
sense to them and then when the code
comes to you you can say well I'm not
you just gonna rename this don't worry
about it it's myself you can go home now
whereas we're - can you like can you
please rename this to the standards that
I'm following cuz I can't rename this
it's going to be a nightmare and then
send it to me again and then I look at
it so that that's the beauty of touch
get any questions about that it's within
the toshka project so over here we have
it is configure jason which is including
everything within the folder and the
folder actually only contain
contains one father a party
yes definitely
yes so that does exist and that is what
this particular project was set up to do
so you can see Taipings dot typings
install so if you run npm install on
this project it'll go ahead and install
the latest Taipings for you so sorry it
will just install the type things you
can add a new one which is like
something some NPM script that typings -
- update and it will do that that said
the key thing that you should keep in
your mind is if you don't have type
definitions your experience is very
similar to what a JavaScript developers
experience would be so any pain you feel
in bringing in typing's is essentially
the pain of bringing in any
documentation like I'd rather have the
documentation and go through that pain
once and then not have to worry about it
and keep it in my head then having to
memorize the whole of the jQuery API and
then keep it in my brain at all times
I'd like to think of higher order
problems than that so that is their like
because it's all statically analyzable
you get other things like fine
references as well so for what are all
the references of this particular thing
this is essentially like fine references
it's simpler than we name so nothing
fancy to show that now the next demo
that I'm actually going to jump to is
the experience of converting a
JavaScript project to typescript how
many people here have heard of UDS I see
no chance so a number of you have heard
of it it's one of the very popular
frameworks out there it's written in es6
now because I've been showing this
continually that typescript is just
JavaScript you can give it a JavaScript
file and will happily cross buy it for
you
I'm just going to as a demo open up the
view source code within my IDE now this
is the directory for VG's so you can see
that there's nothing up my sleeve I am
on the dev branch up to arrest there are
some files and I'm curious why are they
on Save Changes yep so that's just when
my ID booted up it editor
so far so nothing up my sleeve it's all
just the view J source code vanilla now
at this point there is no type shipped
within this code base this code base is
massive it has a lot of GS files and you
might be worried this is something that
your project your project might look
like and you might want to migrate to
the typescript the first thing that
you're actually going to do is go ahead
and create a TS config dot jason and it
is to configure adjacent file is just
essentially you telling the Tatra
compiler the source code of your project
and the configuration options and it's
actually very easy all that i need to do
within my compiler options is just tell
it that a large s because I have a J's
file a bunch of J's files within my
project and then as soon as you do that
because it's going to have to transpile
them it's going to have to move them
from some source directly to a
destination directly I see that there's
a dist folder here so I'll just go ahead
and specify an out DAR as well as the
dist folder and then I'm going to tell
stipes kept all the files that are to be
included within my project and all the
source code seems to be inside the
source folder it isn't but let's just go
with that assumption so a source get
every start of J's from that folder and
because I'm actually going to be
migrating into TS I'm just going to go
ahead and the TS as well so that's like
I couldn't make that configuration any
simpler than that I'm just going to go
ahead and tell type scripts and this is
the project that I want to work on as
soon as I do that you can see that the
source folder lights up so these are all
the files that are now within the pet
ship completion context and you can see
that there are actually no errors with
this project because this was valid
JavaScript that script took that valid
JavaScript and give back with a
JavaScript it will not complain for JS
files now if I just jump into index or
chase with in that file I can actually
go ahead and see whatever translation
that ship is actually going to go ahead
and do for this file so for example I
can go ahead and say let Foos equal to 1
2 3 and then touch it was actually going
to go ahead and cross file let away from
me and convert it into R I can go ahead
and say that foo is something
that is a function that always returns
and now and taps is going to go ahead
and convert that arrow into a function
that always returns now so you can
actually use cross spy script as just
your transpiler
but the key thing about that is that
javascript has very low semantics about
what is and isn't
so it's essentially doing a syntactic
check but it's not putting any
restrictions on your code base which
means it cannot provide guarantees about
the quality of tooling that you get and
this is essentially like if you open up
JetBrains and like if you have some
variable foo over here and then you have
some variable bar over here it will
happily provide autocomplete that maybe
he wanted fubar dot foo like no foo is a
number why would you suggest that as an
autocomplete for bar but that is the
kind of JavaScript tooling that you get
in any idea out there and that's so this
is this using typescript code
intelligence for JavaScript files this
is codename salsa and you'll see this
mention in a number of other tools as
well you see that in visual studio you
see that in vs code as well but this is
the experience that you'll get if you're
using code intelligence for pure
JavaScript JavaScript files what you can
do within the same project is I can go
ahead and add for example a bar or TS
file and now when this file gets into
the types of population context here's
an example so if I go ahead and define a
function over here and I specify that
the function always takes some argument
that Schiphol not let me call this
function without an argument why would
you have a function that takes an
argument and not call it without an
argument it makes no sense it's going to
force you to have that however within
JavaScript people write this code all
the time that they have functions that
when they take optional arguments
because there is no way of annotating it
that's keeping a lot hurt you for using
javascript it'll try to help you as much
as it can but it cannot provide static
guarantees that you actually get from
something that is designed to be
statically analyzable
so if you want something that is
optional touch will actually force you
down the path of
that is optional and this is something
that people run into when they think
about that did they open up a taxi
father start writing code and then test
it starts screaming at them that this is
unsafe and then they say this is valid
JavaScript I'm going to move to a
JavaScript file but the pain that you're
actually feeling is the pain you're
going to feel at a future point or the
next person is going to feel after
you've clift so that's that but you
can't actually like so mix and match
them quite easy within your project as
well so I can go ahead and export this
function from that does nothing from
this board or TAS and I can I can
actually use this quite easily within my
JavaScript file as well so I can go
ahead and import from bar let's just
bring in the function bar and just call
it oh good perfectly fine I just mixed
matched bad shape and JavaScript in the
same project not a problem you can
convert PGS to JavaScript I've skipped
in one second because you just need a TS
config file you can do that with any
project if it's better JavaScript it's
going to valley touch get what you will
not get is stuff like if I have so I
have a question so if I just go ahead
and have something that isn't valid
JavaScript within a tasket file that
ship is going to complain that that's
not a valid variable number what I doing
this is the JavaScript file so you do
get syntactic errors type checked but
that's good
by checking you do get some of it but
you don't get it to the extent that you
respect primarily because it doesn't
have that guarantees and there are
others like so the great thing about
that ship is that there's a slider that
you can move as far as you want for
example I can be a bit more strict about
my code I can say that it must it no
implicit any like don't let and if it's
not analyzable don't let me do that and
you can see that an error shows up over
here what like this function there is no
way for that ship to figure out what the
type of Argos it can be anything that's
essentially something that you've left
undocumented for the next developer as
well but not that she was actually going
to complain and force you to say that oh
I cannot infer the type of this what did
you mean well I meant a number so just
go ahead and do that and the test it
will be quite about it and there are a
lot of other
slags as well for example you can say
that no unused parameters and if I set
that as crew you'll actually see that so
you define up but you never use it did
you mean to do that why would you do
that right is that to confuse the next
guy no no no sorry I didn't mean to use
it that's why sorry my bad okay so these
so what what are the - a team is doing
so they went from having a very
JavaScript experience for everyone to be
a very strict experience for those that
can afford that luxury like if you go
into a new team and you tell them that
please use type script for your
JavaScript they'll be like I don't like
types and then we'll say you don't have
to use them and that'll work
that's the default experience that you
want because it is your JavaScript like
it touch Gabe is focused on making your
JavaScript the best experience out there
so if you want a different experience
you have flex to switch them all you
have to know like so to do it if and
essentially this is something that other
transpilers flow they'll actually give
you more errors and then they might
actually confuse you
whereas with touch it you actually
understand the type system before you
can actually use it yep still tomorrow
so you can see that there are seven
errors that have started to show up so
that's uh no those aren't those aren't
so that that isn't that's just a
syntactic errors that have many of them
do because you don't have the
opportunity to mention an optional in
JavaScript right so forcing you to be
excited about your arguments that's not
something that your javascript is going
to be able to migrate to so if you want
the best tuning spinning best learning
experience you / - yeah
so what I wasn't writing that I was
writing Java so this let foods equal to
something that is just JavaScript if you
go ahead and annotate it like something
that is like this thing you'll actually
see that should contain that you cannot
use type annotations in a geographer and
that that's what you want you want don't
want a George a as for with type inside
of it so if you're concerned about that
script getting all up in your JavaScript
don't be so for for those things like
you can still keep this separate so a
key example of that would be like if you
have jQuery within your project you can
actually go ahead and do this thing so
right now so within like this yes file
dollar isn't something that's actually
going to show up as an autocomplete
thing because you can go ahead and
declare with another dids that there is
something called dollar that has less to
say the method ajax on it which is
anything I don't care to annotate that
right now but then you actually get to
use dollar dot Ajax and all that
autocomplete and then additionally so
this is essentially a documentation for
J's file out there within your project
or within someone else's project in this
case jQuery you can actually use the
task file but then within here
immediately right now like if I go ahead
and comment out all of this dot b dot es
documentation for o dot J's file I can
at this moment not use dollar however if
I go ahead and document my JavaScript I
can actually use that within a dot d s
file and if you did this error will go
away and it does and you get nice stop
it jump you know all the thing so you
can have like you don't someone says
that I don't want you writing I don't
want to convert this to it Ortiz file
you don't have to document that in a dot
d dot ES file right next to it
all right that seems to be the end of
the questions so the key takeaway is
that like just it's just happening you
it's just JavaScript and the idea that
I've been using today that's all written
in typescript and react and that's all
open source as well and I have a free
book on the subject as well so like I'm
I love helping people that's what I left
my life go many going out please leave a
green card that would really help me a
lot so yes I am presenting at ng Sydney
about exactly how all the features that
exist within this developer IDE so
