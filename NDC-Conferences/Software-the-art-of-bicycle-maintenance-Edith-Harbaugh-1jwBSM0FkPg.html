fun to be here in Sydney it's also
really fun to be here cuz I gave a talk
earlier this morning and uh my slides
didn't work so number one lesson of
giving a lecture the hardest part is
always getting your slides to work so
it's all downhill from here so today I'm
going to talk about the links between
software startups and bikes three things
that I'm really passionate about me so
first M edith i'm CEO and co-founder of
lunch Darkly we're a startup that's
based in Oakland California I started
off in engineering so I worked for a
bunch of comm companies that no longer
exist and when I say they no longer
exist they no longer exists with extreme
extreme prejudice
like listed in the Nasdaq delisted
completely bankrupt type companies so I
started off building releases for comm I
then worked for several years for
enterprise software company called
epicenter ik and have some patents on
portal deployment from that and then I
was also at vignette which was a big
content management software company
after about ten years of working in
software I had worked my way from an
engineer who thought they knew
everything to a product manager who knew
I did not know very much at all and I
decided that I wanted to take a break
from enterprise software and so I biked
from Bellingham Washington in Washington
DC so this is a basically across the
United States of America so it's about
33,000 miles I know that in kilometers
that's roughly five five thousand
kilometers in 65 days so this was a
pretty big project and I I definitely
treated it as a project and I broke it
down into a lot of steps using the
skills I learned as a project manager
and as a product manager to kind of
motivate myself what's interesting is
then when I got back from this trip I
then started a it was a product manager
including that TripIt and a lot of the
lessons I learned from biking I could
then reapply back
my startup life so they're all kind of
they're all kind of inter inter
intertwine so I'll cut to the chase this
isn't a suspense novel yes I made it all
the way across the country and it took
me about sixty-five days and my longest
day was 128 miles so the trip the first
step was the hardest so in any project
when you start it always seems super
daunting you know I was looking I was
living in Texas at the time and it
seemed really daunting to start this
trip you know I was like him I really
get a bike all the way across the
country so what I did is I kind of
tricked myself I said that I would bike
for till Montana which is about a
thousand miles and see if I still liked
it I mean that this was really made a
lot easier for me to start the trip
because you know if you think about
biking 3,000 miles you're like oh my
gosh I don't know if I could ever do
that if you think can you bike for about
a week like yeah I could bike for about
a week it seems like a bite-size project
but still definitely the first step is
the is the hardest it was similar when I
was starting a company when I started a
company it seemed amazing like I was
just like how how could I ever start a
company everybody who has a company is
professional they have a booth we have a
booth now when a when I started the
company it was just me and my co-founder
just seemed impossible so what I would I
what I told my co-founder was um hey
let's start working uh you know about
four to five hours a week on this and
then let's start working about ten hours
a week and that made the project of
started a company seemed a lot more
manageable because it wasn't oh my gosh
I'm gonna quit my job and just start out
of ether it was I'm gonna work on this
side project with my best friend and see
where it goes so the first step is
always the hardest
I remember a flew up to Bellingham
Washington which is there on the left
and I unpacked my bike and
luggage area and repacked it if you've
ever assembled a bike you know kind of
put the wheels back on the cranks then
you kinda realize that the tires are
flat and I bike to bike shop so I had a
real pump and then it was off and that
was really fun but the first step
sometimes is really the hardest because
you're you're you're going on a journey
into the unknown but once you start you
kind of you kind of have some momentum
so something I did on the trip that was
hard was that every day I would reset my
odometer to zero and I did this for a
couple reasons I'd quit my job to go on
this trip you know I was living off my
savings and I kind of told myself that
you know biking is your job now you know
if you just sit around and don't go
anywhere you're just kind of you're just
an unemployed person if you're biking
you're unemployed biker so every day I
would get up and I would reset my
counter to zero and at the beginning I
told myself because I was I was kind of
out of shape I said you know I'd been
working a desk job I told myself that I
had to bike five hours a day and this is
like actual button see peddling five
hours that I could take breaks but I had
to do that this was helpful for me
because it made me feel like I was
making progress every day it was also
helpful because this part where I
started and in Washington is actually
very mountainous so I'm like my first
couple days I was climbing these these
major passes and five hours actually did
not equate to that many miles sometimes
it was like you know I would be happy to
doing three miles an hour up the pass
but the the really great thing about
sturdy everyday at zero is every day
you've got to feel like you accomplished
something so like at the end of the day
you know I get to where I was gonna stop
but I'd gone like 40 50 60 miles that
felt really good
if I looked at my overall trip odometer
you know and I moved from 60 to 120 that
doesn't feel much much progress much
less if your progress is you're moving
from 300 to 360 that doesn't feel much
much progress but if it every day you
could look at the other day and see
where you got that feels really good
so this probably sounds kind of familiar
is something I think a lot of us do
which is a daily sprint
you know so every day at work we go in
and we have a daily stand-up and the
reason why I add a least and up is
really good is it kind of makes me feel
some progress you know if you look at an
overall project of building something
that's gonna take two to three years to
complete it seems incredibly daunting if
everyday you coming into you're
sprinting you're like it did this this
this is this and I still need to do a
little bit of this see then you feel a
little bit of a pop pop of
accomplishment so my advice is you know
every day starts at zero and that's both
a good and a bad thing because every day
you got to think what am I gonna do
today but also at the end of the day you
feel a lot of progress about what you've
actually done so I said before there are
a lot of mountains so this is what it
looked like on pretty much my third day
it started in late May and uh and the
states which is kind of early summer and
I had started from Texas where early
summer it was you know already pretty
like hot with 30 degrees Celsius and now
I'm here and I'm wearing these shoes
these were not good so that's I was
wearing these tennis shoes they're kind
of beat-up you can see the frostbite on
my toes because I was basically rolling
down still frozen frozen mountain passes
and I got really cold look really really
cold like I put on all my clothes I was
really cold so I said what could I do
that would make my life better right now
wool socks real shoes so it's okay when
you start any project to constantly
reevaluate your tools like something
something we do at our own startup right
now is that we constantly evaluate
what's the right project management tool
what's a right wiki tool what's the
right communication style what's the
right style of meetings I said before
that we did daily stand-ups
when we started this the company we did
it daily standup which with everybody in
the company because it was two of us you
know you could have it you know you only
have one standup we kept doing daily
stand-ups with the whole company until
we got to about eight people and they
were like this this isn't gonna work
anymore
we need to start breaking off into
different teams and doing more more
modular stand-ups that's not to say that
what we started with was wrong it worked
very well but in the course of any
project you always have to say is are
the tools that we're using still working
for us you know do we want to try
something different and the nice thing
about biking across country is that you
have a lot of time to think because
you're you're on a bike so every day I
would just think about like hey what's
working with this trip what's not how
could I make my life a little bit better
is there something else that I could be
doing differently so I started off the
trip with about 45 to 50 pounds of gear
and I finished with about nine so when
you're biking up a hill you really have
a lot of time to think do I really need
everything I'm carrying you know I
started off with about I think I started
off with three separate bathing suits
I'm a purse a lot of stuff and I would
look and I would be like do I really
need three bathing suits no no I really
don't I started off with camping gear I
decided that as I was biking by myself I
just didn't really feel safe camping by
myself so I just mailed all my camping
gear away
so the takeaway i hope you have is that
um on any project it's okay if you're
going along you decide that something's
not working we do that a lot like we
actually encourage people to say hey
this this thing that worked on another
project is it working for this one or
maybe we should re-evaluate something
there's no template for success in terms
of the things that started you off might
not be the things that finish you the
shoes being the perfect example once I
got real biking shoes I can move a lot
faster
the old ones weren't clip-in so a lot of
the power you get from a bike is
actually on the lift if you if you're
into biking and once I could do that I
actually moved a lot faster that's not
to say that this wasn't cause some pain
I never biked with clip-on pedals before
and I got them in Idaho and I
clipped in and who's written with
clipping petals I clipped in and I
didn't really realize how hard it was to
clip out so the first time I tried to do
this I'm just kind of writing along I
thought I decided I want to stop but I
can't and I somehow managed like wheel
myself into did should fall over and
luckily this was like literally the only
biker I saw the whole day this other
biker came up and I just kind of lying
on the ground attached to that bike he's
like can I help you I'm like yeah yeah
you can and you show me how to unclip
which was cool the other thing I had to
learn though was when you start when
you're coming to stop you have to train
yourself to clip out so I was rolling
into stand point out of Idaho and I
rolled up to the stop sign and you know
since I was a little girl I'd always
just you know put my foot down I went to
put my foot down there's nowhere to put
my foot down I just basically fell over
big big big bruise so try new things
it's not pain free but it's worth it
sometimes but it's it's not as always
easy as like hey I got some better socks
and shoes and everything was great I got
some better socks at shoes and I got a
big bruise and then I moved faster which
kind of leads me to my next point
you can't a be test life so when I was
faking cross-country it was like a
constant decision tree everything was a
decision like when do you stop for lunch
where are you gonna sleep tonight should
you take this road or this road this is
what I was trying to get from Detroit to
Canada and my bike map had this very
nice bridge that look like the perfect
route I got there and there was a sign
that made it seem like it a temporary
closed I called the number and they just
basically laughed at me they're like you
know we haven't we haven't let bikers
across here for like ten years you know
and I was like but I'm here and they're
like cool
and I'm like what do I do now they're
like we don't know we don't we don't
know and we don't care but you can't
cross here so it worked out okay I
backtracked about 20 miles and I went
around but you know I had I had to make
that decision
another time something similar happened
was um there was this road that was
unexpectedly closed I got to the edge
and you could see that there's this
little creek and they'd working on the
bridge this time what I did was I very
carefully walked down I walked across
that little side bridge and I hiked back
up
don't tell anybody though that's
probably illegal but um I really didn't
want to backtrack the lesson from this
is that there's this theory that you can
a be test everything you can't you could
a be test a lot of things but sometimes
you just have to make a decision for
example you know you could you could say
should I have chicken or fish for lunch
every day
you can a/b test that on consecutive
days but that's not really a true a/b
test same for same for a lot of
decisions of software you know when
should we release this would it be
better to do favori release or March
release there's no way of knowing that
you know you cannot statistically decide
which features in what time frame are
better or you can do is make a best
guess with the decision you haven't move
forward and in fact if if you don't make
a decision you'll never make any
progress what I did do a lot of was a
lot of the states is basically a checker
board because it's basically big firm
personals and there's firm words because
I would start going down a road and I
got very good at evaluating shoulders
I've when you're on a bike there's not a
bike lane you're just kind of in the
shoulder and if it was a bad shoulder
like this I would move to the next row
because I didn't like biking there
because it was all gridded up so this
was a huge one for me so the joke is
everybody's like oh you're so unique for
biking across country nobody's really
done that I'm like well my sister did it
a year before
so my sister had actually biked across
country the opposite direction and
that's part of what inspired me is that
I had gone along with her for part of
her riot and I said this was so much fun
why don't I also do this the funny thing
is so there's nobody genetically I'm
closer to than my sister your your
siblings are your closest genetic match
but we're actually really really
different bikers she loved to bike with
she actually had speakers hooked up on
the front of her bike and she liked to
start biking around 7:00 a.m. and then
finish around 3:00 p.m. I did not like
speakers and I like to bike around 10:00
a.m. and I like to stop around sunset if
not a little bit later so following her
style of biking was not for me at all
same as this is actually an old lady I
saw when I was biking she was so cool
she was also biking not cross-country
but uh she would camp every night she
had a little pouch there and at that
night she just kind of go into one of
those goalies and sleep
I found this horrified but it worked for
her so the same thing is true in a lot
of development I gave a talk this
morning where I talked about feature
flag techniques and I think the thing I
was trying to convey is that what works
for one team might not work for you
there's I think a lot of fads of like oh
slack does this or Google does this
therefore we'll have to do the same sort
of thing what works for another team
might not work at all for you like I
said at the beginning that we do daily
stand-ups some teams find that too many
some teams prefer actually to do like
stand-ups in the afternoon or every
other day stand-ups
or I've heard the horrible horrible
thing about people who do an hour-long
sit down stand-up which at that point
it's like you you're just killing an
hour you're not really having to stand
up at all so be careful when you're
looking at bringing a practice in and I
know it's really tempting cuz you read
all the cool stuff about what other
people are doing you're at a conference
like this you're like why don't we do
this this is this try them but just
because something worked for somebody
else doesn't mean that it's gonna work
for you in fact it could be
the wrong thing to do so um my sister
for example she I love my sister and I
but uh she's very different than me
we we were biking together and we came
to camp one night this is when I camped
when I was with my sister and I I was
obsessed with Cody now wait like I would
literally like think about what I could
get rid of like these are my original
canvas panniers my sisters and I
actually swapped them out for some
lighter weight and island ones cuz I
wanted to save about five pounds and I
really felt good about that decision
so five pounds to me was a lot of weight
when I was camping with my sister and
we're biking along and we get to the
campsite late at night around sunset and
um she opens up one of these pin years
and you know what she pulls out a hammer
a little hammer I was just dumbfounded
and I was like but but you realize
you're carrying around four pounds of a
hammer that's just like well how else
would we gonna hammer they like the Ted
pegs in just like with another ten Paige
is like no it's much nicer to have a
hammer and you know what she was the one
carrying around that hammer and for her
it was a trade-off that she was really
happy to make she didn't she liked
having it she also had a full-size you
know full-size um candle because she
didn't like the smell so I mean don't
cargo cult processes my sister would
have been miserable if she travelled
with like me without a hammer I would
have been miserable if I travelled with
the hammer that doesn't mean one is
right or wrong it just means that you
got to figure out the style that works
for your own team when you're building
software alright so this is a huge one
software is hard
I mean software is really really hard I
I think I said this morning that the
Year release is dead what that really
means is that you're always releasing
and that you're working hard all the
time
there's always another feature to be
built there's always a customer who's
asking for a feature that you just
really need to get done right now
there's always a bug that's
pop up in the field there's always
something like software is really really
hard and a fly I did myself when I was
younger is that you pushed you hard and
you end up just killing yourself and
your team you know I think we've all
been at a company or I hope I hope not
everybody has where you start working 80
90 hours a week can't I only do that for
so long so something I really tried to
do when I was biking across country is I
try to try to take care of myself
so like this is a boat I took across a
Bay between Michigan and Wisconsin and
it was a night boat and you could either
sleep kind of sitting up on the boat or
you could pay an extra thirty bucks and
get a little bit like this and I paid
the extra thirty bucks was my little
treat I spent a lot of nights and places
like this the stove didn't work it was
colder than it looks that coffee machine
doesn't work so when I had a chance I
would try to treat myself so like I went
like once there was a I think this was
the only town that had an espresso
machine for about three weeks I stopped
I got an espresso it was really fun and
when I got to Fargo I slept at this this
was the nicest hotel I'd stayed for
about three to four weeks the corollary
is for your team because I think we're
all developers work as software teams
like to do a little nice things like at
our company we'll go for coffee around
10:00 a.m. and around 3:00 p.m. this
seems a little adult chat it's like well
why is everybody getting coffee but it's
like well we can't can't sit at your
desk all day if you if you take these
little these little breaks you'll
actually be able to go a lot further and
a lot faster something we talked about
at our company is that I don't want
people to work 80 or 90 hours as I said
explicitly and I'd say that's very
selfishly honestly is that if you're
working 80 to 90 hours a week you're
much more likely to make mistakes like
there's been a lot of studies that you
know if once you start working a cut off
about 60 hours a week you're much more
error-prone so you might be working more
hours but you're actually being more
destructive if you've ever looked back
at something that you wrote when you
were sleep-deprived you might notice a
lot of mistakes also you become a lot of
nice a person like if you've ever talked
to somebody who has gone without sleep
for about a day or two you know really
like like talking about features anymore
they're more likely to snap at you so
take care of yourself take care of your
team take take care of the way you treat
your mental health and you'll actually
be able to go a lot further well so
Murphy's Law is real the reason why you
wanted to take care of yourself is
because Murphy's Law is real and
whatever could go wrong will go wrong I
woke up one morning and my my my Hannah
bear was bent I didn't know why another
thing that happened was on the bike and
I didn't take a picture they said I wish
I had I managed to snap the cable where
you could shift so I basically that had
a three speed bike and the worst Hills
of the of the Northwest
so picture not being able to shift and
having an impromptu fixie and having to
go about another 100 miles till there's
another bike store because this was
before uber and if something went wrong
you I had to bike my way out of it so
that goes back to why you want to take
care of yourself when you have a chance
something's gonna go wrong
like something is always gonna go wrong
in a software project like something is
always gonna take a little bit longer
something's always gonna break something
is always gonna go wrong anybody who's
here this morning saw that uh my slides
did it come up you know it's something
that's always gonna go wrong there's
always gonna be a day this is this is
American Fahrenheit so this is 99
degrees that's really hot there's always
gonna be a day when it's 99 degrees and
you ran out of water and you have to
push yourself a little bit harder if you
run yourself flat out all the time and
that day comes you will not have the
energy to get past that day
so this was probably that where there
were so many I was gonna say probably
the worst days and there's at least five
days that stand out is worst one day I
was biking through an Indian Reservation
and this was it was kind of at the early
days of a blackberry pearl but really
before iPhones so I had made an
assumption that there would be a hotel
in a restaurant a little motel in a
restaurant I got to the motel in the
restaurant an they look like they had
been closed for about nine or ten years
so I couldn't refill my water bottle and
I could have go to sleep there and it
was in an Indian Reservation which was
not a very safe area of North Dakota
we're at a bike another 50 miles I was
really thirsty
that was probably amongst the most
miserable biking I'd ever done because I
was totally out of water but didn't have
much choice but I got through it as you
can see I'm here um another bad day was
that's a tornado kind of coming can I
see it it's a tornado and if you biked
though the the most unpleasant biking is
an unpaved Road so there was a section
of road which is unpaved and there was a
tornado coming and I just had to haul it
so that was was why I really encourage
you in your own life and your own
projects to strike a balance between the
days where you're like okay this is a
day where I will just you know go in do
my night and to my work and go home
because there's gonna be another day
when everything breaks and you got a got
to put more hours in software is not
really that glimmers this sounds really
sad because I love software I've been in
software for 20 years I absolutely love
love software like whatever one of the
best parts of today was uh I got to meet
somebody who came to my presentation
last year and it's now our customer that
feels really good that feels so good
that somebody that somebody is using our
software to make their own stuff better
in between that in between these high
moments of coming to a conference and
meteor customers there's all this stuff
in between so same with biking across
country I mean there are
days this was miserable there's a lot of
days where like you kind of have a
shitty shoulder to ride on there's a lot
of firm trucks and there's a lot of dead
Gophers that you have to ride past and
they hit in the hiddens killer and any
bike ride as people know his wind like I
hate it I hate it hit once so there's a
lot of on glamorous days we were just
like the road I thought I would be on
it's not there anymore and it's unpaved
and I'm lost
same with software same with startups
there's gonna be a lot of days where
you're just kind of like you come in and
get your work done
however it's not that on glimmers you're
still having fun I had fun and the thing
I always remembered was the more you do
the better you get so when I started I
was kind of I was not really that much
together like I had I said I had 50
pounds of gear and I had the wrong shoes
I was kind of out of shape I got to the
middle of a country to rugby North
Dakota and this couple came out on their
bikes to come hang out with me because
they had been following my my blog and
they're really cool and they said that
they wanted a bike across country too
but they were too intimidated because
they said everybody they saw coming
through look so fit and together it's
like with it and I kind of said well
you're you're literally halfway across
the country anybody who's made it this
far has gotten their act together
where's quit you didn't see me like
three weeks ago when I was really out of
shape so I think it's easy when you look
at other teams or to look at other
companies or to look at other startups
to assume that everybody has their act
totally together and it's always been
you know this perfect perfect act that's
not true you know when we started a
company our first business cars I need
in a hurry and I got them from FedEx
which is Kinkos just like a really cheap
chain they look awful now we have these
nice business cards with real paper
plastic but um you you get better at
stuff as you go along and I think I
think something that I really encourage
people to do is it's okay to be bad at
something in the beginning if you're
trying a new tool if you're trying a new
technique if you're trying a new
language I think people can be very hard
on themselves that they have to be
perfect at the beginning because you
look around you're like well everybody
else is doing this so much better the
beginning it's okay to be a beginner so
this was this was a day that really
shocked me um it shocked me because I
was writing along and I actually thought
I'd gone blind because I also looked
there were two highways up there and
finally I realized that I'd been on a
two-lane road for about three weeks and
slowly it split into a four lane road
it's just a big deal so the this the
idea is that um if you keep doing
something you'll get better at it
so before I said that there's a lot of
unglamorous client grinding and software
and it's really true there's a lot of
days where you just you know you come in
you're like okay let me let me do some
regression testing let me make sure that
this thing works let me write my release
notes let me you know it's it's not
really that fun look thing is it is like
so the thing that gives me the most joy
when I was writing ISM and I actually
named my blog never a bad day to ride is
that even on the worst day like the day
uh the day where I got absolutely
drenched by this rainstorm and my
derailleur had snapped and I was going
about two miles an hour a rainbow came
out that sounds really corny but like
Rick those are cool
so I think if you're passionate about
software there's the joy you get when
you've spent some time building
something and it's done it's out in the
wild and you get to see people using it
and you get to build that next feature
and you get to see them building it and
that's that's that that's that's really
fun I mean that that's what I like about
software is that you have this
opportunity to create something from
nothing
I was I was talking to a friend
yesterday about
about the Sydney Bridge as you all know
it's pretty cool bridge that's a huge
project with a very defined process like
you can't just wake up and say hey I'm
gonna try building a bridge this way or
this way or this way like would they
build that bridge they had to actually
cantilever it from both sides measure
everything precisely and once it was
done it had to be just right
you're not gonna rebuild the bridge
every day the really fun thing about
software is you can do that I mean you
can't completely rebuild everything
every day but you have the opportunity
to constantly iterate to constantly get
just a little bit better and to
constantly have fun with it so just like
with software and with companies
remember that you're doing it cuz you
like it I'll give my two best advices on
startups make sure you really like your
co-founder make sure you really like
what you're doing because otherwise
you're not gonna have any fun I've seen
them I've seen a lot of Silicon Valley
startups blow up at about two days
if the co-founders won't like each other
if they don't actually like their what
they're doing
people think that doing a start-up is
glamorous it's not it's fun but there's
a lot of in-between stuff that you got
to do to get there
so I where I think people get into
trouble with startups is if they think
it's like Google or Facebook where they
have massages every day and that's
that's a late-stage company so I had a
great time this is me biking across
country bike in glaciers so the lessons
I hope you take away from this are
anybody could bike across country if I
can the way I did it might not be the
way that you will do it take care of
yourself and have fun and then let's
bring that back to software you know the
the conferences like this agree because
you can learn tips and tools from other
people I hope everybody takes home a
couple lessons of stuff they want to try
and I hope they remember that if it
doesn't work
out for them that's fine you know
everybody has their own path and making
start start software it's just how you
get to the end better be fun so I am
happy to share my slides and I actually
left a lot of time for questions because
that's always my favorite part so do
people have questions
it took 65 days so I went it's the most
it took thirty three thirty three
hundred miles in 65 days yeah something
that it's really important though is uh
it took every seventh day off so I did
read a lot of tips of people who'd gone
before me and the people who usually
burnt out about two three weeks then
were the people who tried to not take
days off so the the cruel irony is that
if you don't take a day off you're far
more likely to stop completely because
it just becomes intolerable you know to
get on that bike every day so I would
take every seventh day off and just not
like at all I just stopped hanging out
read a book do my laundry uh so I had
banked with I'd biked I'd done a couple
long-distance bikes like I had biked a
week down the California coast
I'd bike with my sister for a week but I
had it done insane preparation like I
think my longest ride immediately before
was about 30 or 40 miles I mean I was
kind of at a basic level of fitness
where I was running ten K's but I wasn't
I wasn't winning the Tour de France
oh so this was perhaps the best part um
I didn't like I told myself that I would
go to the glaciers which is about two
weeks in and then see if I was still
having fun so that's what I meant by the
first step is the hardest is uh I if if
I told myself I was biking across
country that seemed crazy but if I told
myself I was biking the glaciers then I
was gonna reassess that seemed much more
doable so I made it to glaciers which is
about two weeks in I was like this is
still really fun why don't I go another
two weeks so I always kind of checked in
every two weeks shows the map and so we
can see where the glaciers are I don't
have a map of the whole United States
but that would be great if it did but I
have a picture picture here's of the
glaciers can you go to Google Maps
Google Maps so did you go west to east
or east to west
I went actually let me pull this up Adam
always has the best questions that's why
give me a second
any other questions will I pull this sub
so after that I actually I actually
biked all of the California coast
this is why we can't see screen yeah
this is why I discouraged people from
multitasking is it never works
so I kept this journal along the way and
this is actually another tip I really
encourage people to do is to check in
every week or every month so like at our
company we do a monthly retrospective
because we do a daily kind of where
we're doing right now and then we also
do a monthly what is everything that's
happened in the past month and it's a
really good way to kind of check in on
how everything is going so every day on
my ride actually did a daily journal and
then at the end I wrote a lot I can't
easily pull up a map I know I had it at
one point sorry Adam I'll get it
so
so I started um it started here and I
went there which is the glaciers then I
went there and I went a little bit into
Canada that's where I couldn't get
across the border and then I took a boat
there and I actually I finished at my
parents house in DC and that was really
cool because um my parents came and they
rode the last three miles with me and
then we had some shrimpy
oh my gosh how far would advance today
prep um so this is how startups are like
biking it's like um you're constantly
figuring out so um so I did this ten
years ago in 2007 and what I would do
every day when I woke up is I would look
for where the next Motel was where I
could stop and honestly here there's not
many of that choices there would be like
a motel every for 50 to 80 to 100 miles
and that was where I ended up so like I
did there's literally you know if you're
in an area where the biggest town is
30,000 people that's the biggest town
for a week in either direction like you
pretty much you sleep where the motel is
and you're happy if the room isn't too
dirty same with food I actually I ate a
ton of truck stop pizza like and not
like good truck stop pizza like um in
America they have these gas stations
they have on there's things with the
pizza that's kind of warmed up I would
eat that every day actually what I would
do is I would wake up you know at bike
and I have a lot of milk for breakfast
and then a healthy subway sub for lunch
and whatever I could find for dinner so
for planning it was constantly like a
battle of how far could I get that day
and then where could I eat along the way
when I got to this side of this country
it's much more populated and that's what
I started to have a lot more choices
about where to stay and where to eat
when I used to got certainly my little
pet my little pet luxuries like I really
like this chain called Quiznos and I
would like sometimes bike a really long
distance a Cui's notice this also
happened to be a time when and they'd
bought too many Quiznos franchises and
they were all going out of business in
the state
which was really frustrating so a lot of
times I'll get really excited about
Quiznos I would bike there or get there
and be closed and I just kind of like
this has been looking for words that's
for about 15 hours and it's not here so
this is actually really good training at
doing a start-up leader because on a
startup you're constantly kind of
re-evaluating your path I'm you're
constantly having to figure out like hey
the stuff we thought we could do we
can't here's kind of how we're gonna
readjust on the fly and you become very
resilient in terms of you know it's
let's let's satisfy the base needs and
then no that's why I did it based on
hours it did it based on hours on the
bike so like in the beginning I was
doing five hours a day and at the end I
was doing about nine nine and a half ten
so the mileage to me was not as
important because I knew that um based
on the terrain the mileage would be
different
yeah
I think it is a lot of corollaries too
you know there's all these metrics and
software and they're all kind of flawed
like if you look at lines of code what
happens people write garbage code like
I've actually um I've actually talked to
people who say they actually have a
prize for the people who delete the most
code yes which is actually a really cool
metric when you think about it because
if you if you and set people to write
more lines of code you're getting up
with a lot of like garbage spaghetti
code that's actually very difficult to
mate to maintain if you if you reward
people based on deleting code you might
end up with like no code which is also
bad but you got to have a metric that
makes sense
yeah i mean i'm i think there's lessons
that I took from the trip that I then
learned for working with a team but
you're right there are a lot of things
that you could do when your solar that
don't work like when your solar you
could just say like well perhaps the
biggest thing is a lot of times I would
get in really big fights with myself you
know I'd be like this is absolutely
miserable who planned this trip I'm
really hungry why am I on this road and
you you're like oh this is this is all
my fault
like there's nobody to fight with and I
think it's the same when you when you're
on a team is that you learn to take
responsibility in terms of like what's
what you can control and what your how
you can harmonize with your teammates
like it's very easy to I think it's very
easy to blame others and point fingers
other are there directions that are
saying hey this is some of this is my
responsibility but yeah
yeah so I think I fed summer is the
question it's like in life and in
business there's sometimes obstacles
yeah I mean like um I don't know how to
put it better than what you just said is
that um you know you can't magically
make a bridge appear
you can't magically make a feature
appear but what you can do is you can be
very resourceful about how am I gonna
get around this obstacle how could I get
creative like um when I was stopped at
the Canada border there's just no way
across later when there is a bridge out
there was a way I could get down and get
it get around was it you know was it the
safest thing to do but I could do it so
I think you you get better at
recognizing what's what's really an
obstacle and what's what's something you
can work around all right
I looked at about for about five minutes
and I thought about how safe it looked
and I said I think I could do this
you know I'd done a lot of mountain
biking when I was caught in college and
I was like I think I could do this this
look this looks doable mainly I was
worried that yeah it wasn't too
concerned I was just like I could do
this but well thanks everybody
are there any more questions she I'll
show you how I am so my sister actually
my sister is far cooler than me and she
took a longer route she started a main
and then she went across that way to
Washington and then she went all the way
down to San Diego so I actually I'm
actually section biked all of the coasts
and various trips some with her and some
by myself
she originally was gonna go all the way
to the Grand Canyon but she got kind of
bored of flaky
yeah so if you're not tired to ask many
questions Adam and I are gonna do it ask
me anything and you can ask me more
questions well before cool thanks I hope
you learned some lessons I think the the
two things I ate it on is um I need to
include a map so I think for somebody
not from the US these are kind of
abstract places so I'm gonna give this
talking and I'll include a map
I actually also really liked the comment
that some stuff you can do by yourself
you can't do with a team and that was
actually something that I should have
talked a lot more about is um a team is
a totally different beast than being by
yourself
and you but you can a team can actually
do far more than a single person is so
that's that's a something that's a lot
of fun for having a company so thanks
everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
