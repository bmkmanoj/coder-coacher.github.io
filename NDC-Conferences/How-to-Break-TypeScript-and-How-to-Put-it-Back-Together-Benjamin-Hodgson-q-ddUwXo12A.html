Benjamin I worked its back over
controlled by my uniform and I need to
talk to you about programming language
design specifically i'm here to talk to
you about type scripts which is one of
the family of programming languages
which compiles into JavaScript for
execution in the browser now the
typescript designers made an interesting
choice which was to steal ninety percent
of JavaScript syntax the idea being that
the tight skirt that you like should be
very similar to the JavaScript that gets
generated right the main thing that
tight skirts is added on top of
javascript is a type system now it's an
optional type system is called what is
what called a gradually type system
which means that the jobs when you if
you were if you take javascripts and
feed it into typescript it will work
automatically the type checker is off by
default but it allows you to opt into
static typing to the extent that you
want it by adding type annotations now
I'm going to spend the next 10 minutes
or so complaining about typescript
showing you away in which is broken so i
feel like i should say at the start that
i like flights quits we're using it
reasonably extensively it's like
overflow now it makes working with large
javascript code bases a ton of a ton
easier just because you've got a tool to
check the wealth or madness your bit of
your code so anyway i'm going to show
you a a program which tricks the tight
script type checker into believing a
false facts about about your system is
going to think that available is one
sight words and we actually it has
another pipe so i'm going to fix some
codes right so we've got these these
couple of classes here right we've got a
class for registered users who we know
who they are and we've got a vent their
actual name and we've got a class for
anonymous users for which we've only got
our number or whatever and down here i'm
using what's called a union type now our
union type is like it's like all four
types like so what I'm saying is if I've
got something else I'd user it could
either be a registered user or an
anonymous user everyone follow so far
now since these two classes don't share
any common structure the only thing if
you see I if I have something as tight
user the only way I can do something
with it is by performing some sort of
run time
text right so here I'm using the
JavaScript instance of tests to check
what to check the type of the few
variable like this a few variable here
and tight skirts has done something
quite interesting here which is that
after performing the instance of check
it has adjusted the type of you so in
the point is in this point I can access
the name property and indifferent but I
can access the ID property if I were to
say you don't name out here it would be
rejected because we don't know that you
is a registered user at this point this
is quite cool I think this is quite sort
of modern type system design we're doing
it we're doing a run playing test and
we're learning something about the
compile time type of this variable C
sharp devs have been asking for this for
a long time with the is operator we
people have been asking can I say you is
registered user and then not have to
declare a new variable across state
cetera but when I see this feature I
think to myself well let's have some fun
with it can we break it in any way so my
first thought was well what if we
perform this test and then you change it
its type because I've because we have
signed something to it so I've done that
down here so i'm texting that you as an
anonymous user and accessing the user ID
property of that then I'm changing you
to be a registered user now I was
expecting originally that typesclip
would say they would either say no no no
you can't assign a registered user to a
variable of type anonymous user like so
here here what it seems the thing that
you as a user but here you is an
anonymous user I shouldn't kind of
really be able to assign a registered
user to this but obviously the types
good designers thought that this was a
use case they wanted to support right so
they've done something rather clever
they are the typescript compiler
performs quite sophisticated analysis on
my program to see that well you is the
anonymous user up here but then after
this assignment you is a registered user
however it all goes wrong if I perform a
rather simple refactoring sign ESO
and put this assignment inside a
function sine user right the typescript
flow analyzed they cannot see inside
this assigned user function it doesn't
realize that assigned user is changing
the type of this view variable so even
though this code behaves exactly the
same as before it the type checker now
ejects it because it thinks that you is
still an anonymous user so this is kind
of an opportunity to disguise a bug in
your program like you think available
has a certain type and then it gets
mutated somewhere far away and then
you're left in the chrome debugger
thinking well with types the type
checker told me it was this type of
thing and now it seems to be something
I've found us that happen so this is a
problem how do we how could if we were
thinking as the typescript designers for
a minute how could we solve this problem
well there are a few options the first
option would be to say well it's kind of
weird for to have this behavior as the
variable changing its tight during the
execution of the program right if we
compare it to the way the future version
of C sharp C sharp 7 does it it requires
you to declare a new variable with the
smaller type and leave the old variable
as it was right the problem with this
idea of changing of removing this type
of fine than idea is that it already
exists right when you have backwards
compatibility to reckon with as a
programming language you can't just unch
it features willy-nilly because they've
code in the wild that depends upon this
type of phone wont idea so rejecting
this idea another option would be to add
some even smarter logic to the type
checker right the idea is to that the
problem was that the type checker
couldn't see inside that assigned user
function so how can we attack the
problem of allowing it to see inside the
assigned user function well it's a 20-17
problem but we can go back to the 1970s
to find the 6 and the fix is something
called whore logic the idea is that you
attach preconditions and postconditions
to to every statement in your program
and scale that up to functions right so
for example the post condition of this
line of code
be that you as a registered user and the
precondition of this line of code will
be that you has a name property right it
was invented by tony hoare who who was a
very clever man who invented quick sorts
he has his own cautionary tale of
language design because he invented null
he calls it his billion-dollar mistake
he estimates the costs of nul points of
exceptions to be to be a billion dollars
over the 40 years that it's existed
approximately anyway so he was
interested in proving things about
imperative programs and he divides the
system called whore logic and as I said
the idea is to pair every two pair every
statements in the program with with a
precondition of the postcondition we
denote this with these curly braces up
here it's called a whore triple so with
a program s a statement s with
preconditions P and Q we denote it like
this right and the way to make it scale
up is that if I see two statements in my
program sequentially i heed a semi colon
operator the the post conditions the
first statement has to match the
precondition of the second statement
right this this fraction thing here it's
called an influence rule of logical
influence will write it is a
mathematical notation the ice that the
way it works the way you should read it
is the thing underneath the fraction p.s
semicolon TR is the conclusion of my
illogical my logical deduction process
and the things above the fraction are
the premises so what this says is if i
see the program s semicolon t &amp;amp; but then
SME columns he had precondition p and
post condition r if s has precondition p
t had post conditioner and the in a bit
matchup okay now the problem with this
idea is that well first of all it's
quite difficult to implement the whole
logic checker in a automated fashion
right without any input from the user
quite hard to synthesize with
information inside a type checker and
also they're sort of there some sort of
more less tractable problems like for
example if I'm passing a function to a
event handler
how can I be sure that that functions
preconditions are going to hold by the
time that the handle is called right so
it's given that this is quite quite a
big engineering challenge and had some
fundamental problems we should probably
reject building a whole logic into the
into the typescript site checker so a
third option would be to say well what's
the real cause of this problem like we
like the idea of type refinement the
problem is that we changed the title
that we change the value that was stored
in the you variable right needs ability
I guess the message of this slide really
is that mutability is something is
something that imposes serious costs on
the design of a language right there are
many desirable features in programming
languages that needs ability makes a lot
more complicated unfortunately
immutability is really something that
has to be built into the language
designs from day one right it's not
something we can just retrospectively
add to javascript because the equal
statement is something that people use
quite a lot in JavaScript by here so
unsold so I suppose yeah if you're if
you're thinking of designing a pet
language think very carefully before you
so mutation in there and also I think
every developer should learn to program
in an immutable fashion there are lots
of programming languages obviously in
any functional languages that encourage
and some require an immutable style of
programming and it's a it's a very
valuable skill to learn okay for
solution force attempts of solution this
is a comment from Anders Hiles burg in
the typescript github repo on an issue
more or less supporting this exact
problem right and he says down at the
bottom he says we could spend an
inordinate inordinate amount of time
doing this analysis and still get it
wrong right this is a lesson about
software engineering in general right
it's all about trade-off he's saying
that the complexity of the system that
we could we could envision ourselves
building to correct this small problem
is is it's staggering and the and it's
not even that big of a problem like it
is a problem but when I guess my point
is that a feature that works ninety
percent is off
better than a feature better than no
feature at all and it's also often
better than building a difficult to use
or complicated system that works one
hundred percent so so yeah that's kind
of it for a problem for solutions none
of which are particularly satisfactory
and hopefully a lesson in programming
language design and software engineering
in general if you're interested in
programming languages set sure then
there's several other talks on at this
conference that i recommend so check
them out thanks very much Oh any
questions any questions so we have I got
time for questions fine haven't we got
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
