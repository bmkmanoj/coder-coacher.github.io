I appreciate it thanks I'm Lin Lang it
and this is going to be a talk about
teaching kids programming but we're
going to start off with a quiz I'm guys
ready for a quiz it's just a short one
okay just go with me on this just go
with me all right see they see the
picture it's just going to take a minute
it's going to be cool close your eyes
everyone close your eyes close your eyes
close your eyes I'm that might open so I
can see furs are close close your eyes I
want you to imagine a developer okay
think about a developer think about
someone who's a really good developer
solid developer been developing for a
really long time developer not only
writes a lot of code works with teams
leads teams teaches new people keep
those eyes closed keep those eyes closed
imagine this developer developer also
reaches beyond their team and works to
educate the community talks at user
groups toxic conferences writes books
keep your eyes closed developer gets a
job at Microsoft gets very well-known
travels all over the world gets a show
on msdn open your eyes it's me that's me
just saying okay just saying so some of
you might know me from the time that I
worked at Microsoft which was quite a
long time ago it was some eight years
ago now i'm an independent architect
working in Southern California I do
cloud and big data but I also do
something else and I've been doing it
since I worked at Microsoft which is
teaching kids programming I'm the
director so I like to start with the
happy part so I'm going to start with
one of our great successes this is our
first graduate I'm super proud of her
and I'm working to bring her here as a
speaker next year so if she comes please
come to her talk she's 23 years old her
name is Genevieve less bronze she is now
working for pivotal as a developer in
California
but her story is the story that i want
to make happen for more people i met her
when she was 16 she had never done any
programming introduced her to
programming with with my course were
teaching kids programming she became
enamored she got inspired she started
teaching at 17 years old she taught at
the worldwide partner conference for
Microsoft she keynote at a conference
when she was 18 years old in Silicon
Valley she's really an exceptional
person at 19 she went to college in
Canada she went to McGill and she had
wanted to be a biology major to do
cancer research but she decided to minor
in comp sci she did original research as
an undergraduate for breast cancer and
has you know successfully contributed to
the field because she was able to do
computational thinking basically in
college 21 she had an internship at
Microsoft Research at 23 she's a
software engineer at pivotal she's our
first graduate Yeah right and I'm really
working hard to bring her here next year
so that's the happy news that's the
happy news we need more like that so I
tell you another story tell you a little
bit about my story and why I started
teaching kids programming and why I've
spent twenty-five percent of my
professional life for nine years working
on it and why I flew to Australia
basically I don't like talking about
myself but I recently worked with some
people to work on my speaking and they
suggested that I talk more personally so
this is really hard for me but I'm doing
it you can see me peeking over my phone
so even though I live in California now
I traveled all over the world I really
had very humble beginnings and I have to
put a map because nobody knows where
that is I'm actually from West Fargo
North Dakota no kidding I'm the daughter
of two farmers my parents and no one in
my family went to college my dad went to
sixth grade you know it was not a it was
it was a not kind of life I'm having now
and really the reason I have the kind of
life that I have now is because of
education
I have a personal life long commitment
to doing what I can do to impact
education because it changed my life so
it didn't start out really great I was a
really good student and when I was 12 I
was doing great in my geometry and I
said to my math teacher mr. Luna mr.
Luna doing Luna I said what what kind of
career can I have and he said oh honey
girls don't do math and i went home and
my family said yeah he's right honey
girls don't really do math so I kind of
stopped doing math and apparently my
experience is not uncommon will kind of
come to that a little bit later in this
talk so sure cut to now I somehow its a
math because I do data science and you
need math for that so I kind of want to
give you a little bit about my
perspective of now I'm at the top of my
career I'm a successful big data and
cloud architect I travel all over the
world I am the only person in the world
to have an MVP from Google Microsoft and
Amazon which is super fun and exciting
and how the heck did somebody from North
Dakota do this and how can we make this
opportunity for more people well one of
the things that I've found in my world
travels is that if I try to have a
perspective of where I am and listen to
local people and read local signs talk
to local guides I can learn a lot so you
guys all know this right the stupid
American tourists walk into you on the
on the sidewalk because we're walking on
the wrong side and drive on the wrong
side thank you for the look left it
helps me it helps me to not die in
Australia I appreciate it ok so I want
to be that guide for all of you who care
because you obviously care you wouldn't
be here at five o'clock in the afternoon
in a conference when I'm going against
hanselman if you didn't care so I
appreciate the fact that you care so I
want to be your guide not that I'm the
all-out expert I've just been doing this
for a while so the first thing is I want
to help you see things through my eyes
so this is at Google i/o two years ago
these are actual photos I'm standing
there I took the picture I'm a pretty
well people call me a badass person a
tough person but I actually was
uncomfortable because if you got a good
eye you can see there's one other woman
in the picture but as far as the eye
could see there were no other women no
other women this is just two years ago
all right that's google google they're a
bunch of Engineers and you know they're
just San Francisco and you know that's
just the way it's going to be it's
Silicon Valley right this is reinvent
this is the line to get into the docker
session at reinvent I did actually have
a parting over the waters I pulled my
I'm an Amazon community hero card but it
was a very weird weird thing to say do
you guys know who Adrian cockcroft is a
guy from netflix he's super famous so he
he and I were hanging out at at reinvent
and he we parted the waters and it was
just so odd this is a social event in
Los Angeles this is the data scientists
made up I was the keynote speaker of the
year before again I think it's just
really important for more of us to have
this perspective because I think that
those of us who are underrepresented in
the field aren't honest enough about it
it's really intimidating to walk into a
vent after event after event like this
really intimidating so I figured well
okay it's less intimidating if you're
the speaker right but is it I mean
really look that's the big data camp in
LA that's another Google event I mean
that's the thing that's really
challenging for me I know a lot of
really great people been working on this
problem really hard for a lot of years
and that's actually why i started with
ellen k i'm matt allen k at it i triple
e meeting in southern california about
15 years ago that guy is great but he
kicked to the meeting organizers but
because he said whatever small thing
you're doing it's doing nothing and
sometimes i have to tell you i feel that
way and that's one of the reasons that i
travel around the world and talk about
teaching kids programming because we
need more people to work on this problem
so bottom line where is this happening
where is it breaking middle school now
i'm not some researcher I don't have
reams and reams of data but I do have
resources on my sites too serious
academic studies that show over and over
and over that we're not only women but
really anyone but mainstream or very
small subset of people fall off is in
middle school falls off in middle school
and as organizations live like co.org
have started to make some impact with
the younger kids it's really exciting I
don't know how much they're doing here
but they're doing a lot in the US with
the visual programming it's fantastic
but what happens after visual
programming how do you go from visual
program to Java ap you don't that's what
teaching kids programming is trying to
address that middle area when kids have
gone to an event they've gone to an
event like the one we had here got
really excited did some IOT and then
what computational thinking needs to be
a core subject in school period period
there are countries in the world have
started to recognize this but not enough
and our teachers are struggling I went
to a teacher's conference two weeks ago
in California with one of my pilot
teachers teachers are trying anything
they're looking online they're trying
because they know that
kids are getting behind they need us so
I'm going to talk about what we've done
in our organization and maybe it will
give you some inspiration something you
can do they need us so i started when i
started at microsoft so something you
can do if you work for a corporate is
you can negotiate I had twenty five
percent of my job responsibilities
around this problem of access to coding
on my review my bonuses so on and so
forth that's when I started so that's my
first tip for all of you that work in
corporates go back and say I want this
to be part of my job not something I do
on the weekends not something I do on
top of my regular job something that you
go and metric me on that was how
teaching kids programming started
interestingly do any of you recognize
that last woman over there anybody
recognize her that would be Michelle
that's right he was here Michelle
Bustamante that was this was a nine
years ago and she's pregnant with her
son so it's a long term journey so yeah
it just happened that it was women
developers we had guys help too but this
was the first group so Microsoft has a
great program called digi girls and
there wasn't one in Southern California
when I joined and so I said okay 25% my
job I'm going to do this so they sent me
to my ironically to my hometown to Fargo
North Dakota or they're having digi
girls to see the program and although it
was well-intentioned it was the worst
thing ever they had kids coding dynamics
they had no courseware for kids they had
lectures they it was just really bad and
it was we're very well-intentioned but
we needed course we're so at that time
my daughter was eight and I said
Samantha let's find something that you
like to do and I'm sure some of you have
done this with your kids already
probably you're teaching your kids at
home that's a great way to start because
that thing that your kid loves that you
love teaching your kid kids at school
will love that the teacher will love
that it
a great way to start she's at a tech
head by the way starting up right to get
our window so we started i started most
EG girls did one event per year i ended
up doing seven events in southern
california and then i traveled worldwide
so the curriculum that we wrote was used
worldwide and that's how teaching kids
programming started it started with
small basic which was written by a
visual studio developer it's a version
of logo basically like the turtle which
this is not a new idea this is Samuel
poppers stuff for unfortunately just
passed away but it's visual programming
so a guy on the visual studio team wrote
small basic which still exists you can
still use it and we made a series of
lessons and recipes for events and it
was used worldwide taught hundreds and
hundreds of kids all over the world but
in doing that I started to understand
that teaching an event wasn't going to
be enough because what happens after the
event right so I left Microsoft I worked
with a group of open source developers
and in the US if there's any programming
offered at all in high school it's Java
and I talked with a lot of teachers and
they said we can't get kids take these
AP Java classes they drop out they don't
like it it's not fun they don't have the
background they've had scratch or squeak
and then they leave we need help so I
said all right so we took the work that
we did in small basic and we ported it
to Java we started we have 13 lessons
from our events basically that's how we
started five years ago now with some
support from the nonprofit that were
part of which is called the Mona
foundation and a lot of volunteering
from a lot of professional developers we
have a full year courseware library we
have 77 lessons we have teacher training
resources we have a hundred page teacher
training manual and we have screencast
for teacher preparation it's not great
it's not perfect but it's being used
and all started from that first lesson
that I did with my daughter the first
recipe everything's free so the second
takeaway or thing from my talk is you
can use our stuff please use our stuff
we taught I taught here for the kids
night last night or the other night and
there was one developer dad and he's
going to take it to his school and I'm
hoping to come back to Australia to do
some more professional technical talks
within the next year or so and i would
love to train school teachers i would
love to so I offer myself if you want to
start looking at this you want to start
working with it you like it you want to
bring it to your kids school I'm coming
back to Australia it's a great place I
like Australia but I want to work with
more of the school's the targeted age
range for this is 10 to 14 middle school
but it is also very applicable in high
school in US I don't know what is taught
if anything in Australia in high school
but in us with the AP job I have quite a
few high school teachers that work with
me and say they use it as almost a
remedial to keep kids in you might say
java why Java should use Python you
should use are you should use C sharp
you should use blah blah blah blah blah
blah well it's because of what's offered
in u.s. java i'm personally a huge fan
of python and i have a version of tkp
that i found that i haven't yet
completed porting in Python in our
github repo so if you're a Python person
and you want a remote pair program or
fourth the repo party on great if you're
a data scientist I found a complete
version in our that I think is super
cool that I've used in some situations
the language actually really doesn't
matter it's more making curriculum
that's fun for kids that has some step
substance that teachers can use so like
I said our stuff right now we call tkb
java it's a bridge to AP CS java i'm
going to show you it in just a minute 40
hours of java curriculum students start
coding in 90 seconds and tkp train
teachers can teach it i'm having more
and more stem
teachers usually math teachers teach
themselves to code and then ping me and
then we'll do Skype sessions to get them
up and going and then they'll start
using it that's usually where it's
coming although I do have a history
teacher I work with quite a lot who my
daughter actually taught to code it's
kind of cool so this is another happy
thing I had one of my first great
successes this last year a school
district in Riverside California they're
building a stamp program for 6th 7th and
8th and an eighth they selected the Java
curriculum and it's a really
disadvantaged School District most of
the kids speak English as a Second
Language most of them speak Spanish so
the graduates after they got all the way
through I challenged them to write a
recipe and they did and then they had
some of the things happen and they wrote
me some letters so this is one of the
actual letters from a ten-year-old kid
like come on come on you guys that's
aquat line numbers too okay like that's
really cool it's really cool so good so
people ask me because I did events for
so many years we've come to an event
where you come to an event when you come
to an event and doing events are it's
great but I really see impacting this
problem in two areas doing events to get
people excited and motivated and kids
realizing the possibilities and then
getting course we're in the schools and
very honestly it's much easier to do an
event than to go and train a teacher it
takes years but we have to turn the
teachers you guys we have to we have to
so right now we're working with very
actively for school districts and mostly
over Skype although i was going every
single Wednesday for four years to my
daughter middle school and got some
great feedback from that teacher I work
with a ton of nonprofits where the
selected course were for some boys &amp;amp;
girls clubs and like all over the world
because I've traveled all over the world
some Sweden and Jordan and Brazil and
all over the place but I'm really really
moving the organization to move from
events to schools because we've got to
normalize coding in schools now people
say well do you have anything that's
earlier well in addition to the scratch
and squeak I did a bunch of work at
Microsoft with Cody so if you are a
Microsoft damn if you have Windows
laptops it's windows only it's an
awesome visual programming environment
I've done courses on it it's super fun
there's a bunch of research around the
fact that having visual computational
thinking is more inclusive and gets more
kids who would be like not as interested
in some of the other programming mediums
involved in it if you happen to be on
Linda calm I have a lynda.com course on
Co do we also did an experiment enci
sharp and that's on plural site so it's
plural site.com / kids it's the first
lesson only and the original source is
on the microsoft open source what is
that thing called the old one thats
Sarah Ford used to work on was that one
called codeplex it's on codeplex so the
original teaching extensions in c-sharp
on coat it's only one lesson though and
again that'd be an awesome thing for
somebody to do the tortoise basically on
C sharp but we do have the first lesson
and then on the older age group a woman
that we worked with for a while Katrina
Owen who's really phenomenal she has
this site called exorcism which is
actually great for pro dams too it's
basically a crowdsourced homework coding
site where you do TDD it's super fun and
just in just 15 languages and she did
some work without
and you know had her own ideas but got
inspired and so we kind of see working
together but we're focusing in the
center all right so you're probably gone
like okay we're developers what is what
it was she talking about was this look
like well let me show you some of the
resources so we have a website and it's
basically just a index into our stuff so
the courseware and the team and that
kind of stuff so we have eight lessons
eight courses each course has you know
about 10 different recipes in it and
then inside of each course and this is
very much done for school teachers we
have a one video to demonstrate the
concepts there's one two three
programming concepts and then we have a
written lesson plan so the lesson plan
is on pen flip which is github for
writers kind of fun it's all marked down
and it has a you know this is very much
for school teachers this this has been
created based on what school teachers
told me they needed like how do I
prepare how do i set up how am I ready
and it has all the answers then for all
of us programmer people this reference
is into our github repos so we have an
organizational repo and for the Java we
have two sections we have source which
again you're welcome to contribute to
fork whatever it's free it's open and
then we have our teaching repo now in
addition to the lessons the teaching
repo just has the starter the the source
has the starter and the solutions and
they're all indexed here like here's the
answers for the teachers basically so
when the kids use it they're going to
just get the starter code in addition to
that because we were inspired by the
small basic editor which was a
simplified editor we do a lot of
customizations to eclipse we and I'll
show you what looks like we remove we
remove a lot of the menus so we say
press the play button and we also do a
whole bunch of things that make it
easier to code correctly so we for
example add if I say tortoise and I do a
control space notice we have a custom
javadocs for everything with a lot of
icons and a lot of samples so we have we
have examples
I've now written so much documentation
my life because we want to teach kids
you know the best programming habits
right read your docs because we all read
our docs right right we all read our
dogs and for sure right so so we we
automatically put semicolons at the end
we automatically indent on save so we've
done a bunch of things so that kids can
see the correct environment do you mean
it's a set of custom extensions so in
addition to that we have utilities for
teachers so one of the utilities that we
have is something called our virtual
Proctor and i'll show you how that works
what it is technically since you guys
are developers this is a google cloud
application that just captures a
screenshot generates a PNG on window
closed event and sends it up to the
google cloud and then it just displays
it with a little bit of metadata here so
the teachers can self-select and this is
so that the teacher can have a sense of
what the students are doing in the
classroom because our curriculum is
mastery based it's so conceptually
similar to math although I'm not a math
teacher when I find in working with math
teachers is the same idea that everybody
has to get through all the concepts in
order to advance and so the teachers
need to have resources like this so for
each of the lessons we have a core
recipe and then we do a concept called
variation which is refactoring so what
happens in the first recipe we just do a
square and you can see the way that our
lessons are written I actually by
training I did not major in computer
science I majored in linguistics so I
have I we have metal language that that
our team wrote that is um you know
having English comments that are in a
very stat has a similar style so easier
to read and consume so for example we
always have the verb in the verb is
always capitalized so when I'm teaching
this I'll say read line one and the kid
will say show The Tortoise and then I'll
say in English we're starting with the
verb but in Java we start with the noun
so what is the noun in this
sentence we use an interrogative based
teaching again this isn't stuff we
invented this is the the constructivist
method of teaching that's been around
for a really really long time and we've
just I guess applied it if you will to
to modern Java so as we go along we make
that we gradually make our API differ
further and further from the English so
in this particular case you having a
show that tortoise and then I would just
have this move down so do and I have now
done that so I'd get rid of the comments
and then I would turn so tortoise
control space we teach keyboard
shortcuts and dot and then we say in
English you separate by space and in
Java you separate by a period and then
turn so type of tea and then control
space and then we would put this in and
then we would run it and so and so forth
but notice when we get to this one
change the pen color the line the
tortoise draws to blue okay we're
programmers here what's that going to be
there's no change so what's it going to
be anybody have any idea sat there's my
programmer set pen color this is where
we teach setters and getters right set
pin color and then in terms of the
colors we had a lot of fun and we
deliberately we overrode the Java
default colors to be able to put a color
picker so we've done q fide things if
you will we've also put a bunch of
Easter eggs in the documentation so that
makes the kids read it and go what's
going on it's so fun right you know so
it's fun I mean we have we have a great
time so then we have random colors so so
then we you know and this is the first
lesson so then the next thing we teach
is the for loop even though now with
functional programming I'm having to
rethink our for loops good i'm not sure
but anyway
so we have the for loop and we teach the
for loop and then we talk about how you
have to move the moustaches down because
otherwise you're not going to have
anything running and then we have our
for loop and then we're going to go as
fast as possible and again we purposely
michelle-michele really that's pretty
funny we purposely make this not the
same as the English so make the tortoise
move as fast as possible and i'll give
you a hint it's a set so which one is it
yay look at this kid yeah you set speed
and how would you know what speed you'd
have to read the documentation yay set
speed to ten right so so the first part
of our each lesson is guided then the
second part is the refactoring so what
we do is we say all right because you
guys know this when you get done and you
code up your thing and you present it to
your boss your boss always says well
you've perfectly understood the
requirements and you're done and I'm
happy to pay you now right right so
we're teaching the real world so then we
in each lesson but Justin this is the
first lesson we would then say to the
kids ok if this square was the wrong
size which line of code would make it
bigger or smaller who knows how would
you make this square bigger let's say
which line of code turn my turn or is
there another one you want to make a
bigger square move right because that's
how long the line is right so now if we
let's see if it works it did work now
what if we wanted to make a triangle
this is tricky because what sets the
number of sides how many sides are there
for so which line do you see the number
four on right here good right but
sometimes code isn't easy to change as
we programmers know so if we turn in a
circle that's four times 90 so we can
just do 360 divided by 4 which doesn't
change the behavior of our code yet
however if we now want to make a
triangle we right-click and we refactor
and we extract a local variable called
sides and yes we teach the 10 year olds
and now if we change the four to A three
we will have a triangle I love when I go
to schools and I have 10 year olds that
say no miss Lin its refactor no miss Lin
you have to refactor that it makes me so
happy makes me so happy so you'll see in
each of the sections we have a number of
recipes that reinforce so we have a core
recipe and then we have up to three
additional recipes we also have a
concept called a quiz so I worked for a
number of years as a microsoft certified
trainer and I taught C sharp and about
different languages and so on and so
forth and we just open this up and what
I was thought was really stupid was when
I did the certification exams that they
were paper sort of you know what I mean
like you had to answer on a piece of
paper how to code things shouldn't you
demonstrate that you know how to code by
coding what a novel concept right so we
have quizzes and the quizzes aren't so
much for the teachers as they're for the
students because the way that we advise
the teachers to facilitate them is we
always have the students work in pairs
by the way pair programming is integral
to our teaching methodology which I'll
cover a bit more in a minute as we say
okay run the quiz and of course we're
going to fail
because learned anything so we fail then
go to each question and get it to work
now I was just well I might be giving it
away if I say where I was what kind of
thinking is it to write a line of code
and then verify it that's right this is
it has our course where has a test
driven development aspect written into
it that we have leveled it so as much as
possible one line of English is one line
of code so move the tortoise 110 pixels
what's the noun people tortoise i'm
going to type t 0 are right in control
space what would be the verb move so i'm
typing a 10 because i am using my tools
and then i should be typing what their
110 I've got someone paying attention
i'm very happy so now i will pass the
first question so when I talk about
mastery-based learning we've worked for
this is the part that's taken years we
worked for years to level the courseware
appropriately and i gotta tell you
honestly that's the really hard part
right from being a pro dev because we're
all here coding every day and you give
it to the teachers and they go whoa
you've got too many concepts in there we
need two piece that apart we need to add
more recipes we need to move these
concepts over here and over here and
over here that's been the real
development of the library do not I mean
because each course has one two three
programming concepts and there are eight
courses another thing that we have
that's I think kind of innovative is we
have Coty's you guys heard of Coty's
yeah so Coty's come out of the Ruby
community although they're coming into
more and more communities and we run
these as a mob I heard of mob
programming group programming I'll cover
I'll cover it back but it's you work as
a group basically so what happens here
is that
and this is the sort of TDD style of
thinking that are called deep dives so
this is at the end of the module the
teacher will lead the group of kids
they'll sit in a circle now put it on
the projector and the way that it works
is is it says right here select the
method name then read the method name
well run it and it's going to fail and
then fill in the blank you know I have
to put a blank back in here because it
was and for those of you that are
wondering the blanks are variable names
so kind of interesting implementation
and then change the blank and make the
method pass and then reflect on what you
learned and then rotate so this comes I
mean this is not anything we invented
this comes straight out of the Ruby
community we saw this at an agile
conference room full of people didn't
know Ruby teaching each other Ruby and
again learn to code by coding what a
concept so I'm going to go ahead and run
this and it's going to fail of course
right and then over here I need to make
that pass so the method name is numbers
do not need quotes so what should I
change this to I think you guys can get
this one guess children are so smart 42
I love it okay now what if you wanted to
try putting quotes around this now it
says numbers don't need quotes could you
try that do you think it would work how
would you find out run it right run it
verify it nope it was expected it to be
an integer but it was a string so you
can see that this is a very experimental
kind of nature it's actually kind of
funny because the person who wrote a lot
of these is my daughter and a lot of
them have teenager jokes in them which I
actually don't get but when I teach it
or preteen jokes the kids are like
crying they're laughing so hard they're
silly they're silly silly jokes
but we have all kinds like this one goes
into this is just the first one and then
this one goes into a lot of the advanced
for loop stuff so in the bottom here we
get like this one for loops can start
anywhere okay so we can only change the
underscore y is 7 the most feared number
you guys know this because 789 oh I know
teenage kids love it gets love it so so
it's written for kids right it's written
for kids so anyway so you kind of get a
sense of what the library looks like so
I alluded to this but this is actually
integral and goes back to what I started
with and I'm as guilty as anybody else
people who go into programming love
their computers they love their machines
many of us are introverts many of us are
you know we just we like the logic right
the logic isn't it beautiful you go to
work you know life is crazy or whatever
but by goodness code is logical so we
aren't sometimes logical but code is
logical but our industry needs to be
more inclusive it needs to look more
like the world we live in and in order
to do that we need to add ways of
working with people into coding it's
been really interesting because I've
been dragged down this road I was you
know I was like I'm never doing pair
programming that stupid I don't want to
do it I'm never doing mob programming
and I was wrong the trick is if you are
introverted you don't do it all the time
that's really what it comes down to but
you do do it sometimes you do it in
situations maybe where you're learning
or people are stuck or you know whatever
in fact just as an aside for the past 10
months I have taken a contract that's
100% mobbing because I believe in
pushing myself and there have been days
that I've loved it and there have been
days that I went home and said I don't
have enough wine in the house do you
know what I mean because it snowed and I
got a headache and oh so it's that also
we want to normalize boys and girls
coding together in school I don't want
to be negative about some of these
events and some of these other things
because really anything that we do is
going to help okay but I want it to be
normal that boys and girls code together
in school like that is my dream it's
really important so that's although
units we have we go all the way up to
TDD the last lesson in our course where
it's fizzbuzz seriously we do fizzbuzz
it's awesome we do fizzbuzz it's so much
fun and we are we have all kinds of
requests to go further i have a huge
request to do android development i have
a request to do functional i have a
request to do all kinds of new course
where i have spun off a separate
nonprofit in our test location the boys
and girls club it's called tkp labs and
we do really fun summer camps there to
try things out and jessica ellis who
runs that is working with me to do iot
and data science curriculum so we have a
half acre farm and we've had a Java user
group there for three years from where
we started and we now have IOT stuff
going on a regular basis there in fact
she's looking at doing some stuff with
Azure and IOT also the data
visualization is unplugged there's a
whole bunch of unplug stuff which means
without a computer they put it on the
wall it's really cool if you guys have
ever heard of the guy David McCandless
he does information is beautiful I met
him at a sequel past conference and we
got very inspired by him and we use his
materials and its really really pretty
awesome so we're doing stuff beyond the
core but my focus is core because you
got to have the core competency to do
the fun cool
it's just it's a discipline you have to
understand object properties and methods
you have to understand using your editor
you have to understand writing your
documentation you do so there's one of
my teacher colleagues this David Cooper
Smith he's out in riverside and he is
working with his teacher team to bring
our curriculum to all of Riverside
County which would be like 40,000
students so wish us luck he wrote an NSF
grant and if we get it will be like kind
of our biggest biggest launch in the
United States so really really exciting
so I told you every course has all this
stuff we also have some paper worksheets
or some of the teachers so they have
something to grade so we really try to
make a teacher friendly so what kind of
results that's my daughter now by the
way she's been she's 17 now she's a
younger there she's been teaching she
ain't I dragged her Anna's kind of a
helper in the beginning she's been
teaching since she was 12 years old she
taught a university class when she was
13 right now she's at Stanford she's 17
years old and she's taking data mining
from a Googler so this stuff works it
works you teach your kid computational
thinking they go far they do math so
I've personally trained over 4,000
students in our nine years or whatever I
personally trained 70 teachers there's
there's lots more there's lots more
because we're free so I really operate
on a you know somebody needs something I
will help them you know I always tell
people if you are gone through the
materials you've learned them you're
stuck on something you want to give me a
feedback you want a pair program on
something that is what skype is for and
basically I've devoted 25% of my
professional life for nine years to this
sometimes fifty percent because it's
just that important it really is so the
other thing that is really interesting
and I started by talking about if you're
in a corporate cuz I know a lot of guys
are corporate and probably thinking well
maybe there's something I can do with my
corporate there is so this is that same
school those are them because it
graduates I challenge them
to write a Java recipe because where I
was working with the mob they didn't
know Java and I said if your kids David
can write a Java recipe I want them to
come and have a field trip and you can
teach the programmers Java and they will
teach you JavaScript and by god we did
it and it was so freaking cool so the
kids came over by the way aren't those
monitors awesome that's where I work 3 2
to 3 80 inch monitors and we rotate it's
super cool nurse David here's his kids
teaching Java and there's one of the
professional programmers teaching
JavaScript and one of they broke into
six mobs one of the mobs that kids
finish the interview questions that they
give to the professional programmers and
they're 12 years old I was so happy it
was just wonderful so again this is
maybe an inspiration of something you
could do you know they're just all kinds
of things you could do if you're in a
corporate you could reach out to a
school and give them a challenge and if
they meet the challenge have them come
and not just walk around code with you
like that's the theme hey code with you
because they can do it you'll be
surprised so so many different ways that
you can work with people there's tons of
nonprofits you know there's after school
clubs you guys have coding club here in
Australia i know that's been going
really gangbusters going into the
schools is fantastic working with your
teachers side by side the probably the
most impactful thing to the library is
this teacher when working with who'd
Samantha taught in her in her middle
school for four years the first year I
taught and she taught and he sat in the
class the second year he taught this was
one hour a week every Wednesday and she
helped and I kind of observed the third
year he taught on his own the fourth
year he's written recipes for the
library it's pretty awesome right
schooled a history teacher has written
Java recipes for the library it takes a
freaking long time but it's worth it
it's worth it it's worth it
so I don't know what you're going to do
when you go out of here but please tell
me you're going to do something because
there is so much work we need to do
don't mean to end on a sad note but I
noticed something that came today that I
wanted to kind of share with people if
you follow me on Twitter there was an
industry piece that came out of the
advertising world that talked about a
woman's experience well it looks like I
got it you guys must be tweeting about
me so this and I'm not going to take the
time in this presentation but I'm going
to personally ask every one of you to
read this because if you remember the
pictures that i started with without
going into detail i will tell you that
i've personally have the type of
experiences that are here and i know
many many people in the industry have
and we are better than that we are
better than that so if you'll do me that
favor of reading that article and you'll
do me the favor of taking a look at the
course where that we have and maybe
using it with your own kids or friends
kids giving you feedback I am NOT proud
I am not the greatest developer in the
world anything you can tell me to make
it better I will hear and let's make our
world better ok and now we're going to
go have drinks with Michelle is good all
right so I'm done so hopefully I enjoyed
it
and I'm done a little bit early so I'm
happy to take any questions if you have
any questions at all yes mm-hmm yes
mm-hmm what does computational thinking
that's a great question so what I've
done is if I go in to my pin flip here
as you can see kind of laid out nicely
there are core concepts in
object-oriented programming that kids
need to understand so what's an object
what's the property what's a method
what's a for loop what what are the
different types of loops when do you do
which loop we still teach all those
things that you had in college we just
try to make them fun so what I mean by
that is methods of performing
computation that are common for the type
of language what i've really been
noodling around because i'm doing more
and more big data stuff is how to teach
functional that's like an area I'm very
very interested in and should we be
teaching kids functional and should it
be are or should be ipython you know how
are we going to prepare kids for because
i'm working on a course now on hadoop be
next for Linda so in apache spark so in
scala so how are we going to prepare
kids for that world do you know mean so
so just to to give a concise answer
computational thinking depends on the
type of language so the what i see is
there's olp languages like Java and C++
and C sharp and then there are less you
know looser languages like JavaScript
and Python and then there are functional
languages so there's three categories of
languages and again i'm not an expert
i'm self-taught right and there are
different programming paradigms that
align with those languages does it make
sense yeah okay yes
yeah so well you know I did work at
Microsoft's I was traumatized by the
windows mobile experience but i have had
tons of requests for android and really
it's a question of resourcing do you
know what I mean because I i I'm a try
to really grow my organization you know
it we're kind of us startup and so you
know the group that spell split office
tkp labs we were one organization but
they split off because they're more
interested in events and they're
interested in farming and IOT and stuff
like that so once my daughter goes off
to college then I'm going to kind of
regroup so that may well come to pass
because I know kids really like it it's
just figuring out what should be next I
mean I really you know like should it be
phones should be functional you know
because i work in big data right so i'm
biased by that right it's like one of
the areas for example i'm really really
interested in a friend of mine has
cancer and i am really really interested
in helping kids understand big data sets
and if there's something i could do
around like genomic data sets I'm
actually talking with some people that
are local to me to see if there's some
kind of sample genomic data set or
something like I tend to be I don't know
I have to be more fun like to me that's
fun but I don't know if that's going to
be fun for kids right you know so so
it's a question of priorities so yes
well again i'm not an expert but my
opinion is that when i first started
there was an awareness it was seen as a
niche area it was seen as a specialty
area was not seen as core now because of
efforts like code org org is really
really impacting us they're actually
going and changing laws in states to
make computer science be part allowed as
part of the core curriculum they are
really really making some significant
change I think that it's a generational
thing because our generation my
generation I'm older than you I know we
didn't have computers when we were kids
and so it's new right whereas the cut'
now as we're aging it's starting to be
seen as this is this has to be part of
it right so one thing as an aside and I
really didn't mention but actually since
I haven't been I wouldn't call it out
this is really interesting was published
today very very interesting i'm running
up against this math phobia all the time
and just as an aside i personally up to
my game in math about four years ago i
was over 50 when I was laid up for a
while and what I did was I learned like
everybody else in the US or worldwide
from Salman Khan I learn calculus when I
was 51 years old right now I'm working
on integrals because they didn't have it
and I love it it's so awesome why didn't
I learn this when I was younger it's so
fantastic so it's just like I'm an aside
I mean that's more it's a separate thing
but it does go to why isn't coding core
it's sort of this underlying thing why
isn't extremely high math literacy core
because if I God with all the data we're
going to have to write like really so
I'm kind of on this bandwagon about all
of us professionals need to up our math
game it's a way to stay relevant and you
study with your kids and this is very
interesting came out today and it showed
a correlation it's a study that shows
the corlee
Shin because of the the well-known
situation of women not thinking they're
competent muster eighty percent
competent and Men thinking they're
competent when they're like thirty
percent competent and I'm not being
judgmental this is statistically like
studied right so what happens when the
math gets hard is basically the women
drop out so I mean I think that I've
kind of stumbled on reforming education
math STEM education but you know I can
only do one thing at a time right you
know I mean so so so to answer your
question I think that there are certain
parts of Education encoding is a part
that are not seen as central and I think
that that is incorrect it makes sense
yeah okay I see back there
I've embarrassed many a developer at
these kids events who say and I say yeah
you unit test everything don't you in
them yep
yeah so so the things that are working
are I know this is the Sun really dumb
but when i put I I worked with like five
teachers to make this dumb little grid
in the beginning of all this this is the
lesson plan right because they just were
like they were I'm uncomfortable this
doesn't look like what I'm used to i
said okay show me a lesson plan and this
literally looks like what they have for
a lesson plan a little grid and so it's
like communicating with any other group
that's new to you you want to meet them
where they are right so that's been a
really big chance like when we first
started we only have the github right
cuz hey go to give up get it right
teachers are like what right so so and
then we went we went through this
website let's see where's the website
due to deter I was have to go here so
this website basically for you guys
wouldn't need this it's a fancy index
it's with pretty pictures right but the
use of teaching kids programming went
way up and i did a be testing with
teachers and I have you know teachers on
the front page and I spent hours and
hours you know agonizing over what you
know should I say the code or courses or
blah and I mean it's still not perfect
okay but but it's this making the
materials in a way that the teachers are
comfortable with do you know ty mean I
mean I still have a bunch of teachers
and one of the reasons i use this is
because you can print it they print
everything teachers like printing
everything which is so it's like are you
kidding me right but that's what they
want so taking the materials and making
them i think it's helpful that I have
this background in linguistics and I
speak a bunch of foreign languages and
I've traveled all over the world and you
know unlike many Americans I have
something broader than the you know
center of america of you do not I mean
well it's true hey so so it's like okay
the teachers need this let me make the
material in this format so I'm
constantly working to do that
denote I mean so that's number one
number two is when you go and work with
the teachers they it's really tricky in
the beginning because they're experts
that were they're experts in classroom
control managing the kids you know that
kind of stuff and you're experts in
coding so being respectful and if you
co-teaching with them letting them
manage the crap classroom and you
guiding guiding with the coding because
it's really hard when you're the coding
expert not to just take over but
co-teaching is really really important
and then like I did you know in the
school just sitting down and letting the
teacher teach and giving feedback after
teachers are used to that right like
really going where they are and i'll
tell you teachers are leery of
programmer parents that come and tell
them what to do i understand you know be
I have such respect for teachers they
don't get paid they put up with bratty
kids crazy parents you know I have
reverence for teachers I really do so so
being respectful and giving them the
materials the way they need does that
make sense okay other questions go ahead
yeah
which is in mathematical skills yeah is
that I gotta be that begins thank you
there's no pre test or anything like
that and so a couple things i'll tell
you a couple things that don't work and
this might be helpful so we did you guys
know you have a concept of code camp
where you have like a one-day thing
locally and you kind of meet up at a
university so we did a bunch of code
camps and they were actually just
horrible because what happened is people
brought their kids and basically sauces
daycare and we had kids from six to
seventeen and it was horrible so one of
the things is to try to get the age
that's why in school to actually learn
concepts get the age close together okay
that's one thing another thing is pair
programming is really great just like it
is for adults you know you have people
working together and you can be and the
teachers are really going to be good at
this you can level out like if you have
a really advanced person they can be
teaching a person who's remedial or you
can have people that like working
together do you know because part of
what we want to happen is to people need
to learn to work together right and the
teachers are really down with that so
the for this course where kids should
know how to keyboard so I'll give you an
example where it was a challenge i was
in Zambia because I did some other work
over there and even though the kids were
12 they didn't they didn't know how to
keyboard and so what we did is we
separated most of them we separated the
kids who maybe had access to a laptop
from the kids who didn't we leveled them
basically because it was too frustrating
for the ones who have never done a
keyboard before so you kind of try to
group people together do you know what I
mean so and and that's also why we have
extra recipes because if there's some
really fast kids they can do the extra
recipes so yeah okay what else yeah back
in the back oh sorry I didn't see you
sorry
the chill environment so my question is
I guess how to get through the books so
the power bank so it's for kids who
aren't sure I'm going to grab by numbers
i find visualization so this is that
David McCandless person I was talking
about here's his website information is
beautiful so most kids care about
something so find out you know like did
she care about animals does she care
about old people does she care about
does she have a hobby something
something she cares about and then
represent mathematical information
visually and that will engage them so so
let me try to find something here
something this one's cool the
billion-dollar ogram okay this is more
for adults ok but so basically this is
the visualization of money and you can
see like how much is spent on health
care I mean it's just it's neat right
like how much Apple makes how much their
profit is right and its interactive so
there's a bunch of things in that's the
source data there's a bunch of things in
the sorry in the New York Times I don't
know if any of the newspaper and
Australia is doing it that are
interactive like they show the impact of
global warming they show the glaciers
melting and they show you know the
though I think that would be interesting
here unfortunately they show the oceans
rising and you know things like that
right I find a lot of times kids that
say they don't care about
math they do care if it's related to
oftentimes seems to be nature like I we
were teaching in Hawaii not a bad gig
right on Molokai and Molokai in case you
don't know some of you might is where
all the many of the indigenous Hawaiians
live and they have the leper colony and
all this stuff and they're very anti
development and so they have no jobs
right and so this rich family for
Molokai brought us there and the kids
were just like we don't care we don't
care we don't care we don't care about
this why would we care about this so we
actually use co do we use visual
programming that's another thing you can
do and we had to make Molokai we had to
make the island we had contests about
what would be the ideal Molokai and what
should Molokai look like and in co do
they have a when do and they have loops
and stuff like that but it's visual so
the the sort of key thing is visual some
kind of visual computational thinking
that connects to something that she
cares about this does it make sense and
I hope that's not too abstract but yeah
notnot books it has to be hands on you
have to do hands-on books aren't going
to do it I don't I mean again I'm not I
am I I'm a big data and cloud architect
and a mom okay I am NOT an educational
expert I just have had some success with
things what we did with how we did this
in in in the lab is the kids grew herbs
and then they made pesto and they made
different for different flavors of pesto
like one was garlicky one was lemony
whatever then they took it home and they
had to collect data on a sheet and then
we gave them like string and post-its
and paper and then they had to visualize
the results of the data and they could
also use like dried basil leaves and
stuff like that and it was the most
fantastic thing I mean that was a
mathematical thing right because they
had to quantify what flavors impacted
the likeability of the food so you know
making it tangible is
really what makes it interesting right I
think so okay any other questions go
ahead yeah well like when I was really
for starting and I was very naive I was
like oh will do 40 hours and I'll go
through the whole library and nobody
does that so so I just kind of take it
as it goes like usually we start and I
say okay do the first course which has
seven lessons and then I kind of see how
the teacher does and if I can physically
go there I'll go there and that will
take them maybe two or three hours but
more often than not I skype so I do a
lot of 30 minute skype sessions 30
minute skype sessions seemed to work
pretty well so it varies by the teacher
you know because some like math teachers
sometimes they're they're really good
you know and especially this type of
coding it clicks in for them right
really fast but then others you know
really are meeting more i mean i'll give
you an example of something where we
weren't successful we went to an urban
School District in new york city
brooklyn new york and we had people who
did not have any mathematical training
they were basically like office workers
and we were not able to support them
because they needed to have you know
eight hours for two hours of course work
so that was frustrating to us but you
have to be realistic right so consultant
answer it depends yeah yeah ooh yeah yep
yep yep what else yes oh hi
yeah this that's what this is for my
dear thank you for asking that I'm
making it for you so we try it great
what's your name Rallo okay okay well
let me know okay you can find me on the
internet and very easy to find all right
anything else or is it time to drink
with Michelle you guys are fantastic for
hanging in thank you so much i hope you
find it valuable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
