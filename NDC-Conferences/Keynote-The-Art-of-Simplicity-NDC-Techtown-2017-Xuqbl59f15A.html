thank you for this opportunity I really
am excited to be here I want to talk
about something that we all share in
common what we do every single day of
our work which is to deal with
complexity and and that's what we do for
a living isn't it we go to work we solve
problems we create more problems maybe
at the end of the day and then come back
and solve it the next day I was on a
flight and guys sitting next to me asked
me what I do for a living I said I'm a
programmer he said that's the easiest
job on earth I said I'm so glad somebody
thinks that way but can you tell me why
he said because all you have to know is
zeros and ones
I said you're absolutely right but do
you know why they pair such a big bug to
do this I said why because we figure out
in which order to put them together it
is a complexity we have to deal with and
I'm gonna say in this room in front of
us we have something probably the most
complex ever which is the human brain
and the human brain is fascinating for
two different reasons one is it's
probably the most capable we can imagine
things we can innovate things we can
figure out things but at the same exact
moment we also get very tangled up we
get confused
we got emotionally attached to things
and we wake up with again overhead and
we're not able to think clearly and it's
very fascinating that in that little
brain goes both of those at the same
time and when I talk to my children
oftentimes they're familiar the word
called sugar scat shooting guard Wentz
imagine that what if there's a cat and
there's violent up in the box you can't
really see through cannot hear at any
given time maybe the cat is both alive
and dead you know a lot of times life is
kind of like that you think about things
as two different state altogether not
really clear which one we are in but I
want to talk about complexity
well they say life is really simple but
we insist on making it really
complicated so did Confucius say but I
want to start with a question why why do
we really make things complex I think I
have an answer for you it feels good it
really feels
when you make things complex isn't it
let's be honest about it
deep down you will tell me it feels
really good you are solving this
particular problem you go to your
colleague and you show the result you
have done your colleague looks at it and
says yeah I get it it's simple you feel
really let down you're like let me come
back tomorrow I'll come back with a
complex solution there is another reason
why we make things really complex and
honestly this is very important reason
it jobs security because you know when
it comes to times to layoff people they
always say don't touch Joe because
nobody has a clue what Joe is doing so
that gives us job security as well when
we make things really complex but
unfortunately though when things become
really complex it becomes really hard to
maintain them as well look like the
screens are out if you can take a look
at why why is that oh it's actually too
dim that's what it is
okay that's complex right there so
Einstein said any intelligent fool can
make things bigger more complex and more
violent but I taped a touch of genius
and a lot of courage to move in the
opposite direction I would highlight the
word courage over there and in fact
that's one of the biggest challenges is
we feel insecure a lot of times we need
courage to stand up and say no I am NOT
going to make this any more complex to
stand up for simplicity requires that
courage and that's really hard to
achieve a lot of different times so we
want to really work towards being making
things simple well if simple simple was
sitting next to you in a bus or a train
would we even be able to recognize what
simple really is and that's one of the
challenges I face a lot of times when I
work with developers is everyone agrees
that things have to be simple we cannot
really define what simple means in a
given context that becomes really hard a
recognizing simplicity is often really
not that simple
oh we'll talk about simplicity but it
turns out it's not that easy to talk
about it so maybe I thought I'll talk
about what's not simple and if I talk
about what's not simple maybe we'll
recognize them and maybe try to avoid
them as we go into the future so let's
talk about what's not simple well the
first thing I'm gonna say is simple is
not clever how many times have we
written something that we feel
is very clever almost all the time isn't
it and we write something clever and
then it comes to bite us back after a
while reminds me of an experience I had
not too long ago I had a request from a
client saying something is really not
right need to be fixed
I look at the problem it would have
taken me 10 minutes to solve the problem
I said to myself oh no I'm not going to
solve the problem I'm gonna solve the
mother of all problems I'm gonna solve
it so cool that not only will this
problem we fixed but a family of
problems like this would be fixed so I
spent the hour fixing the problem and
when I finished it I had an out-of-body
experience I had Venkat get up and
hugged me from the back and said you're
awesome it felt that good about two
weeks later I got an email from the
client saying something absolutely
disastrous has happened in production I
replied to them saying I'll fix it they
said oh yeah of course you will fix it
because we know you are good I said no
no I can fix it not because I'm good
I'll fix it because I'm the one who cast
it and the little clever solution I had
created had totally backfired in ways I
never imagined what did I do
I rolled back the change as I put in put
the ten minutes solution that was in
place in the beginning and I've never
heard from them again ever since about
this problem I learned the hard lesson
these days when I write the code my
little brain tells me that's clever
I delete it immediately and I start over
I don't want clever solution a one clear
solution well I'll take a look at this
example here for a minute I think we
should dim the light a little bit it
stood a little too dark for the screen
so if we look at this code right here
could somebody help me to dim the lights
please
so if you look at this here the enum e
extends enum e well wait a minute what
does it really mean thank you what does
it really mean um e extends enum e that
kind of weird isn't it oh that lot of
noise you just heard that your brain
throwing an exception and it's really
hard to comprehend code like this this
is exactly how ennum looks like in Java
for example that's complexity isn't it
or you know people come to me and ask me
how do we make sure
I'll first get our code and I often tell
them why do you need an association tool
your programmers create code that's
naturally self office gated they
themselves cannot understand it tomorrow
after they write it so we think to
really alpha skate and becomes really
really hard to understand over time and
so how do we deal with this and here's
an example of a code I came across
here's a method called the in square
root float X honestly I don't have a
clue what axis but notice the second
line we have half of that X whatever X
was and look at the code
next line don't tell me you don't
understand this should be obvious right
and then here's some good news I don't
have a clue most of what this is doing
but the good news is whatever it is X it
is return in the end well if you look at
this that takes a lot of time and effort
to understand what the code is doing you
know how people tell you that
object-oriented code represents the real
world well somebody took it to the heart
this guy was developing a flight
simulator and created this kind of code
and and and somebody should have stopped
and said dude don't do this how does
anyone maintain code like this right
where we get really really excited so
when we come and it comes to being
clever
it really hurts us in the long run so I
would say simple is not clever another
thing I want to emphasize is simple is
not necessarily familiar humans have a
tendency to confuse the word simple and
the word familiar I was told in Norway
they use the word optimal for the word
simple in English well what is optimal
doesn't really mean it is really simple
or our familiar is not simple we need to
be very careful but what this really
means in the context what is familiar to
us is something we are very very used to
we have seen this a lot of times we
don't have to think twice when we see it
but something familiar may actually be
very complex and we are not even
thinking about it in the long run but on
the other hand something that's not
familiar may actually be simple but we
haven't even given a chance to it we
often claim that it's complex because of
our human mind fears dry spheres and as
and we think it maybe it really is
complex
let's look at this particular word right
here well if you most of us probably
would look at this and say my gosh that
looks really complex but people who
understand the language would say it is
actually simple in fact it stands for
uncomplicated casual and common and and
that's what happens when we are not
familiar with something it drives us
crazy and we think it's actually complex
let's talk about a fairly simple problem
and something we can quickly relate to I
have a list of names here in front of me
as you can see and all I want to do is
print in uppercase comma separated all
the names that are off the length for
how would I write code like this almost
any language you use C++ Python whatever
that you may use I'm using JavaScript
here so let's say far and what am I
gonna do I'm gonna say let a equal to
zero maybe let's I say I less than names
dart length maybe and then I plus plus
hey that's a very simple for loop isn't
it notice how I confuse the word
familiar with the word simple in fact I
would argue there's a very familiar but
very complex or loop why is it complex
it's got way too many moving parts in it
I got initialized the I properly
increment it properly send the boundary
properly and to add insult to injury it
requires a lot more effort as well then
I could say name start length maybe our
names square bracket I again a little
bit more complexity there length is
equal to four then what do we want to do
I want to output the names square
bracket I dot to uppercase after all I
want all the values in uppercase well
but that's not what the problem said it
wanted the values comma separated oh
that is very easy I can separate them by
comma so I could pretty much put a comma
and you all know that's not quite what
we wanted we want them on the same line
I could say process start STD out dart
right maybe and print it and then when
I'm done with it you notice there's a
stupid
Armagh in the very end has anyone ever
faced the problem before
how did you feel when this happened to
you you said to yourself this is not
happening to me right because it turns
out removing that stupid comma is not
that easy you just Darren said huh and
then you're like how do we remove this
comma and then you came with the clever
idea you said I will first of all put
this into a string and I will strip it
out in the end how did you feel about
that not so good and then you said maybe
I'll do something like if I is equal to
you know I is not equal to something
like that and then you know maybe name
start a length and then of course you
say is that minus one after this and
you're not very sure about it and it
turns out you can do this in an
interview give this to somebody and
watch them suffer right and and this is
a very simple problem would you agree a
trivial problem but an enormous Li
complex solution I call these accidental
complexity they're accidental complexity
because the problem is not complex the
solution is complex the solution drags
the U n beats you down at the end of the
day you're like I'm done right but it
doesn't have to be this way
let's try this one more time after all I
couldn't solve this really well but
let's try this one more time let's go
ahead and say I'm gonna output right
here but I'll say name start well I'm
gonna do a filter given a name I really
want a name that length is equal to
maybe a value of four well this is
giving me all good names which are of
length four that's a great first step
I'm gonna do a map operation give a name
I want to say named R to uppercase
converted to uppercase hey that's a nice
second step now I want to say Joe in
with a comma can you believe it just the
word join the day I learned about the
join method I cried that night I'm like
my goodness this is the way programming
should be it should be that simple to do
and this is raising the level of
abstraction
this is one of the reason I'm drawn
towards a functional style of
programming and almost every single
language today that's worth using has
the functional style of programming
including C++ which reduce lambdas not
too long ago so we can do functional
style of programming and inherently
functional style of programming removes
a lot of complexity from our shoulders
now we as programmers have spent the
last 20 30 40 years depending on how
long you've been around coding in the
imperative style of programming but
imperative style of programming is
inherently more complex than the
functional style of programming and a
lot of us are just new to functional
style of programming even though
functional style programming has been
around for a very long time and and that
is one of the things to really consider
just because something is familiar
doesn't mean it's a right solution to
use we may have to go out and look at
something very alien very unfamiliar but
in the end it may be the best thing ever
and we have to really give it a chance
to really accommodate it so not as a
very complex up you know problem at hand
but the solution can become really
complex so lots of a subtle unfamiliar
with functional style of programming
very familiar with imperative style of
programming but it turns out the
functional style is decorative and a lot
simpler and simpler also has fewer
moving parts in it you're not
initializing a variable incrementing the
variable repeatedly and so on you're not
messing with stuff that is variable and
changing the state it becomes a lot
easier to work with as well I'm gonna
say the third thing is not only is
simple not ever not only simple it's not
something that's necessarily familiar
but as simple is not over-engineered and
this is one of the things we do as
programmers is we often do over
engineering of what we do why do we do
over engineering because we have this
desire to create something that is
expensable they say the pathway to hell
is created on good intentions we want to
make things extensible so what do we do
we build all this hierarchy of stuff and
in the end when it comes time to extend
it the very thing we set out really
makes it hard for us to extend our
systems that becomes really really hard
I remember one experience I had with
their developer I
looked at what he had done he took a
data from a database 250 lines of code
to convert it to XML and I'm like why
are we read through this code and I see
where this XML is going and it goes to
this other function in the application
and you can imagine what that function
did parses the XML and there'd a little
bit of word and that puts the data back
into the database I'm scratching my head
the data went from here to XML to XML to
little transformation and the database
had called the developer and said I'm
looking at this code and he said isn't
that cool it's like no it's not cool
where you can bring it to XML and
putting it back into the database he's
that van code you need to have a vision
I said what kind of vision do I not have
he said the beautiful thing about this
code I said well the word beautiful is
first questionable but nevertheless what
the meaning of this code well the beauty
of this is that the data can't go
anywhere now and the data can come from
anywhere
now I said wait wait let's look at the
application we have at our hand where
does the data come from here what does
the data go here well there's no
anywhere the data comes from here and
goes here you know no you didn't have a
vision of the future I said what kind of
vision are you looking for the future
well just I told you it can come from
anywhere it can go anywhere as he was
saying it I was fiddling with my phone
he said excuse me and I said hello I
said hello he said yes who is this I
said hey how's it going he said is that
you think it it's like yeah where are
you calling me on the phone I said you
should have a vision I could be anywhere
and talk to you now
why should I talk to you directly we
should always talk on the phone that's
stupid isn't it but that's the whole
point we have this unknown expectation
of what accessibility is and we built a
whole damn thing really complex so the
point is let's not over engineer let's
understand the problem at hand first and
solve the problem we really know well
Rube Goldberg made his name by creating
absolutely ridiculous complex solutions
in fact children in school these days
practice developing rule gourville
applications just for the fun of it to
know how they can create really complex
things I saw my children do this at home
they created extremely complex
Solutions I patted them and said I'm so
thrilled to see your teachers are
preparing for the real world because
that's what we do for a living as well
only difference is we get paid to create
this complex monsters we do so here is
an example of the backscratcher which is
extremely complex and of course a series
of events happen for this guy back to be
scratched
in all honesty almost everyone in this
room including me can point to code we
have written that is the equivalent of
this right all this magic happens on the
result eventually gets produced so we do
this quite often in creating
applications we do well simple is not
necessarily a you know terse and I want
to distinguish between the word
turns and the word concise I want the
solution to be concise not something
that is really terse for example I came
across a product I was working for this
is a client I was working with and I'm
not kidding with you a single license to
this product is a million dollars it's a
very highly intense chemical engineering
application people maintain this court
are PhDs and Chemical Engineering they
innovate and create algorithms I was
working with this client and we were
just going through a code randomly and I
and they opened a file there showed me
something they moved on I said go back
to this file and he did I said do you
mind if I take a photo of this
he said sure sure go ahead and take a
photo of it but never tell anybody where
you got this court from I said I promise
I will never tell anybody and they were
very kind for me to know take the folder
so I took the photo off that code and
here it is oh sorry that's not what I
wanted to really show you what I want to
show you was the food photo I took it is
what this line was and right below it
was this line God helped me I have no
idea what this means and and somebody
this was a developer word written this
comment in code and you can imagine
going to work every day having to
maintain that code and I think we all
relate to this very nicely right because
we see this every single day you're
looking at this coding or asking what is
this all these peoples mean because
somebody wrote this code you know people
to ask me these days what do you do for
a living
I quit telling them I'm a programmer I
tell them I'm a software archaeologist
because I go to work and try to figure
out what this code actually meant once
upon a time when they wrote it because
we can't just simply seem
figure it out so here is a little
example of a code and we can argue this
is verbose with a try and a catch and
all those good stuff maybe we should
make it really concise and you probably
see in examples like this in dotnet and
in Java and I would claim that this is
really a bad example because this is not
a concise code it's a terse piece of
code what I really want to make sure
there's a code really passes test for
one reason and the right reason this
can't actually pass for the wrong
reasons so I don't want terseness our
conciseness or cuteness to lead me in
the wrong direction anyway I would
rather use a verbose code is correct
then a concise or a terse code that is
actually incorrect and so as a result a
better way is a lot of languages are
moving in this direction where we can
actually write letters to really isolate
the code and test it separately and this
could be both concise and also correct
at the same time so we should really not
get infatuated by reducing the number of
lines of code we do that also sometimes
to say that I really want to create a
concise code well correctness is more
important than conciseness as well so
don't confuse terse code with simple
code and and concise code that's very
important well here's a code from Tony
Hoare I'm really you know pretty happy
particular per code because I really
appreciate what he says here and it says
there are two ways of constructing a
software design one way is to make it so
simple that there are obviously no
deficiencies and the other is to make it
so complicated there are no obvious
deficiencies and and we see this a lot
of times the code is so complex we don't
even know if it's broken and that can be
really really hard I remember being at a
client's site I was looking at a piece
of code doing a code review and I found
there was actually a concurrency issue
right there a variable totally
unprotected when I found as I called the
team and said hey you guys are doing
multi-threading this this particular
variable is totally unprotected multiple
threads could access this are you aware
of it and before I could finish it one
of the developers got really angry at me
and said hey wankered this code has been
in production for three years what makes
you think you can come and scare us
today tank
I didn't have to answer it before I
could say anything one of the other
developers said oh but wait a minute
every three weeks the program crashes we
don't know why and and so we could
really have problems and systems and not
even know why there are issues that we
have to deal with so okay we talked
about what is not simple simple is not
clever simple is not necessarily
familiar so simple is not
over-engineered we talked about a few
things it's not necessarily terse but we
don't want to leave without talking what
really is simple so it would be nice to
really think about what maybe is in the
range of something that is simple so
let's try that so well what is then
simple I'm gonna start by saying the
first thing probably the most important
is simple keeps us focused one of the
biggest challenges we deal with today in
the world we live in is to keep focus
the most precious thing today is
people's attention because we have so
many distractions in front of us you sit
with the code and if you're gonna take a
very long time figuring out what the
code is it is a distraction and also
very quickly we get add into things how
many have you sat down with the problem
and two hours later you have really
gotten to the real problem because
you've been distracted so many times
along the way and this can be really
really hard in what we do let's talk
about an example of focus if you will so
let's say we are working on a particular
piece of code and you're not sure
exactly what function to call so what is
the most logical thing to do today do
you would say do don't you just search
for it well it makes sense I want to
quickly search for it maybe I don't know
what function to call maybe I will just
go and do a quick search for it well of
course to do the search I need to bring
up the browser so here we go let me
bring up the browser and do the search
for it really quickly and oh wait
Trump isn't real trouble yet again this
man is unstoppable do you think that you
feel that way to my goodness it's pretty
interesting how things are
oh there's about something about Norway
here how regular people can become rich
in Norway how curious you actually click
on that link
how to become rich normal people can
become rich this is I mean awesome let's
you know what just happened right I went
to search for an API and totally got
derailed this is a problem where the
search box is right there but I didn't
even look at the search box I got
completely hijacked and 20 minutes later
I'm like what APA was they working on
well okay maybe that's something we
should really rethink about it let's try
a game maybe I shouldn't use that who
searched for that reason let's use Bing
hey that's a beautiful
Wow look at that form land that's really
awesome little green patches you know
some of them are Squires some of them
are circles
I just often see them and I'm on a
flight very interesting I kind of wonder
where this farmland is from I want to
search for it I'm really really scared
because that may take me in a vicious
cycle another picture may show up you
know let's try this one more time here
is Google and what is Google say what
are you here for the search well then
search there is nothing else nothing
else I can do do you think this was
really simple there day this Mac can you
imagine just close your eyes and think
about this day the guy walks up to his
boss and says I have created the search
page let me see it and he shows the
search page and the boss says yeah
really what is it
what where stuff yeah that's it in fact
I put a button called I feel lucky well
you should feel lucky to have a job
honestly folks how many of us in this
room will have courage to create this
the words courage in that how many of us
will have the courage to create this and
say that's it I am NOT going to distract
the user right behind that click is
enormous complexity of servers and cloud
and algorithms and machine learning and
you can put more terms to it but I'm not
gonna push any of that complexity to the
users who came here to search how many
of us use Google there's a reason for it
right because you value something very
important to you which is your time your
focus
and that is the reason we go there every
single day because it says mind your
business what are you here for if you're
here for searching about what Trump said
or if you want to know how to get get
quick in Norway I got a news for you
search for that I am NOT going to
distract you by giving stuff that is not
relevant to you and to me that is
something extremely critical extremely
valuable and I have one word for that
kind of simplicity it is called
respect you are respecting Heward users
and I value that kind of respect because
you are saying I value your time I value
your focus I'm gonna get you what you
are here for and not distract you from
that and that is exactly what we need to
do when we create our api's how many
times have you looked at your API where
the function says in p1 in p2 and p3 and
you're like God helped me here what are
these three ins mean I don't have a clue
I have to search for a documentation at
this point so keeping the focus is
incredibly powerful
here's another wonderful quote
perfection is achieved not when there is
nothing more to add but when there when
there is nothing left to take away what
if we can remove all the clutter from
around us all the things that distract
and take over focus and so we can come
down to the bare minimum that will keep
over focus and get our work done I would
say in all respect that is simplicity
and I want to go towards that so
simplicity eliminates accidental
complexity and hides the apparent
complexity from us so we can manage our
day's work and focus on what we do the
next thing is simple fails less simple
actually fails a lot less now let's take
one little exercise here this is a
manhole and it's a circular in size
we've all seen this as we walk through
the streets we see this all the time I
could ask you the question why is this
circular in its shape and pretty readily
most of us would probably say oh it's
circular because
it is not going to fall in and the
circle fits really nicely with the
circle that answer is correct but there
is actually always the rest of the story
to every story isn't it
so yes you are right its circle and it
won't fall in but let's step back for a
minute you can do this as an exercise
send out a request for Proposal and tell
your work of consultants and your
companies to say build me something that
is going to not fall in I will bet you
very few will come with the circle you
know why because you cannot charge them
more if it is really simple and most
likely the solutions you will come up
with these different solutions you know
why because each one of them also have
the property they will not fall in as
well and so the chances are the designs
you will see will not be as simple as
that
because the design satisfies the
requirement things don't fall in and
every one of them don't fall in also so
that is yet another reason why circle is
really awesome these things don't fall
into so why can't we just use any of
these there's a very important reason
why we don't want any of these because
at the end of a very long day if you
have a beam coming out of that hole and
the last person who comes out says dude
how do we put this on this particular
lid on this just roll the damn thing
let's go home is a really good answer a
circle fits in any direction you roll it
in that's not true with any of these
other shapes as well so the simplicity
has yet another meaning to it
it fails really less it doesn't matter
how you roll it it becomes really easy
to roll it on it so it's very easy to
understand easy to work with and I
remember this I was I had worked the
entire night I had work absolutely
entire night I know it was very unsafe
for me to drive this morning but I was
driving that morning and I was running
out of gasoline on my car so I pulled
over to fill the gasoline and I was so
tired I could barely keep my eyes open I
the nozzle and I'm trying to insert into
my car it just would not work and after
about a minute or so I'm almost in tears
now because I'm so tired I said why
wouldn't this work oh I don't even know
how to fill up gasoline let me stop and
think and that's when I found out I had
pulled over to a diesel station my car
was not diesel
can you imagine had they not prevented
me from filling diesel into my car I
would have had a broken car that morning
and I said awesome you guys really did
excellent in your design because fool
like me was promoted from damaging the
car today and I can't think about how
many ways we can prevent people from
failing simple really helps us to fail a
lot less as well as simple is elegant
you want elegance as well when you
develop things and why is this the most
famous picture ever created it's a
picture of a lady not a whole lot and
that is the beauty right the beauty is
not what's in here the beauty is not
what's not in here
no clutter no unnecessary details the
beauty the beauty the elegance the
simplicity comes from the lack of
clutter in here and this reminds me of
an experience I had I was in Boston if
you ever go to Boston I would encourage
you to do this I was in Boston and I was
walking through downtown Boston I was
mesmerized by by a particular building
and I came across this church called the
Trinity Church and I stood there and I
kept staring at the church until my wife
said she's gonna call the cops if I
don't move because I was just absolutely
stuck and I said I would not leave I'm
gonna admire write it well what's so
beautiful about this church honestly
there's not a whole lot beautiful about
this church personally but what I really
was miss price is not this church but
there was a building next to this church
called the Jane Hank Hancock building
and when the architect of this building
wanted to build this construction the
city of Boston said heck no because if
you build here the beauty of the church
will go down and the architect
challenged the city and said no I'm
gonna build it here and when I am done I
will not even touch the church but
the beauty of the church will only be
enhanced and so he did and that's what
really mesmerized me because I was
standing next to the Jane Hancock
building
my camera doesn't do a good justice to
this picture but if you ever go you will
be absolutely amazed as I was because
the reflection of the church from the
glasses of the building is just
amazingly beautiful so he built it in an
angle where the church is reflected by
this building and you could just scan
there and I have to say it's much more
beautiful to look at the reflection than
the church itself and that again is an
example of how you could actually build
something very simple and at the same
time get really aesthetic results out of
it as well so but it turns out we can be
all desirous to create something like
this but it actually takes time to
evolve towards simplicity simplicity is
not something we're going to sit down
and create it in one shot as Richard
Fineman said if you cannot explain
something to a first-year student then
you haven't really understood it and
that's one of my experiences is when I'm
working with something very complex I
find it really hard to explain and this
is one of the reasons why you always
want to create something then sit down
and try to explain it to somebody and
that's when you really figure out what
you've created is actually really a
monster and not something really simple
this reminds me of an experience our
compressor says if you have two equally
likely solutions to a problem you better
want to choose the one that is the
simpler one and I was writing this book
on functional programming in Java and as
I was writing this book I got the
excitement to write about maybe tail
call optimization
well paint color optimization doesn't
exist in Java it doesn't exist in Java
today but I still had this desire to
show how to do tail call optimization I
had wrecked through some really really
good books for example one is the
structure and perdition of computer
programs and this book they show how to
build tail call optimization they talk
about process and procedures and how the
optimization can be done and I have
programmed in languages like Clojure and
Scala and F sharp and groovy
and I have seen how tail call
optimization is done in these languages
some languages do it the compiler level
some language do with the library level
I said to myself if they can do it I can
do it too and I wasted two precious days
of my life doing nothing but creating
that example and when I did I got down
to writing a code kind of like this
don't worry about the details of the
code and I spent 10 more hours after the
two days
so pretty much I wasted three days of my
life and I came up with that code
example but if you look at this example
of the code right in the middle of it is
a wild exclamation call completed
current equals current apply and then it
is doing the looping it looks reasonable
wrong what's wrong with this what's
wrong with this is until the page before
this page in the book I kept telling the
readers avoid mutability avoid
mutability avoid mutability and I come
to this example and guess what I am
doing
mutating and I spent another day trying
to remove this mutation from this code
and for the life of me I couldn't figure
out and then I came up with what I
thought was a brilliant solution and the
brilliant solution was to put this code
on the book and say a footnote that's a
deal reader do you see I'm using
mutability turning this code to use non
mutability is left as an exercise for
the reader this 120 years ago because
you could write a book and you can hide
and nobody would ever find you in the
world of Twitter's and Facebook we can't
do this anymore
because the first time somebody reads
that they're gonna say oh yeah can you
share with you with me your solution
after all busted then I thought ok maybe
I'll change this answer a little bit
dear later do you see me using
mutability avoid me liberty in all cases
except when you cannot and that didn't
go well i said i realized finally after
two days of work another two days a
world i came to this very grim solution
and sometimes is the hardest of things
to ever realize and i said to myself my
code simply say
and I just left it and said never mind I
will not solve this problem now and then
I was on the treadmill a week later away
from the problem I was just you know
thinking about something else and slowly
a little thread in my mind just thinking
about this problem and immediately I did
downtown me I said oh my gosh I can
reimagine infinite series problem and
immediately I charted out of the
treadmill ran to my desk and in ten
minutes I had a solution working solving
this as an infinite stream problem and
so notice in this case what I've done as
I said stream iterate and then of course
filter fine first and because of lazy
evaluation we can actually solve
problems like this without mutability
sometimes it takes a lot of time to
really realize there is actually a
simpler solution and oftentimes that's
when you are away from the computer when
you're taking that beautiful hike around
the mountains are you're trying to
really do your chores and do your dishes
is when you really figure out solutions
when you're you mind this complex it
gets tangled in a problem you spend
three hours and getting frustrated and
then you walk away and 20 minutes later
you're like gosh why didn't I think of
that solution and that's the fascination
of the complexity of her brain is we are
so beautiful we are so clever and yet we
are so stupid I all in the same body
that we carry around isn't it it's just
amazing that we can actually do that so
Einstein said of course everything
should be made simple as possible but
not any simpler but I always wonder when
I create something have it created
something simple and somebody else looks
at my code and says but why didn't you
do this and I'm like oh of course why
didn't I think of that and now I have a
simpler solution than I had thought
about and the fellow developer comes and
makes it simpler for me that's one of
the reasons why I like people looking at
my code like people looking at what I do
because they help me remove the
complexity that my mind puts into it and
I do the same thing for others too when
I look at their code I can help them
make things simpler for them as well so
is what I create a simple or is it
really complex and I think that
simplicity is kinda like the
Schrodinger's cat
so lotion we create is simple and
complex at the same time it is simple
for what we know right now but it could
be simpler when somebody else maybe
comes along and removes certain burdens
we carry with us so this is one of the
challenges we deal with every single day
we want to really remove the
complexities especially the accidental
complexities that we come across
we should really put the effort to
remove it and simple makes things really
easy but as it turns out it's not easy
to make things simple at all it is
something that takes a lot of effort to
really make things simple it takes
effort but also don't forget it also
takes courage to make things simple
things simple too often times we get
ridiculed for making things simple you
need to stand up and have the courage to
make things simple as well as da Vinci
Perret I'm gonna end by saying
simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication in life and that is true
for programming as well every bit of
effort we put in to make things simple
is actually well worth it hope that was
