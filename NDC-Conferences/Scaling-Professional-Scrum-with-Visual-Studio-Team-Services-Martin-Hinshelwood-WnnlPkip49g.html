little bit of a strange character I've
been
here to show you before I used to work
for
SSW for Adam Cogan I think I lasted
about eight months it was a fun gig and
then I went to the States to work with
Steven Bargh
Northwest cadence and then I came back
to Scotland which is where I live to
start my own company so I am a visual
studio ALM MVP so I worked with
Microsoft a lot but I'm also a scrum
trainer with scrum dot-org
now that's actually a pretty unusual
combination worldwide because most of
the tools guys really hate the process
guys and the process guys really hate
the tools guys there's a little bit of a
contention there but like I said I'm
from this little place above England
that most people call England but it's
actually another place called Scotland
unfortunately we have a little bit of an
issue just now I don't know if anybody's
seen their current political situation
but it's kind of a little bit like this
yeah it's not good and did anybody see
how the votes went broken up with the
concession seize did you see how many
constituencies in Scotland voted to
leave not a single one but most of
England did actually London wants to
break away from England now as well
that's pretty interesting
but this actually there's interesting
for me everybody's been asking about it
which is why I put it in there but my
business is very I do very little
business in the UK I travel around
around the world lots of different
customers some large customers that are
everywhere and it's an interesting
situation so what I find happens most of
the time is we want this thing called
scrum anybody here doing scrum okay are
you doing professional scrum you think
you're doing professional strong I've
seen your scrum so what we we start with
is we're doing this we start with scrum
yeah we follow the rules there's a
little rule book anybody read the scrum
guide it's like the rule book if you
were bought monopoly you don't expect it
to come with a strategy guide you expect
it to come with a rulebook
so a couple of real book and then you
can add whatever strategies make sense
for your organization your culture you
can use Kanban to help formulate your
process change stuff but scrums just a
framework to help you get started is it
a unicorn for you guys because what the
scrum end up like Emily no so the most
crumbs I see end up like a little bit of
a car wreck nobody was injured in the
making of this shot by the way so we're
missing something and one of the things
we're missing is technical excellence
we're missing that technical excellence
in a lot of organizations now we're
trying we're adding this thing called
DevOps used to be called ALM no it's
called DevOps who cares what the word is
yeah it's a set of practices that we can
choose to do or not to help us achieve
the goal which is working software as
quickly as possible let me know what the
what scrum kind of mandate says the
maximum amount of time it should take
you to build working software 30 days
you should be creating working software
and getting it in front of your
customers at least every 30 days that
doesn't mean you can't ship more
frequently if you want to ship every day
that's ok too but at least every 30 days
but to get there man you can't just make
that happen
we've got complicated software we're
going to need to get feedback from our
stakeholders we're going to need usage
monitoring we're going to need
continuous delivery and continuous
integration and all the other DevOps
practices automated testing if you've
got to do six weeks of automated tests
can you deliver working software in 30
days no so we've got to get there so
that's one of the things that's missing
but anybody been implementing DevOps or
what people call DevOps
okay if we just find another another
unicorn but this is a better unicorn
executives love this unicorn because
this unicorn gives us something extra
and we're eating it up and we're giving
it to our team
and they're expected to just run with it
but that's not everything
did you notice on my diagram there's
another space we need values and
principles we need some guidance to help
us in choices we make if we've got a
piece of software that we've been
working on for the last 30 days and we
haven't quite managed to get all the
tests finished should we ship it to
production simple tests these are the
core values and principles in scrum laid
out in the scrum guide the scrum guide
didn't actually include the values and
principles explicitly up until two weeks
ago there's a big update two weeks ago
big announcement and they've added the
men is shipping software that hasn't
been tested to your to your customer
respectful to your customer is it open
and transparent about what's in your
software and how it works no so we
shouldn't be doing it do you want your
organization and your people and your
culture to embody these values or the
opposite of these values because I sure
want these values in my teams and teams
I work with and I don't know any
organization which that would say hell
no we don't want respect we want to put
people down as much as possible but it
is there in your organization does your
development teams have the courage to
say no to customers that are asking for
things that are just not physically
possible do you make guarantees to your
customers that you'll be able to deliver
software that doesn't exist yet to the
features they require on-time and
on-budget is that respectful to them to
their business the risks that they take
this is important it's a big deal so we
kind of need three things we need three
things to create that professional scrum
team that I mentioned at the start
rather than that scrum dot org likes to
call them amateur scrum teams I usually
use the word mechanical
Grum teams Ken likes flaccid scrum teams
but they're just Cowboys
they're just Cowboys so if we want
professional teams we need some sort of
process you can actually replace the
word scrum with the word Kanban as it
applies to software teams or anything
else so they're scrubs just the most
common thing that people are doing
we then need technical excellence and we
need values and principles to make
decisions by to help guide us to doing
the right thing but that's awesome for
one team now we've got our professional
team though we can think about scaling
because what happens if you take five
teams of cowboys and try and put them
together and build one piece of software
anybody got that scenario in the office
doesn't end up well we don't get good
software but if we've got professional
teams we can start scaling but again we
need a little bit of guidance we've got
scrum to help guide a scrum team but
don't we need more communication if we
have more scrum teams working together
more teams of people we don't want
things falling through the cracks might
we have integration and dependencies
between the teams we're creating one
piece of working software at the end and
if we have five teams working together
how do we guarantee at the end of 30
days we have one piece of working
software it's hard so we kind of need
some extra help scrum a dork has been
using a framework for quite a while now
called the Nexus framework which is
using scrum to scale scrum this is the
same diagram as before
we've just added some extra points of
communication and things that have to
happen the minimum things that have to
happen to main communication is this
everything no we still need continuous
integration we need all of those DevOps
practices we need to test automation we
need all of those things but we've got
some things I usually call them team of
teams are you familiar with another two
who are the right people
your team of teams is what I usually get
it's whoever turns up yeah are the right
people
same as open space rules whoever turns
up for the right people and we're gonna
have to get together before our sprint
planning and have a discussion about
integration and dependencies team send
representatives all of the places where
you see Nexus Nexus daily scrum before
the retrospective after the
retrospective it's a group of people
that are representatives of this
community of developers that come
together discuss dependencies problems
issues bring that knowledge back to the
rest of the team because the teams have
to deal with it what happens if you
create a semi to have a separate dev ops
team here who's responsible for
integration and build and all of those
things nobody do you know what happens
if you have that if you do anybody here
have kids right you clean up the room
for them or do they make you make them
clean them up clean it up
what are they less likely to have then
or they have to clean it up make a mess
developers need to clean up their own
mess
need to sort out their own problems they
need to be responsible and held
responsible and accountable for
delivering working software at the end
of every iteration to do that they're
going to need help
so you might have some kind of
integration team you might call it a
DevOps team or you might call it a build
team or whatever you call it within your
organization but that team is not
responsible and accountable for doing
the work they're a team of coaches and
mentors who have understanding of DevOps
they might be another team of teams yeah
they might not be full-time I was
speaking earlier to some of the guys I
work with customers that have 70 teams
working in nine different countries on
the same product they have a dedicated
team to help with that and that team
helps the other teams understand why the
build was broken to figure out of the 70
teams who actually broke the build
helped them figure out how to fix it
they very rarely fix it four of those
teams legal help them figure out how to
fix it themselves but it's difficult
there's a good temptation to do it
yourself
but we need these extra moments where we
can get together and communicate and in
order to to manage this we maybe need
some extra help anybody here use
stickies on a whiteboard to manage their
scrum process I do that's the best way
to manage and monitor your scrum process
a digital tool is not the best way
however if you've got teams across
multiple locations you're kind of stuck
how do you know what's going on how do
you get transparency across multiple
countries we need to put our data
somewhere and for that we need tools
most of my customers being that I'm in
ALM MVP I'm going to using TFS or vs TS
I always recommend vs TS unless there's
another reason and vs TS supports Nexus
and many other frameworks and we can
have multiple agile teams inside of a
single team project so we're not talking
about collections a single team project
inside a collection for TFS or a single
team project inside a can account for vs
TS and I can have one or more teams
inside that team project but what I
might want to do is have another team
inside of TFS that kind of looks at
everything I want to see one unified
backlog for everything that's going on
and I want to iterate on that backlog as
I I have one product owner who needs to
see a view of the whole thing but then
my product owner might roll up to the
rest of product management and I need to
understand how portfolio works in that
situation I might be managing my
investments that break down into things
that are going to end up on my backlog
as they get closer to time the refine
to action and they end up on the teams
backlog yeah if you're using the STS
write or TFS correctly you pick the
scrum template as your default if you
pick the agile template that's fun it's
not very agile you can read my blog for
the issues I have with that I always
recommend the scrum template to start
with so we have a work item called a
product backlog item that product
backlog item is your backlog both at the
law level and the unified level we have
backlog items they break down into tasks
these are the execution items that the
team are going to execute against this
is the plan that the teams are going to
use to execute those items but if we're
rolling up to portfolio we might have
features and in fact out of the box in
the sts you'll have feature sitting
there as well yeah you don't have to use
it in fact I would recommend if you can
get away with not using it don't use it
but if you have to have it have it so
what we can do then is we can have our
many teams backlogs we can have our kind
of parent portfolio team that sees the
full backlog or is looking at features
here and I can take one of those
features and I can break it down in a
bunch of backlog items put it on the
backlog for the teams for them to pull
from each team's going to pool items
into their sprints but they need to know
what they can pull from so we can put
those things on the team's backlog for
them to pull them into the sprint and we
can have a link between those items back
to the feature so you as a product owner
or your product management can go and
look at an item and see what this items
in progress how in progress is it open
it out oh there's 20 PBIS five of them
are assigned to a team two of them are
in progress the other ones are on a
team's backlog awesome there's some
stuff going on it's been started or it's
been finished or what's left to do get
an understanding of that and obviously
you can have multiple things each thing
on your backlog broken down
saying to the teams now one thing that's
coming in vs TS that's not quite there
yet but isn't more advanced in TFS are
more advanced it's the old way of doing
things you can have more customizations
in TFS right now they're bringing a lot
of those customizations to V STS but you
might need more levels if you have a
very large organization and you have
people that are managing at the epic
level big things that can't even fit in
a release and they get broken down into
features things that can fit in their
release but can't fit in a sprint all
the way down to PBIS that are things
that can fit in a sprint we need to
manage that all the way up and there may
be different people managing those
backlogs hopefully there's alignment and
the more backlogs you have the more on
fusion you have from the idea at the top
and the execution at the bottom which is
bad minimize your hierarchy and what you
get out of the box although we said we
only see feature you can go into the
options and you can tick the box too
short epic so out of the box in V STS
you get epic feature product backlog
item and task that's a lot of hierarchy
you can have more I would say don't
the only reason Microsoft implemented
seven levels of hierarchy is because
they had teams internally that we're
doing that is it a good idea nor are
they doing it the same way no no that
was Microsoft of 2005 Microsoft of 2016
is very agile so we've got our standard
DevOps cycle that you've seen in every
talk about DevOps
you have development or deployment
opsahl feedback into the backlog and
then we're going to iterate on this team
backlog to make it as powerful as
possible rolling up to our product
backlog iterating on that rolling up to
portfolio iterating on that the plan is
created over time and we have some way
to
H that and understand what's going on
and that lets us rule up to this idea of
Nexus that was a bad noise okay so any
questions on the Nexus framework because
what I'm going to dive into is how you
go implement that in the STS yes so the
again I would say it's whoever turns up
as the right people if you think about
if I'm doing some pre work around
analyzing dependencies before my sprint
planning meeting of the team's go off
and do their own sprint planning meeting
I probably need my product owner I
probably need representatives from the
team which representatives so you need
maybe depends on the Sprint goals maybe
depends on what work you're doing just
now who's the most knowledgeable in
those areas yeah so I see it both ways
it can be a fixed group of people there
are a hundred percent dedicated it can
be a fixed group of people that just are
full-time members of the team and do
that as well yeah or it can be
interchangeable too we want to spread
that knowledge within the team and can
the testers bring something to our
DevOps pipeline sure because we would
test surround a vote pipeline we've get
automation who's the right people this
sprint who the right people at this time
to turn up at that event that makes
sense
yeah sure so I have a single unified
product backlog for my product owner
that's where things are ordered when I
go into my Nexus planning meeting I
probably want to understand what's going
to be maybe in the pool of work so well
it's a single list I might want to look
at what's in the pull of work for this
team versus that team because while we
want teams of feature teams that are
generalists quite often we've got
specialist teams I work with a team in
Norway and they have teams multiple
teams that build hydrodynamic models of
ships that run inside a simulator the
guys that build the cranes that sit on
oil rigs and ships inside of the
simulator can't go build those models
and these guys can't go build the cranes
they have everybody on their team they
need to build those features in those
areas but cross skilling is very
expensive because these guys all have
PhDs and hydrodynamics and these guys
understand control systems and control
runs and electrics very different skill
sets yeah so it depends what type of
software you're building make sense cool
any other questions
cool so what I want to do is show you
some things ways to configure that
inside of V STS I'm going to use the
out-of-the-box VST s functionality
mainly because you can do other
customizations inside of TFS that you
can't do in VST s so what I'm going to
show can be applied to both okay
so ever account called practical devops
inside of V STS and in there I have our
demo project with multiple teams set up
so if I open this project and hopefully
the internet gods will be on my site and
here is my portfolio project my
portfolio my portfolio team so this is
the team that has set as a default team
for the team project so when I go in I
see stuff that maybe the team doesn't
necessarily care about but somebody
looking at the big picture might care
about so here I'm seeing at the amount
of effort total amount of effort inside
the team backlogs so they've got
compartmentalize maybe we've already
decided upfront which team might do it
maybe we've not but we've get things
scrum dogs has 22 effort points
currently sitting in their backlog and
one bug one point worth of bug I might
be looking at the value here and all
those Grum dogs have only 22 effort
points they have the highest amount of
value in the items and their backlog so
maybe I'm going to look at how much
value each team is producing and then
I've got just work items by type so
they've get four items that make up all
of that value so it gives me some
understanding of what's going on who's
working on what it really high-level
just because it's a little value doesn't
mean it's not worth anything order and
priority are different from value I've
get test results trends because I'm
interested in that as a product owner I
would hope quality is important to me
I've also got in sprint how many tests
are not run past feeling and I'm not
sure what that word is blocked so I can
see that I've only got a few test pasts
there's 24 tests they'll not been run so
depending on where you are in your
sprint cycle might depend on whether
that's a good sign or a bad sign
how are things going just an indicator
for open bugs that's bad it's not zero
Emily have more than zero bugs in their
system at the end of a sprint
try and get to zero it's hard I work
with orgs that they have a rule that all
bugs must be closed by the end of the
Sprint so if that means we don't get
back clog items done because we end up
spending more time on bugs that's fine
as zero bugs that we know about should
be left in the system though they do
have exceptions to that anybody Adam
session earlier rules are for the
guidance of wise men and the obedience
of fools I would say don't have any bugs
but then reality comes to the party that
makes sense there is a dashboard for
that group I just created that quickly
I've got an overview dashboard I can add
multiple dashboards to that things that
they care about from different
perspectives okay no this is backlog so
I'm looking at the entire backlog what
we've got in there and how much effort
and value and then it's already been
compartmentalized to the team but if you
see something in there that's the same
name as the team project
maybe it's off the bottom there because
there's it would mean it's not assigned
to anybody yet there's a little trick in
V STS there's a new field called node
name node name is the lowest level area
path value so that you don't have to
have the area path here you can have the
lowest node name which is usually your
team and then you can filter by team you
can do stuff by team yeah makes it super
easy so if I go to my work I'm gonna
look at my backlog I have a backlog but
a whole bunch of stuff in it the thing
there's about 200 things in this backlog
not all of them are assigned out
assigned out is the wrong word I'm not
assigning work to teams I'm putting
things on a team's backlog ie their poo
list they're not gonna pull from the
main backlog they're gonna pull from
what the product owner says are good
things for them to maybe go work on
maybe they want something else that's ok
they can go ask and negotiate all of
those things here you can see I've got
both effort and business value allocated
to these backlog
and bugs and obviously I can easily just
go drag them around on the back lock now
I can hide things in progress which is
what I normally do by default because
what happens when the team selects items
forecast the items that they're going to
do inside of a sprint the team is taking
those things from the product owner and
we'll see what we get at the end of the
Sprint so I'm gonna hide those things
because I don't really care about them
once the team started them I'll care
about them at the end but not in in the
middle and it means that I can very
easily or hopefully very easily turn off
the forecast button turn on the forecast
button and the STS will nicely draw
little lines where the amount of points
in here add up to as close to 30 as it
can get and that's just an arbitrary
number 30 actually defaults to 10 I've
obviously changed it to 30 but if my
team if I look in here the team that the
the org took one hundred and three story
points last sprint don't worry that they
didn't manage to deliver it's a fake
project but if I'm going into sprint 2
maybe I'm looking at changing that to a
hundred and then I'm looking down my
left and seeing sprint force can I gonna
get to their where it spent 5 going to
get to sprint six just to give me an
idea helps me forecast I used that word
very specifically forecast yeah it's
like the weather it might change it
might change significantly that it was a
forecast of rain today what was the
percentage likelihood it's gonna be 60%
rain
it rained well it was 100 percent but we
didn't know that up front so we've got
this backlog gonna term forecasting off
that's a tool to use I used to see
product owners print out their backlog
and then draw lines on it as they were
adding it up it's a lot easier but we
need that single backlog to be able to
do that single unified backlog but here
I'm rolling up two features so if I go
to features I can get a here's my list
of features here's my priorities my
order for my features which might be
based on priority
maybe be some value maybe based on this
customer screaming a lot that's okay
that's my prerogative as product
management to order it any way I like
and I can go into this item and I can
open out and I can see well this item
said is new but one items already been
committed by a team I know it uses the
word committed I use the word forecast I
just translate the tool says Kim
committee because it's based on the old
scrum guide and I've get two items that
I've already looked at and approved and
put on a team's backlog to go look at
and breakdown so this item this feature
is not actually new is currently in
progress so I'm going to save and close
that and now I can see that that item is
in progress and that would be something
I'm going to go look at at a higher
level that make sense my data wasn't up
to date that's gonna happen just deal
with it when you find it it's not
necessarily a bad thing okay so yes you
can prioritize in here although my mouse
is doing something weird but I can drag
it and reprioritize it no it will not
and I would not expect it to nor would I
want it to I might have a different
person prioritizing this backlog I am an
executive who looks at feature level I'm
ordering my features that's my intent
I'm going to talk to the product owner
and say this is my intent for when we
want the features and the product owner
might look at that intent and then order
the backlog items using that as an extra
piece of information along with
everything else they already know
including talking to the team and what's
physically viable
yep not in this view so if I trying oh
yes I did I can't this is the problem
with a product that's delivered
regulated production is this features
you didn't know were there that you've
asked for that then appear in the
product just to know that the VST s team
delivered to production every three
weeks and I've have missed one
deployment in the last two years and it
was this Christmas and the whole company
or the whole team had two weeks off at
Christmas and the product owner decided
they didn't make enough to bother
shipping that sprint that was the only
one they didn't do so it was a choice
not forced into it by not having working
software so yes you can
yeah and these features roll up again to
epic so I have a much fewer number of
epic so I have lots of backlog items
that can fit in the sprint fewer
features that fit in a release and even
less epics which are the strategic
direction we're trying to achieve with
the product as you can see unless you
speak if you spoke Latin you would
understand my strategy direction I'm
trying to achieve here and again I can
drill down all the way down in fact I
can drill although we don't into the
tasks but I would never recommend that
because as a product owner why do I care
about the team's tasks okay
that's awesome we've just talked about
one team that's how one team does
portfolio management but generally you
don't have portfolio management for just
one team you need multiple teams so what
I can do here is I have multiple teams
already set up let me go into the admin
system and it's changed a little bit if
you're using TFS this will be slightly
different and oh my goodness me that's
huge that's better so I have a number of
teams set up I've get the default team
which disappears it just ends up being
the same name as a team project at the
top of the screen and then I have a
bunch of other teams each of those teams
owns an area path
okay then we can assign work items to an
area path to allow us to
compartmentalize by default if I create
a new team and create the NDC Sidney
team it's going to create an area path
add it to the contributors and I'll have
that new area path automatically for
that team so if I put work in that area
path so when the work item set it to
that area path it will appear on that
team's backlog if I don't set it to that
it will not appear on their backlog yes
that allows me to compartmentalize
between teams if I go to work this is
the bit that will be slightly different
for you I can choose what that team sees
so this team is an execution team it's
not a portfolio team I might actually
have multiple levels of portfolio teams
I have customers that do that as well if
I have multiple levels of portfolio
teams I might end up with a bunch of
teams roll up to a certain product of
the Omni works and multiplex that is
rolls up to about organizational
portfolio all in one team project okay
but I wanted to keep things a little bit
simpler so I just have one product in
here so this team doesn't really care
about features so I can go to that take
out but they're not not going to see
that features tab I don't really care to
go in there I want to look at PBIS
that's what I'm executing against okay
and if I go to iterations this is the
bit that's changed slightly so if you've
seen it before it's a little different I
can see what iterations they can see so
this is a little bit annoying in the new
interface I know I've asked the team
because we need to go all the way to
four to get the next sprint because
three is the current sprint go okay so
they're going to see those Sprint's on
the left-hand side if I don't want them
to see sprint one anymore
I can just click on it and remove it and
they maybe don't care too much about
history you'd maybe go a couple of
Sprint's back and then you don't care
anymore because that's the past nobody
cares about the past and then I look at
iterations and iterations
this team owns that iteration any work
under that iteration will be shown by
the team if the team if you're set
looking at the team's UI and you create
a new work item it will automatically go
into that area path yes or if they
create a new backlog item which they may
do if they're breaking stuff up it's
automatically on their backlog at Matt
Kenny makes sense but if I wanted to I
can add multiple things into that they
might look at NDC Sydney and months
behind so they all then see stuff on
their backlog that's in both of those
areas okay so at the team level single
team it's super easy it just sets up
like that out of the box we add our
sprints it's fine but if I go to the
root team the default team oh no it's
not quite the default team
well the Internet's a little bit slower
in this country than it is last time I
did this demo was in Norway I can see it
again if you want much faster when I'm
at home as well
so if I go to areas you can see this
team the default team owns a single area
path which is the route but they have a
special model modifier sub areas are
included if I roll over it go here I can
say either exclude sub areas or keep sub
areas if I screw it up sub areas this
team will only see stuff that is
directly assigned to that area path and
not any of the sub area paths so the
teams I might want to do that I might
want to just look at the view for a
little while with just that smaller list
or I might want to add it back and see
everything that's going on that make
sense for every day cool which I'm part
owner or so who's configuring this all
right so it depends on your product
owner for sure and in some companies I
work with product owner ones less some
companies yeah you don't want the
product owner to own that and maybe I an
admin owns that or a developer who's got
the admin hat on to configure it for
them or they call me and I come and do
it for them it just it just depends yeah
and if you've got that but when so when
you've got 70 teams it's not really one
team just usually maybe the integration
team next somebody on the next
integration team that does this somebody
on your DevOps build team in the big
organization I work with it's the DevOps
build team that handle all of the admin
ok so I can now switch between teams if
I switch to my brand new team that I
just created which hopefully that won't
take too long don't window and I go to
my NDC Sydney team
we won't have features and epics because
we turn to them off
we do have sprint 3 but we don't have
sprint 1 on we have sprint for that's
the ones we specified and we get nothing
in our backlog yeah so if I now add
something to my backlog it's defaulted
to not being in an iteration it's still
in the root iteration path but it's
inside the NDC Sydney team path this is
the NDC Sydney team so it's adding to
their backlog but if I go to the RIP
team and let me find some stuff that's
assigned to the Ritz the RIP team root
team did that change yeah let's just do
those two things I'm gonna right click
Edit
okay now I go to NDC Sydney and those
things file they're on the master
backlog in a particular place or now on
the teams backlog so I can create a
backlog for that team that they can then
pull from in order to either do
refinement or pull it into a sprint yes
so when I created the the question was
the fact when I created something on the
M on the the the teams backlog where did
it go on the parent backlog yes so it
went right to the bottom would be the
answer to that went right to the bottom
because the product owner is not
prioritized it so where else should it
go is it more important than other
things they've not determined that yet
but if I then this is there's a little
bit of a weirdness here now because if I
take that item and put it in there it's
now between those items on the parent
backlog but we're between those items
well somewhere yeah every every work
item gets a big number in the in the
ordered list so you're not changing a
whole bunch of stuff when you drag
things around and it will just pick a
number in between I think it justifies
it by two does some sort of modular
thing so you don't get clashes and
sticks it in there so it will just be
somewhere between those two items and
the product of all what's this thing oh
I need to order that because that's
something this team's ID'd I agree and
the TFS team have been looking at ways
to solve that one way to solve that is
you're not allowed to see something on
two backlogs but that then makes it
difficult to do some kinds of work if
everybody knows about this then you can
mitigate for it and agree as a team as
an axis just as a team a scrum team let
the team decide how do you want to
figure that out I usually say let the
Nexus decide how they want to figure it
out agree with the product owner and how
are they going to deal with that yeah we
can just not drag and drop at this level
and let the product owner do it or
whatever makes sense
so if I go to one of my other teams that
have a little bit more on it should have
a little bit more on it there we go and
a whole bunch of stuff committed by the
team broken down into backlog items now
I can open that item and I can gain
context because this item has a parent
yeah
which has a parent and I can see those
things in here if I turn parents on at
the team level even though I don't have
the backlogs listed to go in and order
them for features and for epics I can
see that this backlog item is part of
this epic but it's not a sign to my team
if it's a square with an empty bit in
the middle it's not on your team so that
makes sense
cool so you get some visibility not just
down from the product management level
but from the team looking up how do I
get context and there's probably other
things that are associated with this
item so if I open it up I can go in and
see it's get for PBIS as children and
maybe one of them is assigned to another
team so maybe I have to go speak to that
team because they've committed to it in
the current sprint and we're both
working on the same feature we need to
organize that work that's the
integration work we've just got to
figure out
okay so if I click on the sprint ah I
don't have anything in that sprint let
me go back to that clog and put some
stuff in there one of the things that we
need to be able to see from a product
management perspective is what's in the
sprint backlog
if each team's doing something
independently we can't go get a holistic
view of all the things that are
currently underway
maybe the integration team the Nexus
integration team needs to look at that
your DevOps team needs to understand
what's going on so if I drag some of
these items into three
keine arbitrarily I know but demo from
Strom dogs and then I change over to our
NDC and they're gonna do some of these
items when I look at my sprint as the
NDC team I only see the things that I
see in my sprint that's what I want to
see yeah stuff I'm gonna go work on so
if I go look at my boards if I go look
at my Kanban I look at my scrum boards I
looked at my capacity it's all about me
my team and I can create dashboards for
just my stuff there's not really a way
to easily control those permissions have
agreements it's not about it's generally
not about enforcing permissions because
if if you're a scribe you're an agile
team and you've got to deliver work
within ten days and the only thing
that's blocking your ability to go to
get that thing and do that thing that
you need to do if you're blocked from
doing that and the person who can do
that for you is not available you're not
gonna meet your 10-day deadline so I
wouldn't try and control permissions at
that level I would control it with
culture with an expectation is it is it
let me go back to the scrum values is it
respectful of the product owner to go
muck about with their backlog no yeah so
I wouldn't expect teams to do that
because I'm going to create that culture
of
of understanding we want to do the right
thing we're all we're all held
accountable for delivering working
software at the end of the iteration and
if we do that that may get in the way of
that so then we're kinda broken so if I
go to that that root team the default
team that's my portfolio team I'll see
all of the things so I've get NDC Sydney
and scrum dogs so then I can easily
create reports I can create dashboards
for the current sprint everything that's
going on and Microsoft nicely creates
some default backlog items and not
backlog items boards like this sprint
three if I'm on the root team it's
showing me all six things that are in
the backlog not just the things are
saying to my team or those to it because
I can see everything
is there anything else you want to see
in there that goes to this organizing
the hierarchy
okay
so we kind of need three things to be
able to do well we can I need four
things to do well we need scrum we need
engineering excellence we need the
values and principles of scrum to adhere
to some some guides so that we don't do
some of those things that that people do
and put them all together to create
professional scrum teams and then we can
start scaling because if you try and
scale before you have professional teams
it's going to be a car crash of it's
gonna be a bus crash not just a car
crash yeah the real the trains if you're
interested there's three useful books in
this space it's a little bit old but
professional application lifecycle
management with Visual Studio 2013 I was
involved in that which is why I put it
on there I can I can I can I have to
sell promote a little bit the reason all
the LM stuff that it talks about the
DevOps things that it talks about are
all still valid regardless of version of
the product we just decided not to write
another version of the book because the
product is moving too quickly to
actually keep up with it don't books no
use any more books or no value at that
level of the tools level Phoenix project
is then we read it yes read the Phoenix
project if you've not read it it's an
awesome read it's not a perfect scenario
not a perfect solution but it does give
you some ideas and help define the
problem and software in 30 days by Ken
he talks about something called the
scrum studio and we heard of the scrum
studio yep the the those come
everybody's coming to a realization as
if you've got a large enterprise company
and it's actually too difficult to
change it's it's too difficult to change
the culture of your organization
especially when you have a large
hierarchy and it's not just software you
build you've got a bank how do you go
change the other stuff that's going on
to make sure that you can be agile
because it has to be top-down scrum
studio is about kind of creating a new
company
there is all agile you move one team n
they start servicing some of the
business needs as you build
demonstratable trusts and that teams
delivering software bring more people
into the scrum studio and the Cana work
as a profit Center for that organization
I've got a number of customers that have
moved towards that model and it's Inc
much more successful one of them was a
travel company that uses software know
they have a profit Center instead of a
cost Center and they build better
software any any questions cool thank
you very much thank you for coming and
hopefully you can take something back to
the rest of your organization I think
the slides will be available for you
guys and I know it's the last session of
the day and everybody wants to kind of
go on the boat trip a in the rough seas
in the forty mile an hour winds I'm not
looking forward to it thank you very
much guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
