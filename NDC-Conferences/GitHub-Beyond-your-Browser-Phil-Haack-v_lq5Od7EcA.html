a minute so I've been told you know as a
presenter you never start off your
presentation with an apology right like
it sets the wrong tone so what I do
instead is i bribe everybody with
stickers so after my talk I have
stickers here get up
you know the classic octocat the Phoenix
the samurai and photographer and
skateboarder like unfortunately they
were organized earlier today but they're
not so much now but feel free to come up
afterwards
ask question take stickers whatever it
may be
so hello there we go so glad beer in
London this is my third time in London
in the span of a year and I have to ask
you and you know feel free tell me the
truth the name github it sounds funny to
you doesn't it being here in the UK
right like why would you want to use a
website where all day gets gather
although I got Ternes on we're going see
it's not that type of hub so now on to
the matter of ham today I want to talk
about github beyond the browser so when
you use github you often spend a lot of
time here in the browser
you know browsing issues looking at
profiles raging about the semicolons or
the lack thereof in issue comments but
that's when the code is already hosted
up in the cloud on github calm but
before it's hosted when the code is on
your machine you spend a lot of time
with git and again I don't mean an
unpleasant person that depends on where
you work what I mean is that you spend a
lot of time on the command line so an
alternative title for this talk would be
github beyond the command line how many
of you here are really strong with get
the command line show of hands
okay we have quite a few
how many of you struggle with it and be
honest okay also quite a few you know
how does one get anyways well xkcd has
the answer right I'll just read this
this is good it tracks collaborative
work on projects through a beautiful
distributed graph theory tree model cool
how do we use it no idea just memorize
these shell commands and type them to
sync up if you get errors save your work
elsewhere delete the project and
download a fresh copy this is an apt
description actually of how a lot of
people work with get right you know if
you have a go to a new shop and they're
just trying to get in to get you know
just like yeah just memorize these
commands don't worry about it right in
this talk I want to cover the work that
my team's do to help make it and github
more approachable so that hopefully you
don't have to resort to this we build
tools that slot in to the way that you
work with git and software in some in
some cases these tools make it so that
you don't really need to use you know
get the command line but you can just
use our tools but for most people there
are nice compliments to the command line
they work in tandem with it you know
sometimes you might need to drop to the
command line but ideally you'd you know
use these tools if they fit your
workflow your work style after all I
personally love using git get warts and
all but first a little about me my name
is Phil hack and I know what you're
thinking what a great name for a
software developer Phil I'm on Twitter
and I keep a blog and I got my first
computer when I was five or six and as
you can see I look pretty old for my age
back then but I've been in love with
computers ever since and I love sharing
my love for computers and hope that you
know everyone could have the same
opportunity that I've had and that I
continue to have with computers and now
I also recently learned from 23andme
it's the DNA testing that I'm actually
16% British so that may explain my love
of football or what we would call soccer
and my wonderful British accent
so anyways I run a group I'm the
director of engineering at github
I run a group called client apps and
this is almost basically anything that's
not get up calm the website right so
this includes atom desktop electron and
editor tools all of these projects are
open source if in case you you know been
under a rock or we've done a poor job of
marketing atom to the text editor its I
let you know a while ago we announced a
teletype as a new addition to that that
also show off later
we have desktop so desktop is a
cross-platform git and github GUI and
it's the next generation of our
pre-existing clients so if you've been
using get up client for a while we used
to have this get up for Mac get it for
Windows so now we have a very separate
clients written in two different code
bases now we have everything on a single
codebase because of electron so electron
is a platform that lets you use web
technologies so CSS HTML Javascript node
chromium to build cross-platform desktop
applications and coincidentally atom and
desktop are built on electron or not so
coincidentally we're not the only ones
building on it you may have heard of
other companies such as slack Microsoft
and even jay-z's title I like to imagine
jay-z and Beyonce pair programming on
their electron app so I was pretty
excited when I heard that title is
actually built using electron that's
pretty cool and then editor tools is a
team that builds extensions to IDE such
as the github for visual studio and the
github for unity plugin and this is kind
of our mission here's what we believe we
believe that in order to be the place
where developers build software we
should be everywhere developers build
software and so you know our mission is
extend github to wherever you're writing
your software like whatever tools you
may be using we're not gonna we don't
want to wait for you to push everything
up into the cloud and and then
help you out we'd like to help you as
early as possible in the cycle of
writing code and building software we
want to make it more approachable we
want to make it more productive and we
want to fit the way that you work
we believe that getteth is so much more
than just the browser in the command
line so to demonstrate this point I've
concocted this scenario it's a little
story that should feel somewhat sanera
familiar we have a software team named
TBD and that's the actual team name
they're building a to-do app right like
it's the classic example because I'm not
very creative and like many opinionated
developers they hate everything out
there right they know the right way to
build a to-do app everything else is
wrong
so like a typical software company this
app requires a back-end service and a
front-end client and and they're going
to require that developers testers
documentation writers graphic designers
lawyers all of them work together you
know on github and this is where we're
gonna begin the story so we have sort of
four characters actually I made a
mistake so we're gonna have to scratch
gabriela fort I'm sorry Gabriela
we have Fredrik the front-end developer
Beatriz the back-end developer and Don
the designer and so as I go through the
story I'm kind of telling the story of
these different characters all the
changed personas and kind of go through
these demos so let's start there I have
to switch I'll exit presenter mode once
I ever met I always forget how to do
this escape even know how to
at a presenter mode maybe I just I'll do
it the old-fashioned way just close it
all right great
so one of the things I want to do is I'm
actually I'm trying to model like how
you might actually a real team might
actually build a software project right
so I'll use one of these new features
called the project boards on github and
so we have a repo level project boards
but we also have org level project
boards so go ahead and create a new
project we'll call this NBC London to do
app it's a demo and one of the cool
things I don't know if you how many of
you seen the project board feature or
how many of you not seen it okay a lot
of hands up so it's a relatively new
feature and what's really nice is we had
these templates now so you can see like
none Kanban basic and Kanban automated
so Kanban is a Japanese word it means
literally a signboard right like it's
where you would keep track of the status
of things and in the flow of work on a
signboard and we've taken that you know
a lot of companies have taken that
physical model and moved it into
software so I'll do this automated one
and create this project and what it does
is it creates you know a pretty typical
Kanban board it starts you off with some
initial like welcome guide how to use it
but what's really cool is you'll notice
down here at the bottom I don't know if
you can see this automated is to do
automated is in progress automated is
done and so as you create issues move
them into these boards and they start
closing these issues it'll will actually
track these things and start moving them
through the columns for you I'm gonna
remove these built-in ones excuse me
and then we
take some of these and drag these into
the board so this is some of the tasks
that I need to do the design needs
freshening up let's we'll want to change
the port to 5000 these are some of the
to-do items and will kind of track my
progress through this talk by using this
board one cool feature though is one of
the apps we're going to be working on is
this to-do app and we already have a
project board here the to-do client
project and we have some tasks already
here but one of the things I can do is
if I want to have cross repo project
boards I can create a card here and just
type in the URL of another project board
and hit add card you can see that it's
already it already did it and that
purple bar that represents progress
through that other project board so I
can kind of keep track of multiple
projects within a single project by just
adding cards that link to those project
boards and there's also keyboard
shortcuts for navigating so if you have
question mark you know we bring up the
keyboard shortcuts you can kind of
navigate the cars and all that I don't
have those memorized very well yet I
need to I haven't been using these
project boards a whole lot yet because
they're pretty new to github so let's
start with the to-do app this is an
electron project and we're gonna start
with Don the designer so I'm dawn and
I've been asked to review PR that update
some CSS so let's go to this go to this
app so you have typical thing oh let's
see what PRS are here oh there's one
called design changes for Don oops go
back it says oh we got a pointy hair
boss here who says I bring the Styles
hey Don I'm not a designer by figured
how hard could it be
here's my suggestions for sprucing up
the app ok well let's you know run this
app and see what it looks like today
so I forgot to open this up
I'm gonna rent and oh okay so we're
gonna run npm start and just take a look
at the app before we've taken any
changes from anybody okay pretty
straight forward looking app you know
it's nothing pretty got some failures
going on some we've got some work to do
here right I'll close this out and I've
got this PR and I need I want to take a
look at this PR right I could click in
here and look you know look at this code
oh this is gonna be weird and and try to
figure out you know I could try to
reason about oh is this the right CSS
but you know when I'm looking at that I
don't I can't visualize what does that
look like in the running app one nice
thing you know one of the ways that I
said earlier that we want to bridge the
gap between sort of your workspace in
github on comm we have this nice way
feature here like you can see here where
you can open a pull request right in get
a desktop so when I click that what
that's going to do is launch a URL
protocol handler which is you know get
up desktop and it's going to clone that
locally oh wait I actually didn't I
already have a clone I didn't want to do
that so let me do so github dot and also
if I'm interview and it's not yet being
tracked by a git of desktop I can run
git up dot dot for the current path to
the repo and now I can add this
repository so now it's being tracked by
the app so that so if I click this open
in this and get AB desktop you'll see
there what it did is it launched the URL
protocol handler this is a way for a
browser to launch an application on your
machine if your app has registered for
this protocol and so with that what get
of death hob did is it looked at it got
this information from that URL that I
clicked
which has a special protocol and it
changed the branch to the PR branch I
did a pull change the branch to the PR
branch so now I have that branch checked
out locally so with one click I can now
take a look at this PR so I just by
running you know running the app will
run NPM start and did that not work so
it looks like I may have at I may be in
a wrong directory okay all right so I
made a mistake there but what would have
happened is this now I'm running the I'm
in that PR branch it says oh no this is
a really ugly design what do I do about
this well as don designer I'm gonna try
to fix this design up and help this
person help my boss out let me do
something real quick let me remove this
from here so make sure we're in the
right place otherwise this will be
really bad
this is the last actually what happened
so I've done this demo before and I had
changed directory so if I do this again
okay we should be in the right place
okay great
so what I'm gonna do is create a new
branch right for my design fixes and I'm
gonna one way I can do that is go into
the branch menu new branch and one nice
thing is here typically you're gonna
create a branch off the master branch
right and do your work in a branch I'm
actually gonna create it off the branch
of this PR because I want to fix this
changes from my boss here and we'll
create this branch and we'll call it the
design fixes oops so I'm creating new
branch based off that branch now rather
than have you watch me do a bunch of CSS
typing which would be really boring and
also I'd be very prone error will do the
whole Julia Child's thing you know we
she pulls out the fully baked pie and I
actually have a set of batch scripts for
doing this stuff so I'll just run apply
applied Dawn's changes oh no its crop
patch file that's not right so this is
where you get to watch me squirm really
well so what often happens so one of the
interesting things about working on
Windows is that line endings are crlf
and on linux and what get expects is
just LF so chances are that my line
endings are mixed up I messed up here
and I just needed to save this as that
and if I do this again that looked like
that actually worked let's check it out
so now I've got some changes whoo that
is a relief
I mean I'm missing a file don't know
what that's about I'm sure that's gonna
come bite me at some point but you know
we'll deal with that in a moment
okay so imagine that I'm done I just
like spam
all day you know fixing up the CSS and
now I've got all these changes and I
want to commit them right now that if
you know get in the command line it's
pretty easy to just you know get a - a
git commit and you're done but one of
the nice things about git is if you care
about the history you get rewarded down
the line if you keep your history kind
of clean like keep each commit have your
commits tell a story about how you got
to the point where you are right because
there are commands like git bisect which
I won't get into but things like that
that will that will that depend on
having a nice clean history and that are
worth their weight in gold
I guess I'll tell you so git bisect is
basically a binary search through your
history so imagine you have a bug and
you're like oh what commits introduced
this bug so you type git bisect you give
it two commits the one that is the last
known good so at some point in your
history you know that it wasn't broken
then and then the current you know
commits where it is broken and then what
git will do is it'll start it'll look at
the history and it'll go right to the
middle
check out that commit for you and then
you just tell it is this good or bad
and then it'll keep you know doing that
and does a binary search and eventually
you find the commit if each of your
commits kind of change one thing or are
a logical grouping of changes the git
bisect is amazing for doing that kind of
stuff you find bugs really quick if you
just take you know oh this is all the
work I worked on today I don't know just
jam it all into one commit then that's
not as useful for you and it's also not
as useful for people who come in and
review your code and so doing partial
commits where you take all you know I
just would I want to get I don't want to
get out of the flow so I'm not maybe I'm
not committing while I'm doing this work
because you know I'm deep in the flow
but now at the end I'm like oh well I
have all this work how do I commit you
know group these commits into logical
units well one nice thing is with
desktop that I think this experience is
actually better than the command line
you know I can check this style file and
say you know I'm just gonna commit all
the styles so all of the styles and will
commit that
well that's pretty easy to do with you
know the command line as well but let's
say I'm looking at maniacs and I'm like
you know this was a logical change right
there that group but not this but maybe
these two or these two lines should not
be in the commit but these four lines
I'm just making this up here right but
you know let's say this was a logical
grouping of changes fixing the header so
I can commit that and well you notice
there is that those lines of code that I
didn't select are still there in the
changes view and so with that what you
would call an in get parlance that's
like get add - P so I'm doing a partial
commit I'm saying I just want these
changes but not those changes in this
commit and so I get AB desktop makes it
really easy to do that and so for the
sake of brevity I'll just do this
I'll just commit the rest but you can
kind of see how that helps you keep your
git history clean so now you know I've
done this work I'm ready to create a
pull request so I can go to the branch
menu and create a pull request and
desktop
you know helpfully alerts me oh you know
you need to push this branch up to
github calm and then we can create a
pull request so go ahead and publish
that branch and what it's going to do is
it's going to push it and then it's
going to launch get up calm into the
pull request creation view and so we can
see here if I click on we can see all
our changes down here that are in this
commit and I'll say design fixes hey try
this
create this pull request and you know
what I forgot to do is identify what
issues is fixing this is going to fix
issue number 14 so let's do it this way
so one nice thing when you're doing
commits you can use this syntax like
fixes number fourteen the design needs
some freshening up oh I forgot we do the
intellisense
we do the Auto completion for you and
what's going to happen what's nice about
doing that is when this PR is merged it
will actually go ahead and close that
issue that you've referenced if you use
the syntax so either fixes or closes
there's a certain set of keywords that
it works with so when I merge this I go
back to the project board we can see
that
you know that issue the design needs
some freshening up has now been moved
from in progress to the done and so
we're we have a nice way to kind of
keeping track of our work here and one
neat thing about desktop is because it's
an electron app I can do something like
view toggle developer tools and just
like you would do in Google Chrome
I can now kind of see everything going
on in the app so I can mess around and I
could play around with things like
really just get in here here let's see
so that says changes and I can go in
here and nothing has changed
and you can actually play around with
the internals of app and see how we
built the app and and you know try
different things with it which is a kind
of a neat way of exploring an app
especially when you're developing the
app that you have these developer tools
just built into the app itself that
allow you to see you know messing around
with the console all that stuff so
that's kind of any consequence of it
being a electron app and the other thing
is I met I showed you earlier that we
actually have a we have some we have a
little like we have a few command line
options that we've that we've included
with the app so you can you can clone
from it you can open the git repository
from it and that's pretty useful as well
so because a scenario that I often run
into is I'm working on a repo because I
do like to command-line I'll be working
in the command line and realize oh I
need to do like a big partial commit and
I don't want to do it from the command
line because that's the pain but I
haven't tracked it so you can do git or
even if I have tracking you just do
github dot and that'll open it right
back to that repo so if you're working
in multiple repos it's nice with another
nice way to switch the other way to
switch would be in the close this is you
know you can go in here you can see all
the different repos that I'm working on
and so on cool
okay so that's that's showing off get of
desktop that's a tool that you know it's
for developers but you know it also
makes it more accessible for like
designers and others as well but now
we're gonna switch the Frederick the
front-end developer and the Frederick
needs to make some changes in Frederick
uses atom so we'll open this project up
with Adam so use atom dot specify the
path and Adam will load up okay I guess
and one of the things that we've added
to atom is we've added git and github
support so you think control shift nine
you can see the get pane and it's a
little hard to see but way down here you
know you can see the branch chooser here
so I'm going to excuse me is it looks
like I forgot to set up the branch here
git checkout oh wait I should oh I can
create a new branch here there this act
tries to code okay so we're gonna go to
control shift 8 and we have a github
pane so it says no pull request could be
found for the branch hack tries the code
on the repository to do app well that's
not good let's go check out the pull
request on the to-do app maybe I made a
mistake here
we have a pull request and the branch is
hacked tries the code why is that not
showing up uh yeah I was supposed to
match up the get status okay let's try
this
get the Oh master I'll delete the branch
let me do a poll I may have forgotten to
do a pull and let's do a git checkout
okay good so that showed that now it's
tracking the remote branch so I made a
mistake there in my setup sorry but oh
it's not supposed to apologize right
I have stickers here all right so let's
try this again control shift 8 no pull
request could be found okay so it says I
don't know why that's happening I swear
that I'd try this before but let's try
this if I submit this I'm in the right
place right okay great
so normally normally this all works more
smoothly than I'm showing I have a
reputation for always having things go
wrong when I'm demoing but what happen
ormally happen is when I switch to that
brand it may well be because I hadn't
done a poll earlier that it kind of got
everything out of whack but normally
what's kind of cool about Adam is so I'm
working in a branch and it knows that
there's a pull request associated with
it when I go to the get up pane it'll
show this pull request and I could kind
of you know I can go in here and pull
these changes using these little arrows
like here but it's a push and pull that
sort of thing but right now that's not
working because I've messed something up
so I'm gonna have to do some surgery
here which let's see
I have these batch files that I use for
resetting everything and it's probably
I'll just do this manually okay okay
there we go so when I reset my demo I
must have made a mistake or I've been
having problems thinking coherently
because I'm severely jet-lagged but
going back to where where we're at right
now so the idea that I've checked out
this branch and I'm one commit behind
what's on the server and hence you see
that pull one but I'm also one commit
ahead so I've done some work locally
that's not on the server there's some
work on the server that isn't yet on my
local machine and so you know before I
push my work up I'd need to pull that
work down and make sure that you know I
incorporate that right just you know
normal get stuff so this is like a git
pull command so I'll do this pull and oh
no what happened we have merged
conflicts so what do we do when we get
merge conflicts well according to xkcd
we just delete everything and retry it
right um but you know what we don't have
to do that because Adam gives us a nice
way of managing merge conflicts so I
look at this and and when I double-click
the diff view I don't know what Adams
trying to tell me there we get this nice
user interface for figuring out merge
conflicts but you know if you've ever
handled merge conflicts sometimes they
can get really gnarly right and you're
trying to figure out like who changed
what and what changes should I fix and I
want to be very careful
so like I'm looking at this and I'm you
know I might be in a situation where I
don't know what to do
can someone help me fix ease merge
conflicts oh really oh great
so Jasmine's gonna help me um so one
thing we could do is we could work on
this collaboratively by working in the
same editor at the same time and the way
we do that is we use teletype so I'm
gonna zoom in down here at the bottom
here and you see this little like
antenna so this is the new new feature
in Adam called teletype and so I click
that and I can start sharing my
workspace so that generates this portal
ID and now I need to find a way to get
that to you so like I might you know
slack you or text you in this case since
when I tried this earlier whatsapp was
being a little bit flaky I'm gonna just
give you to you via Twitter now Audie
Emmet I'm not gonna like posted live we
could do that if you want I would be
kind of funny let's see when we first
launched teletype somebody posted a
portal ID on Hacker News and we had at
least at one point I think 60 people
editing the same file at the same time
and it was handling it really great one
of the reasons how do I send you oh
there it is messages one of the reasons
it works great even with that many
people is teletype uses a technology
called CR DTS or content context
replicated data types actually I think I
got that wrong but Oh
sorry I need to I need to ya actually
choose you and then this Twitter in your
face I tell you alright there we go
alright Jasmine do you got that so
there's like you know if you ever use
Google Docs it has the real time
collaborative editing as well but they
use something called the operational
transform this is all like weird
computer science ii stuff but
operational transforms requires sort of
a central server to host all the the
work CRD teas are really nice because
they can work well in low latency
environments they can they can handle
changes that come in out of order and
it's peer to peer so what um are you in
here oh okay so we can see that she's in
here and we have a peer to peer
connection now if we happen to both
behind up be behind a firewall then we
would be going through a little service
teletype service that we host in order
to you know establish this connection
but for most users they're gonna have a
peer to peer connect connection so I can
ask that Jasmine you know can you help
me resolve these conflicts I think the I
think that the first change is usually
the the right one I can't remember any
more like you well that's why you're
here to help me so like she can be in
here you know fixing things up while I'm
in here making comments please hurry up
and I can even add other files in here
so are you are you did that change it
for you when I open that file are you
still in the old one so because one one
cool thing you can do is like when you
click on a person you see that little
icon there that little chain link icon
so now like I'm following her so um do
you see two files can you switch between
them a you only see one okay I might
have time I wonder if I can
this one so we do support two files but
I forgot I don't know like it I think I
mean I may have had to have it open when
I initiated this session and I didn't
learn how you add a file to it so we've
got some kinks to work out it's a beta
but what's really cool is like sometimes
you know what rather than both of us
working on the file at the same time
like I actually wanted her to show me
how to do something right I want her to
teach me something so if I click on her
image
I'll start following her down the file
so go ahead and like scroll down and up
okay yeah okay so she's going gonna
finish that fix that for me really
appreciate all your help here so you see
no hands on my part okay you got them
all and can you go back to the top the
very touch you scrolled up and start
typing up there okay so you can see that
teletype is now following her around
whatever she's doing is following her
around what's really cool is that we now
support multi files so like she could be
working on the test while I'm working on
the code that's making the test pass
that sort of thing the team that builds
a teletype actually uses teletype every
single day they do a lot of pair
programming using teletype so I'll go in
here and accept all their changes I
think these look good to me I hope
they're right ya know one of my computer
source loves and so I have a Dell XPS
and one of the things that seems to
happen is sometimes when to close it it
actually doesn't actually shut down so
when I took it out of my bag today it
was really hot it had been like the fan
adjust it was sound like a jet engine
just been going okay so now that um I'm
okay with that I double clicked the file
to say okay I accept these changes and
staged them and now we can just commit
this and be done with it so you know the
whole point of that part is to show like
you know we have this real time
collaborative editing a lot of times we
were like you know I'm not really into
this prior programming but sometimes
like you just want someone to help you
with something and it's a real nice way
of doing that it's a pretty cool feature
of
of Adam great
so let's where am I so I'm gonna go
ahead and you know again I have some
changes to apply as well Frederick's
changes great okay so I just made some
changes and I can click on this to see
all the changes that I need to commit
and just like in desktop I can do the
partial commit thing as well right I can
click in here and I can oops select that
and I can right click wait what I can
right click and I can stage that
selection so now you can see here that I
have a stage change of just that line
that I those lines I selected I'll add
message to in DC I'll commit that so the
interface is slightly different from
desktop but it lets you do the same
basic thing do partial commits with Adam
we actually model like the staging
environment that we didn't do in desktop
in desktop we kind of simplified it a
little more but with Adam since we're
targeting you know we ostensibly more
power users we kind of didn't want to
hide the details of get staging
environment so I'll go ahead and commit
this and again I can go down here and I
can I have four commits I can push those
up by clicking that and we don't yet
have a feature for creating a pull
request right from Adam so I'll have to
navigate to the repo and do it okay
great so now that's done I'll go back to
just
get code there where's the branch act
rise the code oh wait we've already have
a pull request for this right I'll
navigate to this pull request and we can
see you know I have a lot of changes now
go ahead and oh there's still conflicts
in here I'll just resolve those I can
resolve them from the browser so I don't
know what happened here but we'll just
go ahead and fix this up in the browser
so you know all these tools kind of work
together some do my little song and
dance here as I made a mistake somewhere
again that we can fix that so I can mark
it as resolved so did you all know that
we now allow merge conflict editing in
and get up as well so I can do it in
Adam or I can do it right from get up
calm and now I'm ready to merge this
pull request and we're done cool
so I'm like do I dare run it and see
what happens
okay so we've got a problem here
oh I get it
oh yeah you know what I need to go back
to master that's right
so the the issue there is I had pushed
that branch up but I fixed it in the
browser I still don't have those changes
locally so since I merged the master
looks like I still have problems and it
may be that I've I made a mistake with
duplicate declaration title title in so
yeah I did a bad job of resolving the
merge conflict so we could fix that
later so anyone here use typescript okay
a lot of hands so we have another
feature called Adam - IDE so it's a
separate Adam module you could APM
install Adam IDE it's a little bit it's
a little bit early and rough I'm
actually having troubles with showing it
as well so I won't show it today one of
the things we've been doing a lot of is
working with Facebook - they have a
editor called nuclide it's like a react
editor and so it's built on top of Adam
it's actually built as an Adam package
and we're working with them to pull a
lot of those features right into Adam
proper and that's what I've been working
out pretty well and so we have a
Diagnostics window outline window but
one of the things we're hoping to get
into Adam pretty soon is a bugger and so
that'll be nice to have we don't have
that yet but when it's ready you'll
probably get it through installing the
Adam IDE package all right so let's
switch change gears we're gonna switch
to beetrice the back end developer so I
have this to do API and this is a what's
change here okay
so this is a dotnet asp.net core
application that is going to be the back
end web api for for this to do app so
I'll open visual studio and our friend
Jasmine over there worked on this when
she was at github she's no longer with
us
and so one of the cool things here is I
can go into to do API and I can
authenticate to get up I've already
authenticated github you can see where
this github pane here and I can actually
list pull requests associated with the
project that I'm working on and so I'm
gonna view this list of PRS and I see
this one here like change the port so
I'll click on that and let's zoom in a
little bit so you can see okay we've got
this pull request I can kind of look at
this pull request and notice here I can
see what's changed in this pull request
so I'm gonna click on this it's like oh
there's a comment here what is this
about and you can see here that we have
this comment I can see the difference
pull request write from visual studio
I'm not to leave visual studio and we
can see that there's this comment says I
prefer odd numbers do you think we
should keep this as an opera
no that's silly I'll hit this comment
and so you know it's a nice way for me
to run through you can see the beginning
of a workflow where I can do code review
right from here on if I go up to the
website pull requests
and you can see my comment right there
no that's silly so one of the things
we're working on is we want to make it
so that for a lot of the common type of
operation that you do you don't have to
switch to the browser switch back to the
repo if you want to you know make a PR
comment naturally with the PR you may
want to try the code locally you can
make comments one cool experimental
feature we have that we hope the ship at
some point is you know this is the diff
view but if you imagine that if I'm
actually working on this file will
actually start to show in the gutter
that there's comments on the file if if
you're in a branch that's associated
with the PR and there's a comment on
that and then you could write from your
editor you could see the comment and
edit we have a experimental branch we're
still working on that the experience is
actually kind of tricky to get right so
what I'm going to do here is run I'm
gonna apply some changes again using the
Julie child's method patch does not
apply again we need to fix the line
endings I really just wish Windows would
just get rid of the CR like I don't
think it's really needed anymore okay so
we applied this change I can go and you
know imagine I'm doing this work in here
I can go into a team Explorer and you
can see it's a little hard to see but
you can see here that you know we
recognize this as a github repo I can
click here on changes and I can look at
what's changed by double-click or
clicking that or click double clicking
it I can see the change I made and then
I can create a committed so this changes
view is actually already built it's
built in a visual studio this isn't part
of the get up module just kind of
showing how the whole workflow works I
fixed it and commit all and then I can
click
care to sink and we'll so sink is
basically pushing it and then pulling
any changes that might be up there so
it's kind of a abstraction around get
pushed then get pull so I went ahead and
already push the updates to the branch
and we can kind of see I switched
through the commits oh don't do this I'm
in the wrong branch okay let's forget
that oh wait okay I'm not sure what
happened there all right
okay so and there you have it TV app is
done a little rough but you know it's
like a typical software project one of
the nice things about all these projects
that everything everything I've shown
you is open source so if you go to these
repos you can see the source code for
atom or electron desktop editor tools
atom an electron in particular have very
large vibrant communities as I mentioned
before Facebook contributes to atom they
built their own editor on it electron
forms the basis of vias code so
Microsoft can you know works with us
closely on it
slack works with us a lot they have a
lot of full-time folks contributing
electron the teletype so teletype is now
is in beta and you can install it by
running APM installed teletype and
that's the real-time collaborative tool
and teletype is also open source and
we've divided it up into these four
components so if you're interested in
you know the full package
that's teletype the CR DT library which
is doesn't depend on atom it's just a
it's a it's the base C R DT library that
could be used in anything our goal is to
get other editors to use the teletype
protocol so that we could get real-time
collaborative editing let's say across
from Adam to Visual Studio to you know
IntelliJ whoever is interested in
working with us on making this somewhat
a standard now interesting bit of news
the day we announced teletype Microsoft
announced the vs live share and so
that's their real-time collaborative
editing I had no idea they were doing
that on the same day we were doing it we
didn't really know that they were
working on a similar thing
unfortunately they chose a different
technology they chose a operational
transform so we're working with them to
kind of figure out is there a way that
we can interoperate because we would
really like to have someone be able to
you know work from Adam and visual
studio and have that collaborative
editing work and we also have our server
and our client as open source libraries
so in the end we hope these tools make
your own workflows better and if there
are ways that we can make your life even
better when working with github please
let me know thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
