actually heard of Ryder are using it
play with it remotely okay
nothing we do is free like like would
you see that already made him leave what
you might be free as my friend says
nothing is free it's just been prepaid
right so no it's not gonna be free at
least no plans that's not very hard it's
gonna be faster than Visual Studio
that's good point it's gonna be smaller
than visual studio so I install visual
studio the other day was a 25 gigabyte
download know something like what
whatever download and then it said it
requires 25 gigabytes to install right
this is the download is 300 megabytes
and install is 300 megabytes ok so
welcome please write a tips and tricks
I'll give you a quick overview of what
it is for those that aren't familiar
with it and then we'll dive into
actually what the purpose of this
session is is about if you're playing
with it or if you want to play with it
get the most out of it especially coming
from environment that's somewhat
different to what you're accustomed to
any of you have ever used any of our
other tools tell the jury and stuff
right webstorm so the great part is that
everything I'll teach you here today
you'll be able to use for the other
stuff as well so you'll pick up tips and
tricks on that as well
ok that's where you write and write up
that's where you sign up it's called the
private EAP because we just want your
names but then everyone gets access to
it this is what it looks like and what
is it it's for now it's a codename it
might be the definitive name is closed
platform dotnet ID not just c-sharp it's
built on the intelligent platform which
is an open source platform on which
other people have also built such as
Android studio the back end is resharper
and it's written in Kotlin and c-sharp
if you're not familiar with Cortland
that's our programming languages for the
JVM open source it's very familiar it's
very similar to C sharp so if you're
doing any JVM stuff look into that
because it coming from c-sharp it's
really nice is it using Roslyn no it not
it does not and it will never use Roslyn
okay same reason that resharper doesn't
use Roslyn because Roslyn doesn't fit
our needs it doesn't have what we need
and there's no reason for us to rewrite
our own Roslyn that we've been
developing for the past decade to use
something that is not suitable for our
requirements but what is the
architecture so we've got dotnet over
here talking to IntelliJ platform which
is built on JVM and basically we you
have resharper kind of like as a service
on this side and then you have writer on
that side and all that this is doing is
just like all the heavyweight is being
done by this side so the front-end is
basically a dumb client that all it's
doing is just sending requests back and
forth and drawing those requests in the
UI okay so we use a very lightweight
protocol custom protocol initially we
were using protocol buffers but then it
turned out to be not suitable for our
needs so we invented our own and we keep
deltas and it's a two-way it's
completely mutable contrary to what
every functional developer will tell you
it is completely mutable and we're proud
of it so and there's like representation
on both sides of it okay things happen
in a very short time 20 milliseconds
right and in that 20 milliseconds I'll
tell you what happened under the covers
just to get idea now why is it based on
an intelligence of all this we have all
of this right we've got you know version
control favorites themes anything you
can think of as an IDE we already have
on this platform so it makes very little
sense for us to create a new platform or
a new UI around all of this
functionality what is a protocol it's
lightweight and fast because I would
never put there as heavyweight and slow
it can operate with mutable objects that
are shared on both sides it is written
in Kotlin and only the UI is being
transferred as I mentioned okay so what
does that mean that means that when I
press alt enter the back end is going to
send some information the front end is
going to send some information to the
back end the back end is going to
prepare all of the possible options that
would be available on alt enter on that
section of the code and then it's going
to send that back to the front end and
the front end is going to display it and
when you select one of those options
it's going to say to the back end this
is the option that was selected go do
whatever you need to do with the code
and tell me what code I have to write on
the front end okay but that's quite fast
it sounds very slow but it's quite fast
it's sharing resharper so which one is
resharper which one is Ryder can you
tell top one is resharper bottle one is
Ryder but they're sharing everything
right in fact 99% like already that's
actually outdated this kind of like two
thousand inspections are already
available because we haven't rewritten
anything from scratch we're using
everything that's available already in
resharper so all of this information is
already available and it's 99 percent
resharper code right that's not entirely
accurate it could be maybe 95 percent
right so what that means is that the
majority of the time that we're spending
right now is creating the UI aspects to
be able to interact with the backend
okay
that's it that's all I have so any
questions resharper is a plugin for
vision what is it what is reach operatin
and I'm f-sharp now I'm just kidding
some would wish no it's written in C
sharp with places in vb.net just for the
fact that we need to dog food someone
someone needs to use VB and also I think
there are parts in C++ manage C++ I
don't think there are any more so it's
pretty much C sharp code okay
right so what I'll do is this is mano
sessile and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you some tips around like
navigation and you know getting into the
ID then how to kind of focus around
editing then some code analysis stuff
some refactoring some code generation
code assistance and then some other
things ok please feel free to interrupt
me at any time if you have any questions
etc also I'm using a plugin which is so
we already have plugins right you can
see that we already have a whole bunch
of plugins because again is it's a part
of the IntelliJ platform so I'm using
the plug-in which is called presentation
assist which basically what it does is
every time I press a keyboard it shows
it on the screen ok so that way you
don't have to say what keyboard did you
press it's also very good when you're
doing pay programming because that way
they won't interrupt you and say what
did you do so you can just see it there
I'm also using the default Mac OSX
layout which basically means that if I
want to go to a type I press command Oh
if you come from resharper normally that
would be ctrl n I recommend that if
you're using any of our IDE s probably
worth switching keyboard mappings I went
from the visual studio to reshot - to
IntelliJ however having said that we are
providing keyboard mappings for
resharper users so if you're coming from
visual studio you'll be able to use
those same keyboard mappings ok any
questions yes so Hadi is asking he's
cool the same way if it runs any Visual
Studio add-ins no it runs resharper
add-ins so in principle any plugin that
you have for resharper will be able to
work on writer as well and then you have
to write the rider platform plugins the
distinction is if your plugin is going
to be working with anything around the
code code semantics knowledge of the
code you would probably write it as a
resharper plugin right if it's going to
just interact with the IDE and other
aspects like for instance I don't
version control and stuff like that then
it would be a plugin for that for the
idea right but if you go to Chrome
plugins are jetpens.com
you can see that we already have like
1825 plugins ok we have everything
there's even a plug-in that colors your
code is the color of the rainbow don't
know why someone would waste their time
doing that but apparently it's a good
thing
okay so navigation type specification
notice how fast it is you know a lot of
times people ask us is resharper's slow
or is it Visual Studio that's slow I'm
not going to say which one but you have
your own judgement after this session ok
so type specification you can see that I
have time camelcase and I can just do
type specification and I will take me to
type specification ok I can look up
symbols for instance I could just do
full name and I will give me a list of
all of the full names that are across
the entire project now again if you're
familiar with resharper you're familiar
with the namespace filtering with
resharper yes so I can write for
instance if I'm going to go to the full
name inside the type type specification
I don't have to sit and look through all
of these what I can do is use camel case
and namespace filtering so I could just
do TS full name and then that would take
me to the full name inside that type
specification so its namespace class and
then the the symbol name ok I also have
a structure window over here so you can
see the actual structure of the the
project right all of the properties all
of the methods and one thing to note
about pretty much anywhere in ID in the
idea platform is that you can actually
search in all windows right so if I'm
now I've got the focus on the on the
structure window if I say for example
metadata or whatever meta data type that
you can see that it's allowing me to
search through those two as well ok and
you can do that pretty much in any
window on the IntelliJ platform we also
obviously have go to file
again type names for a camel case and I
could do for example TDC 30 which would
take me to line 30 of that file okay and
folders it's it's kind of not working
yet but there will be support again for
folders so you can navigate to specific
folders as well and then you've got of
course the project structure window
which is basically now in in writer it's
called the solution Explorer and here
again I can do all sorts of searches so
for instance I could do buffer etc and
that will also do searches for me inside
that okay now if you see as I'm opening
these different windows you can see that
one of the things that does anybody
actually notice anything no tabs so if
you go to tabs you do have actually
added two tabs the best thing you can do
is place switch them off right tabs are
probably the most useless piece of
garbage that has ever been invented for
navigation and you don't need tabs how
many of you actually use tabs okay so
the only place you use tabs is in the
browser but there's a plug-in which is
called kind of like IntelliJ plugin for
browsers that allow you to navigate fast
as well don't use tabs my recommendation
switch it off and then just use the
navigation features of going to type etc
and then you have two keyboard mappings
which is recent files right which allows
you to quickly change between files
right and in fact if I alternate between
two files I can just hit alt enter and
it will switch back and forth and then
of course you have recent edits right
which allow you to also do that
navigation of going back and forth
through recent edits so for example if
you're doing MVC controller view you can
just press shift command E and it will
constantly change back and forth of
course you can also use the left square
brackets and the right square brackets
to also navigate back and forth between
all of the different places that you've
been right we don't have a navigation
bar that I will I I have it actually
switched off before that double shift
which is search everywhere okay so this
is now I've got a map to search
everywhere
sometimes you might by default if you
use a resharper keyboard mappings on
Ryder it will map it to ctrl T or
command T right and this basically
allows me to do any kind of searches
across anything so I can instead of
distinguishing between go to type go to
file go to symbol I can just write
whatever here and then you can see that
it shows me grouped by the type so if I
hit more here you can see all of the
types here but let's say for example I
do TS I see recent files I see classes I
see files I see symbols I see even
actions etc right and I can do for
example navigation and navigation is
showing me the navigation bar which is
an actual option and if I hit enter I
can switch it on and off right so I can
set settings directly from here as well
ok where is the navigation bar it's dead
now there you go I usually have this
switched off now this is good because it
allows me to do things like actually
like click on this and navigate through
different files here and in fact I can
even invoke the create new file directly
and it will do it in that context of
where the folder is but I usually have
it switched off and then if I want it if
I want to bring it up all you do is you
just press the keyboard my binding which
is in the case of max function alt left
and then you can just bring it up in
context wherever you are ok so again it
saves you a little bit of space there at
the top any questions so far is
everything I've shown you you already
know yes
well yeah this is this is a Mac so yeah
but yeah I mean yeah we've got out of
the private users that we have there's
there's ironically there is most of them
are using writer on Windows and so it's
quite a bit and then there's Mac users
and there's Linux users as well okay but
all of this like all the navigation do
you notice that it's fast or not yeah so
all of that is basically going
constantly to the backend front and back
in front end and all doing those things
okay so time specification we're gonna
go to again type specification over here
and then I have for instance the
navigate to menu and he from here I can
do that you know this is something that
we brought onto the IntelliJ platform
they don't actually have to navigate to
menu so navigate to implementation base
symbol find usages of symbols there I
mean it's it's plain certainly fast okay
in terms of and so it's fast in terms of
speed if that even makes sense okay
I'll command B that would give me
derived types again and again on all of
these I can do searches right every
single menu that comes up I can do
searches on that and you know so back to
the navigate to menu I can do usages of
symbol derive symbols extension methods
exposing il code etc because in fact if
I go for instance to I don't know let's
go ahead and bite reference over here by
reference oh that's a value that's good
this and we do for instance bar s
I've been so long not writing c-sharp I
don't even know how to anymore I'm
string and I can actually navigate to
string it has already dot peek built in
so it does decompiling as well okay any
other questions you people really need
to answer some ask more questions
yeah I'm using the I'm using actually
the light backgrounds because there's
much better for presentations but you
can actually say look on field arkla and
it'll go dark right look and feel light
cooler right so I get the light thing
and in fact we also have support for
what you call it for fun ligatures so
or we did fonts
oh okay I don't have it enabled hold on
save as default copy
I say fira code enable font ligatures so
you saw that and now I hit apply let's
make it a little bit bigger 17 apply and
you see that I get the nice little arrow
okay because that is these are the
important things in our lives not not
everything else it's it's these things
that matter right it's the little
details right and you know like you know
all of the things around I mean we've
seen in the Navigator menu poverty
definition usages of symbol related
files so for instance if I'm doing MVC I
get the ability I'll show you some NBC
stuff later you can do all of the
related files etc on that as well okay
and then you have all of the gutter
icons here which allow you to also
navigate to the derive types etc okay
now what else do we have in terms of
navigation you have bookmarks so I could
do for example shift ctrl + v and set a
bookmark here right and then come here
for instance and say shift control 7 and
said uh not a bookmark here and then I
could navigate back and forth to these
bookmarks easily just using the keyboard
as well and I can see all of the
bookmarks and do previews of those
bookmarks without having to actually
navigate to those things ok some things
that aren't working right now parameter
info for instance is working and there
is also the ability to do what we call a
quick definition so for instance if I'm
in let's go back to type specification
here for instance and I want to go to
type reference obviously I could
navigate to type reference and then look
at it and come back or I can press
command Y right and this in principle
when it works it will show me inline ref
definition of that type reference not
having me not causing me to good you
know navigate back and forth that
doesn't work right now but it will be
working and eventually at some point
okay so if you want to start writing
code
is this where's my arrow if you want to
start writing code sometimes you know
like especially when people come to our
go away when people come to the IDE
they kind of see all of these little
windows everywhere and you've got the
project structure and you've got the
databases stuff and etc and you kind of
basically are left with zero workspace
okay you can quickly kind of go back and
forth in that mode by just pressing
shift ctrl shift command f12 okay and
that will take you back and forth and it
will provide you with the ability to
always use the command with the numbers
that are wrong here to kind of show the
actual window that I want to go to you
can even hide this you know the little
tabs over here by pressing this button
there and that's completely hidden
okay if I want to get it back just
double click the command and I can get
it back and I can then see the numbers
or at any time I can just click on the
mouse here and see all of the different
entries okay try not to use the mouse
just like with resharper you know
IntelliJ platform has been designed to
avoid usages of Mouse as much as
possible okay
there's also what we call distraction
free mode which basically what it does
it kind of like eliminates everything
else doesn't shut down things like
Twitter and Facebook and stuff like that
but everything else it does if you want
something that does do that it's called
focus anyone not focus right I use it
I'm you come here and you add all your
applications that are causing you grief
and all the websites such as Twitter and
Tumblr and all of that and then you can
just focus for an hour and it won't let
you open it
it's got a hard code mode which actually
if you kill you kill the process it will
still not allow you to do anything so I
haven't enabled that yet then there's
also exit distraction mode there's also
another one which is called presentation
mode which is very useful for doing
presentations except when you're doing
presentations or out the tool then it's
not useful but like if you're doing like
code reviews and stuff like that this is
also useful the thing here that it just
makes everything much much larger
right you can control this phone but
that's like if you're doing
presentations internally your company or
externally etc okay now when you want to
create a file again don't do the
right-click new just like you wouldn't
in resharper just press command N and
from there you can create a class you
can create anything and you can invoke
that anywhere right you don't have to be
in the actual solution Explorer to be
able to invoke that we also have this
other thing which are called scratch
files right so normally when you create
a new C sharp file or whatever it
becomes part of the project but in on
the platform you can also create scratch
files which allow you to just create a
file that you can just play around with
and then throw away afterwards okay
those are called the scratch files but
it gives you all of the syntax
highlighting all of the completion and
everything that you would come to expect
if it were pilot the project okay so
what else with the resizing again you
can even resize your project structure
window without using anything of the
mouse and then you can also have kind of
like a split window if you like so I can
go to window here and edit two tabs and
I have the split window vertically so
you can now just kind of like get rid of
the project solution Explorer and then
just have like a side-by-side you have
your unit tests on one side you have
your code on the other side and you can
do all of those wonderful things and of
course you can do as many splits as you
want down here can I hide which gutter
the gutter here I think actually you
might be able to
by the way these are if you put a
hashtag it allows you to dive into the
settings
okay so editor and then is there gutter
showed you see it shall hide gutter
icons there you go okay so you can hide
the gutter as well if you how many of
you use vim alright so we also have ID
event which is a plugin that we've
created which kind of simulates whim so
you click down here install IntelliJ
plug-in and idea of M and if you install
that that gives you very short cuts them
editing copying pasting etc so it's kind
of like the best of both worlds you
still can exit the IDE but don't be
alarmed when you like enable this and
then certainly like what's wrong with my
files they're all read-only I can't type
because you have to press I obviously
okay just also to let you know that when
you when you come to install a plug-in
in writer anything that says install
jetbrains means we maintain it anything
that says browse repositories means we
don't maintain it ok so what this means
is that all of the plugins that are
available as as jetbrains plugin we make
sure that it works with every release of
the tool of the platform and with the
browser pod stories those are
third-party plugins those are the 1800
something plugins that are available ok
the platform's I said it is open source
so you know you can write that you know
whatever you want on it
okay
that
and then you've got the extend selection
shrink selection as well so I can just
like select a word here it's
context-sensitive so if I want to select
now you see it selects first the class
name next the line then the entire class
then the namespace and if I were to for
example go on a method it would select
the method name then the entire select
block and if I want to unshrink I can
use the out up and out down right on the
windows that would be controlled W and
shift ctrl W which on Mac is really
painful because command W closes this
editor file so we have to rename we had
to redo that so that people don't get
pissed off about that ok we also have to
complete statements so let's go here and
open something that's here so public
void a and I can just hit shift command
ENTER to do complete statement you're
familiar with complete statement know
it's it's it's the three keyboard three
key shortcut to insert a semicolon so I
can do console.writeline or right left
and I press shift command enter and then
it would insert that do you notice that
the actual is quite fast as well so
that's actually going back and forth
between the back end in front end right
okay
we also have kind of like multi caret
support so you can just place carrots
anywhere you want and then just screw up
your system as much as you want this is
this was one of the most demanded
features by hipsters because they would
say like I need to refactor code you
would be yes but you don't do that with
copy and paste you need to use like and
I apply the same thing like yet there
are situations in which you would want
to use multiple carrots to do some
refactoring but usually use the built in
features that the tool provides you and
only in cases where it doesn't then do
that kind of refactoring okay and then I
can have for example if I have console
over here
if I press ctrl-g that's gonna select
console and it's gonna select all the
different consoles and provide me with
multiple carrots across those all of
those different consoles of course this
could be anywhere right so if I come put
that there and delete these lines and
then I come back here and I do ctrl G
and then ctrl G that's going to place
the carrots on all of those words and
then I can also do a command ctrl
command G and that will select all of
the consoles in one go in that scope as
well okay moving code around again you
have the same features that you would
have in resharper so for instance if I
want to select the line by the way to
select the line go anywhere that's empty
and just press up okay and I can just
move code up and down as well without
doing copy and paste if of course I want
to do copy and paste and I come here and
instead of pressing V I press control X
which happens sometimes
press shift command V and you get your
clipboard contents where you can select
the one that you deleted and insert it
okay cleaning up code if you've used the
code cleanup that's also available right
so I can for instance come here and move
that there and move that here and then
do for example I'll command L and that
does code cleanup okay
and styles in the code style settings
you have it you have all of the
different you have you have all of the
different settings that you would
possibly want to style your code which
in this case are limited to tap size and
indentation so all of that is coming and
it's all there the problem is that it
doesn't have the UI right so for example
everything that's in dart settings on
resharper it will that's another issue
that we have issue we need to be able to
provide a format in which you can share
settings across resharper and rider
right
by default historically on the writer
platform all of these settings have been
in a folder called dot idea on the
resharper one it's in a file called dot
settings and so now we've got the Java
side of the company arguing with the
dotnet side of the company and we're
gonna all reach a beautiful compromise
and provide you with the bestest most
awesomest awesome sources solution at
some point in time until then just
change your tab size you have all of the
optimized imports as well of course you
can just do alt enter and do optimized
imports as well I this is I believe it
is also available in resharper in that
you can actually select some code and
then do format selection based on that
right so we have this in in an idea it's
not available fully here yet but what
you can actually do is start to like
play with the settings contextually and
it will show you live preview of that
section of the code or you can just say
apply the code style to this code or you
know cleanup selection or surround all
of these things are also available okay
so we've got all of the templates for
surround we've even got postfix postfix
so for instance watch this I'm here and
I do var and it does the post fixed do
you know about that postfix templates
so that's been available in resharper
for a long time and then IntelliJ copied
it and then Eclipse copied it and then
NetBeans copied it but basically it's
it's kind of like inserting templates
but it's afterwards like you know I'm so
fast I don't think and I wrote this oh I
need to introduce variable well instead
of coming here and selecting all this
and then saying refactor and say
introduce variable what I can do is just
do dot var and that will introduce
variable for me right and I can do
things like for instance action not null
and that will say you're an idiot
because that's always true but you get
the idea okay any questions nothing
so what is the question is what is my
technique for learning something you
like learning the keyboard shortcuts and
all of these things what I do is I force
myself to not use the mouse right and I
kind of constantly try and remember the
keyboard shortcuts and in many
applications what you would have to do
is go to the menus and then look it up
and then try and remember that so I
would come here for instance you know
navigate - I don't know jump to
navigation bar so I wouldn't click it I
would look up the keyboard and then
invoke that right now with IntelliJ you
have the ability which I was going to
show you data but shift command a if
there's one keyboard binding you need to
remember it's that one okay which is a
lookup of action names okay shift
command a so if I don't know how to do
something I just say refactor and it's
all reformat code and then will invoke
that action for me but it will also show
me the keyboard binding okay there's
also another thing that we have here but
on this one it doesn't show you anything
which is called the productivity guide
which believe it or not is not a PDF let
me show it to you in a complete version
which is in IntelliJ
so
if you click on port if you click on
productivity what it does is it gives
you information about what features
you're using when it was used how many
times it was used right and then you can
just click for example unused and there
you go never ok and then you can click
for example Oh smart type completion
what is that and it tells you what that
is right so that's also a good way to
kind of figure out like you know what
features of the product I'm using what
not another way is to come to talks like
this
so let's go to generic arguments and so
you see that we have the what I call the
resharper WTF which are the inspections
on the side you know that code review
thing now like the doors with the how
many WTF scum out per door is quality of
the code so these are the inspections
all of these again are available all of
those two thousand-plus inspections none
of this we had to rewrite it's all comes
for free and you get all of the
alt-enter functionality as well so I hit
alt enter here and it says to expression
body do you find that fast really yeah
it is right so all of that again it's
free and since most of these or only
require all tensors no additional kind
of UI they're all there the only thing
that you do require here which aren't
all there is to actually list them so if
you go to inspections by the way when
you're doing a to when you go to
preferences don't ever sit there and
like say oh where was that setting right
don't do that just type it in and it
will find it for you okay so inspections
you can see that I have general and I
have very few right now there's no C
sharp specific ones they're all there
they've just not been surfaced to the UI
okay so we will surface those and just
like resharper you can set the severity
level there's also structural search and
replace how many of you have used
structural search and replacing
resharper no it's a very very cool
feature which basically allows you to
search for patterns across your code and
then replace those and not only does it
allow you to do an explicit search and
replace but as soon as you enter a
pattern and say that set this patterns
as an inspection then anytime that it
detects our pattern it will also
highlight it right so it's very useful
for instance for code smells etc that
your team might do just define these
patterns as custom inspections so
effectively what you're doing is you're
adding your own inspections to it to
resharper without having to write it as
a
in etc okay you have that here as well
it's basically if you go search
structurally structural struck oh we
don't have it enabled yet okay yeah we
don't have it enabled yet in in
resharper in by there but it will be
there okay yes yes well with team C with
team city you can write with team city
the question is if you said this is an
era can you surface it in a CI yeah
in team city there's and we already have
built-in support for all of the
inspections for resharper and for
IntelliJ right and then you can say you
know if if these inspections give errors
and if there's more than X amount of
errors fail the built with resharper
there is also I don't know if you're a
way that we've been providing for the
past several years a command line
version of resharper that allow for free
that allows you to also run these
inspections outside of the scope of you
know I'm from a command line so you
couldn't potentially use it with other
CI servers right
but that functionality already comes
built into to the CI yeah and it uses
the the settings defining what
inspections you want to enable the
disabled is based on your dot settings
for for resharper okay any other
questions
yes the question is if there's a new
gear package Explorer yes series I'll
share it a little bit later and it's
faster than Visual Studio which I as I
always say - Martin Martin Bala did
anyone go to Martin Bala session the
other day where he was showing how they
sorted all of the performance issues
with the new get I think he did a great
job to be honest not this session only
but what they did I say rider proves
that the slowness of nougat is not your
fault because you'll see that it's
pretty fast I actually didn't test it
this morning and the internet here is
crap so maybe I should have shut up
before I said all that okay
regarding refactoring so we have
basically refactor this menu and you can
see that you have changed signature in
line method invert boolean and rename
safe delete extract into a extract super
class extract class which is really
powerful refactoring that we have in
resharper and I will show you each and
every one of these except I won't
because probably none of them work oh
there you go look it does work extract
super class so yeah so basically what
we're doing is all of that functionality
is there and what we've been focusing on
these EAP builds is just surfacing the
UI okay so the last time you know only
two things worked and now extract
superclass even work so I can select the
the actual methods I'm gonna extract and
then just go next and then cancel it and
you also have the platform also provides
you with the preview so you can actually
see all of the refactorings before you
actually commit those ok and inspections
again you can search them off as soon as
they they become available in surface
through the through the settings okay
now Boros coding assistance let's go
back to this version here pardon
SS is
in terms of what's like I'm not
developed in society's packages what
does it require because we have we have
database supports as well I don't know
if you're familiar with data grip have
you heard of our product data grip so
data grip is a standalone IDE which is
actually extracted all of the database
support from IntelliJ which basically
means it allows you to do refactorings
code completion and navigation of
databases right so if that's what you're
looking for
yes no no that's the 16 gigabytes that
comes with Visual Studio so some other
things so for instance let's say now
bear with me here because my c-sharp is
rusty
isn't that oh god what am i doing string
variable name Collin is the other way
round so blah blah right now how do you
write JSON you go
backspace quote no curly braces no
backspace quote name backspace quote :
backspace okay nevermind what you can do
is we have a feature which is called
language injections right and what it
allows you to do is here you actually
can't see it because we don't have the
support for the for the JSON one but
that's coming but what it allows you to
is to take a specific string and inject
another language into it right here what
I have for instance is HTML right so if
I do all regular expression I can make
this a regular expression right and then
it identifies it as for instance a
regular expression okay you see it does
highlighting it as a regular expression
and then I can even do a testing of the
it will surface I could show you this
and in intelligent LJ but let's say for
instance I do HTML body and body and
HTML and then I say make HTML here that
will highlight it okay and then that
would give you completion and it would
give you all of those features right and
the one that I wanted to show you was in
JSON which I'll show you in a second
here I'll launch just want to show you
because it allows you to it even has a
JSON editor so you can basically edit
JSON without having to resort to all of
those horrible little things that I was
just showing you before okay what else
so moving code around we've seen postfix
completion we've seen completion I mean
you've already seen it I can do console
and I get smart completion I get normal
completion there is also the surrounding
code is well so the templates I get file
templates insert templates cert live
templates all of those are available as
well under templates so I have live
templates very html's
c-sharp all of those will be coming
they're already there in other things
here and I mean go to IntelliJ watch if
I do now this is called lin VAR ABC
equals string I can say inject language
reference JSON right and now I can just
say edit JSON fragment and here I can
say name you can see that as I'm typing
that it's showing it right so that's
coming as well okay and that's how you
can do the language references okay you
don't need to actually put this here you
can eliminate that if you want
it's it's mostly is about time so yes it
is out of the box but so all of this is
on the platform all of these features
are on the platform right but they're
not enabled in all scenarios for all
purposes so it's mostly a matter of just
doing you know enabling that the other a
specific issue that we have with
resharper which I'll mention quickly is
that resharper because it's been dotnet
right we've had our own parsers for
JavaScript CSS HTML etc but now of
course coming to IntelliJ platform that
also provides it right so we're trying
to find the best way also to kind of
surface down and see which ones we
choose so some of these are language
injections that you see what's actually
going behind the scenes there is it is
using the the parsers for JavaScript and
for JSON right so it is also a matter of
getting that enable okay yes question
about what powershell I believe I'm not
sure I believe that there might actually
be a PowerShell plug-in or maybe not no
there isn't
I owe someone was talking about creating
one no there isn't then if you're
writing something like cloud formation
templates or I don't know arm templates
does it know like any specifics does
have any Intel sense
is there any plugins around that like
does it does it give me anything in this
place because it's very painful and yeah
so if if it is a technology that we're
supporting in resharper then it will
give it to you right if it isn't it
won't so for example we support sam'l we
support certain stuff from unity so all
of these things yes you will have it
right if we don't support something
specific to Azure No then you won't have
that functionality right but what what
is like really important to to note here
and I want to insist on this is that you
know we are sharing all of that code
base with resharper right and that's
important because when like people are
now kind of worried like are you going
to stop developing resharper far from it
because every feature that we had to be
sharper we get people to use it in
visual studio and we get it in writer
this needs resharper plus JetBrains
these resharper because it's one of our
best selling products right so you know
we're not abandoning one for the other
right we're just trying to give you a
different experience but in terms of
feature wise feature parity it's going
to be pretty much the same right
yeah that's already there well it's
there on RC 1 naught RC 1.5 RC to change
slightly RC 3 is dead RC 4 I don't know
what's going to happen
we will support it properly when
Microsoft supports it properly
okay what about the new get packages and
all that stuff that's already there yeah
I'll show that in a minute okay so some
other things let's go for instant no
let's go back to right at no IntelliJ
some other things let's go and do Game
of Life
okay this is game of life see how fast
it loaded and I can come here and I can
set a breakpoint right and let me show
gutter and I can say debug and I have
debugger and I have all of the
evaluation of the arguments everything
that you could possibly think of it's
all there
okay right so fully integrated debugger
has drop drops tax everything everything
that you would come to expect from a
debugger is working that's for msbuild
notice that everything that I've shown
you right now is for msbuild
projects yes question thank you could
you also connect it to a process for
debugging process yes and of course if
we can read Deepak we can also run as
well right so we can run as well and etc
what about editing continue not yet not
yet but it will be but you normally
shouldn't do that you should unit test
that's how I brought my card
just in case those that are going to
listen to a recording didn't hear that
well the gentleman was asking for
editing continued and that's how he
writes his code mate so right creating a
new project we have empty project which
is actually believe it or not empty as
opposed to some other tools so when you
say create an empty project that does
create an empty project not pointing any
fingers I'm just saying console
application class library so I can say
create and it's you see how fast it is I
mean it's like very very fast and I can
just come here and you know run
console.writeline hello it's me and
breakpoints as well or just run this and
then you can define we have these things
called run configurations which
basically allow you to run the same
applications using different
configuration parameters we've made it
so that you can just hit run and it will
create an automatic one for you so you
can see the output here you can actually
define the tool sets that you use so you
know everything around system to said if
you want to use a custom to moving to
msbuild if you're on windows obviously
it's gonna use the dotnet framework if
you aren't on Linux OSX it's going to
use mono eventually once Microsoft and
xamarin get their act together and ship
one solution which will be done at core
so run about 2028 we will switch over to
that okay regarding a support for dotnet
core yes it's here which one is here
whatever was there before they decided
to change the tool set again load felt
but it works really well other than that
it's it's it's it's it's it's really
fast so let me show you another example
here cake okay you over an old cake cake
is c-sharp make because what else could
you call something that's cake
and we have unit testing so I can just
come here and say you know run unit
tests so you have X unit and unit all of
these available already right so running
the unit tests ok new gate explorer so
right now when you open a solution that
has new get it already goes and fetches
everything ok so it does new get restore
and then new get here is our new get
package let's minimize that and know
that I said minimize go away ok let's
let this all run and then we'll it's
quite fast as well so you can expand all
of these and see like you know all of
the outputs etc ok right now if you come
here you can see all of the packages
that are installed for new gates I can
do search for example easy HTTP now take
into account that this is the internet
right and I can do right click and I
could do install select a version etc ok
so all of the new gate functionality is
also there
pardon do you want to use the command
line yeah no you can do it in any
terminal I mean the command line new get
support is is what's provided by by the
model always say the windows will
Microsoft whatever right I don't know
how much command line support they
actually have on the OS X but it is fast
did you notice that was fast
or not yes it was brilliant yes question
if there's any sort of support for
remote debugging so it's like to enough
to process running on say another
machine on you okay okay what else is
there there's a terminal window we have
a rest client which is until test
restful service is already here
brilliant so this is the ability to
basically test an endpoint an HTTP
endpoint or some hipsters like to call
it a RESTful API so you can do get post
put delete anything you want so if
you're familiar for example with postman
from chrome this is basically the same
thing right and you can upload
certificate you can upload files you can
upload text whatever you want okay
because all of that is also included you
know we have a VCS I can do commit
important to VCS I have perforce support
get support subversion mercurial yes
there's also support for TFS and visual
sourcesafe there isn't anyone use it
recommend it for teams of less than one
person remember that and and then of
course we have all of the other stuff
like JavaScript HTML etc etc etc so for
example if I open an MVC application
which one this one notice that I get all
of those goodies that I have in
resharper as well so I can go to view
command B navigate to the view right
inside the view I have view back and I
have completion as well right and this
is razor combined with C with the C
sharp and combined with HTML combined
with everything right and I can also
debug run and debug applications and
miss your applications okay so for
instance the shared I have the layout
here and I have the action links so if I
delete that you can see that I get a
code completion for all my controllers
and navigate to the actual action back
and forth write all of that again
because we're sharing the same code base
with resharper and as of the VCS I also
told you then you have other things like
for example external tools which allow
you to basically lock this is ones that
I provided myself
I was waiting for Union testing which
basically I defined a call out to an
external application and then getting
back the results inside the actual IDE
an analyze stack trace scratch files as
I said I the scripting console pretty
much what you would come to expect from
a full IDE okay right so with that kind
of gives you a general idea of what is
available already and then again some
useful tips and tricks hopefully of what
you should do when you're working with
this
just remember the shift command a which
allows you to basically look up
something if you don't know it and the
double shift which is the search
everywhere and then the productivity
guide which in this case you shouldn't
be using because it's only two things
anymore any questions any general
questions around writer that HTTP thing
it postman does it store the collection
so you can have a list of things in
there and sort of part of the project
yes
so some other general information when
is our release date we were initially
aiming for sometime at the end of around
autumn now we might be looking at
sometime early 2017 that's why we don't
like giving dates because hey you know
we're very agile in that sense and then
what else price range it's we're looking
at something along the same lines as
what we already provide well has a very
ambiguous way of saying no here's the
thing here's what I can tell you pretty
much is that how many of you are
familiar with the job range to a box
package which basically means that you
pay like I'm a coolant turret we're
talking individual licenses something
like three hundred dollars a year and
you get access to all of our IDs and all
of our dotnet tools right so resharper
ultimate which includes dark cover all
of these things it will be part of that
right so that gives you a general idea
that it won't ever be more expensive
than all of the tools
right what will it be exactly we don't
know will it be obviously we will
probably provide options of things like
you know I'm a resharper ultimate user
that also wants to use Rider is their
availability for me like that yes or I
want to just convert and use rider can I
do that probably will offer all of these
different options but we're generally
talking in the price range of like you
know same as what resharper is and same
as what intelligent Amit is for the I'm
talking right now individual prices
which as you know are heavily discounted
over our official business licenses and
in case you're not familiar business
doesn't mean that you can't use the
individual licenses for business
purposes and commercial you absolutely
can the difference is that one is
purchased in a single person's name
whereas the business licensing is
unnamed so if you have four people
working at the company you can purchase
four licenses and any of those four
people can use it whereas personal
licenses is to the individual okay and
that's it
you can actually now sign up for the EAP
its EAP seven we're going to continue
with a few more private APIs but we will
soon go public EAP and then that would
be open up to to everyone and onion and
I mean I'm still here for another few
hours at the booth so if you do have any
other questions feel free to find me
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
