hero using visual studio team services
my name is Anthony Vaughn I'll be
hopefully entertaining and educating you
for the next 60 minutes and I'm sure
that if that's not the case it's sort of
backs on the lunch so you'll just wander
on out I'll get the message loud and
clear my first opportunity to come and
visit Norway of course my first NDC
conference so a little bit daunted but
looks like an awesome conference out
there so there's a lot of other
conferences I think could learn a thing
or two from from these guys so I'm a
Microsoft Visual Studio ALM MVP sorry
old name Visual Studio and developer
tools developer technologies development
technologies MVP
I think this has been my 11th year now
I've been a Microsoft certified trainer
since 96 and the Microsoft Certified
Professional since 93 he's got a
Microsoft exam this is awesome so it's
going to be 90% keep your hands up
don't go to work for this keep your
hands up if you've done more than 5 10
15 give me wait who's still playing oh
yeah okay so you guys gave up really
really quickly and early and that's
great because it means you've got
interesting hobbies and interests so
yeah so for me that's 60 exams so far
yes that's very few hobbies and
interests and now I'm feeling really bad
about it you can see by the drug a user
I'm part of the Australian contingent we
tend to love coming over here so I
noticed you've got to have quite a few
Aussies on the speaking roster so
hopefully you're being entertained I'm a
visual studio ALM Ranger can I arrange
your shirt on today as well professional
scrum master professional scrum
developer developer trainer way back
when so I'm from a little country called
Australia kind of really isn't that
little when you look at it like back and
noticed you won't even notice that the
shapes a little distorted but that's to
try and get the size perspective correct
so
this was this little infographic that I
bought the other day and what it shows
us is every road and track in Australia
and it's actually quite accurate you can
zoom all the way in I decided to throw
that up there to show you that we all
live on one side and then you got the
people who do the mining on the other
side and in the middles not much except
a desert but come and do the middle it's
great they love the tourists so that's
the geographic distribution that's the
backyard so you have the Coolibar there
and then in the middle the rainbow
lorikeets that's a 3d printed custom
little feeder that I printed for my wife
that's her hand they're holding the
bottom of the tray to feed them and
that's kitty looking on you know making
sure they all behave most of the most of
the pets and the visitors in the art of
welcome most of them but we do have the
occasional visitor that's not most
things seem to bite you and kill you
down there I'm not really doing tourism
the world of good for my my country but
that fellow was sitting in the tree
probably about three meters from the
back door my wife calls him boots
because you misbehaves and plays badly
with the other pets we gets turned into
a pair of boots we also have other
interesting signs that you don't seem to
see too many other places when you
travel this kind of works but where dogs
has nothing on this side we wear snake
seems to be a lot more effective in
there in keeping unwanted people out so
any good snakes here annoy no I'll bring
some over next year we could start some
biodiversity studies in you know and
don't try and pet them my wife was
talking to boots and I swear any second
she was going to Pat it that one wasn't
poisonous but a good bite a bit of
bacteria and luckily a pleasant day for
you yeah that's enough about me the
opening premise of my talk here this
morning is how things work you get a
great application idea and then you
retire and live an awesome life cycle
lifestyle but that work isn't it great
ideas retire rich it's worked for a lot
of people just not me yet so somewhere
between the great application ID whether
it's all just hours of someone else
and this awesome lifestyle at the end
there's things in between and it's in
between the details that always get in
the way of us and retiring on the beach
and some of the things that we need to
set up there we need of course to be
able to get our requirements get the
requirements recorded somewhere we need
to be able to develop the solution right
the wonderful application how many
people are just developers I shouldn't
say just developers but I'm going to
developers conference I expected to see
some some good action there that's great
we want to build the solution we want to
be able to test the solution we're going
to be able to release the solution as
well monitor the application well there
seems to be a lot of things between that
great idea and our retirement in order
to make all of that work we need some
scaffolding now how do we set up an
environment where we can turn our ideas
into you know these things are going to
make us rich and happy as an example
here we've set up applications are a few
servers we're going to set up our build
infrastructure whether that's you know
from Microsoft as a vendor or any other
vendor it doesn't matter it's still an
environment to be set up managed and
maintained we have multiple environments
or for tests if you think about it of
all of the machines the servers that we
that we buy the tax that we pay and by
tax that's the cost of having them in
our data centers when you think that
well under fifty percent of those are
there for production use ok just think
of that number so 50 percent or more are
not directly for production they're for
our application testing now that's a not
a bad story if we were doing a talk on
Azure dev test labs that's a different
talk one that we won't do today and then
of course we've got the production
environment as well to consider so
between the beginning and the end
there's lots of things to do so the
purpose of my talk is really about how
can we set up an environment to deal
with that scaffolding just one way what
I'm going to talk about as you will have
seen from the
the title of the session is visual
studio team services how many people are
using VSS already Wow that is awesome
that's probably 80% or more all right
we've got some competition most volume
all right so that's awesome so in that
particular case then we'll probably try
and touch lightly on a few of the
simpler topics that I'll see if I can
throw a few extras in for you now by
dealing with that Stephin scaffolding
having that set up for us using it out
of the box so to speak we can save a lot
of time and of course saving times
saving money for us so that's my agenda
what can we do to deal with those things
using the SPS all right so in terms of
getting started 80% of you probably
already know that you can go to visual
studio comm you can sign up for a free
account or three for up to five users of
BSP and all you need to do that is a
Microsoft account parent MSA how do you
get those well I'd suggest everyone in
the room already has one probably they
were your Hotmail accounts Outlook
accounts live IDs passports net
something or others they've had
interesting names over the years what
did I leave out I've got most of them so
if you haven't got one you can sign up
for a free outlook.com email and
suddenly you've got an MSA which lets
you go if you sign up it's really that
easy something I'll often do I'm a
trainer by trade so something I'll often
do with EFS courses is also to encourage
people to simply go and sign up for the
SPS to see what's coming what's you know
going to be in the next update for VSPs
there's not a whole lot of fun when the
tool you're using gets updated every
three weeks it's like Christmas every
every three weeks yeah not as
enthusiastic about that are you alright
you try training it you tried developing
courseware with lots of slides and
screenshots and then Microsoft go again
your navigation
and you're going yay mm screenshots to
readers
yeah those includes Jessica exciting for
me I can tell you the time we can
certainly get set up quickly and easily
you don't want to start by initiating
our first project we're going to go
ahead and create a new project and as
for the session title we want to go from
zero maybe not a hundred percent zero so
I've already got my account set up but I
will start by creating a brand new empty
team project we want to choose our
process we want to choose our version
control provider get a team set up set
up some iterations so we'll do those
things you know reasonably quickly that
all right so let's go across to VSS so
there's in your navigation let's zoom
that in a little bit more for people
that should be a tap back there some
thumbs up alrighty thank you alright
similarly create a new team project that
particular team project I think we
should call Internet I don't talk like
this at that it was still a kid back
then sigh take a New Zealand when the
conference center had an internet outage
yeah really not such an exciting
presentation without the internet or
really slow in today in two or three
doses this morning that normally happens
very very quickly what
is there a wide company-wide Network
nope alright so you know something jokes
just wow that's really go slow down
quite considerably eruption there ok
from 0 to hopefully somewhere in 60
minutes is the new title the talk
alright so let's go with MVC Oslo 2017
will be our team project name and well
that's the start of my typing prowess
MVC rocks that's a good description for
our project what's your dish so you can
centralized or decentralized for
distributed version control they will
run with gifts in terms of the process
templates
I'll choose agile one of the really
exciting things there with fierce kiss
is the fact that we can have inherited
process templates now for anyone that's
started with T offense who's ever done
process template customization on CSS
yeah not fun at all so that whole thing
changes with BSP for a long time you
couldn't customize in fact I should be
doing things in case the internet plays
up again so I'll go ahead and just
choose agile for my demonstration and
you'll see there was a inherited
customized run there I could have used
and also create that's going to go and
quickly create that team project for me
to finish my other points the template
customization experience in VSPs
is just worlds apart from what that TFS
experience handcrafting xml files is all
about now it's a really nice web-based
experience dragging fields around so
those days hopefully long behind us
okay so I'll go ahead here and I pass
over a new project landing page there
I'll make it a favorite so in the new
navigation experience it's all about
it's all about you so you can have your
favorite build your favorite project
your favorite queries and the landing
page that shows you just those things so
we'll favorite that I'll go down here
and say just initialize here for a
moment to initialize and while we work
that another little ad hoc survey
because I love collecting information
for my training so between say the tube
the to version control providers you see
there the TF VC for centralized get for
distributed who's using T fvc okay and
get so probably two-thirds get compared
to T FEC okay so it's going to head and
done that for us the option here to
create a CI build we haven't let me code
yet I'll just hide that one away I'll
choose edit here switch back grab some
custom markdown there and yeah you don't
know what you type that will replace the
default placeholder text with my
placeholder text and commit that and you
want to go ahead and start configuring
our team so you'll see up there it's got
it's got me there so I'll go ahead and
add another team member
maybe just one team member today
remember this tomorrow all right
seriously maybe just one team member so
normally I'd go in there and choose to
add a couple of team members just to
show that very simple experience it's
not worth the wait trust me and that's
good it shouldn't be a complex or
difficult thing so just imagine was gone
and chosen to add my wife it would have
made a feel warm and fuzzy to be
included in a presentation and now she
won't be happy with me that's all right
all right back over there
so the next thing we want to do is let's
start with our requirements so I want to
get our requirements recorded into the
SPF we'll start by putting in our PBIS
we can set up portfolio backlogs if you
haven't already sent it we might have a
diffuse that's being nice we'll have a
very quick little look at some
customization very very quick you'll see
the work item forms now given how many
of you are are already using the SPS
those work item forms aren't new to you
so people that are using on-premises TFS
this will few
depending on whether you've moved from
2015 over to 2017 yet you might see that
those work out in forms have changed the
appearance of them all the fields are
still there it's just a process of
retraining the muscle memory fuels in
slightly different places for us on the
up side of it it's far more useable far
more functional and also we've got
things right it's now going to be mobile
aware and reactive responsive so with
different sized devices and screens if
it's a much better story than what we've
had in the past so let's see how the
web's going to behave for us now so I'll
go across here and say that we want to
start adding some work
okay the redesigned landing page makes
that a little quicker and easier
in to our Kanban board that makes them
good improvements and customizations -
this one will go to the backlog and we
can just start by adding in our user
stories and I'll do that very very
quickly so let's accept visa as claimant
for items in the cart will borrow a bit
of that accept mastercard accept
let's go bitcoin just to mix it up a
little bit so then we can dump down our
ideas quickly and easily create I use
the stories create the backlog
drag-and-drop reprioritization all the
fairly standard things we can go in and
have a look at these and to the TFS
previous version users I could have said
that better you'll notice maybe for the
first time that that forms a little bit
different from what you used to okay it
is a lot better for us straight away off
the top here of the titles there we have
tags at the top of the work item form
before I would tags the most important
thing the answer is they weren't it was
just an implementation convenience to
get those tags at it in there for us
don't think there's so many little
trivial things here I'm not going to go
through all of them while my favorites
just a little seemingly innocuous thing
at the top there so if we were going to
have a discussion a conversation about
this particular user story with the
previous work out on forum you'd go down
to the history in the bottom right hand
corner you'd have to scroll down there
you're good discussion you don't start
typing things and you might say why are
we doing it this way and if you were
likely someone would go down and see
that and answer it but how many people
really went wandering into that
particular corner just in case there was
a conversation it wasn't very usable so
here if we go down and start a special
we leave the tacos there and we'll go
back in there but simple little
indicator to say there's more
information here a quick link on that
hyperlink to take us down to see the
discussion points okay a trivial thing
but it does make it a whole lot more
usable compared to what we had before
there are lots of other examples there
but I'm not going to go through with you
up here just this little follow button
is another great example so I have a
particular vested interest in this
requirement so a single click here sets
up a notification subscription for me so
if anything changes about this
particular work item I'm going to be
notified via an email and then when I'm
done with that I don't need to know any
more it's just as easy to click and
unfollow the work item this is how it
should be these little single click
experiences if you compare that to going
and setting up alerts in previous
versions it was a lot more than just
that a convenient click experience so
the time some really good things here
I'll close out vellum sometimes we'll
start with our stakeholders talking
about the individual things that they
want sometimes they'll look at the big
picture first doesn't matter we'll go
into our features and as a feature I
might say we want to accept all common
online pen methods okay so it bigger
picture side of things
we'll go back to stories and with a
simple mapping I can then set up the
bidirectional links between those so
simple drag-and-drop they're sets up the
parent-child relationship between them
if I then turn that mapping off say show
parents you start to see what looks like
a more traditional work breakdown
structure there we could have started
with the features first and decomposed
it or you can go the other way it's
entirely up to ya the product owner
whoever's putting these requirements
into the system for you
okay I was going to talk about some
customization so if I go into the user
story a couple look at this drop down
menu over here there's some interesting
things in the drop down menu I will see
if we get time to talk briefly about
marketplaces to extensions that Springs
in mind so if I go and grab say we'll
start with the feature and let's choose
to visualize it since was an extension
created by the visual studio ALM ranges
available from the marketplace and what
that allows me to do is to simply
visualize those work items if anyone can
solve that extension no Thank You Martin
all right got another hand no I got my
hopes up okay
so guys want to show you the marketplace
this one is really cool so I can easily
go in there look at these relationships
I can say show work items only or show
work items with changes and files we've
not checked in any files yet but it
could then drill right down to files I
can set little comments on their little
annotations check this with Bob some
other text they're small yeah let's make
it small and the shape is going to be a
red arrow red arrows are important and
then I can go and link that to a
particular work item or file here and it
ate it save it out as an image if I want
to do that I can save this so you can
easily get back into it again so some
people find that really really helpful
that's let's jump back out of there but
the one that I wanted to show you that
started it was that little customize
button name okay for those of you that
have done customization using TFS with
the XML files this is just so so much
easier okay I can select an existing
process template there okay I can say
you want to create a new field please
here are some options for it the layout
where I want it to appear I'm not going
to go through the finer points and lucky
to sort of teach you that but just show
you that wow it is so much nicer there
now what we had before we spam with TFS
so well worth a little bit of a look
around and the in fact that you can do
those
inherited templates is really really
nice okay but we won't be looking at
that today so I've got the requirements
in there go back to there alright
something else jump analysis so I'll
also talk under work items there's
another one method shows dependencies
that's another extension and I'll sort
of just mention extensions as we go and
then I'll show you where you can find
them a little bit more information about
them at the end the extensions come from
the marketplace is really a great range
of extensions there to add little
capability a little bit to polish into
the product to solve particular
challenges whether you want to consider
creating those extensions yourselves put
them on the marketplace to help others
whether you just want to be able to
consume those to make the product you
know do those extra things that you
really really need it to do works for
any of those mcadams what else grabs on
you there are the notification
experience so previously that was
setting up alerts so project alerts just
wallow here I can go up here and say I
want to look at my notifications so our
notification experience is being
significantly improved you'll see here
that I can simply turn those
notifications on or off for those people
have been using either TFS or VSDs for a
while we've wanted that when we set up
our alerts as they were called I can say
Oh tell me an alert if this build breaks
send me an alert if anyone checks into
this particular branch send me an alert
if we get a priority one bug but what if
you didn't want those for a little while
there was no easy way to simply turn
those off they will work around but you
know that's a little bit different the
experience of going in and creating
those is a lot better the small screens
not so much top right xxx
okay so if you wanted to be notified
when something happened I can say let's
go into work items when a work item is
created click Next
okay so it's still a very similar
experience it's just the other polish
that's been applied there makes working
with these notifications so much better
point for saving them get out of there
okay let's go back okay so we've got our
backlogs started next thing I want to do
in terms of setting up you know or what
the scaffolding can do for us is we want
to start our development so of course we
get Enterprise class version control
whether you're using centralized or
distributed version control really
doesn't matter there's great integration
between work items and source control
that ability for traceability that's one
of the big things in the classroom when
I'm teaching people are using this for
the first time particularly with an
audience of developers telling people
they've got to create tasks telling
people that they really want to link
their commits or their check-ins to
those tasks for traceability is often a
hard sell because what a lot of the
developers I work with the best thing
you can do for them is lead in the line
and let them develop that's their
passion their enthusiasm so when you
tell them they've got to go and create
tasks and work items an account oh
actually accounts of terrible word to
use they've got to plan that work out
and then link back to it you know sell
them on the traceability story that's a
challenge to start with but then when
they see that flow through to the build
two releases to QA the benefits the
benefits to themselves using annotate or
blame to be able to see who changed the
line of code when they changed it why
did they change it and delete that back
to go from this feature and track it
down to every line of code that was
written or change to deliver that
feature or conversely here's a line why
is it here now that's that's a heck of a
lot of value so
what what I'm doing is go and get
started with some version control so
I'll go over here
and we're going to jump into Visual
Studio I'll go and connect to that
particular new project we've created
fascinating
alright let's connect that one it's way
too many accounts and projects you can
tell ok I'll go ahead and choose to run
that repository great and be patient and
wait for it or if that's going to come
back and hit me all right it's on but I
say I'm going to do its go and create a
solution in terms of what I want to show
you here when I go to write code I'm not
going to change the font for the code
editor window in Visual Studio we're
just going to choose a very stock
standard windows on that web application
again we're not here to sort of write
applications so I'll just use a simple
template I got out here and give it a
name so we'll call it our MVC web so
that looks fine
and we'll say okay now that's concerning
me just a wee little bit in the
background I'll make it just simple web
forms it really doesn't matter given
time you notice that I chose not to go
and add a unit testing project they're a
little bit more time it'll be nice to
sort of throw some unit testing in there
to see that will happen automatically in
the build to show the the testing side
of the story but I think time is going
to beat me there so I'll skip that one
and hopefully that shouldn't take more
than a moment
okay I figure if you close the message
then that can't be bad right
can't see the error it's not an error
famous last words you know I shouldn't
poke the demo God by saying things like
that but I just never seem to learn okay
so I've got ahead and created that
simple solution there okay that looks
okay to me come back over here let's
look at changes initial load of simple
website
all right excellent and we just push
that up so getting our code whether
you're starting with the new project
whether you coming from an alternate
source control provider when I look at
the audience and I see smiling people it
usually means I've done something really
foolish okay that stop smiling okay
and really got nearly done
so regardless of how you manage to get
that source in there where the source
comes from really doesn't make a lot of
difference there I've just created a
very simple template my intention is by
the end of our session today is tablets
running up on aja fully tested with full
CI CD pipelines in place and running and
we're already halfway through so that
should be fun assuming in turn it's
going to play along excellent we should
make a really simple change to that so
let's go and find default.aspx and let's
just change that default heading there
to NDC you rocks save that
this is
okay anything from the suicide you
noticed that I didn't choose to link
that back to any task so now if we had
more time there I would have gone along
and had a look at decomposing the
requirements into the task we could have
then linked those commits to the
appropriate tasks along the way a lot of
you are already using the tool and I'm
assuming that you're doing that at
minimum so so I've tasted some shortcuts
laughs all right so first source code
here next we want to talk about is
setting up a CI CD pipeline continuous
integration continuous delivery or
deployment to get the application up to
to Asia okay as far as the automated
build goes we want to set up an
automated build and while my application
is a very simple c-sharp web application
one of the key things about VSPs
is that it's basically any language any
platform if you've seen any other talks
talking about this if you've seen any of
Microsoft's marketing these are big big
messages for well for a little while
again any platform any language so while
I choose to stick with my comfort zone
which of course is net that's certainly
not in any way a limitation of the
tooling that you see here in setting up
a CI city pipeline there's multiple ways
we can do this I can go across into the
azure portal and use an experience of
there to get the source and to set up
that pipeline I can go into the web UI
and I can create the pipeline from there
I can do it from visual studio and I can
use other tools to do it so there's lots
of different ways I'm just going to
choose to show a very convenient and a
quick way to help us now get started to
try and get that idea to retirement
happening far more quickly so I'm going
to use the continuous delivery tools for
Visual Studio it is an add-in it's not
something that's out of the box for us I
have already put it into my visual
studio so let's have a look so if I go
across to Visual Studio IDE up to tools
extensions and updates'
come on there we go
I'd normally click on online here I'm
mindful I'm not going to do that make a
drug of incident right now so I'd
normally click on online guy appear to
search and I'd simply type the word
continuous that's going to refine what
options are available for me and the one
that I'm looking for is already
installed so at the top there the
continuous delivery tools for visual
studio
okay so just calling that one out as
something I have added in there okay
close here now the benefit of having
thatl the feature that it provides for
me is when I got to my solution I can
right click on that solution and choose
to configure continuous delivery okay
that's where that menu item comes from
so if you don't see it you know exactly
what the reason is I'll select select
continuous delivery and it's going to
say ok there's the repository we want to
use we'll go from the master branch I'll
choose the particular subscription so if
you've got multiple Asia subscriptions
choose the ones that you want to use I'm
going to create a new app service but I
can choose to go in there and change
some of those values I'm going to choose
to send this up and just use the
standard as your website I can go in and
choose other sizes of that if that's
what I wanted to do I can also go in
there and use as your resource
management soar manager I can go and set
up some templates there's a lot more
capability that I won't drill into in
this walkthrough other cancel there and
say well they're pretty good options and
I'll click on OK so right now what it's
doing is it's going to go and create
that CI city pipeline for me it's going
to take me generally a lot longer to
talk about it then it will take to
actually do the job here so it is going
and creating a build for me that's using
the hosted build provided up in the SPS
it's going to create that build
definition it's going to use a standard
templates to do that for me so we'll
look for an automatically executed unit
test that it finds it's going to go and
create a release definition for me it's
going to go
and set up their release pipeline I
should really call it much of a pipeline
because there's going to be one task in
there that's all we need to deploy a web
application up well this web application
up to Asia must be very clear they can
get a lot more involved if you look down
there now it's looking a little bit
better
okay creating the build and release
definitions so they're gonna have to go
up to Asia and do some work there so
that might be a little bit more
temperamental with our internet
hopefully not too time-consuming let's
use this tool while I been around for a
little while now so continuous delivery
tool set just man oh yes but when you're
joined by someone else awesome
I saw at least one other hand and it was
just one hand
okay so hopefully you'll all go and
download it and have a look at it I
think it's pretty cool
it'll be very is done okay so I really
didn't do a lot of work let's see what
it's done for us okay so if we switch
back over to the web UI I'll go in and
say show me my bills and you'll see that
we've got to build there and right this
moment it's currently in progress so not
only does it create the build definition
create the release definition set up the
azure resources we need it then goes in
triggers that process for us so right
now that builds in progress we can prove
it if it's still going I'll click in
there and have a look and it's succeeded
so it has finished give it a little bit
more time 60 minutes a bit of a squeeze
we could have gone in created some tests
there we could have set up some army you
know code coverage results and metrics
we could have seen a lot more
information on the screen here but so
far so good the builds happened that
should've then automatically treated for
us the release so let's move across and
have a look at the release definitions
ok so right now that's been pretty great
progress so it's built the release
definition for me and it's currently
deploying that very very simple web
application live up to Asia the
to my knowledge government have loaded
Asia portal at all I set up nothing
there other than choosing my
subscription and the size of the as your
website resource that I wanted to use
okay that'll be clear I could have done
this manually I could have done this by
going across and using the Asia portal
as an alternative way of doing this okay
let's see what they've done for us and
with any luck our deployment has
succeeded so if I remember what I call
the website and they see whether if my
guess is going to work it's going to be
MDC web dust Asia websites touch yes and
it's really an help if I don't make
typos on this example and you go to
college okay what do they cool
Snoopy's that one way that I made it
into bread that's looking a little bit
better
totally
curious okay no matter how many times
you rehearse something you know if it's
ever going to go wrong you'll be
standing up for you when that happens
sorry I thought it wasn't my era all
right what exactly did I delay I'm going
to remember the name yeah probably
should have paid more attention to Assam
resources before I eat some names
okay so let's hide the evidence has one
now call it so with a little bit of
entertainment thrown in there
unintentionally I've used that to go and
create the building all these pipelines
let's take a moment to have a look at
those so if I go over here yep
leave it hide it carefully let's see
what it's done for us I'll choose that
particular build a look at the build
definition and in a moment you'll see
that we've got the standard build steps
shown okay so it's gone and created this
for us we are using the latest in terms
of the editor experience so up here
we've got our get sources notice that
we're pulling our sources from this
project we could easily pull from github
remote repo subversion okay we're going
to get restore there another semi recent
enhancement fee is with each of these
build steps so each of these tasks is
now independently versioned that's been
there for a little while again depending
on whether you're the SPS or on-premises
TFS but that little flag there tells me
that there is a newer version of this
particular task available so I can go
over here and have a look and we're
currently using zero point something and
there's a version one there so I can
choose selectively when to take an
update to the next major version of that
particular step
we build our solution and notice that
that's put those msbuild arguments in
forests finally okay for those people
that have used or created these build
pipelines before how many times have you
gone in and put in those msbuild
arguments not many times okay a couple
of hands thanks Martin
not me you excited by that put it in
automatically yeah thank you okay
having to put those things in yeah I'm
easily easily entertained I'm really
intolerant I guess that's the other way
of looking at it let's go with the other
ten part our first assemblies here of
course are going to go automatically
look for any particular unit tests that
are available they didn't have any in
there we'll publish our symbols publish
the artifact back up to the server so it
does that work for me but it just
creates that particular build definition
now I can enhance it improve it modify
it anything I want it just helped me get
started more quickly and easily if you
move across and have a look at the
release that it's done for us you'll see
that on this occasion the release is
very very straightforward I have got a
single environment and within that
environment my my pipeline has just a
single item in there you'll see that I'm
using the latest preview of the editor
which take a little bit of getting used
to
I've got to save so I'm sure I'll make
some interesting little clicks here
again it's that muscle memory that's
used to going and doing this without the
brain engaging that doesn't work well
these days so I'm getting my artifacts
from the build although I can go and
modify that I can choose to pull my
artifacts in from various locations I
can say I want to fetch these files
these additional things here bring them
all in so that we can release them I've
got one environment called production
there okay and we can go and have a look
at the properties of that environment
I'm the current owner of that
environment I can specify some policies
for if I want to I can go and choose the
pre-approval people person or
post improvements for me I'll say I will
look at some pre deployment conditions
so I want it to be triggered on the
release there is it can be triggered
manually is it going to be scheduled in
terms of the pre deployment approvals
I've set it up for automatic or sorry
that is that a fault I can say before we
deploy I want specific users I'll go in
here and say we want me okay and I can
go and add other people in there
multiple people if I wanted to do so so
for those I'm innocent production but if
we were to go in and have a traditional
dev test staging prod whatever stages or
environments you've got then those lower
environments like dev you'll probably
just set them up for auto what I've
proven a movie way through them as you
get through through to test through to
production then of course you've now got
release manager's configuration managers
as always that great process there to
get in there to get in your way okay
I think Damien radio - good talk on that
stay installed yesterday or today you
want to attend Damien's talk on some of
the garbage in the pipeline it was
yesterday was it okay so if I go in and
have a closer look you'll see here that
I've got just a single step in order to
be able to deploy this okay it points to
the particular subscription I want to
use the app service name I can set up
sorts slots I can set up to
automatically swap slots the things
we've been able to do with as your web
applications for quite a while now if I
wanted to I can go and say they want to
go and add some additional steps and I'm
not going to go through all those steps
for you they are logically grouped
across the top there but I can go and
now add quite a lot of flexibility
depending on the applications I can
deploy databases as part of it as well
services I can employ on premises I can
deploy up into the cloud I mean there's
a lot of flexibility there and if you
need a step that's not available that's
where the marketplace comes in so you'll
see how clear that I only go and check
out the marketplace okay I'll say sure
let's do that okay I'm not sure if I
asked the question already who's been in
the marketplace to grab an extension
that's not too bad so that's that I
guess maybe let's just shy of a quarter
of the audience so in marketplace I'll
select VSS up the top here and start
looking down there are tools that will
allow me to automatically stamp the
assembly info so I've got a consistent
numbering on all of the assemblies
created in my release or build I've been
going scroll down here what's going to
grab my are today
SAS build and deploy if they're the
types of applications that you're
working on
Kuban eighties if you're going to use
accumulations for the container services
octopus deploy if you know if your
organization happens to use octopus I'd
normally give that little plug there for
Damien that is now joined Microsoft
party app 2.0 is web applications to
on-premises they finally use any of
these I can simply select it and then I
can choose to install it into my BSP
account or I can go and download it and
install it into my on-premises TFS not
every extension gives you both of those
options but I'd have to say the majority
certainly do okay if it is vs TS you've
got to be an appropriate account owner
to go and install those extensions if
you're not you can then put in a request
to say hey I'd like to go and grab this
extension and hopefully your VSS account
managers will go in there and install
those and improve them for you or
anecdotally I'd say that 95% of them are
probably free and expect to sort of see
that continued others are going to be
free but you can offer donations and I
love that model and of course then
you've also got the paid for ones so the
marketplace is great for plugging any
little gaps or so they have some
integration with other tools that your
organization might use
ok so we're always having a look at ok
all right actually want to have a look
at is how we can go and monitor our
application so setting up telemetry how
we get to keep an eye on the application
making sure that it's running that it's
healthy it's really quite adverbs and I
open up so many of my sites are going to
say when you turn this on and you know
there are going to be errors they're
happening everyday you didn't really
know about well for my site maybe not
yours so I mean that telemetry is a
really positive thing you can monitor is
your website's that's of course the one
that I'm demonstrating for you here
today but you can also work with them on
premises websites and a variety of
others for us who's using application in
fact today for telemetry wow that's
awesome that's about half other tools of
the chama tree providers just one all
right
so in terms of monitoring our
applications let's go and add
application insights in here so go back
over here we'll go and select our web
application i'll say that i want to go
into configure application insights
you'll see here they've made this
experience much nicer application
insights has had a an interesting
journey as someone that sort of develops
courseware all the time you know those
I'll call it's the first version of
application insights and what it was and
then it sort of morphed and decided my
courseware and then it sort of finally
found out or figured out what it needed
to be and that's where we are today so I
think the experience with application
inside C is is a lot better today okay
so if you've looked at it in the past it
is worth another close look
so you'll see here that I can simply go
and say get started for free I go to the
details here modify a change any of
those that I want I'll just simply say
register the application that's going to
do most of the heavy lifting for me I
should take more than a moment you
notice the SDK was already there so the
template includes most of the hooks and
the things that we need to get started
excellent
and I'll say finish there if you have a
look at 80% complete and then we'll
choose whether arts you want to enable
an event trace collection or trace
collection and I'll say yes we may as
well throw that one in as well doesn't
take a heck of a lot of extra time and
we're done so setting up that telemetry
by simply going through and using those
wizards is absolutely fantastic so exit
out of here okay let's go and check
those changes in I'll commit them of
course the process of doing this I'll do
the moment triggering that push it's
automatically then going to go and
rebuild my application redeploy it and
that time a tree will exist within the
application if we do have enough time I
might do too much thank you
yeah thank you very much
excellence here makes a whole lot of
difference doesn't it thank you all
right that shouldn't take too long okay
so once that's been added we can easily
get access to application insight that
provides these little shortcuts for us
there'll be no data up there yet I
actually run the application it's still
in process of being built and deployed
but I think don't see the site again no
really interesting data there for us
right now okay but they will start
showing something more useful I can
choose to go in and keep an eye on the
application so set up some availability
monitors I can say I want to create a
simple test in this particular case
we'll just use a ping test is app alive
still web sites can I leave an airsoft
before if that's what it was copy we'll
find out I know it starts to check every
maybe 10 minutes I can choose the
locations but I want to use we'll leave
just those us ones selected I will throw
us in just people just because I can
click on create' that's going to go and
create that availability monitor so for
most six locations ended up choosing
it's going to sit there and just ping
that application every 10 minutes that
will give us interesting telemetry about
the availability of it we can set up
alerts be notified of the site's
unavailable at any point in time okay
now a little bit curious that we would
like to see the application to get
deployed after all right
that's fascinating
and given the time we're not going to
try and troubleshoot that although that
was kind of supposed to be one of the
really interesting things about that
wizard and I'm sure are we looking at
the video to find out what little click
I have not done correctly there okay
Mike might be very interesting for that
availability monitor to not really save
my sites as a hospital but that's fine
for today so let's get back out of there
okay so adding that telemetry into the
web application again a very very easy
thing that saves us a lot of a lot of
effort finally making this information
available so we've set up all of the
orchestration to the application we've
got it setting up with a build and
release pipeline that's not really
releasing just at the moment so how can
we display this information so that
stakeholders or team members can see
exactly where we're up to so we'll jump
across and the final thing I want to
show you is I want to go and create a
dashboard so go into my dashboards here
leave that page gory I'll choose to
create a new dashboard the dashboard
might just be called release and we'll
grab anything to do with building the
lease for now so I might say let's throw
this one up here the builds health
overview build usage you want to keep a
track of the build minutes that I'm
consuming from my VSS account as your
account build history let's keep an eye
on mass and maybe one over deployment
status sure squeeze that one down there
we can go into the extension gallery so
if I click on the extension gallery
that's going to take me to the
marketplace I'd normally go in there and
choose application insights and see that
I can get some of that application
insights information and also expose
that through my dashboards in here for
now I'll go in and just say they're not
to configure these arms so in terms of
my build history or go and choose the
particular build definition okay so i've
had two builds and they both work that's
positive over here let's see what's
available to us I'll select that build
again and last but not least a
deployment status and of course is only
one branch
they answer amused you there okay
I've run no test for that information
won't be shown I'll say okay so right
now we're seeing that the last two
deployments to production were both
successful they're out there somewhere
out there some of them good sure all
right so that'll be enough for the
dashboards there's plenty of things in
VSS that we haven't had time to look at
just in the time that we've got
available I'll swing back over there
some of those could include there's so
much more in work atom tracking
reasonably recent comparatively recent
addition is package management so
looking at how we can use package
management for both our new get
compatible feeds and Kim and a variety
of and move it at the moment I think
it's those three preview thank you
so the some other ones out there we can
go and some of the more recent releases
they've renamed some of the tasks so
setting up easy deployment building
deployment of packages to share
privately within the organization is
much much easier code search whose size
using code search it's been available
for a while in DSPs no guys code search
is amazing and given the proportion of
you that are developers absolutely have
a look at code search I've got verge I
really haven't put any code up there but
if we go into code
we're in even to the home page the
landing page up here
it's a context aware search I can say I
want to find hello world where it's used
as a property as a constructor as a
method as a string literal I can easily
go out there and search across multiple
projects an entire repo so those are you
using VSS that was a lot of you have a
look at it and of course with TFS 2017
you've got the ability of having code
search on-premises as well
yeah hint make sure you have a peek at
that one okay for those of you that are
using it back me up here good
Thank You Martin
all right great all right
and look bunch of other thing to say but
I am here at a time and standing between
an audience and lunch is never a good
idea so hopefully we've seen how the
f-test can really set up the environment
for us all that scaffolding is available
for us out of the box to hopefully get a
stud or some lifestyle a lifestyle a
whole lot more quickly and easily I'll
be hanging around for a little while
during lunch so if you've got any
questions I'm more than happy to take
them enjoy the rest of your conference
and things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
