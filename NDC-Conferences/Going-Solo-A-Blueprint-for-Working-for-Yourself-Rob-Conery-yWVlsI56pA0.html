the day no there's one more right all
right all right just curious just wonder
how many more of these things I have to
sit through did I say that out loud okay
well let's get started
thanks so much for coming everybody this
talk is as you can tell going solo
getting started on your own I want to
start off by saying that this isn't
about pumping up saying that you know
you can do it you know just get out
there and you know it's easy because it
isn't this is supposed to be a very
pragmatic talk I wanted to give a
blueprint talk about what I've done what
I know other people have done just so
you know I have had to start my own
thing about five times now so I kind of
have this down and I have a pretty
specific perspective but my hope is that
when you walk out of here you'll have
some notes some pictures things that you
can actually go and do other than just
feel good about yourself what you should
maybe you're here because you are out on
your own right now and you're wondering
what other people are doing maybe you're
wondering that would be like to go out
as a contractor and farm your services
out so let's just start there but I
always tell people that when you go out
to be a solo contractor writing code for
companies or other people it's sort of
like turning the gain upon your career
that's the best way I can put it like
things are more scary everything means
something more everything's more
liberating and happy it's it's a really
fun thing to do it's a great thing to do
for your career but a lot of people
don't like that and honestly it's
stressful
it really is stressful and you're
wondering when you're gonna get paid
next you don't have the safety net of a
big company behind you and it involves a
lot of failure honestly and when you do
fail it can hurt and the problem with
this is the problem is that people are
afraid of failing and I was just talking
to a friend today about this that a
failure is something that really should
be embraced it really is because
failures it just means you're trying
you're trying and you're learning and
you can use those skills to move forward
and it's okay to fail you're starting
starting out on your own is hard because
the perspective of this entire
is that you're actually starting a
business and when I say that to people
they don't believe me like this I'm just
gonna go and I'm gonna just this
person's gonna pay me like no you
actually are starting a business and and
I'm gonna I'm gonna probably assume that
most of you are not gonna believe a lot
of the things I'm gonna say because
everything I want to say today is gonna
be fairly obvious but you're gonna find
yourself senior I'm not gonna do that
part and that's gonna be tough and the
reason that people don't want to do that
is because the idea of starting a
business is a little bit terrifying
because you have to go through and jump
through a lot of Hoops but it's actually
really kind of straightforward you
wouldn't believe it if you've got the
plan in place you can sell just about
anything this was all the rage when I
was a kid in the 70s people sold rocks
in a box and they called him pets and my
parents thought it was funny and they
gave me one hahaha for Christmas and I
like it went viral it was probably when
the very first things to go viral and
everybody thought it was hysterical
here's another one this is the flow bees
anybody heard of this thing you attach
this to a vacuum cleaner it spins a
razor and cuts your hair so there's no
mess no fuss it's ridiculous this one's
great live water this one's making the
rounds does anybody heard of live water
unfiltered uncleaned water straight from
the ground and you can buy this really
cool crystal thing and it comes straight
out of the ground for 130 dollars and it
is alive with all kinds of goodness like
Giardia and eco light amoebas and that's
not true they actually do test it but
these things are actually a problem that
historically we've figured this out
already
in fact these little plushies these
plushies are great this is another
business that's out there and I figure
that people in Europe would really
appreciate the plagues from history oh
this is a fun one yeah this was a black
death cholera typhoid you guys seen
these things before there's another one
that I took out because it was too gross
it was different kinds of poop you can
buy that for your friend so what I'm
trying to get around to showing you is
that the idea is actually secondary you
know they just you everybody says you
have to have a good idea to have a good
business that's not really true you just
got to be able to execute and and and
get your idea or get your product out
there the good news for it for you
you have an idea and the idea is you and
your ability to code things that are
it's already done
and believe it or not you are a quarter
way through the whole process of
building a business I also want to be
positive here and say that if you go out
on your own and you screw up we don't
you don't have enough money or whatever
is happening you will be forgiven your
partner whoever is depending on your
money or maybe it's just you you will
forgive yourself even if you fail
dramatically you'll start again because
it's it can be a lot of fun and very
rewarding even if you don't ever want to
do it again at least you did it so now
you know something okay so let's start
again and say I want to say that this is
all about you as a business and this is
a critical perspective so you're not
just going out as Joe or Joleen Smith
and saying hi hire me I'm a coder you
need to structure something and it needs
to start with recognizing that you are a
business selling a service once you make
that recognition and believe it and
internalize it then you start to realize
that nothing is new in terms of starting
a business it's all been done before the
machinery has been there for hundreds
and thousands of years people know how
to do this and so you can literally look
online at the things you need to do to
start a business I'm simplifying things
a little bit but these are the four
things that you should focus on when
you're going out on your own number one
and I keep telling you it is not it is
not not obvious it's totally obvious
have a plan have a plan a business plan
not just like how am I gonna make money
next week but an actual business plan
I'm gonna go through this in a deep and
in detail in a second a product we've
already done that's you and it's your
ability to code you need support
services something to like
infrastructure to help you out and then
you just need a network of people that
you know in other words marketing and
sales and then you just need to execute
it honestly and I'm telling you it seems
so it's you're probably sitting there
going why am i sitting through this talk
when this person is telling me
everything I know
and the reason is as I get into the
details you're not gonna want to do it I
can almost promise you so let's get to
it
start off with a plan what do I mean by
a plan has anybody here ever filled out
a business plan okay good a few people
not a lot of people actually do that
I only did it once and it's the last
time I filled out or started a business
I just never bothered with it I thought
well I'm gonna write code and sell this
or write code for this company snap a
picture of this this is really just what
a business plan is what's your name
what's your products who are you gonna
sell it to what are your starting costs
what are your monthly costs projected
what do you think you're gonna make
that's it of course you can get more
detailed here in other in terms of the
things you want to fill out but this in
essence is a business plan so let's
start with the very first thing the
business name this is where people put
the brakes on like wait okay it's just
me do I really need a business name yeah
cuz you're gonna be a business so what
would you even pick so there's a couple
of things that you could try just to
throw some names out there you could use
your street I you did that once when I
started out a long time ago I dreamed of
living on the street on kawaii where I
used to live and it was Weeki road man
so I said all right that means available
that's what it's gonna be so I was a
name of my business you can use a
nickname my friend Dave Ward when he was
younger he his nickname was in cocea
which I don't know what that means but
he named his business that song titles
pet's name anything just something that
you can just tell people and give him a
card or whatever things to avoid if you
tie yourself to a technology like node
services or like a Richard Campbell was
laughing about this yesterday dotnet
rocks is the name of their podcast
well if dotnet was ever to go away then
their podcast goes away so you if you
ever decided to change what you do and
your dotnet forever incorporated then
that's gonna be a problem for you
something clever or goofy I highly
recommend you don't do because here's
the thing with having a cool business
name or something that is just relatable
is you are going to be spoken about in
whatever company you work for because
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to get into someone's back pocket
at a company and they're gonna say oh
I've got this person and they work at
and they're gonna say your company name
like my company's name is big machine
current company I picked it out of the
blue it just was a name that I thought
that people could repeat and not feel
like an idiot
so that's my guiding lights on that one
so let's just put a placeholder in for
your business you incorporated so you
can just mentally put your business name
up there right now and if you're
starting to write this thing you might
just fill in the blanks like I don't
know I'm gonna write code for people or
companies that's my product and I'll
work for whoever's gonna pay me and I
don't know cost what are you talking
about this is the best part of a
business plan when you sit and you
staring I need more detail doesn't need
to be a lot of detail but it forces you
to think through everything so let's add
some more detail maybe you want to be a
hired gun someone that goes in and
writes code per hour doing friend and
work maybe you want to go in and be a
triage expert and go in and fix the
system that's blown up it could be
anything but you could detail the
various services that you're willing to
do the market is something that is some
is critical do you want to work for big
enterprise or do you want to work for a
startup write it all out and then the
starting costs this is something that
varies but I usually tell people have
two months in the bank two months of
money in the bank and then some money to
actually pay people to start the company
for you
you're gonna have to have a lot of
services and that usually requires for
me it was about 12,000 total dollars
u.s. so I just translate that to pounds
because I'm pretty sure it's the same
thing and then a monthly budget I have
about $500 and services that I pay for
I'll get those in just a bit when you
start to break out the things that
you're willing to do you start to see
things a little bit differently about
what you're going to be billing for and
instead of just writing code at say 50
pounds an hour you are now having
different rates for the different things
that you can do and you start to
conceive of them as individual services
this means that when you talk to clients
you can have a different conversation
other than what's your rate which is
what a lot of people have to go through
when they're subcontracting and they
talk to a friend
oh my boss needs somebody you can come
in how much are you per hour well you
can get away from that because you are
now a business as I keep saying and you
can think of things in terms of project
billing that is a savior of people who
don't want to get paid 50 pounds an hour
they can say well two weeks worth of
work and you want me to triage this
system that's gonna cost you five
thousand pounds how you spend
time is up to you that's a vendor to
company relationship and I strongly push
you to do that now at this point I could
talk for the next hour about billing in
different ways of billing but I'm just
gonna jump because I have other things I
need to talk about billing clients is an
art and getting money out of them is
it's kind of difficult to do sometimes I
talk a little bit about that but in
terms of how you bill that's a very
detailed subject I would just push you
to think about project-based billing is
if you guys heard of project-based
billing is this a new thing hopefully
good yes so services when you start
doing services for people that hire you
or hire your company you're trading time
for money and at this point you start
thinking about your company is an
abstraction so we can apply some
programming principles here you're
trading your time for money and you have
to think about scaling can you scale
that well how much money do you want to
make the curve on that the scaling curve
is kind of just you can't really make
all that much money and one of the
problems that you get into is as your
own boss you have administrative things
that you need to do and that tug-of-war
causes a lot of pain in your own head
and also with your family when you're
working on the weekends and you want to
go out and do something and I got to do
my books so we have to keep that in mind
thinking about how much we actually want
to spend on our business each month
because the idea is we want to farm out
as much as we possibly can to other
services again I know that sounds
obvious but when we start talking about
those services in just a second you'll
see what I mean if we start out
believing that we're gonna build a
business and put the infrastructure in
place later on when you start working on
something that's interesting or you
write a bit of code that's interesting
or an open-source project you're
involved with and you think I could sell
that then you start selling assets and
when you start selling assets for money
that's when it starts rolling in I'm
going to talk a little bit about this
towards the end but this is one major
reason why you want to have a business
in place because once you have that idea
you want to be able to sell it
well I don't have any think about oh
gosh what do I do now you want it in
place ready to go so again I'll get to
that later on so
about support services in other words
infrastructure for you incorporated as I
go through this I have a feeling I'm
gonna get some resistance which is fine
please just consider what I'm when I'm
offering to you that I've learned this
the hard way over the last 20 years I
consider these the next few slides to be
critical in all of this the first thing
that you should do is get yourself an
accountant in the States I think they're
called CPAs over here is that right okay
well most of the advice that you're
seeing is is is a us-based stuff because
it's my experience but get yourself a
certified accountant somebody that you
can sit with show them your business
plan that you've already written up in
great detail so they can read over it
and they could say oh sure I know how to
structure your business for you in fact
I will go register your name
I'll get you verified with the
government X Y &amp;amp; Z here's the
documentation and everything you need
that's gonna cost you about well in the
US it cost about $750 to $1,000 a CPA
does everything and this comes from a
financial perspective they set you up
they get you in motion and I didn't know
this and my best friend is a CPA which
is funny but one day he said you know
Wyant just let me do this stuff and I
just like I'm not gonna pay you money
Joker and then he said yeah I'll do you
know it only costs this much believe me
you'll have a return and he outlined the
things he was gonna do five days later
in the mail comes the whole bookkeeping
stuff that I needed to get my
corporation running and off the ground
the man is a wizard I never believed I
never believed that a CPA could be that
necessary he has consistently saved me
money he saved me money primarily
because he set my business up with the
right entity in the United States he has
helped me dodge tax polls which would
cause me to be audited and anything else
he made me see that I needed a bank
account I'll talk about that in a second
he made me see a lot of things so I
trust him now with absolutely everything
every single year on my taxes he saves
me between fifteen and twenty thousand
u.s. and that's not an exaggeration at
all I'm able to let him do all that work
and he comes back to me and says here's
how I've shuffled things around for you
and this is how we're going to set
things up and I say okay go for it and
you're done to give me an example of
what I mean in the United States when
you file
taxes you get a number of things that
you can deduct so one of them is
healthcare there's also insurance costs
there's a whole bunch of stuff that you
can deduct and a lot of people will use
software to do this in the u.s. even
businesses and they'll just put all
their expenses in and the software will
decide what you can deduct it's a
painful process it's a lot of work my
CPA said you don't want to have
deductions you want to have expenses so
get yourself a credit card that's in the
name of your business and then when you
go out and you want to buy something
like a computer or a lunch that you're
out with colleague then you just expense
it that goes against your books the
Internal Revenue Service never sees it
and the only way they'll ever see it is
if you get audited and at that point if
it's a bookkeeping error you just shrug
whoops but if it's a bad deduction that
which is the other scenario if it's a
bad deduction they can actually audit
you and they can charge you penalties
and so on just by doing this is lighten
my load I mean you would not even
believe how much money this alone has
saved me okay so I mentioned a bank
account after you go to your CPA with
your business plan he's gonna give you
or she's gonna give you back a bunch of
information about your identification
numbers and everything else you can take
that to a bank and then get a business
bank account this is another thing that
was difficult for me to realize is that
if you mix business business money with
personal money life is terribly
difficult because you can't separate
where the money is coming and going and
who's spending what if you have business
expenses isolated to a business account
life is much easier so this is pretty
straight forward spend the money get
into account I think a friend of mine
said the business bank accounts over
here are free I'm not sure in the u.s.
they cost about $20 a month completely
worth it the next thing is a lawyer and
this is where I always get pushback
people always feel like why should I get
a lawyer I'm not gonna sue anybody and
the power of a lawyer is much more than
suing people it is your big stick and
I'll get into that story in just a
second finding a lawyer is actually
really easy you talk to a friend
same thing with getting an accountant
just talk to some friends talk to people
that do this you will find an accountant
you'll find a lawyer often you'll find
ones that
exactly this exact service for
individual coders that have our business
lawyer will check the CPAs work and make
sure that everything is legal and making
sure that the CPA is on tip top and that
everything that you're setting up is not
going to get you into trouble a lawyer
comes in very handy when you have
clients that decide they're gonna pull
out the last-minute negotiation with you
before you get paid this happens with
every single client all the time and as
you can experience being out on your own
you start to build in a buffer because
you know what's coming and then you just
kind of deal with it it takes a while to
establish a trust relationship with
clients sometimes you get a good one
straight away other times you will just
get the run-of-the-mill client that says
yeah sure I'm how to pay your final
invoice before you do that let's talk
about the the work we have a few changes
we need to make making sure they're in
there oftentimes just do it you know
other times other times they really try
to hold your feet to the fire I had a
client want me to do an additional 20 no
what was it about about 40 hours of work
almost changing everything and they
tried to blame it on me and we were
going back and forth an email and I see
sieved my lawyer and I just said I'm
copying my lawyer on this right now
I told my lawyer that this was gonna
happen I'm seeing my lawyer
every conversation we're gonna have at
this point from this point on my lawyers
gonna be involved at that point I got
paid like within a couple days and I
know it sounds cliche but people that
work in corporations especially don't
want to hear from your lawyer even if
it's just a polite letter if a lawyer
sends something on legal letterhead then
they have to go through their legal
department at a big company usually they
do in fact whenever I worked at a bigger
company they said if you ever got
anything that's from a lawyer
we have to be involved so make sure you
send us an email just that act alone on
their part talking to their legal team
their boss is gonna say what are you
doing and it's gonna bring down a whole
heap of trouble of course if you get to
this point you're cutting ties with your
client because you don't want to be
threatening obviously but having a
lawyer just to kind of casually CCE and
asks certain questions is a good thing a
personal story I wrote a book called the
Impostors handbook I had it printed
the printer managed to send out the
wrong template to all of its physical
printers and so what happened was they
sent out the wrong version of the book
and they took it offline to fix the
problem they took it off for three weeks
over the holidays I lost thousands of
dollars and they would stop responding
to me and I kept emailing them and I
said the next email is gonna be with my
lawyer my cc'd my lawyer and they said
this is your last warning next one is
gonna be a nasty gram and then I'm suing
you for negligence and I had the book
back online within three hours I'm
telling you this is one of the best
things ever and my lawyer said you're
gonna have to pay me this is just what I
do they just kind of hang out and then
when you need them they cost about $100
an hour I know it sounds like a lot but
wow it's so worth it let's talk about
books this is the next thing you're
getting to absolutely make sure you set
up after you get your CPA and your
learner and everyone's happy then you
get to have your bank account then you
set up your books this is where CPAs
advice is golden how do you set up
QuickBooks I don't know if anyone even
here has ever done it it is not the
easiest thing it is intimidating but
QuickBooks works really well if your CPA
is on the ball what they'll probably do
is say I'll set up your company for you
let me get your QuickBooks and they'll
structure your QuickBooks for you and
you're done that's time that you don't
have to spend working on books this time
you can bill a client and your CPA is
just probably gonna charge you 50 or 60
dollars an hour in fact they're not
gonna do it they're gonna have their
bookkeeper do it so I would say if you
don't know which one to do just use
QuickBooks the pricing on this is great
it might be tempting to look at the $5 a
month thing and say oh that's perfect
but that's just for individuals you are
going to be a business so pay the $25 a
month it is absolutely worth everything
the reason why if I can just go back to
the slide for a second is this is going
to be the health of your business
there's a dashboard on here that's going
to track what's coming and going you're
going to invoice people through here
you're going to also accept payment
through here you can take credit cards
PayPal and a bunch of other things so
QuickBooks is great this is the company
that I use which is based in the UK I
love it it's free agent costs $25 a
month it does just about the same things
it's a little bit more friendly here and
there but same thing you can send out
invoices you can do all your money
tracking all through
one interface which is great I just
threw a bunch of stuff at you but I want
to really quickly recap this and I also
want to challenge you a little bit
because I'm wondering if I throw so much
I don't think I can do all this is this
just so much work and the truth is it it
really isn't
it's it once you know what the plan is
what the execution plan is you just have
to go ahead and do it
find a CPA open a bank account get a
lawyer and instead of your books to find
the CPA and the lawyer just talk to
friends of friends family whatever and
you'll get a name easily within probably
a couple days we're almost done believe
it or not we have some extras at the end
the next thing is how are we actually
going to find the work and that's we're
establishing a network comes in so I
like to think of it as establishing a
network as opposed to going out doing
marketing and sales and you know just
handing someone your card and saying
give me work
so yeah let's go into network and this
is actually I have this business card
once and it worked of course I didn't
how do you establish a network and
rather than standing up here and saying
good and talk to people know God and
talk to people that's everyone but how
are you actually ask them about any
possible work they might have honestly
you could be that direct if you if you
know and trust the person but what I
have done in the past is when I decided
to go out on my own I just told my boss
that's what I was going to do once I
made my mind up when I had the money
saved I told my boss I'm actually not
going to come in to the office I'm gonna
be working from home because everything
I'm doing here I can do there and I'll
be more efficient and better now for a
lot of folks the initial reaction that
is well that's great for you you know
but I can't do that because I work at
big bank or big this or big that you'd
be surprised at exactly what you can do
let me explain I worked in an analytics
company doing heavy intensive database
work and I had set up a way to VPN in
and get the data and work with my
machine remotely and in fact I started
doing that two days a week and finally I
got so tired of driving from Marin in
San Francisco Marin County
it was a hours commute when there was no
traffic down to Mountain View and if was
trafficker just over two hours
my daughter had just been born and I
just realized this is not a good life
and so I just told my boss you know I'm
not driving down here anymore and after
I've been working from home two days a
week I am NOT driving down here again
I'm gonna be working from home in my
mind I was ready to jump because I had
saved up some money and I thought well
I'm gonna go out and try and contract my
first thought is I'm gonna see if I can
contract with my existing company I was
about to bring that up when my boss told
me straight up I can replace you and I
got an ego trip on me and I said that's
totally fine do whatever you think you
need to do and I did not challenge them
and I and I just played the part of now
I am a business owner in my own head and
I just said whatever you need to do but
our relationship has now changed I write
code for you but I'm gonna do it on my
own terms because I am now a business
and we are two businesses working
together I've done this twice now the
first time it worked out really well the
company in Mountain View has gone away
but what I was able to do was I was able
to start working from home and then I
was able to just go completely on
contract off of salary and then I moved
to Hawaii and my boss is great he said
do not tell anyone that you work here
from Hawaii all right I could do that I
kept that contract for three years and
they I was more productive and had a a
better outlook on life and and they saw
that and so everything worked out really
well and I finally let them go because I
started contracting with Microsoft and
eventually that led to a full time job
and then I left Microsoft but when I
left Microsoft I did the exact same
thing I said I'm gonna instead of
quitting I just walked into my boss's
office and said I'm gonna reduce back
down to contract and I was already in
the vendor system they said sure all
right that's fine whatever you want and
so I took I took a few contracts with
them and then they moved on to do other
things I was telling my friend about
this and you know the advice I was
offering to people and he said yeah
you're you you know and sure I you know
I write my blog I had followers on
Twitter whatever
it doesn't matter in fact I flip it on
on the Ted I'm me because I do these
things I go out to user groups I write a
blog I do open source so I did those
things I don't know if you saw through
Troy hunts talk today but you talked
about those things to to just put
yourself out there write down the things
that interest you you know get out there
and do stuff on a business level this is
really really important as well just be
responsive transparent and on time and
what this leads to is you being on speed
dial and I'm not joking about speed dial
there if you start working with a
company and you get in with a certain
cost center let's say a big company and
you're getting with a certain group and
you do well for them and by doing well
all you have to do is show up and then
do the work and then be transparent
about it they will call you every single
time because you'll become their person
their go-to person and honestly it's a
funny line from I think it's Woody Allen
I'm not sure but 80% is you know it's
Groucho Marx anyway
80% of success is showing up and that's
true and especially as a coder you just
respond to an email you know within a
few hours you would be surprised I mean
contractors out there especially
programming contractors can be so
ridiculously rude but if you're not rude
and you just respond and then you also
are transparent about what you're doing
people will love you and then it just
grows from there because they're gonna
tell they're the people on the company
and you're gonna keep getting calls the
other thing you can do is when you're
out and about maybe not at a conference
but maybe you're on vacation strike up
conversation with people and I don't
know if I'm not naturally social but
sometimes I've been having a beer or
something like that you can just start
chatting with a person or whatever could
come up you would be surprised at how
often it turns back to talking about
work I know that there's differences in
the UK and versus America where what
that's like the first thing out of our
mouths what do you do I know over here
it's a little bit different it might be
like what's your name or how are you
it's something more a little bit more
polite but over in America it's like so
what do you do and that happens a lot in
fact this is where I was just 10 days
ago my wife bought me a trip to Hawaii
for Christmas
which was amazing so I went to Hawaii
and I was sitting there enjoying the
sunset that is my beer and I snapped a
picture I said I want to put this in my
slides I was I was a very happy person
and the person next to me just right
here off-screen it was like hey what are
you taking a picture of we just started
talking turned out he worked for the NSA
yeah and it was a great conversation we
just started talking about all kinds of
things and we sat there for I want to
say two hours and it turns out he was
doing some heavy heavy data work and
next thing I know he's giving me his
business card
he didn't I mean he doesn't know like
anything about me he doesn't know I'm a
speaker and bla bla bla I just told him
what I knew about databases the next
thing I know he's giving me his business
card he says well you know when you
moved back over here
let's talk like whoa did you know
Snowden he knew Snowden
no I'm not kidding he did know cuz
Snowden worked in Hawaii and they worked
in them it's probably all I can say
about that honestly can you just rewind
it a second there okay the point it's
you start to get this thing where where
you just open yourself up from either
going to user groups or just being
around other people you start to open up
you have a blog you're tweeting a little
bit more and you just have to open your
persona up a little bit and the
opportunities start coming to you and
once you kind of engage with people it's
really once they find you agreeable
really the process of going from there
to hiring you on is typically pretty
short especially if they find out you're
a business as opposed to just being a
person who's going to come on as a as a
1099 contractor now that you're a 1099
is the reference to the US tax no it
just means you're an individual and
they're hiring you outside the company
once I know you're a business it becomes
much easier because then you just have
to become a vendor for their company and
once you're in as a vendor they can just
put a work order in and boom bang you
got lots of money so let's say once you
start working with them how can you be a
little bit more communicative
so the first thing that I did when I
started my new company machine is I just
created a
I created an org and github and I every
project I have in there for a client is
locked away in a private repo I pay the
money and if I have a private repo the
client can see what I'm doing that's
transparency that's all there is to it
you know using kit is wonderful they can
see my check-ins and I make sure to not
use bad words and they can leave issues
and it's good to go you don't have to
use github there is get lab of course
but I got to be pretty quiet because
Phil hack is right next door here if he
hears me talking about gitlab
something's going to come flying through
the wall also if you have a big client
if you have a big client you could spend
the money on something like Basecamp or
some online planning thing where you can
exchange documents exchange exchange
messages because sometimes and this is
what happened to me
establishing a relationship with a
company company to company carves you
the cars a really unique space for you
inside your clients company and what I
mean by that is I used to get hired in
what we're called skunk works projects
little green field things where they're
trying to replace existing systems with
new technology and they would call me up
and say you're the dotnet guy right yeah
yeah and do that well we've got this
little project that we're trying to push
forward it's this little cost center
inside this big org but we have free
reign but I can't use any of the
company's assets I can't use our JIRA or
whatever it is they're using like oh I
got you covered we got Basecamp I've got
get we're all set and they go great
thank you and so they can now we can now
host I can now host this stuff for them
it's a little bit expensive but it's
actually really really really useful and
it makes clients really happy another
one would be Trello anything to make
them feel like they can see the work
that you're doing honestly that's it I
mean I have more to talk about but I'm
saying that's that is the nuts and bolts
of having a plan having a coherent
structure to move forward instead of
just going out there and saying Harvey
what you could do but if you want it to
scale until last putting that structure
in place allows you to do different
things and let's talk about that because
that's where the fun is that's where the
future is and
it's easy to think about what's gonna
happen next couple of years two years
but what about ten years from now
I mean who here has thought about ten
years from now or even 20 and I've been
doing this for 25 years and I can tell
you 20 years ago I had no idea where I
would be so here's some extra stuff if
you really really want to think long
term you can start to think about
branding to come up with a business name
well that's maybe what if we had it be a
brand instead of just a business instead
of just you know I write code as a
business description well maybe
something you can elevate it to a little
bit more of a bigger concept why
branding because when I started I
started a company called tech pub calm
years ago and the corporation name was
something different the corporation name
was actually massive studios and massive
studios started a brand called tech pub
I sold that brand to a Pluralsight they
didn't buy the company they bought the
brand so that was really easy for me it
was actually super easy for my lawyer to
go in and say okay they're buying the
IEP for the brand Boom Bang and it was a
really easy transaction just saying you
can think about branding as well as just
being a business business cards and a
website this is all about appearance and
all about bowling people over with the
appearance of knowing what you're doing
so how do I even do a brand how do i how
do I go about starting a business in a
visual sense something a little bit more
that extra step to make you look amazing
I went to 99 designs I spent I think it
was $500 on a competition who here knows
what 99 designs is okay for those who
don't know it's a crowd-sourced way of
doing all kinds of graphics anything
design related you go in and you start
what's called a competition and a bunch
of designers from all around the world
try and make something for you you just
have to describe what you want so I went
there and I described big machine and
what I was trying to do video tutorials
blah blah blah and I got all kinds of
funky designs back some of them I liked
and some of my not really I kind of
liked that one on the top left corner
it's a little bit weird but they went
down there in the middle is good I had
about 50 designs to choose from and it's
really fun because you leave feedback
and hit a little
it becomes a game um this one is weird
this one's really weird isn't it like a
electric Bible or something I don't sure
what they're trying to think of as far
as business cards go I hope you can see
this with the light in here I hope that
it looks good down there but this is the
business card for my friend Jeffrey
gross blocked gross and Bach who ran P
code and P code did video tutorials much
like to have tech pub did his thing was
just he wanted everything to look just
right highly polished so he went out and
got a letter pressed quarter-inch
business card that had the name of the
business hopefully you can see that
pressed into the card with his title and
name over the top and he showed me this
card once and I just like this is this
is ridiculous the problem is that if you
order this I think it's $750 for about
two hundred so that here there'd be
about five hundred pounds for two
hundred cards
yeah and it's a lot of money but to him
it was worth it
as far as a web site goes again if
you're in Troy hunts talked earlier he
talked about using ghost to get yourself
started I differ with him on that
I like ghost it's fine for blogging but
to me a website is something a little
bit more than just a blog
although feel free to use it as a blog
if you start a company you want this
website to represent you and what you do
you know Juliana here does all kinds of
design and other things she might have a
company in the background but the
company is her so she's front and center
and I love this because I don't know if
you can see the URL up there but it's
julia dot na it's her name Juliana which
i think is this wonderful that's a that
just says so much about her and what she
does it says WordPress by the way again
with another WordPress template I like
this one because something is missing
from in the front is in fact something
is missing from all over it it's the
person's name and they're making a
statement here that they're so good they
don't have to tell you who they are and
I'm not kidding this this is a really
high-end designer that makes a lot of
money and he doesn't take cold calls
from anybody which I thought was funny I
want to throw that in this is WordPress
as well this is where I differ with Troy
ghost works
ghost is limited and I think Troy
earlier today said that it's full of all
kinds of junk and widgets and buttons
that you have to figure out and that's
true but WordPress also has a ton of
capabilities that help you promote
yourself and help you represent yourself
online WordPress is WordPress what can I
say I just pushed my blog over to it
once again and I've decided just to
leave it there and to stop thinking
about it because my blog is not only my
blog it's my website that represents me
and so there's all kinds of projects up
there that I do there's there's podcasts
that I run and so on the one thing that
I really like about it is you can go to
a site like a Novato or a theme forest
or monster template pay 40 bucks and get
a really really high end template that
looks amazing
you upload it install it you can load up
some demo content that they'll just put
in a bunch of stuff for you but they'll
make it look amazing so it'll help you
just fill out what you need this is my
blog it's just got a simple statement on
the front like so many other blogs do
all right at the very top there you can
see well if you want to read posts I
write here's my about page publications
and podcasts just simple stuff like that
to let people know who you are but also
I bought this design for I think forty
five dollars I don't want to mess with
this because I have other things to do
so that's why I like WordPress if I need
something on my blog I don't have to
think about doing it I didn't know Troy
was gonna be talking about his blog but
I did want to point out this is Troy's
blog and you can take a look at his
structure too and he just puts at the
top what he does and he's got a picture
of himself and he says hello I'm Troy
that's it this is Feli on our keynote
speaker WordPress again on this site
again just a little bit about her and
what she does I like this one a lot I
like this one because it's Heather she's
one of the speakers here it's her
smiling isn't that great and if you
could imagine thinking well you're
telling somebody at let's say the
corporation you work at well I have this
coder her name's Heather
here's her website go check out her
skills and this is the first thing you
see wouldn't that be kind of like yeah
I'm sure she'll work out is fine and
then she has all her stuff at the very
top and her experience and so on so what
do you do well I recommend that you just
create a blog
use WordPress use ghost whatever you
want make it look really simple put your
name in the top left corner put the
things that you do in the in the bar
right there the things that you
specialize in a hobby so people can know
it you know you like to do on the side
and then your recommendations things
that you like just start like that and
you're good to go if you want to go the
full-tilt business route and you have
some references then put those up there
too but that might take a while to get
going now you're probably sitting there
thinking well wait a minute you're
telling me to be a business but now
you're telling me to put personal stuff
on the site the business is the
mechanics of getting money and and
scaling things forward you are actually
the thing that you're trying to sell you
are the product so put your product
front and center you and then everything
else is going to cycle in your business
after a few years you'll have things
that you can add up here like a
portfolio of your satisfied clients and
testimonials and so on I love that
picture I just have to say I'm so proud
of myself from the first impressions of
II of course like that did that for you
guys man come on okay now we get at the
fun part who cares about all of this
Here I am talking about all these things
and let's say you do it you go back you
get your plan you get your lawyer you
get your CPA and you're starting to do
all this stuff and you're a contractor
and whoop-dee-doo oh my gosh I have a
slide out of order sorry I wanted to
show Scott Hanselman blog okay I'll get
to the who cares part in a second sorry
pretend you didn't see that speaker foul
um what I was gonna say is if you're
having trouble starting out with your
own personal site just copy someone and
this is the part where I get to confess
that I copy everything from Scott so if
you're ever wondering why I'm such a
jerk online it started with him I hope
he is not here he's not here good um
okay so I would say you gonna start with
start with what Scott does and you can
see hi I'm Scott well I copied my thing
hi I'm Rob I copied that from yeah why
not and he you know he has a little bio
about what he does and his stuff at the
top so you can just follow along with
what
this brings this brings up a problem for
a lot of people me especially because I
am NOT a natural marketer I'm not a
sales person in fact I wrote a book and
just released it about two weeks ago and
I forgot to tell people that I sold it
forgot to W so I wrote the blog post
today in the morning because I woke up
I'm like you haven't told people that
it's for sale it's it's for a lot of
reasons I can't stand telling people
about me and like hey I'm awesome that
just doesn't feel right to me
and it's an actual paradox and this is
something that Chad Fowler said once in
a conference that I loved in fact it was
a dev day in Poland at your conference
and he said marketing is a moral
imperative and I just thought what the
heck does he mean by that and his idea
was if you do good work or you make
something that's amazing and you think
you can benefit somebody else save them
time save them money or you can help
them out of a hole you owe it to them to
tell them about it from a moral
standpoint and I like how he went
straight to the morals so I try and
think of things that way so if you have
a hard time doing that just remember
you're helping people out with your
awesomeness okay now we get to the why
part which is my slide problem why are
we doing all of this you know so why so
where do we want to end up what do we
want what do we want to do in a couple
years we're just doing this to get free
for the moment and feel happy that we're
out on our own well remember when I
started out before I said there's four
parts of this whole plan there's
actually five and I needed to leave the
last part to the end because I needed to
build the case and build this structure
and everything the first thing the very
first thing that you should actually
have is an exit strategy how is this all
going to end
who was it someone I think it was either
When Harry Met Sally or people do this
they watch the end of the movie first
that's the reason why that is is you
want to know where you're going where
are you gonna end up do you want to be
rich you know do you want to be rolling
in cash well that's a totally viable
goal other people want to be famous you
want to be the Tiger Woods of man or
whatever the heck for me my end game is
I just want to retire I want it right
now with the busy
laughs I want to build up enough stuff
that people like that they can just keep
buying it and then I can kind of work
less less less less last less I don't
ever want to stop working by retirement
I mean like probably gonna work like
five to ten hours a week I don't ever
want to stop because I enjoy what I do
but in 20 30 40 years from now I just
want to be fishing that I was actually
out there fishing right then I want to
be out there fishing that's what I want
it chill out and have this business do
something for me other people they want
to sell their company straight away
five-year exit that's what I want other
people have an idea where well we'll
work on it for six years and we'll build
up this big MVP thing and then we'll
sell it to some other company and make a
million dollars when you start working
on your own as a solo contractor you go
in a very familiar arc in fact if you
ask most of the speakers here most of
them have done it they've started out
they started blogging they started
getting their name out there they get
contracts and the contracts get bigger
you become more in demand you can follow
choice career on this exactly he now
goes in charges top dollar to do a lot
of amazing talks and discussions all he
has to do is start charging money for
having been poned and he's going to be
able to retire tomorrow you start
getting these ideas for these assets
that you can start charging money for a
great great example is Rails cast when
Ruby and rails came out
Ryan Bates did 10-minute screencasts
every week on and he did that through I
think three years four years five years
and then he started charging money for
it and he was able to stop working and
forever it was great you can end up like
Rudy de Haan here who is so successful
in his trajectory that he can have a
website that looks like this
I mean seriously look at that thing
there's so bad in every way I mean like
there's no color to that I think he just
wrote I don't know anyway yeah so hoody
started off doing a lot of consulting he
did so a service-oriented architecture
as many people might know here and then
he created an service bus that's his
that's his product that's his asset that
asset is driving now his business this
is how you can scale your business that
way I already mentioned Troy and his
workshops there's Julie Lerman who has
established her career doing entity
framework she goes out and does
consulting and mentoring she sits with a
bunch of people in a room it gets paid a
good amount of money to do though to do
those things
the idea is scaling you that's why we're
putting this business in place so you
can get to your exit strategy you can
get to your end goal but you need to
have that plan and that structure
underneath you to get you there and so
many times people get to a point where
they realize I'm becoming successful
what am I going to do I don't have the
infrastructure and the plan I got to
stop what I'm doing pivot change and do
all this other stuff and it's disruptive
if you start whoever with just the
basics it doesn't cost a lot of money if
you start however getting yourself an
infrastructure starting with an exit
strategy having a business plan so you
know we're gonna do in the next 20 years
and then establishing your network you
can grow this and then retire happily or
go wherever you want to go so that's it
for me if you have any questions please
shot them out I know this is a pretty
obvious stuff that I mentioned but as
you get into the details it really
touches on some things that aren't so
obvious and hopefully you've learned
something today
so I think we have about ten minutes I
ended a little bit early so if anybody
has questions please yeah so the
question is what's the difference
between a freelancer in a business a lot
of times what a company will do at least
in the United States I think it's the
same over here is when you come on as a
freelancer it's like you work there but
you don't they're paying you hourly and
they just want any rate and then you
give them a timesheet and then they pay
you
it's just taxed differently for them and
for you they don't have to give you
benefits and so on if you're a business
however that's different sometimes it
takes a little bit more to get you set
up to get paid because your legal entity
as a business so you have to submit a
bunch of paperwork to usually their
accounting department and then you come
online as a vendor and if you're a
vendor in a big company that means that
they can send you a purchase order
purchase orders just like a bid and you
can send back your estimate and they
approve it and sometimes you go through
this rigmarole but the more you do it
the easier it becomes and then you can
just leave then it comes down to project
based billing so the idea is that your
contact can call you and say well we got
this thing I need you to fix and you say
well it'll be about 1,200 pounds let's
say I think okay okay just send me the
estimate I'll get it approved and then
you say all right usual retainer half up
front they go okay got it
checks in the mail and it actually makes
things much smoother does that answer
your question because B and also
business-to-business has tax
considerations in the US the company
doesn't have to send you any tax
information
it's called corporate court and so when
I do work for people I always do it for
my corporation to their corporation and
they have less paperwork it's less
hassle for them and when they pay me
they don't have to send me any tax
information at all and they don't have
to report the IRS it goes down there's
an expense on their books does that make
sense
I know dumping a lot of business stuff
on it it's like it's been so helpful and
my accountant actually is the one who
told me all this so I'll let him worry
about it anybody else yeah
yes that's an interest so the question
is when you work from home how much do
you have to go into the clients to talk
to them and to be with them basically or
yeah I say no to that and the reason why
is is if you if you take the mindset
that you're a business but at least for
me this is what I look at it if someone
requires you to be on on premises that
means you know you're getting in your
car and you're driving and there's a
whole whole bunch of extra money that
goes along with it on your time and I
mean if they're gonna pay me to drive
I'm gonna build them for it and if they
really need me there then my rates gonna
in my mind when I put together the work
order the my rates gonna probably double
and it cuz it's inconvenient and it
sucks and if it if you don't want to do
it say no I mean it would be like you
know your company calling a temp agency
or not a temp agency it would be like oh
I'm trying to find an analogy where like
you can only demand certain things of
other businesses and in this sense if
they need you there they need you there
and that's your decision that you can
make but I would just up the money like
you know I don't want to go to your
business use my answering a question
right okay
may sound a little bit vague but I hate
driving California it's horrible and and
you know like City are here I imagine
sitting on a train for an hour like
going to a plate now I won't do it and
that's one of the reasons that I love me
on my own is I couldn't just set that
rule might mean you don't get work but
oh well alright anybody else
okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
