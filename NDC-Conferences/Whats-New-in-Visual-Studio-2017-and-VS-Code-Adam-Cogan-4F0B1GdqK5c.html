coming I hope you had a great keynote
you now know not to lie right it's
pretty cool hmm I have been in Europe
for a month or so been on a Greek island
I went to the NBC conference and then I
went to a Greek island and I have been
super healthy I have been eating goat
for a month I actually didn't I know
that's not obvious maybe I didn't know
you could eat goat
I thought you eat goats milk and goats
cheese I didn't realize you eat goat so
I've been eating goat for a month I'm
very healthy and really looking forward
to this
I wrote this session for NDC oslo if you
ever get a chance to go to europe Norway
is a fantastic place to go just
yesterday I adjusted the title what's
new and Visual Studio 2017 because as of
now the title is the change the
versioning number numbering so it's now
officially Visual Studio 2017 version
15.3 so you know that update system we
were using which is nice and simple it's
now not as simple but it is clearer and
I did speak to Microsoft last night
about some of these changes on the
regional director list and you know
there was a lot of when you're asking
them asking customers what version your
are you on it you know there was a lot
of internal differences in the internal
versions than what we were talking about
so they're always semi confused so now
you're going to ask your customers what
version are you want and they're going
to say 15.3 and you're going to say is
that vicious gia 15 2015 23 or are you
talking about Visual Studio 2017 version
15.3 yeah all right I love how they do
this anyway we'll see how we go so I got
a few things I'll quickly go trip down
memory lane this is where we've come
from 2002 and webforms in 2003
we got resharper in 2005 where we got
generics which we still love and and
linus started off his Linux can kernel
and that was a pretty big thing
we were we were using git from this
point so 2008 we got lots of lots of
cool stuff the most cool stuff was link
and we started getting iPhones and
androids and in 2010 Windows Phone was
released which we've forgotten about and
we got Intel II trace 2012 we got lots
of cool stuff including uppercase menus
and a whole lot of stuff for black and
white a few other things that are notice
we've got lots of stuff Microsoft at
that point it was a big deal if you do a
lot of unit testing there's a first time
that they actually said alright we're
embracing unit testing and we put in the
Box the support for n unit and X unit
etc and I think there was an MB unit
back then and we got some there started
trying to give us storyboarding features
and things that were you know tools that
weren't really for developers but
they're trying to get us to communicate
better in the reality most people have
gone most most companies have designers
and UX guys and using Sketchup and
things like that 2013 well we got
vicious gog.com
you know the TFS team was forced to give
us a a cloud version which was awesome
many of the other teams also was putting
aja front and center and Ozzie's it's a
sure it's not a juror I mozzie but I say
Asia you know Americans invented it it's
their name so you should call it their
name that's my policy
anyway but a lot of the guys in my
office don't agree all right I think we
should have one version of English okay
and the Americans you know whatever
version they use I think we should copy
yeah fair enough
no all right cool I'm top script was a
big deal we got that as well and the new
Microsoft starts talking to Linus
and that was a big deal and we started
seeing some real changes based on that
and we had at this point we had a whole
lot of get support coming and a lot of
investment so that was awesome so and
Microsoft went from these monster
releases where they boil the ocean for a
couple of years and now they started
giving us these updates and update one
gave us get support which we're excited
about and update to we got lots of we've
got lots of stuff coming you know cloud
load testing was pretty important we got
lots of stuff on there to your first
side of things as well and then update
three they gave us cordova and update 4
we got release management for those
people that weren't happy with octopus
we were all you're happy with octopus
right who's an octopus guy in this room
oh and the less than a quarter who's a
release guy now one oh my goodness okay
we've got some stragglers you octopus or
release guy you're a bamboo right
there's a bamboo guy - all right now the
rest of you I got a team but maybe we
should stop this session talk about
continuous deployment and that would be
handy because it's more important to
ship software then get on the latest
version of Visual Studio and I would be
curious to know who's here who is a
who's a visual studio guy and who's a vs
code guy who's a primarily of visual
Styria guy in the room almost everyone
95% who's a primarily vs code guy 3 all
right so all right so we have 97% of the
room I would say on vicious chip we will
talk about that during this session
talking about frameworks who's a MVC or
angular or react or something
who's primarily an MVC guy more than
half the room who's primarily an angular
guy
oh I me a few who's a react guy oh the
same a few any other other ones view any
view guys
oh the redhead he has to be different
alright yes I will talk we might talk
about view as well but I just tell you
very cool very quickly view is super
cool as well I know there's so many
things to keep track of but view I we
have an office in China and all they
talk about his view because Alibaba used
view okay Ally Barbara is like the
coolest company in the world and Jack Ma
he's like Richard Branson times ten and
he's really funny and really cool and
everyone loves him and you know that is
a massive massive organization and they
do a lot of stuff with you but anyway
let's keep on track here so and then we
got Rosslyn in 2015 and we got lots of
cool stuff helping us work with xamarin
and at this point we've got asp.net core
which will they were calling asp.net
five at the time I'm glad they renamed
that that would have been confusing so
and
and that's where we are so essentially
we got lots of small things we've got
auto updates in our extensions and
Microsoft have really given us a long
long trip down this visual CEO path okay
we've got the marketplace and you can
see we've got add references very easily
they got some of these ideas from
resharper I guess and who's a resharper
guy in the room okay
that's three quarters the rest of you
that the quarter that doesn't have it
there's some homework for you go and get
it it's really important so here we are
vicious cheered 2017 and as I just told
you a new version and let's find out
what's cool and what's not
I guess what I should tell you is just
yesterday they announced asp.net core 2
or Core 2 so you will want to grab that
anyone in the room already downloaded it
and installed it and tried it out
just a couple
all right whew all right good excellent
that is really important and it's a big
release you'll see lots of cool stuff in
it I'm still discovering myself it's
it's hot off the press and it's super
cool and I'll go through some of that
stuff all right a little about me I am
the chief architect at SSW we have a
booth here and it's a it's a great
investment for arson for everyone else I
am very well known for for crashing at
Tesla and there it is but I've got to
tell you it was a Photoshop job I was
trying to trick my wife I put it on
Facebook my wife always said she's never
on Facebook but every time I look at her
she's on Facebook but she's never on it
so I decided she my daughter text me and
said can you dad can you played trick on
mom it's it's April 4th and I replied
back what do you want me to do and she
goes I don't know you'll think of
something and I have the Tesla for a
week
I hadn't had insurance and she was
freaking out about it I'm very safe
driver yeah if I was her I'd be freaking
out but she'd have to worry with me and
so then I said a photo of the of the car
to one of the designers that the company
I said he make it look like it's crashed
don't put on Facebook and so he sent
that back to me
and I put it on Facebook coincidentally
my wife was watching it just at that
point in time and she calls me and she
says are you an idiot get that thing off
off the internet and I think she was
kind of encouraging me to do insurance
fraud or something yes I'm not sure but
then recently I crashed my motorbike and
of course I had everyone telling me it
was a joke I broke four ribs punctured
my lung did a whole lot of damage but
I'm all right
in fact when I went to Oslo I just did a
tough mother so that was all good all
right
so all righty also soccer coach so be I
will just quickly go through the biggest
user gripes so the biggest user gripes
I've grabbed off user voice and they are
they want dotnet builds without
installing visuals do
this is a big big ticket okay and I'll
just tell me very quickly that's done
you can go onto your build server and
instead of spending half a day
installing visuals dear you can just
download this build agent zip and in
less than probably twenty minutes you're
good to go
all right now there were workarounds for
the old one as well you could you could
actually get away and get a get around
that in the 2015 days but it wasn't
legal so obviously a lot of companies
didn't want to do that but now it's all
fully supported and it's good to go now
I'm not going to tell you the others I'm
going to come to them throughout the
talk but this is a really popular one
people want that web.config style
transforms and they want to do it on any
config file and some say do it on any
file at all okay I'm not I like the idea
of doing on any config file but I'm not
sure I'd like to see it on any file at
all you know how like sequel server you
can have tables and every now and then
something goes weird and then you find
out some developer wrote a trigger and
you never think to look for a trigger
because it's so hidden
I reckon that would be scary you know
you even forget and weird things would
happen anyway non-noble reference types
are very popular we've got you some
Windows 10 Universal app requests some
some of you have already glazed over as
soon as I mentioned Universal apps we've
got this we we want a better null
pointer exception error people don't
like the object reference not set to an
instance of an object and we want sam'l
debugging and we want Visual Studio to
be quicker to run and we want a task
manger in there that's got 1,700 votes i
I want I want this one because some of
our guys in our office won't run
resharper and they always use the reason
I think it slows down my machine but
they're never sure they just anything
that happens poor resharper gets the
blame anyway they want solutions to load
faster they sick of seeing this okay and
they want to stop the dependency in IE
and they
want Chrome and Firefox support alright
so let's talk about dotnet core who's on
dotnet core at the moment who's running
their solution on.net core only a few
okay all right I am going to tell you
where we stand at SSW we did a dotnet
core solution in beta into in the 2015
better days and we had a bit of trouble
with it there was a lot of updates and
stuff and I heard a few complaints
during the sprint reviews I thought that
that you know that team went and did
another project on dotnet core and I can
tell you in the last so I kind of
thought it was a side thing but in the
last 12 months no new projects have
started SSW that haven't been on dotnet
core ok so it's really been rock solid
for us it's how our Web API is done most
of our projects are angular front ends
not all but most of them ok
it is a huge update and I will recommend
you go to any of the dotnet core 2
sessions during the conference it's
brand-new and it's really important ok
it's there was many reasons people
wanted this and they liked it I know
only a few of you you've got experience
on it but these are the main reasons
it's faster people can develop on their
Mac ok
people can deploy to Linux people can
the whole thing has been open sourced of
those four reasons which one's the most
important to you who says the number one
reason they want to use court is for
performance hands up ok so that's maybe
2/3 the room who says it's because they
want to develop on their Mac or
something like that just a few and who
says it's because they want to deploy
where they want you to Linux or whatever
ok so that's maybe a third and who cares
about the open-source story Oh quite all
right about 10 or 11 yeah the
open-source story to a lot of people
means that it will get a larger market
share
you'll get more traction it's it's seen
as a really important thing to a lot of
people
okay I did this asked this question in
Brisbane and that was one of the I think
was the second biggest reason people
liked it so in some communities that's
really important all righty so last year
when I went through this and I told you
this is what I explained there's no more
serious proj it's all project Jason
no more web.config we go config Jason
and there's no more package config it's
packages Jason all right
so alrighty so Microsoft released this
blog post and I said when we started
building dotnet core and asp.net core it
was important to have a project system
that worked across Windows Mac and Linux
and worked in editors other than vicious
year the GNU project dot JSON format was
created to facilitate this the feedback
from customers is they loved our new
project Jason model but they one of
their projects to be able to work with
the existing net code that they already
had and basically they what they're
trying to say and they trying to say
sorry we changed our mind we've gone
back okay so welcome back
so say any stuff that I told you last
year forget about it we're just still
going C as prod and we're going
web.config all the way and you can use
packages dot configure if you want so if
you want to migrate back which doesn't
sound like any of you do because you
haven't gone there but you just open
your folder and it will pop open and say
hey you should review your project these
projects are either not supported or
need project behavior impacting
modifications there's nothing here that
says sorry that makes it sound like you
made a mistake but anyway you click OK
and you're good to go if you want to do
a command-line you just go dotnet
migrate and you're done an ice-cream
message everything so it's very very
painless
alright and before I told you about DNX
and dnv M&amp;amp;K p.m. for our package major
and we've been watching that evolve over
on github.com and you kind of saw that
you you downloaded the install you
used DNX to install you restored your
packages and then you ran your
application with DNX all changed so it's
now dotnet run dotnet upgrade and dotnet
restore isn't that simple
nice and easy super easy in fact
probably the better the first thing you
should do now if we talk we should go
dotnet - - version mmm before you do
anything see that is version 2.0 that's
what you want to have if you don't have
vision to a whole lot of things inside
Visual Studio ain't gonna light up for
you so get that okay and we'll talk
about that in a sec yes okay bill has
you should go to build session - but
he's basically saying that dotnet
restore runs automatically you don't
even have to run that happen was in
Greece oh okay it's part of what
happened last night with the - oh drop
thank you all right all right we've got
a unit tester live in the audience okay
fantastic all right and you're gonna
watch this evolve just like it has in
the future on github this is a whole new
world for us okay and so you just go
here and it's a nice simple system net
new dotnet well and dotnet run okay
thank you I'll put a big strike through
that okay
all right so let's have a look at this
dotnet new nice and simple just create a
project with some files in it dotnet
restore and it's going to go off and
grab all the packages and then we have
dotnet run and this is just a console up
so it's nice and simple so that's done
and now we've got our holo world that's
as simple as it is sweep alright so just
in summary creates a console up and
you'll just see a couple of files in the
folder nothing much
let's get onto something more important
okay so don't know it restore grab their
files and then dotnet run builds and
runs a project what I'd like to do is do
this for a web project
now Web projects slightly different okay
dotnet new - T web now bill is about to
correct me and he's going to say we've
just dropped the - T yes that's true
that happened in Greece anything that
happened in Greece doesn't count
alright so dotnet new web dotnet restore
or to make and don't have run awesome
now one of the things you'll notice is
we have a new web server that they've
created called a Kestrel web server and
that will be running as you do this and
I'll just show you that so we go dotnet
new - T Web enter and dotnet new net
dotnet restored that will go off look at
the what packages that need to be
brought in and then we've got dotnet run
now this will kick open the kestrel web
server and things will start running and
it will give you some instructions there
to go to localhost colon 5,000 if you
can see that bit and we are good to go
and so that's the web server running and
we would then pop open to the browser
and type localhost colon 5,000 and we
are in business
all right great that is awesome and so
what it does is in this case rather than
a couple of files you'll see a whole
folder full of stuff
okay and based on what was pulled down
in the restore process and that is all
defined those new cap and you get
packages are defined and customizable
and then we've got the kestrel web
server if you look closely I guess not
many of you will ever bother and it
doesn't really matter but if you look
you can see that the you know the first
thing is the home controller is being
requested and then down here we've got
the CA CS HTML files being requested and
then you can see all the static content
the CSS files the JPEG files any of
those JavaScript files are all coming
through and then you just see them
alright so the next version you'll be
able to pull open your iPhone to open up
the cortana up and go creighton your
website alright
just joke don't worry the version after
will be able to actually saw in the
keynote just think about it with their
hololens device on and it should be good
so all the stuff you'll learn today you
might need next year okay so in summary
it's blazingly fast and i haven't got
the new numbers for 2.0 but i bet you
it's even better as it bill faster you
see they're working on it that sounds
like a donald trump answer okay yeah
it's gonna be great
alright alright runs on windows links
and Mac and it's very simple to run all
righty
who is impressed with dotnet core who
looks at that and goes I don't think I
want to do my next project on it so a
hundred percent of the room is sold on
there you go all right there we're all
sold that was quick
all right okay we went from three to one
hundred awesome so now you got to choose
your front-end and we'll talk about some
of that stuff now you can go angular
react view okay and there's you know
angular is for an entire system react is
for pieces and view is or view is if
angular and react had sex that's what
you'd end up with okay all right now
there is aralia there's
aralia guys here yes - that's two of the
60 in the world but they're extremely
noisy so it is I put the fourth choice
down there because they make a lot of
noise and they would make a complaint to
the MDC guys
alright so it's hard to choose now I
just went and got the numbers beef now
this is pre grease trip I'm sure
something's changed but in if you go
with angular and I'm not counting
angularjs angular 1 angular 2 and 3 and
there's no three but angular 2 and 4 &amp;amp; 5
that is the new style and that's still
pretty popular 1.5 million downloads the
a couple months ago month and a half ago
or whenever react now react is they
haven't segregated their community
they're just one react and it's 4.5
million downloads so it's big and but
you might not comparing apples and
apples and there's view and that's half
a million but I reckon that's growing
and that's important and of course
there's a rally er 25,000 all right
there you go
alrighty so um oh by the way uh this is
a photo of a train in Norway like when
you go to Norway it is the most advanced
civilization you've ever seen there like
the roads are just full of Tesla's like
you know I see a Tesla here I'm really
excited and you know the whole if I
don't spot it then my kids will try to
not say anything so because I will just
start talking about Tesla again but and
I was you know I love Norway it's you
know you it it's just it's very
expensive place but they're also loaded
you know they're all making money off
all the oil and stuff and I got that and
this time I agreed that before my talk I
would go to a friend a fellow regional
director and go to his company and do a
talk so I I probably shouldn't know
because it's such a long trip and then I
didn't understand I had to get in a
train when I got to Oslo Station and
there's no eight hours in a train but he
booked me k for comfort do you like that
so I was in K class comfort class so
anyway I fell asleep put my alarm on um
I'm a very sad boy today because my
abanda stopped working I have this band
for years and it just died on me now
have to rely on stupid Apple watch which
I can't work out anyway
so I have the alarm on and I wake up
when I get there and I go and do the
talk and I stay there and it's beautiful
little town I have some most awesome
photos and then I get the train back do
you notice anything wrong with this
photo it took me a while to notice
but um huh you can't see anything oh
I've never seen one track going both
ways and what happens and what soon as I
work to I go what's going on here and
then the train pulls over and then
another train comes flying through and
now realizing I'm in cave for comfort
I'm right at the front now I cannot
sleep I'm it was the most dangerous
system for a country that is so rich I
couldn't believe that it could have one
train track and just keep pulling overs
like imagine a freeway you did this this
be crazy stuff anyway yet that's just a
warning never get on a on a train in
Norway it's very bad all right so let's
move along we now need to choose whether
we're going V s code or visuals to you
2017 version fifteen point three all
right so I know that almost everyone in
the room is a visual studio guy but V s
code is an important tool in your
arsenal I'm going to encourage you to
get on it and let's go through the
history of this we have an eye a three
we get note pay then we get notepad plus
plus which I assume we all have and then
we get sublime and then Adam and then
Microsoft do a really weird thing they
come out and give us vs code and we go
huh why do you want to give us a text
editor won't you just make visual studio
faster what is all this this is weird
anyway several months later they open
source on github and they give us a
preview and then it they give us a
version one and it's released and
there's been lots of updates and if you
look at that we've had this for a couple
years this is this is mature time okay
and I can tell you all the guys in our
office run this each day but we do a lot
of anger and I'll tell you why if you
look at this this is the trends you will
see that notepad plus plus is the big
one now there is this when people do
trends for you be aware of is if they
don't change the categories here see the
cutter is there's a problem okay so you
changed it to development tools and
you'll see things a little bit more
accurately so that there you can see
sublime
it's kind of the the big the big dude
all right so we have these front-end
developers these hipsters
now there's I can see a couple of
hipsters in the room okay but you know
these hipsters have a certain style okay
they do not want visuals geo it's too
big and slow they want to use their max
okay they they are very comfortable with
JavaScript frameworks HTML CSS they love
react they love angular they you know
they probably download view on the train
on the way in there they're really cool
now you guys think this is a hipster but
I want you to know I was just tricking
you that's not a hipster that is that
sleazy dude that dumped our Kiley he
just looks like a hipster but look how
ugly is without his hat on yes anyway
now let's talk about real guys these
guys we know that V vicious to you is
slow we don't care we like Windows we
like productivity we want intellisense
navigating code and pick peak we want
code lens we want good debugging tools
we don't mind we don't mind the price we
pay it's all cool so we have front-end
developers where the light bulb is
broken and they cover the light bulb
with yellow paint and then they tell the
backend that the light bulb now works
but just during the day okay these are
the type of people we have to deal with
a lot okay now I want you to be aware
when I go into companies and I'm talking
to you know CIOs and CTOs
a lot multiple times every week and we
typically are talking about the front
end we are typically they want to know
opinions about angular or react or some
other JavaScript library or basically
what I think and I want you to be aware
I consider vyas code this part of the
you know whatever we're talking about
with all these guys whatever we're
talking about it's going to be gone in
two or three years for sure the stuff
that we spend a disproportionately small
amount of discussion is the services the
things that are going to stick
there which I can guarantee we'll still
be seeing there in five years time okay
so I'm just giving you guys the same
warning to try to keep remembering it's
very easy to keep talking about the
front-end JavaScript frameworks but
spending an equal amount of time having
nice architecture on your services so
they're rock solid is a much better way
to go anyway that is the part I consider
the visuals geosite alright now you can
do both or neither
either way around but that's kind of the
way our company is standardized most of
the guys doing their angular and react
stuff in vs code and their services in
visuals do you some are doing it the
other way around but anyway so front-end
developers you can see that dotnet
developers front-end developers are more
popular to talk about it so it's a light
download there's lots and lots of
languages that support it it's got get
built in lots and lots of cool
extensions
here's intellisense working beautifully
it's as good as Visual Studio let's have
a look at peak you don't want to go into
another file you don't want to lose
context that looks quite slick too
okay so no problems there having a quick
look alright so let's just look at that
again so you're just in there rather
than using go to definition we just have
a peek and it looks quite nice so let's
go through the experience of using vs
code so you know what it's like okay
we're going to go file new project
awesome and here we are and when you go
following you you get a whole series of
folders the same as going dotnet web
remember we went command-line before
this is the exact same set of files all
right what do we want to do now we just
want to open the solution and press f5
right so let's do that so you press this
little button okay it's gone you go five
let's click it and it goes hello what do
you want and you go Oh what do I want
I want dot net core core that's the guy
I want this guy alright so we're going
to select that and when we select it a
couple of files pop in here launch Jason
and tossed out
Jason and then over here you will start
looking at launch Jason and you go oh
that's pretty cool
fantastic let's try that again now I've
got the required files will come in this
this little guy again and let's click it
and we go oh what's going on no task
runner configured oh sorry about that I
will configure a task runner so let's
configure that which one
well rut is dead isn't it gulp is almost
dead
I'll use dotnet cool okay let's choose
that guy alright let's try this again
number 3 let's click it you ready
third time lucky oh error launch Jason
must be configured changed program to
the path to the executable oh that's
weird what'd I do wrong here or I'll
just click open okay Hey you wrote this
file this wasn't my fault you added this
file now I'm doing errors and stuff you
did okay put your hand up if you see the
error 300 bills - cool - puppies and all
right it's not too cool to correct me
but he won't put up his hand oh alright
so here is it's not caught what they
should do is enter the right name here
in uppercase then you might have all
seen it quicker okay so now we start
looking at that or better understand
this file since you put it there and we
start googling this we find Hanselman x'
blog post on it and then we there's half
a day gone but we learn a few cool
things path of the.net core up and oh
wow you launched this browser order
launch oh if I'm using OS X and Linux oh
great this is really cool stuff
what else can I learn about anyway half
a day later we're back here again and we
click OK we fix this up to project
awesome DLL and we come here and we're
ready to go all righty let's click it
bingo Oh what the hell debug download
dotnet core debugger open this is
ridiculous what is this so I have to
know where this command palette is
you'll learn at first time
very quick if you can't if you don't
know the keystrokes you'll start
learning all the keystrokes but you go
into the View menu and you open this
command palette and you download this
thing this dotnet core debugger and then
you start seeing this thing called
downloading omni sharp downloading omni
sharp now I'm going to tell you about
this thing because I think it's a cool
story the guy that developed omni sharp
is a random dude do a normal dotnet
developer in manchester the UK okay now
I don't know what it's like in
Manchester but you could probably tell
me Jared it's cool place north of the
what north of the wall Oh Game of
Thrones alright okay
you see Sam Newman he looks like he's
Game of Thrones doesn't he
so anyway Jason Emerson he decides he's
been just coding Network for years and
he wants to do a little startup he wants
to do he's pet project at home so he
told me because I asked him how this
came about and he said I just wanted to
do this project at home but I didn't
want to feel like there's at work so I
wanted a completely different
environment so I decided to do this
project in Linux okay and he's he starts
using this any max thing and after a
period of time he goes I really really
need to like I need Intel since I can't
get my job done so what he decides I
don't know what you'd decide at that
point when you need Intel he since he
decides to write in until he since
talked about a distraction
anyways so he writes an Intel he sends
library for himself and there he goes
continues on his little project at home
every night and then some blog II reads
one day says I'm using vim I'm doing
this c-sharp project gee I wish I hadn't
intellisense and he puts a comment he
shows me the blog post I put a comment
oh I've done this for you I've done this
for myself do you want the code I could
give it to you in case yeah I'd love the
code you guys so he goes up to github
creates a project has to give it a name
he wants to call it c-sharp everywhere
and then he gets crave you know what I
should do is I should make it more cool
I'll make it everywhere c-sharp and so
he switches those names around and then
he goes what's the Greek word I don't
know he's not great but what's the Greek
word for everywhere I'm
I'll call Omni shop so he creates a
github project once you do that creates
a life of its own
some so it gets a going in vim and Emacs
and then some random dudes in South
Korea create a sublime one as well so
now we've got we've got intellisense in
sublime and you know all this goes off
so isn't the community amazing a couple
years later David Fowler from the dotnet
team he contacts Jason and says hey can
you come over we'd like to get this
going and so he cuz it's a bit weird but
anyway they've got this Minako editor he
says you know David said I've got this
Minako editor we'd like you to get it
going in that we think what you're doing
is great and we want it working the
browser and stuff and what they actually
did want to do is they want it working
in code but they didn't want to tell him
they just wanted to get it going and so
they get it going in that and then they
put it in vias code he read changes the
compiler - Rosalyn from looking at the
way Zimmerman was doing it and
everything's great anyway there's a big
distraction anyway we got Omni shop and
that's done so let's run this again all
right this is this is the next day now
ok so we click on this little guy ah
where we up to click that guy whoa bingo
so what did you learn you learnt that
you can debug pretty easily so what were
the steps there was just one hoop to
jump through and then a second hoop and
then a third hoop and then a fourth ooh
all right and we are all good to go so
let's do it again yes
there's select the environment configure
the tas run update the dll download the
dotnet cord debugger and you are good to
go fantastic now what I want to tell you
about is how many people here have
downloaded the vs code insiders version
the insiders not a not a soul well I
want to change this I want you to all
start using this okay hey look I might
even teach Bill a thing or two you know
that's not possible but I'll try Vere's
code insiders now this is a preview
version this gets updated daily
the
spirits is much better you get lots of
new features it's only for real men okay
it can break so let's have a look at
what's in here and if you go download
this today now your environment does
change daily with little bits and pieces
but let's just do exactly what I just
did file new project so as soon as you
open up the project going following you
I haven't done anything and it starts
downloading omni sharp which you know
all about now okay
I didn't do a thing and just starts
downloading that so ordered order
detects and downloads what it needs and
then it knows we need this dotnet cord
debugger as well or to make it says hey
no error messages hey can I add these
projects it's so much more polite you go
sure whatever I'm not sure what you mean
better alright let's take that and these
required assets are added and you'll see
over in the left launch Jason and tasks
Jason all good now let's have a look in
that launch Jason remember that one
so that's created what do you notice
project awesome I didn't even have to
learn about this launch Jason there was
another half day saved all right and we
are in business so I'm pretty happy with
every the whole experience so far it's
been much more pleasant and well this
works so now obviously this is changing
all the time and now there's there's
updates so now but here's the good thing
it obviously this can break I asked like
we've been running this for a year now
on all our production projects and I
asked the guys has there been any
hassles they said none none at all now
which means there will be one very
shortly ok do you know about the left
pad problem the left pad problem
everybody in the world is using NPM NPM
is is amazing there's a random little
library called left pad which I think
you just passed in a string with how
many extra spaces you needed and that's
all it did like it was a 15 line little
project that half the world would take
in dependencies on I get calls from all
my clients saying that the developers
now can't work because why did we take
this dependency on NPM I said what's the
problem I didn't even understand the
problem nobody can build anything and
everyone gets a crazy fright from NPM
and and from that point forward
everybody wanted to become cool and use
yarn instead of NPM for this one problem
just to round off that story and don't
know how we got on that story whose
fault was that but just to round off
that story so yarn takes a case and it
doesn't have the problem at MPM had but
NPM have now made policy changes that
when you upload your package if somebody
else takes a dependency on it you grant
them rights to Keysha and so neither
neither has the problem anymore but now
we have two choices isn't that awesome
okay now where were you up to
I cannot remember oh yes so here we are
moving along yes so this was an
automatic experience and if you go vias
code insiders it's just one hoop to jump
through look how simple it is all right
so it's a much nicer experience bling
edge features daily releases now you
just need to grab all the right
extensions now if you're an angular guy
this is the hard part getting all the
cool extensions I spoke to Duncan Hunter
and Adam Stephenson
they are big angular big angular guys in
the company and these are all the right
extensions the angular language service
the angular 4 typescript snippets the
angular 2 inline the switcher the
bracket pic colorizer colon eyes is that
right : eyes it doesn't sound very nice
get history Quokka settings sync tears
lint typescript importer fears code
wallaby serial murderer No okay so
that's all but now you know Johnny Pappa
Johnny Pappa is the coolest guy in the
world he's mr. angular well now
Microsoft actually Hey look at this he
went and created a cool extension you
know what that extension does it just
goes and grabs everything I just said ah
I don't know why how did he think of
that all right you'll probably be famous
for that and all he's done is grab all
the other ones anyway very cool I have a
question for you who likes the look of
vyas code and will download install it
all right who does not like the look at
various code and we'll keep on vicious
to you okay so there's a core of you
that will keep on vicious to you the
rest are you going to vs code fantastic
let's let's go let's move along okay I
just want to talk about V is 2017 now
and V is 2017 has just changed what's
the first thing you got to do when you
got V is 2017 now when you get the
updates grab the updates of course and
you'll be on V s 27 vs 2017 version 15.3
what are you got to do you open your
command prompt and check that your
dotnet version is 2.0 and then extra
things will light up let's go through
and let's have a quick look and you'll
see lots of cool things in here let's go
file new project what they have here if
you're choosing a web project dotnet
core now what you what they should do is
put a warning on this don't use this
okay you want to go caught okay this is
for old people okay this is for 40-plus
people for 40 40 years old and over if
you're younger you choose this okay so
dotnet core now we have the Web API and
an MVC oh hello what do we look at here
what's wrong the core version thank you
if you have 2.0 you get an extra option
so you choose that and go Oh more
choices that's pretty cool whatever it
is
now we have a Web API the Web API
definitely should be done in visuals -
if you ask me if you have a look in here
you'll see lots more stuff they've done
they've supported Microsoft Azure Active
Directory so they've got this b2c stuff
going so that's nice of course if you
want a third-party extension identity
server would be a good choice let's have
a look at what they offer here identity
server they have put all 0 here I would
like to see all 0 and listed but anyway
there's lots of betting like they're out
of the box there they're sorting out
security for you ok soon there won't be
any need for Troy hunt ok
all right then this was the MVC solution
we had before and a lot of developers
especially just corporate developers
that don't want to do massive projects
they just want to do a small project
deploy it I don't want to understand
infrastructure I just want to write
alright I want to write neat HTML but I
don't need all this MVC stuff I just
want to go file new page doom I do my
stuff and get it done well they've given
you this new web application razor
syntax I would encourage you to have a
look at it there'll be sessions on this
if I went there it's a very simple setup
not folders everywhere it's real simple
that's the old way hold on hold on and
now you're all chomping at the bit for
the red one hang on if you
you've got react as well in the box this
is exciting it's in the box I can tell
you this this amount of pain just
getting to here is enormous for new
developers and if you want to do a large
react project you'll want Redux you want
this one that now what it should say is
core core people choose this all right
now it although they kind of did say it
with their beautiful red icon now this
is angular 2 plus and will go in and
create one let's have a look now I when
people come for a job at SSW we have a
test where they do something in angular
now a lot of them haven't done angular
snot we just want to test the angular
skills not their skills gain the whole
thing up and running
in the beginning so we actually had to
was my as a browser I'll just rules too
we have these rules to better angular
and this this wasn't enough so for the
new guys just coming and we want them
just not to have all the pain of file
new project we we
Adam Stephenson created this extra page
and it was cause rules to getting
started with angular
so in here he he craved this extra one
do you know how to get started with
angular because that was the amount of
pain which I've just showed you here we
go and goes alright here's the best idea
he kind of wants people to use vs code I
don't know why he's got business to here
is the good example Adam Stephenson is a
very nice guy he never wants the same
thing mean he's kind of a bit gutless to
write bad example for angular but what
he did mean was that's the good example
so he anyways there's various code and
then here's the right way to get your
project built etc and so he's given all
these links off to using the angular CLI
alright so there's there's all that
stuff so yeah basically says go and get
the angular see like you follow these
steps you'll get your project up and
running but what we've what we've done
here is we've got a project out of the
box the first thing to check on them is
Microsoft giving us angular for OS hope
you look in package Jason and there we
go you can look here where is and
there's the angular core so it's for
actually 4.2 ok so that's pretty good
and everything else is pretty cool there
alright and visuals to you is as fast as
ever
and yeah but but well I have some tools
here
I'm pre-rendering I should tell you
about that in a sec so but everything is
perfect for point I accept bootstrap I
don't look obviously Microsoft don't
know the whole world is using bootstrap
for but if you look at oh my God look at
that did you actually see that let me do
that again I hover over bootstrap sure
okay so then you can click on bootstrap
and I know it's an alpha but everybody
is it every sample project and the Sun
user every one of our projects is on
bootstrap for and it does say alpha but
Microsoft should get with the program
and change that to 4.0 and OH in the
last few days I think it's changed a
beta how's that finally got over alpha
after several years any way you'd change
that to 4.0 where's there they need a
little button here bill that just says
upgrade to four what can't we have a
upgrade you you've gotten you're a man
that can get things done alright anyway
alright and also ah one of the problems
that angular has had is Google juice
problems okay if you're building a site
that is a angular site and it's got a
lot of content Google juice is a problem
one of the things that we now have if
you look in this web pack config file
scroll down here this isn't you lots of
new stuff you'll discover we are we I
see this server-side pre-rendering this
is brand new and what pre-rendering does
is basically pre-render the son of the
pages google just finds them anger is
already blazingly fast angular 2 is
anyway this adds more milliseconds in
performance as well there's pre
rendering and this pre-render is
pre-rendering
is a really important thing this was
done by the google angular team for node
and it was done by the Microsoft
for.net core so if using.net core which
is kind of the majority of our projects
you basically Steve Sanderson did this
from the Microsoft team and he is here
speaking you want to go and see him he's
the guy that wrote knockout don't hold
that against him but he has done all the
cool stuff recently in Microsoft so
definitely definitely get into that and
ask him why don't we have yarn here what
do we have npm we want to be we want we
want to be cool okay so i'm just
wondering is it anything else worth
mentioning it all looks pretty cool ah
this is one weird decision see they see
this controller if you look here this is
a web api one and they've done it in
their one project so I would have
expected that what Microsoft
out-of-the-box would do is file new
project and they'd create a second
project for your web api and put it
there but they put it here probably for
simplicity probably because the average
developer now has to waste a lot of time
understanding cause and all they're
trying to do is get their project up and
running it might
Steve Sanderson also explains this in
more detail it's got something to do
with all the pre-rendering support and
stuff so anyway all very very very cool
so let's yes you're happy with what
you're saying with vicious cheer it's
looking pretty cool right okay so I just
want to do what I did before in Visual
Studio remember we went project awesome
you go file new project you choose core
now this is done before now don't worry
about that icon this was I know a lot of
people wouldn't click on any I come with
a little VB in it okay that's a that's a
bug that doesn't happen in dotnet core
two days all right
you choose web application and we're in
business we've got this if you look down
those files they are the exact files
done by dotnet web the exact files it
just looks a little
because they changed some of the
ordering special folders and visuals to
you if you go and compare that with in
the insiders version and the same it
looks identical start from the bottom
web config start up it's all the same
except in your vs code they don't hide
certain folders all right and time to
debug we press there five how much pain
you think visual studio gives us zilch
none okay alrighty so nice now
the reason people use visual studio
obviously there's lots of cool things I
just showed you some of the
authentication and support built in if
you want to deploy something to Asha and
you just come in here and go publish I
don't know anything about Asia so what
would I do as a corporate developer I
guess I'd click well and that looks good
and you know I'll click crate profile
and I press crate and what does it do oh
it seems to deploy to Asia and it's all
good you try to do that envious code and
your how you'll be you know trying to
stuff around with command - try and get
this going so there's certainly a place
for both and certainly a good it's it's
a much richer environment officials to
you as you would know ok let's talk
about some cool things that it does
we got vs code you can go file open
folder and that is a big shift forward
we are tied to solution files anymore
so the way that we we probably should
have got this a long time ago but we
have it now and makes it work very
easily with web projects
ok so that's very nice I want to I want
to tell you about a few other things the
main developer goodies in there was so
I've told you dotnet core is built in
open this folder let's talk about some
others the quick installer and the
roaming extension major is miles better
I'll go through that in a sec
lightweight solution loading there's
much better intellisense refactoring and
code analysis so they've got lots of
things that have come out of the
resharper work there's much better
debugging and DevOps now we are now seen
you
when when you're looking at your code if
you've instrumented it with up insights
you can now see in the code the errors
so as you're looking at code you can say
oh this is a number of errors because
that feedback is coming back through the
azure portal and into your IDE okay you
won't get that in via scope we've now
got typescript debugging and in chrome
so we don't have the dependency on IE
anymore which sauce awesome live unit
testing live unit testing up until
yesterday wasn't supporting with dotnet
core and with dotnet core 2.0 it's all
good to go so that's that's a really
exciting development and we've got this
code styling thing called editor dot
config alrighty so now I want to just
mention a few things you've got a lot of
sessions to choose from I also just want
to mention a couple of things so you've
got heaps how they get to there one sec
so there's heaps heaps of speakers to
see this week I'm going to tell you
about one specific track that I would
like to encourage you to look at we I
don't know if you guys are familiar to
ask me anything but the reddit the
reddit site who's a reddit reader anyone
read reddit Oh half the room alright so
they came up with this concept where
people would just go on there and say
ask me anything
AMA ask me anything and then famous
people got on it like Bill Gates and
other people Richard Branson and they
would ask any question and that answer
it like they asked Bill Gates um what do
you normally eat for lunch
you know what time do you go to bed yeah
any of course all all these opinions on
everything every technology Under the
Sun as well so we we've got a number of
the speakers doing that if you look in
room in level room 8 that's level 4 in
this case
Jennifer Tim are being interviewed and
you can go up and ask them anything I
will be interviewing
very shortly I'll be interviewing Sam
Newman and then you can come up and just
ask any question in one of Sam okay he's
he's they're all they're all awesome and
there's heaps of these interviews going
on so that's that's room eight track
eight that is also being live-streamed
so you can send it to your friends as
well they can watch that and it's done
by the SSW TV guys there we have a booth
over there we've got this new thing you
can have a test of it's called Sophie
and she she's in our office when you
walk into the office she recognized you
uses all the azure cognitive services
it's pretty pretty cool tells you what
what's on your calendar tells you
whether you look happy so as new people
walk into our our office like a client's
is hi you're you're Tom you're here to
see Adam Adam is already here in the
office that can tell because I've
connected to the Wi-Fi your meetings in
seven minutes you can take a seat in
that direction or if you're coming for
an event and say go to that direction so
it's just a kind of automated a lot of
fun we have updated our little book of
angular we have a little book of angular
it's now angular support for angular
four it's for free it's in our booth we
have a new version on Linc auditor I can
tell you having to watch all the people
set up the booth they are here until
midnight they are back here you know
five o'clock in the morning there's a
lot of work in all those boots I'd
encourage you to go and support all the
all the people with stands there's a lot
of work and I think it's awesome so let
me just finish off I would just like to
tell you there's a there's a few
resources here one of the things I think
the most important resource here is the
visual studio and release notes that
gives you all the updates and there's a
lot in this new version of visual
studio.net core two in fact they
probably could have they probably could
have caused it called it Visual Studio
2018 there's there's that much stuff
that you'll see in it
I've showed you a little bit today we
have some other ones that I haven't
listed here rules to bear
angular rules to better react we also
run a five bootcamp it's a six-week
online course it's angular 2 and angular
2 plus and tweet your favorite feature
I'd love to hear about it if you want to
ask me any questions I'm around or week
or send me an email Adam Cogan at SSW
comm do you I'm always happy to answer
questions we have some posters over on
the stand thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
