coming last session of the day I'm sure
that has been a long day a lot of
sessions and thank you very much
so first of all and introduce myself I'm
Ricardo but everyone called me Rizzo I'm
from Spain but I'm working in Redmond in
Microsoft and a big team that we are
doing a lot of things related to
JavaScript so not only is it sharp there
are more languages here and this is why
I'm in Microsoft so things that we are
doing probably you know we are working
on chakra it's the open source engine
for JavaScript that drives it and we
announced an integration with node
recently we also have another team
running typescript it's an open shirt
language if you are familiar with
typescript yes No we'll talk a little
bit about it we also have another team
that our Apache Cordova kilometers we
are going to talk a lot about Cordova
today but I'm working on Visual Studio
and JavaScript mobile tolling so which
studios were studio code and I like to
share with you all the things that I
learned talking with a lot of customers
and trying to have different people to
create apps using javascript so probably
you are familiar with with this sentence
from the fab boot that any app that can
be written in JavaScript will eventually
be written in JavaScript I think that
this sentence says a lot of things and
this has a reason is because javascript
is the most universal language that we
have today we have she serves with
Submarine and there are different
options but javascript it's truly the
unique language that you can use to
write server code client code web apps
mobile apps and different things
so today what I'd like to talk about is
with the states of the mobile mobile
development in JavaScript which are the
different options and why we think that
Cordova today is one of the best boxers
that we have it's fun to say because
Cordova it's in a Spanish word that is
not called always Cordova but anyway
everyone says Cordova and then which are
the different JavaScript tools that we
are using or we are creating for you so
depends on your preferences you can go
for a full IDE like Visual Studio or
maybe you prefer the common line or
something in the middle like the
extensions that we are creating for 4 vs
code another important part of the
JavaScript ecosystem is typescript and
we are investing a lot of on this
language and we're what is the state of
the art today of typescript and how can
you use it in your mobile apps
especially when we are talking about
angular and ionic you know you're
familiar with these frameworks there are
a lot of frameworks I will cover some of
those later but we think that ionic is a
real good one to to create this kind of
mobile apps and finally and just a quick
introduction about we are what are we
doing in the DevOps space and how can
you use the our tools and visual studio
team system team services sorry to to
create your bills deployment and the
different kind of tasks that it's not
only development and the most important
thing is a QA I'm more than happy to
talk with any of you you want after the
session or tomorrow during the
conference I love to speak with
customers know know what's what kind of
features you like what kind of features
you don't like what are you expecting
for the next versions of the product we
are very close to the next version of
Visual Studio
and finished with building alarms the
named yet but will be the next one to
2015 and what see we still have some
time to introduce the features that you
need so as we said in as I said before
and in visual studio that's the
organization that they work there are a
lot of different technologies to create
cross-platform solutions talking about
mobile is talking about cross-platform
I'm still a Windows Phone user suddenly
know if will be a platform in the future
but I bring some devices Android iOS and
everyone wants to to create apps for
this but we also have Windows and you
can write once for all these platforms
and we have like 300 million devices
running Windows so I think it's platform
that we should consider as well not only
iOS and Android and with Cordova you you
can get benefits for for the three
portfolios with the same code so we have
the native technologies donate summer in
unity react native something that we
announced in the last Facebook
conference support for windows in react
native and we also have mobile
technologies asp.net the responsive web
from here for a lot of people for too
many years and we also have the ibrid
applications where Apache Cordova
belongs to that kind of apps and the
languages that we use are javascript
touch create runs pilot to javascript
and frameworks like angular or ionic but
today we are going to focus on in
Cordova but before getting to the more
details into what is core demand how it
works let me try to recap where we are
in the mobile JavaScript development
life's landscape so we want to create
apps for Windows for Android and for iOS
from the beginning we also have html5
html5 was a big promise that we could
use a lot of features a lot of aspects
of standards but today is not a reality
you can have mobile websites that are
responsive works great on your devices
might have too big too big problems the
first one is that they required to be
online what everyone is online every
time but there are some kind of apps
that are that should be able to run
without an internet connection or a tab
with good internet connection and the
other problem is the how to access
device native device capabilities so you
want to create an app you want to create
your you want to access your location
okay you can access your location with a
browser but maybe the camera oh yes it's
also the camera and it's similar but not
the bark of the scanner or what's
happening when you want to access the
more devices specific capabilities like
the accelerometer or my record code the
scanner or name it so what we have is
also another perception from from this
is their performance problem we know
that in native we will be more
performance that in web but at the same
time the productivity is also greater
and you go to the to the web into that
side when I said productivity I mean
that if you won't need to create the
same app three times this is going to be
costly one wants to create the same up
three times also another factor that is
important talking about productivities
which which tools do you want to use so
you want to go to Android you need to
write your code in Java or C++ if you
want to go iOS and you need to write
your code in swift or Objective C and
for all of the web developers if we are
web developers we like to choose our
tools so we are not trying to convince
anyone saying this is the tool to create
this app so maybe you are happy with
your browser your dev tools or you
- you sublime or you want to use your
text editor or vim or Visual Studio who
cares but this will affect your
productivity that the freedom to choose
the tool where you feel more productive
it's true that we have things like react
native react native allows has to create
native apps using JavaScript or rare
native native splits native script but
this technologies these frameworks are
pretty new and and they don't have all
the support maybe in two or three years
from now react native will be a good
solution but today is too new just to be
on the bleeding edge and sometimes if
you are working for a customer or you
want to create apps for your company you
don't want to experiment with these new
things in the other hand in the last two
three months everyone is talking about
progressive web apps the great promise
from Google we have progressive apps
that will allow you to half of line
access with service workers
you could have notifications you could
have but the realities again it's a new
technology it's only working in chrome
is not cross-platform it could be good
in some years from now but today the
best of option that we have this Cordova
that's how we think that for enterprises
when you want to create software and
apps for companies maybe it's not for to
publish in the store but for companies
is a real good option because it's right
in the middle of the performance and the
productivity so you will get more
performance that in a typical web
applications because you can have access
to the device capabilities there is a
solid and mature community of people
creating plugins so we have more than
thousand plans to do a lot of different
different things with with your devices
and at the same time it's not tied to
any company or tool so
we have companies like IBM working in
Cordova Salesforce Adobe and Microsoft
so it's not just one one company and
there are a lot of tools to work with
this but again you will need something
else not just Cordova because you are
going to see right now that Cordova just
the basics in first infrastructure to to
make this possible but you need
something else to create your apps and
there are a lot of frameworks in the web
some of them are really specialized for
for this kind of development like
angular an anionic but if you want to
choose our framework it's fine even you
can use react GIS in collapse not react
native react yes we are running some
experiments to enable some kind of
native capabilities inside code of apps
but again it's more an experiment
something new that we are testing if it
really works or not so focusing on
Cordova which are the best benefits that
we found the first is the lower cost of
ownership so if you truly can share your
business logic and your UI layers and
fully sharing the hundred percent of
your code and you could lower the cost
of ownership and and get to market
faster and you can create apps that are
really really similar to native apps
maybe there are some effects transitions
things that are specific for one
platform that you can get those but for
an overall for the average app I think
that we call the way we can have a real
good with performance
and this is why we call hybrid and
hybrid is something that is in the
middle of the worlds like a wanna so
these kind of animals they are good on
the water and good on the earth they can
survive in two different ambient so you
need to you can think in in hybrid in
the same way because hybrid means that
there is some part that is native but
also some time that is weapon the good
thing here is that the problems with
native and are abstracted from you so
you're going to see when I'm show you
how Cordoba works that you don't need to
know Objective C or Java or C sharp to
access the device capabilities it's on
the plug-in and the plug-in will expose
some JavaScript API that allows you to
access this capabilities without special
knowledge of the native code so before
who knows whose Cordova everyone who use
it yes just just to know how much time
you want to spend here so I can go very
fast so Cordova just the short
description is just a web view that
renders your UI in Dom but have access
projections to the device capabilities
using plugins
it's plug-in exposes and the JavaScript
API so you write once in JavaScript and
all the calls will be translated to the
to the native liar
so you can thinning Cordoba something
like this you create your Cordova
project and then you will have one part
of the code that the inner is your code
your HTML your javascript or css the
configuration your a splash screens
icons and so on and other part that you
don't see but it's still there that is
the platform code and the plugins code
in fact you need to build three times
one for its platform so what Cordova is
doing you can think in Cordova is like a
code generator where you are and
generating the code for its platform
base it from just one single source so
this is why we unit in a Mac if you want
to build for iOS and you need Windows if
you need to build for Windows but it's a
code generator and from this you will
generate your your project and so let me
do a quick demo about what is Cordova
and I want to show you not only Cordova
but also what is the vs code extension
for Cordova have you try that extension
and in the room no so
let's do what were the first up
oops
like this so cordoba say come on line
then that runs on note right now we are
on version 6.2 I guess and to create an
app I can do Cordova create and you see
up and I'm going to give a name this is
important because it will generate the
config.xml for the provision profile
that I have required you have provisions
in this device to be able to to create
so this will create a basic Cordova
project and what's what isn't it so you
have a config.xml that is like the
manifest of your app here is where you
define your
you're content some policies and your
icons and so on and then you we have
hooks hooks is just a mechanism to
customize how the plugins will work
platforms is where you specify which
platforms do you want to support you can
choose you can choose just one platform
three platforms in fact Cordova the open
source project supports more than eight
platforms including Web OS Firefox
Amazon but in Microsoft we are focusing
just on the big three Windows Windows is
one Windows 10 in iOS and Android then
you have your plugins is where the
native code is living and finally that
data folder this folder dub-dub-dub is
like the root of your web server is
where you put all your web assets so the
first thing that we can do is to add a
platform for iOS
okay and now I should be able to run so
to do so and I have here this cool trick
but this is my device real device and
I'm going to deploy here on iOS last
device and the app that I just created
is here so what is happening here is
that Cordova is creating the Xcode
project with native code and it's
building the whole thing invoking Xcode
but you don't need to see that so I'm
sure you didn't show you showing this
just for to explain what is it but but
you don't need to understand what is
happening if we open this with code you
will see what's happening here
so here in the platform sorry OS this is
the platform that I generate and hearing
glasses you will see that there are some
code to be honest I don't understand so
but I know that it's here right so here
is where the native code lists but you
don't need to see this never okay so
here is my app basic HTML and the
canonical example here is just to access
the camera for example so to access the
camera let's say that we want to add a
click event handler here and then show
the image the picture that I'm going to
take so I will add an image it's going
to be the photo and some style
with
like this okay
and now let's add some JavaScript to
access the camera
so I have this element
I'm going to have a listener that will
be click and click what I want is to
call this take picture
and let's create that functional this
will be the picture this will be
functional that this is what we are
going to do most of the plugins are
exposed in their API in the Navigator
object
and here is where I'm going to show you
the tools that we are building to have a
better experience now I know the code
it's in my head I memorized the
signature and everything but I'm going
to show you which tools are we doing to
improve this experience so it will be
something like camera get picture and
they get picture there are two coal box
first one is the success callback that
will return some data and the second one
is the world callback
so okay and finally there are some
options that I never remember so what I
want to do here with the data is do the
bar of course you can use here any
framework that you want so you want to
use jQuery or backbone or knockout you
can do it on just doing this demo for
simplicity I think that the idea was
photo and I want to make the eye source
data right that's it
okay so the only thing that is missing
is that I need to add the plug-in to the
project the camera plugin so one thing
about Cordova is that the plugins is
like their references that you add to
your CSR project so you choose which
native capabilities you want to do so
let me go back to the console Cordova
plug-in I can list
I have only one plugins the whitelist
this is something about security to
control which URLs you can call from
your app but I'm going to add plugin
plugin Conner the plugins are stored in
NPM so you can search for plugins and
most of them are stuffed with Cordova -
plugin but it's not really required so
now if I run a Cordova prepare iOS this
is not going to build this is just going
to generate the code that will be built
afterwards so now if we look at the
platforms iOS here we will have more
classes that access the camera here
so here's the plugin but again you don't
need to look at this so ugly so sorry
trust me is here and now let's run the
app Cordova run iOS device that's it
let's see if it works the first time
and show you this is the previous
version of the app uninstall install
again running now I click here this is
the camera picture use this photo on the
photos here okay so this is a simple
demo I think that you get an idea about
what call demise any questions from now
good that's great so what we did in in
in code to make this experience a little
bit better so we have one extension that
you can get from the store and I already
install this extension from the store
not from the a gallery or via Scott
extension Valerie and I have the Cordova
tools extension that I have is not the
one that is release it I built this one
here before but you can do the same this
is open source in github go to vs code -
Cordoba pull clone the repo build and
you can drag and drop the v6 and you
will have the latest versions of the
tools and we are doing three things here
first thing is to add some commands to
the palette so you can do Cordova wheel
so you can do the build here the same
thing that I did from the command line
you can do from here well the second
thing that we add is that we are
detecting which plugins are you using
and we are adding
typings you are going to say oh but this
type is work from typescript right yes
this is the dot d dot TS syntax to
define which is the API that you want to
use but vs code is able to consume these
typings for your JavaScript so you don't
need to use typescript in the if you
don't want so now if I need to write the
same code again first when I say dot I
should have the camera here
in the gate picture I should have the
picture with the parameters and for
example here I told you that there were
some options that I never remember the
option here is camera options this is
the type so the experience will be much
as any static language so here I could
say destination type equals camera
destination type dot and I have here my
own or things like the quality of the
photo and I would say so we are doing
the common palate integration we are the
intellisense
and also we are doing something that is
really cool that is that we allow debug
in your app from here so you can set
breakpoints like here and there
choose your debugger for Cordova and run
on iOS device and from here
no come on line and it should be the
same thing as we did before but with
debugging and jelly sense and common
path integration this is the basic thing
of this extension this is what is
release it and later I will guide you
about more things that we are doing so
right now let's see if the breakpoints
are there whoops here we go and you can
divide and you can have your what is and
everything
take another photo whoops and we will
see the call back here with your college
stack your watches I could say what's
that I and I can see everything
okay any of you have used vs code for
debugging before well I think that it's
a nice feature that we have so this is
cross-platform running in the Mac
everything good okay so this is the
extension so let's talk let's go back to
the presentation
we were here
took at the time
okay so we all know that we want
JavaScript but what's happened with
JavaScript the big problem with
javascript is what we call the feature
gap this is light is not mine it's from
Anders Helzberg the inventor of
typescript and C sharp and he defined
the feature gap like a problem that we
have one in a dynamic language like
JavaScript where the standards are
evolving but implementations not so fast
so for example one year from now and in
2015 we were very close to hit the
es2015 standard but the server were a
little bit behind yes five under
browsers even behind so what's happened
is that we want to use the latest
features but for what if no one is able
to consume that features things like
classes or LED or that kind of things
and this is what we called it in the
future gap where we want to have
productivity and but we also need to
target to specific devices so one year
ago some people said okay it's cool to
have touchscreen but there will be some
point where all the browsers and nodejs
and everyone will hit yes 2015 so why I
care about typescript what happened is
that in a year from now the standards
already evolved and the browser's and no
but there is still a feature gap so if
you are running typescript you will be
able to run on the bleeding edge of the
language and at the same time target all
the browsers that you've that you want
in fact today you can use typescript 1.8
and target ES 3 so running in real all
devices and that's really important when
if you are planning to turn to charge
the devices like real androids
all androids but sometimes they are not
supporting all JavaScript features
so typescript you know it's just a
superset of JavaScript so any JavaScript
program is a typescript program but you
can add things and first thing are types
and when you have types you have that
experience you have better tooling you
can do things like intellisense you can
do things like go to definition and the
things like refactorings renames and
that's really this will increase your
productivity and well if I started with
type of language like C sharp to be
honest I prefer the compiler tell me if
I made a mistake running that waiting
until I'm running the application so
everything that I can get from their
compiler better and the good thing is
that it's up to you how much typescript
you want to use or not we are very close
to typescript 2.0 that will be really
set soon for sure with the next version
of Visual Studio but you can use
typescript even where you want it's not
tied to Visual Studio so we have one
version of typescript 4 vs another
version of tight grid that is an npn
module so you can run it in Linux Mac
and Windows where you want and it's up
to you how much typescript you want so
you can choose how many types you want
to add so what I we are seeing is a lot
of people that have some code in
JavaScript and they are moving
progressively you don't need to do
everything typescript so you can mix
things together in fact one of the cool
features that is coming on the next
version of Visual Studio is the
JavaScript language service that we call
salsa that will allow you to mix
JavaScript and typescript in the same
projects religiously to have the same
experience with intelligence but this
will allow you to choose which parts of
your programs wants to try to move to
the typescript
but is not only the language the other
problem is the framework so last year we
did survive through more than 800
Cordoba developers asking to with
tooling framework tools they were using
and we created this tag cloud so there
are a lot of options a lot it's not easy
to choose your your framework in one
hand you want to use a framework because
you don't want to write code from
scratch everything so here in the demo
is nice to use get element by ID but
when you rang write get element by ID
hundred times every day probably you
need something else but you go to jQuery
it's I don't know if really solves all
the problems you can use knockout for
the binding but what's happened with the
routing and so at the end you need to
make a decision and when you choose one
of these frameworks for video I'm going
to use 100% of this frame where you are
going to use 10% 20% and this could
affect your your performance so again
it's a trade-off between performance and
productivity what we think is that with
angular 2 that is in release candidate
the run right now it's from Google but
we will have a good trade-off between
performance and productivity at the end
I will show you how it looks like to
create an app with angular 2 and an
ionic tube and it's not only the
framework it's also the tooling and this
is what creates more headaches for a lot
of users because you don't want to spend
time here npm it's huge just to
understand all the different options
that you have to install your packages
so what we did with Cordova plugins that
are NPM but you don't know I think that
it's a good approach you have a gulp
grant to create your tasks you have sass
to have better CSS you have type speed
but you need to transpile the typescript
in something else and it's not only
transpiling the problem with not the
problem the challenge with typescript or
even es6 is that you have the thing
called modules where you can read define
the dependencies of your components from
remember when you decide to add one new
javascript library to your webpage Oh
remember I need to go to all my HTML and
add this script tag
oh no but I have my master page so I
only add in one place but what happened
with the order so you need to take care
of the order everything with modules
everything that the problem is gone but
now you have a different problem is that
them what's happened with the module how
are you going to reference the modules
do you want to hit like 200 or 300 files
at this angular or you want to create a
bundle so you want to create a bundle
maybe you want to use webpack or system
jas or loader so there are a lot of
options and one of the things that it's
my advice and the best practice that
when you choose your framework look very
carefully at the tooling that it's based
on because maybe you can choose a
framework that does not have a solid
tooling and could just slow down your
development so it's important the
framework but also the tooling that is
behind it and this is why we created the
what we talk we call taco Visual Studio
Tools for Apache Cordova that are a set
of utilities on top of Visual Studio
that will help you to create this kind
of program so now I need to switch to
Windows but if you're running in my
parallels so it's not very fast and here
I have visual studio and with cord Allah
so what we have here is a typical
project visual studio project and this
is ionic 1 using angular 1 but with
typescript so ionic 1 by default is
using javascript not typescript but we
created this template and will allow you
to use typescript with JavaScript but
you will see that it is not the full
feature typescript it's just a migration
from JavaScript attached
so things that that we have here first
thing that you will notice is these
dependencies so here we support NPM and
Bower NPM to declare your the
dependencies that you have those are
define it on this package Jason this is
the standard NPM way to define
dependencies here for example we depend
on gulp and Bower Bower
it's another packets manager to be
honest is not very popular these days
but ionic wanna use it so we support it
anyway so we are seeing that most of the
of the frameworks and developers are
just putting everything on NPM so NPM is
eating all the different package
managers but anyway we support both and
we also have a support for Bower because
hi onic is in Bower one important thing
about NPM is that there were a change
before NPM 3 and after NPM 3 but there
are really really different so before
NPM 3 all the dependencies were created
in a deep hierarchy that most often that
we like we hit the max path issue in
Windows of 256 characters that has been
solved latest version of Windows you
don't know the person that is coming
this summer has the option to enable
long paths but anyway after NPM 3 and
the hierarchies flat hierarchy so we
don't have this problem anymore and this
is important because depending on which
version of node and NPM you are using
you could have problems or not well
anyway I mean running here the release
candidate to of the web tools because
some part of these of these tools are
not only for Cordova projects are also
shared with asp.net core projects for
example NPM it's the same tool
and also we have our gulp file in our
gulp file is where we define the
different tasks that we have here in
ionic 1 it's real simple one we only use
two tasks one is to compile the SS and
other one is to compile the the other
ones to compile the type script that
should be here so here instead of using
the command-line compiler of typescript
I'm using the this gulp task that also
is creating source maps search maps is
an important part of your typescript
workflow because we will allow you to
debug the typescript even if the code
that is running is the JavaScript but
your experience will be like
exit sharp and we also have here another
tool that it's little hidden it's called
the touch Runner Explorer and this tool
is able to parse your good file and
allows you to execute tasks from here so
if I run this what will happen is that
it will check the typescript code that I
have here and will transpile the code to
JavaScript that you can see here in dub
dub dub yes
here I have my JavaScript and my maps
this is what is deployed to the to the
device
and the other thing that we added to
visual studio is this one editor for
this manifest for the config.xml and
here you can define some common
properties for your manifest like
versions your ID or names descriptions
the version of Cordova that you are
using remember that in the common line I
was using the latest at this six - oh
but I can choose which version of of
Cordova we want to run or you can use
the global install version we are taking
a lot of attention to make sure the
interoperability between vs code and BS
so you can have some people in your team
working with Visual Studio and some of
they were working with vias and
everything should work because we think
that not everyone on the team has the
same preferences and this is one of
these features that will make easier to
configure and one important thing here
the plugins so we provide apply an
editor we are constantly updating these
this list well not only this list all
the tools right now last as this week we
will release the update 10 of tako we
are trying to be as more agile as we can
and release often and one of the things
that we are doing is improving this
experience so we are offering here a
list of plugins that we care about so we
are reviewing the quality of these
plugins one of the problems with the
open source is that you are dependent of
a lot of plugins from a lot of people
and who knows with the qualities the
quality that I need so the blinds that
you will see here are plugins that we
tested and
that we ensure that will work plugins
that we have here for example Adel this
is for active director Archer the
Directory authentication mobile apps
this will allow you to have push
notifications access to data mobile
engagement this is the core plugins of
Cordova like actors the battery
Bluetooth low-energy camera capture so
the same thing that I is that I did
before here will be just at and this
will do the same thing without the
common line doing basically the same
thing we also have the ability to add
plugins you can have plugins by ID so
you find the plug-in in NPM or whatever
and you don't want to go to the command
line you can add it from here you can
also add plugins from your local folder
this is really helpful if you decide to
create your own your own plugins or even
from gate so you can say they get URL we
will grab the plug-in for you and
uninstall and then just show you their
plugins that are installed and the last
thing that they want to show you about
Visual Studio because I don't want to
spend too much time here and probably
you know we saw a studio or love it or
hate it but that's the other cool
feature that we have is that we provide
the same experience across different
platforms so you can choose your
platform so here I mean windows I mean
going to deploy in my local machine and
we provide a debugging experience that
will allow you to use your Windows iOS
Android emulator devices or even browser
workflows that we will talk a little bit
about browser war flow what it's
important in Cordova development from
the same integrated environment from
Visual Studio that's something that is
unique from this tool and the debugging
I'm not talking all only about
typescript debugging we are also talking
about Dom Explorer
so here this is the Windows version
we have the problem here well anyway
this is just to show you they the
debugging that that we have here and we
have a Dom Explorer where it's like the
dev tools where you can navigate for the
different nodes and see and change
things so the only thing is that if you
want to build and debug for iOS you
can't do it in your box so you need
something you need to communicate to
your Mac machine so what we have is a
tool called remote build it here again
this is another NPM package I'm going to
configure without security to avoid it
but you can configure with certificates
and so on and this is like a web server
that is listening to Visual Studio so
when I go to iOS and I say that I want
this time I want to use a simulator not
the device I can run this and my vs will
communicate with that common line tool
and will allowed to build deploy attach
and the back and we have different
options here because sometimes it's not
not natural that you have two machines
and you are deploying one machine and
debugging in the other so we also have
the ability to have local iOS
deployments what it means is that you
can have one Mac Mini or even a Mac in
cloud somewhere request the build
grab the IPA that is the output file and
deploy it to your to your iOS device
that is attached to your Windows machine
so you don't need to have a Mac in your
office you can use a remote build two to
do this so right now we are submitting
here you will see that we started a new
bill that is this one
but it takes some time so it's something
that we enable but probably you will
understand that we need something with
more speed so what i'm doing here is
good for demos but isn't it's not good
for working every day so we cannot make
a change to a file and wait like three
minutes until I can see something in my
simulator right
and because Gordo is for web developers
we know that well developers have
different expectations so they want to
have speed so I want to make a change
and I want to see that change fast I
want to edit the CSS file I want to I
did my email my JavaScript I wants to
see the tense really fast because this
is how things works today in the web so
we have that concept of live reload that
even I don't want to press f5 every time
I make a DT I want to make a change and
that's it and I want to see the change
and also this every time that I make a
change to a typescript I need to spin up
all my tooling so I need to create my
tongue my touch script build I want to
create my bundle my sass everything and
I want to do it just every time I save a
file so here in beers we are let's see
if they will ends
and then I can show you their browser
workflow oh I never trust name I don't
want to spend more time here but it
works and so for because I'm not using
it it's because they're different
versions of card of Cordova that I'm the
Ben Rhyne
so in Visual Studio what we have is a
tool called ripple ripple it's a web
emulator where you can use Chrome and
little web server to emulate your
emulate your device so here what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to run
this watch task in my test run or
Explorer so every time I change
something any type my type script this
will pick up the Train turn and execute
the the task that is affected so right
now I'm watching for CSS changes and
typescript changes and I'm going to
deploy in rebel and this is much faster
because I don't need to run the native
part remember when we started talking
about Cordova that we are making real
builds this is not a real build this is
just putting things under that data
folder and showing showing that things
so this is ripple
this is another open-source project
again I can debug I can attach whoops
okay and here I have my app I can do
things like in any Dom Explorer so for
example let's say that I want to select
this the playlist and want to say music
cool let's here
change it real time but this is this
change didn't Riggin from my code so
what I want is to let's see if I can do
things a little bit smaller
like this okay
let's open the controller run it again
this time without debugging just to make
it faster and I want to make some
changes here in my in my code so for
example here in the list let's see this
is running yes
now let's see that it changed and who
like still I like rock so then with one
hand safe and it's Indian I don't want
to take should change without any but
here we go but this is too as low this
is too much we know that we make the
this live reload so we are working to
improve this experience right now and
what we have is something envious code
that is much lighter so in Visual Studio
there are some technical problems right
now in this version of years but the
next version the tool for Apache Cordova
this experience will be much better but
anyway you didn't need to hit refresh
run and everything so everything is
automated so time happen so fast I'm
gonna have 10 more minutes and a couple
of things to cover so one thing is the
live reload so for live reload I have
here and the same up but it's a unique
I am
this is the same up I'm going to open it
up in BS code let me close this instance
and that's another feature that we added
recently to the extension that it's the
integration with ionic serve so here I'm
going to serve to the browser from from
yes and I'm going to do the same thing
and you will see that is much faster so
this is more or less the same as ripple
but using an ionic tool that is called
ionic serve we have a back here didn't
show up there so it's here let's do
exactly the same change and you will see
the
seem you can see it
like this
Rock safe no now safe and this is the
speed that we want something like this
so again this is type script that has
been compiled and everything
but what's in the future the future is
not ionic one or angular one is ionic
two so ionic two it's a great framework
is based on angular 2 this allows has to
create some kind of HTML components
where do you define your own tags that
will embed all behavior or styles and
everything is really easy to compose
applications with this it's based on
type script so the types could be
experience is much better because when
you write a program type script the
types are defined at the same time it's
different when you use the library from
one for example you use mom and Jes and
then someone else create the Taipings
there could be some mismatch between the
versions of the library and the Taipings
if the library is written written in
typescript the version will always match
ionic also provides a cool way to
provide access to plugins that they call
it ionic native and now you are going to
see and the most important value
proposition from ionic is that they
allows you to define the interface once
and interface the UI will adapt for its
device so for example the tab bar will
be in the top of the bottom if it's
Android or is
iOS they will use material design and
you don't need to worry about this this
is because they have a bit advanced
theming scenario so let's before
they can look to for the code let me
explain a little bit how ionic to up or
angle up up looks like so here this is
the modern typescript that we want to
write so the first thing that you will
notice is the imports this is like the
using this is how you define your
dependencies this could be from an
external system like angular here or it
could be your own component so if we
start with dot it's because it's your
code and if it's not starting with dot
the compiler will go to the node module
folder of npm to to get these in this
type in we also have attributes like
well really they are called decorators
like that add up that will specify
behavior this is the aspect or in the
programming we have this in Java and
then cesare for long time
we have classes we also have decorators
we have types and you don't need to
write function anymore so just a method
like initialize app is a function or
here this platform ready this is the the
event that cordova saying the plugins
are ready to use them lambda expressions
promises just in this culture will say
the future and this will be the markup
so the first thing is that you will
notice the new tax like I own content or
I own list that will define behavior and
you can make the ionic tax with your own
tax like button that it's a typical
button we also have some attributes this
ng for this is the angular syntax to
create a repeater so this will create
different buttons well with from let P
of pages this click is the way you have
bi-directional data binding so you can
respond to events and this open page is
just a method on the class there is no
more Mike nothing to bind things and
finally with this double square braces
it's how you define
binding so if you mix all of this the
app that you will have will be something
like this open
this is the same map but written in AI
with ionic - so most of the of your app
will live on on the app folder and you
will have a typescript file and an HTML
file five so for example here and the
sass file and the good thing about this
is that angular is able to compose all
all of the parts and all the components
and all the COA CSS and all the
typescript
but the code the code looks really
really natural so here and just to
finish my demos I'm going to write the
same thing that I did at the beginning
just to use the but because I have only
five minutes and I would like to to show
it but I have here in another branch so
this will looks like this so what I did
was adding just one button saying that
one click I want to take picture and
instead of doing that document get
element by ID I don't need the ID
anymore and what I can is to bind to
some property so the communication
between the HTML and the typescript is
just a method and the property property
that I'm using to bind so here what we
have is that I create this property and
here I have a camera this is from import
camera you will see that all the
different native capabilities that you
have they get picture quality everything
but instead of using the call box it
will use SEP remise I assign this value
here and that's it this is all all that
I need
and the latest thing that not we are for
this is that okay but if I want to use
the native capabilities I cannot use the
browser workflow that I show you because
the brochure workflow runs in browser so
what's happening with the native
capabilities and this is the latest
thing that we are adding to this
extension is what we call Cordova
simulate so here we had a couple of
options these options that while they
will intercept all the calls to the
native code and provide a UI where you
can specify which values do you want to
this so every time that you are writing
native code you have a way to mock in
that call so now you're not fired
something's wrong with me well this is
the UI where you can simulate the
different plugins and events so you can
simulate where is where you are in the
map or how is the battery or how is the
accelerometer or instead of the camera
saying just return this picture and
that's it and let's see because I think
that I need to run the the gulp task
so now be as cold show me my gold file
I'm going to run the tasks it will take
some time
if I have the platform and this will
finish my demo
yes
well so it's not working anyway you have
the idea this is us this has not been
really said this is the source code that
we are working on right now but I expect
to release it very very soon but they
did you get the idea that we are working
on a brochure workflow where we can
capture all the native code so you will
have the best of both worlds when you
are developing but this didn't mean that
you need to to do everything on the
browser so sometimes you need to build
for the device and for that what makes
it easier is if you have a good
integration with with some tools like
oops our cloud so in Visual Studio the
services we have built tasks for CI CD
build so it's really easy to create
automatic deployments so you can start
with your core Delap create an automatic
continuous integration build for it
you can integrate with hockey app that
it's a product that we have for beta
distribution so every time someone makes
a change it will make the native
compilation submit to a private store
where your testers could download the
app and test it very easily
and finally the latest product that we
have that let this service it's one
called code push that this will allows
you to send updates to your app even if
the app has been downloaded from the
store because this is HTML right so you
don't need to build everything so if you
are not adding more plugins or you are
not doing that kind of things you are
not changing the native capabilities you
can send updates even without using the
store there are more we could talk just
another session only with that so in
summer summary just for ending and we
have the web web is a good platform and
you can use all the technology
technologies that you want that you know
and you love to create your apps you can
choose your JavaScript framework
primordia that you want with typescript
you can increase your productivity you
need to select your target devices it's
not the same target all Android devices
that modern ones or iOS or Windows it's
important to target the devices use
modern tools as vs code or visual studio
and use the cloud and visual studio team
system to deploy frequently and make
sure that your app really enjoy your
users so here I have some URLs but
they're really easy to find so Cordova
dot IO taco that visual studio that
comes where we are hosting our our
documentation a couple of important
reports the BS code Cordova is the
extension that I showed you for rias
code that is open source and the Cordova
simulate that this is the latest product
that we are working on and I think that
that's it just in time any questions or
comments thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
