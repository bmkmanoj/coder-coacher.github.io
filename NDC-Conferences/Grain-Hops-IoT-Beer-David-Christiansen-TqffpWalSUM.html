Christensen and I come from Glasgow in
Scotland by they I work as a principal
technologist for a wide ock and by night
I am a geek and a brewer by show of
hands do we have anyone that's tried
brewing beer and here before awesome
other show of hands how many people have
raspberry pies
how many people have a used those rusty
pies sorry got your piece ashes Susanna
and so yeah I'm here to talk about how I
used in my grocery pie it means my
brewing process and they make better
beer so I like beer and like you're
quite a lot and I also spend a lot of
money on beer and so the natural
progression for me and what Shirley's
can be cheaper if I brew my own so I
went to the local where supermarkets
I bought the in the Box home brewing kit
fold the vague instructions and waited
patiently for a couple weeks and it's
safe to say that what the results were
were absolutely revolting
they were undrinkable and but I've been
to me off
what a that maybe decide was I'm going
to do what the Brewers do I'm going to
use the same ingredients that vo Brewers
use I'm going to use the same process
and that process says it all grain
brewing now you can do all the rim
brewing in your house indeed you can do
in your kitchen however that my noble
den well with everyone else that was in
the house a so that's why I ended up in
the garage
brewing can be a straightforward they
can be straightforward burn and in
practice it can be quite challenging and
by no means is technology a substitute
for experience and trying and gaining
skills but where technology can help is
in one of the key principles of a
successful brewing not as consistency as
with so many things and so what I wanted
to do was apply some of the principles
from my day job and I applied that into
the brewing process and that is mainly
automate an instrument as much as
possible so it can be repeatable so of
all the ingredients that are involved in
brewing yeast is the one that we really
care about a yeast is a very sensitive a
microorganism and is a particularly
sensitive to temperature so it's
temperature that we're wanting to use
technology to monitor and control and
but before we get started to use yeast
we need to prepare the liquid that we're
going to ferment with yeast and for that
I use a green father the green father is
actually a fantastic better kit and the
more recent their versions are actually
Bluetooth controls from your iPhone or
Android you put in your recipe all the
ingredients hit starts and it will gauge
you through the whole aim mashing
sparging boiling a world cooling process
the result of which is a lovely sugary a
liquid which is a yeast is it desperate
to start eating and that process is
called fermenting and fermenting it
takes place within our temporary
interpreter to importer controls
fermentation chamber otherwise known as
a fridge and for that we need to hack a
fridge word of warning it's best that
you go out and get a second time fridge
hacking your facehole fish does not go
down well and so what we're going to do
we are going to take control of the
fridges compressor so we can cool things
down we're going to install a heater so
we can heat things up we're going to
install some their sensors and all that
able be wired into initially an Arduino
and the adrenal will be connected to the
Raspberry Pi and no hacking a fridge
actually isn't as complex as you may
think
and essentially what we're doing is a
to realize that we can control one for
the heater one for the the cella of the
compressor the cords that's a
controlling that very of us either the
relays is from a project from a cold and
proof I made by a very nice gentleman
called Apple Jacobs from Netherlands and
what blue pine does is it can do
everything from entry-level monitoring
and of environments all the way through
to fill brewery a automation which I
hope to demonstrate later if I've got
same result of which is something like
this now this is a from a Peru added
earlier this year and all those squiggly
lines a is the system trying to maintain
a consistent temperature on in my wort
which is the fermenting beer so given
that data I that got me excited and like
what else can I do aside data and this
is where in flux dd ingress fan I come
come in in flexsim fox TB is an event
this event database it's built for
storing data coming from monitoring
devices and Internet of Things devices
and Agri fauna is a fantastic date of a
data visualization tool for creating
dashboards and it also has monitoring
capabilities and away acting fantastic
and it looks a wee bit like this now I
have a demo of this but I'm not gonna
have time to show you but if you're
interested I can show you a way so
really very simple to two things
together so I've now got a my in flux DB
and a fan are all running on the lovely
Raspberry Pi here in docker or all the -
all the technology what else can I do
now so I start looking at other Wi-Fi
enabled chips the blue pipe project and
moved away from the arduino platform
towards a particle photons so i did the
same and initially i just recheck and
it's a fantastic little device which is
going to fall off the table if it's a
felow device once it's on your home
network
it synchronizes to particle and you can
use the cloak based IDE to write
software and deploy to the device on
your desktop a this a code and setup is
a simple temperature monitor which
throws data into influx database
absolute fantastic the next one I looked
into was a Remus d1 money which is based
on the esp8266 Wi-Fi chips a
fantastically versatile device
especially when you apply it where face
is something called blue pylus which
essentially means that a no longer need
to my Arduino
I actually know when I lead my Raspberry
Pi everything runs off a chip like that
so wire up create a socket you've got a
nice little self-contained unit
especially when you combine it with a
little device like this a sawn-off th10
is our applying say geared towards a
home automation very low cost indeed and
it also has this esp8266 chipset which
means you can flash it with the blue
kylus plug in your temperature sensor
and plug it into a key sir and that's
you got our temperature controlled unit
in Scotland you just open the door to
cool things down is called a yeah so
what we're moving away from is boxes of
wires and solving more to professional
things and makes looking things like
this
and that's exactly what group I entered
as well they moved to the photon as they
started developing a nice little unit
self-contained looking lovely with all
the connectivity you needs we're now in
version 3 or so theorem now in version 3
which is launching soon by I just happen
to have a nearly a foot safe in here
another really exciting thing that the
blue PI team are working on is our user
interface which will allow you to
represent visually your whole brewing
process control valves control pumps
heaters monitoring everything it takes
all the boxes for me I do have a
demonstration of
but we're just going to show you a quick
video what do my body was turned in
which is oh here we go
so it's going to go pop hopefully we
have audio so isn't that fantastic eh
so why mobile clinics just of our pop
how we doing 14 and mobile looking into
next hold you know when your beers done
well historically you would take
historical traditionally you would take
a manual samples at the beginning of
fermentation and through this a the
fermentation process and when it stopped
the value stops changing then you know
that the yeast is a finished having its
meal and you've now got beer hopefully
one key point is you know when I gave a
beautifully and they go are you going to
kill me that's the first question and be
very strong is it there's absolutely no
excuse for humbly not to be accurate if
you follow a specific and calculating
specific gravity and the adv then you
know exactly what the alcohol and
percentages so there's no excuses for
drinking vodka fuel unwittingly so what
do we want to do here we want to create
a digital hydrometer so this is where we
use something like this yeah suspect
looking but what it actually is is are a
units that sets within the fermentation
chamber and continuously monitors the
fermentation process so a not no more
having to go into the garage in your
lockers and taking samples and having to
drink your beer before this ready you
can now go onto your screen whilst
drinking - beer and watch it in the wait
for it to be ready the last thought I'm
going to be looking at is a so I've got
kegs and and I want to know how much
beer I've got left of course I could go
lest it but that's difficult I've also
got a very much unused a Wii Balance
Board which is essentially a
bluetooth-enabled
a
a week skill so that they're the
challenges to basically you use that to
send data into the influx database and
use grow sauna to perform calculations
to see you've got four points left start
between the fart thank you very much and
if you've got same do we have team I
think yeah we do I'm going to try and do
a we've ever them so while starts outfit
out there I'll come back to our screen
so you can see notes if you want and so
what we have here is instance of guru
ply running and you can see the
temperature or you can't see it here we
go so you can see a when I started a
setting up for today we've got some
lovely data coming in if I switch to my
SSH console you can also see that I'm
taking data from blue PI I'm spitting it
into a influx database and if we search
here as fairly blank I made in New
Zealand very quickly yeah oh yeah I'll
come back to that one so this is the UI
that just showed you earlier
so just an issue everything is closed so
let's say go in and start my full sets
off and filling the hot like a ton so
that's why I want to do what we've got
here is a representation of these a two
valves in the bottom so when I hit apply
you should get some lovely noise there
you go so what that is as a valve and so
I'm now filling that tongue OS say a
lots of a lovely cold water and I it's
sort of a boil kettle next apply again
so fantastic so the UI is actually
calculating that this floor and Rio is
going and let's just close that off and
have a fly so isn't that exciting I
think is so with that thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
