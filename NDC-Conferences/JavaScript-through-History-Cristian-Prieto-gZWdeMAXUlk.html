welcome and thank you very much for
coming to my talking and ECC me the
first and this is Sydney
so far yeah obviously who I am my name
is Christian Peter you can't just reach
me and Twitter and things like that and
this is the play when I just spent out
and so just don't get it scary I look
like a psychopath or something like that
over there because the real life just in
case you pick this talk because you
thought that was the ice P tonic or
something like that is not this talk is
about JavaScript or history or why what
history can explain why javascript is so
goddamn ugly that it looks made made by
Satan himself
why well actually the reason because I
studies talk is that most of all I was
having this conversation with a girl
friend of mine this guy over here and
his husking hipster right look I do
understand and all the stuff and things
like that
and I said look and he was like bashing
JavaScript JavaScript Aradhana yeah
because it's the low-hanging fruit
everybody can buy JavaScript right so I
said look to be honest I don't see why
javascript different than any other
language like for example if you see C++
or C inclusive see and you see seed
through the history you see that the
first version of C and even like that
currently the the the other editions
were awful so do we need to understand
something very important here about
JavaScript is awful
or why we have to keep the faith that it
will change in the future
it is that programming languages are
like human languages right human kind of
like
rookie linguistics I love linguistic
especially proton European linguistics
and one of the first thing that you
understand
languages are living entities they are
more they are both dangerous and change
to time and we cannot control what
happen languages evolve now it's just a
way to requirements by the people that I
like the people using it then close to
the please the people that is using it
and change basing they need good example
to see this is looking at Old English
how many of you are native English
speakers a few of you this is the first
fragment or the oldest fragment of
English that we have knowledge of is B
wolf and is written in Old English not
Old English is as well known as
anglo-saxon right how many of you native
speakers understand what it says it's
just five hundred years old now five
hundred one thousand years old this is
actually what it means when you compare
one by one they are very different
because languages evolved the same with
programming languages we can now control
the evolution it's not like a pocket
right that you just like make it evolve
and change right some sometimes
devolution is just screwed up in the
same way that you just like if put the
Firestone to an if you just transform
into Flareon right so sometimes you can
do that or the worse thing that you just
give at under stone to a Pikachu to
transform into a Radeon that's the worst
thing that you cannot control what's
going to happen once it's happened you
guys are done it right the same happen
in English this is taking from one of
those popular animals a stove they say
like in the plural if the single artists
and the Brewers these were the plural
keys will be called keys right and I
don't know you guys
but I'm not native speaker yeah my
accent looks like I'm coming from North
Queensland but it's not
and as an astonishing native Spanish
speaker many things doesn't make sense
but English is do you want to be a
developer English is your lingua franca
if you want to be a developer now
javascript is a lingua franca you should
smooth the language and as I said
because dad used such multi language
sometimes we cannot see what is coming
afterwards because modern English
doesn't make sense
neither JavaScript so why why we got
here well historically I want to explain
you one why JavaScript looks so awful
and why has better stuff believe me it's
just for me was a revelation was like
you know what was I saw I don't know it
was because I hit my head or something
but I still lies and things like that
that makes me appreciate JavaScript a
little more it still made by Satan but
you know how JavaScript what blue was
born well in the beginning we are
talking about 1993 when there was
nothing there was something named at
NCSA mosaic and that was the first
commercial kind of commercial browser
that we know there was so there before
that it was a browser named abu allah
and there's and there was another one
named Amadeus
but mosaic was the first one widespread
it was a simple browser it did what he
has to do go to the web right and part
of that story mosaic was actually like
created by a contract by not a company
NCSA that is the National Center for
supercomputing application that is a
venture between the federal state of the
United State and the University of
Illinois because of that day it was by
the state they could not sell software
because it's a state-owned right so
instead of that they create a spin-off
named spyglass Incorporated remember
that name spyglass incorporate
we'll get into that in a later the story
was like is that there was this
developer and risen and risen he create
the first moseyed for unix name x mosaic
they're owning x free windows the story
says that Alan Gore Al Gore just saw
that shit and said like whoa that thing
looks awesome man can we just like dude
shit with Internet and things like that
and it was like yeah so the things that
they star like doing work for Internet
and 1993 Messiah was out but the thing
is that this guy understand he was like
you know what I had kind of idea for
business man that thing about like being
poor all my life that doesn't call my
attention so he left NCSA and together
with one of the founders of Silicon
Graphics Interactive or incorporated SGI
he just like create their own company
the company was called Netscape and that
was around ii 92 originally Netscape was
not created to be a company around
browsers they have no interesting
browsers are all but the Andersons saw
the potential of the Internet and his
idea of creating business is was
creating like network for playing games
seriously that was like in 1993 was was
the time that dot had all that stuff
that was since 1993 that's right hey hey
hey what if we just don't connect like
Nintendo console because he was working
for getting a contract from Nintendo to
connecting Super Nintendo consoles so
they can play together in a network
obviously Nintendo was like that's never
going to work man right and the guys was
like well we just ran out of money where
would we have a look the only thing that
we have this like the pieces of this
stuff because there were developers as
well that he brought from the NCSA and
there was like this as more things that
was a browser at the beginning of a
browser that didn't have called from
mosaic
right it was completely homemade right
and they decide to release
this us a browser commercial and sell it
so they released the first version
mosaic Netscape that was the first name
obviously obviously the guys from
spineless and NCSA was like hey wait a
minute we have the trailer for mosaic so
what up and 9.4 millions later they
renamed to Netscape that was around 1994
so originally the browser was called
Netscape the same as the company with
every version to change the name so the
first version was called Netscape mosaic
because the concept of web browser was
new they didn't even know what was that
type of so we're always it's like now
that people say like or just clicking
the internet right to a study
terraexplorer or something like that in
those day was the same they didn't know
what was the nineties so they say like
oh the data or software is called mosaic
so Netscape I saw one of the stories
regarding escape is that when they
started Netscape the idea was to be a
mosaic killer right so that was the code
name for the deploying the mosaic killer
so when it was short the nickname was
Mozilla and that's the origin of the war
Mozilla you just learned something new
today right it means Messiah killer
there's another story regarding like the
user agents and things like that but you
can ask me outside in the cruise or
something like that so I know that
Netscape was very popular people were
paying dollar I think the day or the
original price of Netscape was $10 so
people were paying like ten dollars to
this company this new company Netscape
to get like an amazing browser because
there was like the other option one more
sign that was really slow and awful so
then because this morning somebody's
like what money
I like Bonnie and they said you know
what let's make a browser as well but I
can't imagine the people around that
like build your crazy right do you want
to do a browser do you know that
everybody right now is busy doing this
thing called in Windows 95 so we don't
have developers we only have four guys
that we just hire like and that's the
only thing that we have you know what
it's true we don't have time for making
a browser let's buy one so you remember
that I mention a spyglass that was the
commercial venture of NCSA well that
spyglass company had a browser mosaic so
the guys from from microservice like hey
what if we buy your mosaic render engine
and make that our own browser we will
call it Internet Explorer and they were
like oh good man but you have to pay you
royalties as well so Microsoft was like
ah damn it we have to pay royalties for
using my site you know what to avoid
paying royalties that's another very
important word here royalties you will
mention this I would mention this so
many times
let's make it free so if we make it free
I don't have to pay you royalties and it
was like fair enough
and they released that so the first
version of Internet Explorer's is user
agent string was NCSA mosaic one as well
but there was no JavaScript so far here
it was just the web browser to just the
proto Internet to call it something like
that so they decide to go with something
better
Netscape that was the leader I have like
so much money so like you know man I
want to make this team like more
interactive so what if we had scripted
language for this stuff
remember that Java was popular in those
days as well
originally I didn't own this but but now
I know I would share with you originally
they actually wanted to embed Java
inside Netscape but it was too
complicated so they just went from
Brendan egg and Brendan takes the
understand just said hey man you know
what you always complain that you don't
have anything to do that is cool so you
have ten days to do a programming
language I'm Brendan egg was a lisp
developer he used to work in making
compilers in a scam scheme so he said
like sweet I have this nightmare about
this language basing a scheme and I want
to make it and the first version of that
language after he was done in just ten
days was called mocha I don't know if
he's related to the mocha tests ranging
now or something like that but it was
called mocha obviously that name was no
hip and not was like mint with that
thing we are not going to sell anything
right so one marketing has these
brilliant ideas like because when you
use it you make things life in the page
let's call it live script and in fact
the first version you have a version of
Netscape that's how much I love you guys
I installed Netscape 2 and let's get to
better in a vector machine the first
version was called live script but and
that was in September there was renamed
to lie script so 1095 the thing is again
Java was the hot team there everybody
wants to Java everything right
so again marketing amazing marketing
just came and say like dude why did we
call the language JavaScript because
it's an ax scripting language that is
kind of like Java it was like man it
doesn't look like Java oh no no no no
forget about that you are your technical
stuff
and they were like okay dude but if we
just call it JavaScript we have to pay
royalties to Oracle so they just came to
Oracle and say like no Oracle nowadays
what song in those days someone's like
hey son what if we pay you this bunch of
money so we can't use the name
JavaScript so I was like okay I like
money
it was so into that or Java was so
important in the name that when Netscape
was released the press conference in
early 96 Athena was in ferry 96 son was
in the press conference and son had
nothing to do with Netscape but there
was easily just imagine it's like making
a party and inviting Kim Kardashian just
because you want to be popular right
what's exactly the same so far so far
javascript is still a registered
trademark by Oracle so just be careful
using the word JavaScript because
probably one day Oracle is going to sue
you an important thing that was in the
first specification of the Engla
standard or the javascript so we'll get
there soon is what is the definition of
an inscript in language and this is the
first thing that you need to understand
when you start smashing your head
against the wall when you find something
in javascript that you don't like
javascript is a scripting language it
was designed just to extend the browser
originally to create plug-ins for
Netscape not just a web page as well to
create to extend Netscape and as part of
the definition in the official
definition of JavaScript we find this
paragraph notice the word in formalities
and built-in that means here be dragons
don't complain that the language is
awful because we warned you it has
informality so every time they say like
why true is not equal true because it
has in formalities
I was a little curious about first how
much JavaScript evolved through time or
if it was compatible so I downloaded the
first version of Netscape not the first
version the first version the hot Java
screen that's got 2.0 we dealt with that
and try to load Google 47 errors loading
Google I actually never even imagined
that Google had JavaScript until I run
this so it doesn't load don't try it
don't try to live in the age of next guy
- because he's not going to work there
was another version of JavaScript as
well developed by Sun not only sorry not
by Netscape not only the JavaScript for
the browser Netscape as well has a web
server and for that web server they
create something I'm a live wire that
was JavaScript for the server so you can
just connect to database and things like
that so the next time a hipster comes to
you and said that no GS was the first
one to bring JavaScript to the server
just kicking in the boss net skatelite
work was the first disc a live wire the
pen off of proprietary extensions like
database and things like that and it has
a server attack as well so you a lot of
proprietary extension and guess what
happened javascript was goddamn popular
and everybody just like wing nuts and
start using javascript for everything it
was like yesterday right
that is the day query was out and
everything just created plugging in
jQuery to some two numbers so the same
thing happens here they went crazy and
like they start getting the market share
internet remember that intern exploit
one was already an intern exploit one
only having those days a market share
like probably three people right that
work from Microsoft and they have to
test Internet Explorer so that's the
reason because they were using it and
everybody else was using Netscape so
what happen is the Microsoft game as
like well scripting I can do that as
well and they release Internet Explorer
to with bbs script how many of you write
web pages in VBA script it was not
popular at all Microsoft sorry like you
know what these these guys just are
delivering Java like using Java to just
attract people I'm going to use peace or
basic to attract people didn't work very
well there is a mistake in the Google
page for Internet Explorer and the
Google page in Internet Explorer says
the Java Sea in turn inspired to was
shipped with JavaScript that it cannot
be possible
because JavaScript was released with
Netscape in 96 and Internet Explorer was
- was released in October 95 so it was
not possible there was not even like a
living example of JavaScript self and he
said yeah I was with JavaScript and it's
not true what they was released was we'd
be be a script then Netscape 3 was out
we are talking about here about there
was in almost 96 Netscape 3.0 was out
with JavaScript 1.1 the biggest change
here was that you now in Java spray can
change the location of images because
images in the original JavaScript
reciprocation was not possible - it was
not part of the Dom model was until
JavaScript 1.1 that the images was part
of the Dom model so when you just they
are discopath the ability to from
JavaScript change the location of images
so in that way you have Hoover's and
effects and things like that do you
remember those like your series pages
that were like crazy and think it was
because 1.1 again
one of the things that you learn is that
when you release a new features people
got snot and Starlight using it for
everything it's like oh my god can you
change my chest oh my god I'm going to
make such a great website now and
Microsoft say like a
want to do that as well the other
problem that he has after that is that
there was no more version of JavaScript
so originally to specify which version
of JavaScript you are going to execute
you have to add this 1.2 for 1.2 1.1 for
1.1 and so on that was the version in
those days
thanks Cory what change because right
now we will be something like JavaScript
five point zero point zero zero zero
point one something like that right ask
again it was popular Netscape was owner
of the market they have JavaScript BBS
trade never worked so Microsoft decided
to release Internet Explorer 3 with
Internet Explorer 8 three they released
JavaScript as well base they just
basically copy the implementation of
JavaScript from Netscape but there was a
problem they named JavaScript it means
that I would have to pay some for that
dude
it's a free browser I just given this
for free and I already pay a spyglass a
lot of money that I don't want to pay to
some for this and it was like chill out
man I have the solution let's call it J
scrip interesting most people think that
J script is another dialect of
JavaScript now it is but originally was
not it was a variant in copy of the
specification of JavaScript at the
beginning the only reason that it has a
different name was because trademark so
that's another thing J scraping
JavaScript was originally the same it
was just money and then something
happened Internet Explorer was
everywhere because Internet Explorer 3
became became a really really good
browser it's hard to believe right
because now everybody's much Internet
Explorer but you seem like a how crazy
was the people in the mid-90s that
internet exploited tree was an amazing
browser and everybody
like oh my god I thought you are using
Netscape you are nothing man you have to
download this sweet sweet sweet browser
name Internet Explorer I see I'll run
over there like laughing because that is
his dream yeah so int exploit was
everywhere and became famous and another
thing that was even more important
suddenly happen a new web was born
originally you have very static things
I'm very ugly as well and the new things
that happen is that the w3c was born and
create the CSS specification right so
you have now a document that can specify
how something looks like so designers
went crazy again first was whoa whoa
whoa first you let me change the
location of images and now to allow me
to put colors and shit like that
everybody was like crazy right but the
problem was that it was more complex now
because now you have two reference
elements in the web page and a mess that
were not there with great power comes
great responsibility
now how javascript is going to do that
because javascript was very high still
very tied to the dom model so netscape
came in netscape for with a new idea
layers and that was our industry 1.2
Netscape 4 and a new breed of HTML was
created what's called da dhtml or
dynamic HTML in fact I don't know how
many of you are all enough to remember
that the first applications were called
triplets or HTML it's that thing about
like react and things like that next
time you just pull out your scribbling
so layers was some way to reference
elements in the in the webpage right so
the problem was study depend a lot of
things like with tax proprietary tax
that was the layer that and another
problem is that it was no backward
compatible we pre with other browsers if
you already using layers you're screwed
everybody has to use Netscape 4 or you
are nothing
the other problem that was is that the
layer model was awful was really awful
because basically was based in the idea
that you have a Dom level 0 that is
document and then you have document dot
paragraph dot something else so it was a
very it was obviously created by a
developer right it was like yeah it
makes sense it's like hierarchy you know
but it didn't work out it was too
complex to code especially very complex
part like pages and you have to put
everything that you need to move or
change into the layer layers tax so if
it was no rub under the layer tab you
cannot use anything so it was nobody was
using layers and the poor bastard that
were using layers they were just like
using tricks like detecting if it was
Netscape 4 then serve the page with
layers is not just saying this old page
to serve pretty much what we do with
Internet Explorer nowadays layered was
sour and everything was ok and Netscape
decided to make JavaScript eggman
compliant so making an estándar so aj
push java screen 97 to the egg my
stander and create egg my script 1.0
originally was made by Netscape just by
Netscape
you will find us well in books and
things like that that image straight 1.0
is exactly the same an egg my script 2.0
and that is truth one or two are exactly
the same
what happen is that then they want to
create that egg my script
and I saw stander so they have to change
the way that they reference the things
because it's like writing papers every
Jonah has a different way to to receive
papers so they have to change everything
but the language continuous saying so
that was a misplay 2.0 JavaScript it was
kind of disorder symmetry and kind of
the same as JavaScript 1.3 this is
important say kind of the same because
they were not the same the story said
that they went pushed the stander
they still working 1.3 so they never
published things like for example not a
number or the the exact equality
operator so those study quality operator
together with switch while export and
import and the object of regular
expression we're not pressing in that
specification just dumped zero as well
that is just document or what is
reference in the first level of the dome
and then something happened that we
cannot believe Internet Explorer was for
was out it came with Windows 98 second
edition that was a very popular winner
so far I think that is one of the best
windows because it has direct s and all
my games were running pretty there and
one of the best things that internet
acquired poor heart is that instead of
using the layer model they say like this
shit is too complex let's use this
better way and they started using the
get element by ID get element by class
instead of using the layer references
and that was amazing because instead of
learning all this lot of hierarchies and
things like that I just have two methods
that are available in my window object
and do everything we can say thanks to
Internet Explorer for that so everybody
was in loved it with this again I see
you laughing man but
this because yeah it's the first time
that somebody actually Stan and
defendant and Explorer somehow and then
what happened before that is that the
w3c specification love to get element by
ID as well and say well you know what
let's ditch the layer system and let's
use this put an extra specification so
one of the things that happen is that we
are mentioned right now JavaScript 1 1.1
1.2 1.3 and then you we will escape up
to 1.5 so what happened with JavaScript
1.4 there was a 1.4 version but what's
available only in the livewire server in
the netscape web server so yeah you can
just impress we let the next party that
you go to just can impress a lady saying
like do you know about javascript 1.4
that's the way i got my girlfriend by
the way and then they push on my screen
3.0 egg mysteri point zero was
javascript 1.5 that had just a few
elements and with the get element by ID
get element by class so they teach the
layer they put what internet explorer
brought to the table that was in jail
screen it was not as part of the
javascript specification and they got
javascript 1.5 that just include things
like for example the triple the exact
equality operators and not a number on
define appear for first time in in
javascript 1.5 so and that happened
javascript viewpoint segments crate 3.0
so so far we know that ed Westwick 1.0
is javascript 1.3 penguin sprayed 2.0 is
1.3 as well that is the thing i want at
1.0 an egg much spirit 3.0 is javascript
1.5 right
i told you these things like a back of
rats
and everybody was happy you know
Internet Explorer was gaining market
Netscape disappear the story of white
netiquette disappears that they never
they tried to push very hard what I mean
that is that they they didn't give a
damn about people that already have like
all versions of Netscape and every new
version with every change that they
tried to do would break previous
browsers it's something that Microsoft
learn very well and that's the reason
because they have to create H because
you know we we just have screwed off so
many times right Netscape tried to do
something like that
and around Netscape 5.0 they stopped
charging for Netscape and just given for
free I don't know because their idea is
just what selling the server after that
it didn't like run very well and what
they did is that they decide you know
what people is going crazy for
open-source
let's open sore this stuff and nets
Casey points six point zero was the
first one using open-source didn't roll
out very well neither because the
open-source developers they are like a
really difficult breed to keep happy and
they say like you know what this code is
shit so they just throw away all the
code and develop a new engine from
scratch and that was the Gecko engine
instead of using the Mozilla engine that
they already had so that's the story of
how one thing just was born - from the
other penny people said like oh you know
what
Mozilla is the successor of Netscape
well Mozilla was the name the code name
for netscape browser but the mozilla
player and the mozilla foundation was
born because they didn't like the code
that they saw from from Netscape and
decided to start everything from scratch
what happened now is that when you have
something good everybody wants a piece
of this right and in this case was many
companies suddenly there was no goal in
those days so suddenly everybody just
want to deal with the specification
and a new cliche happened there was a
big big fight for how the knee the new
JavaScript looks like working in Java
the equivalent that would be JavaScript
1.6 or in my script for what two
companies here
the first was Yahoo and Microsoft there
was a time when there who was big right
and Yahoo and Microsoft they were
advocating for not doing big changes and
do the same that they were doing so far
just releasing it small changes for
example they would like a lot of
research words in JavaScript that they
were not use so they were like you know
what let's just implement the support
for those food those keywords and they
just continue releasing JavaScript
repoint wanna so whoo so on but the
other group of people that was the most
illa foundation that is as I said from
the guys from the guys from Netscape an
Adobe that as well a star using
javascript for their ranging to create
their own language namely ActionScript 1
and 2 they decides to push the language
forward and create a new format term
completely from scratch that was more
similar to Java that actually JavaScript
and it was Eggman Street 4.0 and it was
crazy it was not compatible at all with
previous version of JavaScript
a good example is Eggman script for a ad
type resolution and things like that or
it wasn't a strong type language so the
problem is that we already have a
language that is completely dynamic and
now you are making it like strong type
that thing is now going to roll out
because all the pages are no comparable
how do we version this because the
product is version you have to create
two scripts one for all the browser's
are one from new browsers microcells I
like not even us
can cope with that team we have just
added a small team of three hundred
thousands developer so just as we cannot
we cannot a cop out with that stuff and
Amos Creek poor never happened it's just
basically it was like a novel like a
like a soap opera when they just like
break the heart and like I don't want to
see you anymore
and they run away so there was no Eggman
script for Prague was a banner and
things like that and then Microsoft was
in those days already like owner of the
market and start doing crazy stuff which
I scraped that it was the time when
actually there were two different
versions and implementations what
happened later is that they decide you
know as I said get together our friends
you know why we have a beer or whiskey
or whatever you prefer and let's resolve
our differences those guys from Adobe
they're like crazy didn't don't even buy
them they are like happy with the image
with the actionscript 3.0 teeth you look
the last time they were talking bad
things about you so that's the reason
because I didn't want to tell you or
anything let's listen you know and it
was love again they just like a star
both companies all those companies
running with holding hands around like a
filled with rainbows and things like
that so much that that conference in
Oslo was called harmony and that's the
reason and then the newest under
Eggman's great fire was born it was look
instead of going like with those crazy
guys from Adobe let's take what
Microsoft did in Java 3.1 unless let's
make that egg my script five man
brilliant
they are so brilliant
right and it happened it was good at the
beginning obviously they didn't have a
name for that version so they code that
version that in my script file with many
names not bad names actually one of
those name is harmony the next time that
you pass harmony to them you're no GS
application to wrong Agnes great five is
because that it's because the harmonium
you're telling run harmony JavaScript
run 5.0 that's the rest' that the
reading of that but that meeting was
called harmony
how many introduced something new as
well the problem was that you don't want
to break compatibility that was that was
the biggest part we don't want to break
what we already have we want all pages
to work and but we have to fix the
language because seriously it's screwed
up
look the thing that equals are not the
same and then you can have bars or no
bars and there it's at least the thing
is not right I don't know who the sign
that somebody was was Hitler he throws a
sign there so what they did is that they
introduced something they might use a
straight and a user string is just it's
just a string right that all the
browsers that didn't support him ice
cream five will ignore and will continue
executing everything has nothing
happened in my opinion it was actually a
good idea some people says over there
that it was a bad idea and things like
that but I like the idea because you
have JavaScript code that will execute
all code and things like for example in
all code errors parsing errors were
where errors right as some of them
before use a strict
we're just consider warnings it's like
what is a warning if my code is not
running at you're telling me that is
because a warning right do you do you
know prior it is JavaScript right so
with uses three what is happening is
that those errors transfer that
transform interceptions by the way try
cash was introduced
javascript 1.5 if somebody wants to know
right that try cash and the reason
because try cash was introducing
javascript 1.5 is because javascript one
poor found was the first one to throw
exceptions before that it was just
errors the usage tree was the solution
as well to introduce new keywords
because the problem with unit when you
introduce new keywords keywords is that
somebody could use that as a variable
name good of those keywords is for
example let let was not present in the
original javascript by specification so
it would break things with is a street
let is transformed into a javascript
keyboard every circle would without that
is just a variable just in case somebody
has that team right how is the future
coming I like this quote tomorrow
tomorrow was yesterday it makes you
sound like like you know what you're
telling her you're saying well the
future is very different now for
JavaScript itself because one of the
things that it was the site is don't
touch the original specification if you
want to create a new JavaScript of
things like that let's use something
named and transpilers and that was
actually part of the ideas that there
were things that they are ready
resolving that all slow stuff in that
harmony meeting that they wanted to
spend they spun the language but keeping
backward compatibility so in that way
they would just create a new language
that could be transforming to the old
language using transpiler like for
example bubble is to the classic so
javascript 6.0 was released another big
change with javascript 6.0 was released
is that now it's renamed to Eggman
script or yes with the number because
they will have annual releases instead
of every 20 years or something like that
another change is that
officially you should not call it
javascript in any place of the spec
because it's Eggman script and the
reason is that Oracle is holding the
patent for the name the trademark I was
surprised that's why reading that there
is like yeah you know what he said
material things like that because they
the whole the the trademark whole by
Oracle can't cause harm for JavaScript
engine implementers the way that they
that egg might turn now
Eggman 262 that is javascript is very
similar to the way that c-sharp is done
is in a github project and you just
can't posture your suggestions to change
the language and the suggestion became
drugs that are revised for people
together with you suggestions one of the
things that you do in that webpage is
that because you use something named a
Babel or Babel I seriously don't know
how it's pronounced I found someone that
said that it should be bubble because
Australian accent the guide I'm a bubble
is Australia but I never heard any
Australian say bubble butt Babel anyway
that pink bubble is called and in Babel
is just basically transpiler
you can just block your own
implementation you can do it it's
actually really easy how many of you
have tried to make your own bubble
extension to just add a new keyboard
into JavaScript no do it it's just a lot
of fun and it's not that complex
actually so if you have a brilliant idea
about what to JavaScript like for
example oh you know what I want
JavaScript to just every time that I put
unicorn says make America great again
right
so what what you can do there in that
case is go to babble create your
extension that you will do the
transpiling from that unicorns to make
America great again and then just
publish their create a draft probably
called that draft make American Greg and
Kane from 2016 and then what is going to
happen is that they would just like
check that draft and try to transform
that ramp in the next next JavaScript
spec if you check the specification
there are like 4 levels or like steps
and that steps phases stages yeah yeah
I'd say I know from North Queensland so
so what happen is that they moved
forward and staged things that are at
stage 4 are the ones that are approved
for the next release you can just go in
that patience all the stages on how the
process is done and that is the idea
that you will transpile and you are not
going to touch that eventually
developers will support the whole gamut
of JavaScript extensions or JavaScript
in their engines policy at their pace
you don't have to change anything or you
do trust that it will be executed as you
want there is hope I know that there is
a talk after in the next slot that is
there is still dragons in JavaScript es6
and things like that but look it's
easier to sell bad news there are
actually some good news seriously just
have you turned on the TV lately so it's
exactly same here there is hope I hope
that we are closer to a JavaScript that
looks more natural and that eventually
all those scars that we have from past
battles will disappear because I just
don't like it that is all thanks a lot I
try to make JavaScript history a little
more nicer there's like a many stories
and anecdotes around here that you can
just ask me if you see
me outside or any question something
like that you are welcome
ah remember the JavaScript as more than
twenty years so the next time that you
just want to say watch our screen can no
be like pure script that is just like
one year old is because that is 20 years
old right Emily you know this look I
think that we learn very well about what
happened before also and the fact that
we want to diversify and create like a
full-blown language with so many things
that just resemble and know the language
I think that is not going to happen we
learn that already from their mistakes I
think that there will be Ramos that like
next JavaScript will be like this or
that or we just like want to forecasting
forecasting that was what happened with
Emma script for yeah yeah when you get
into Stage four is the next expect when
it's closed what if whatever it is does
is part of the standard but probably was
before the standard uh object tree yeah
there are I think that that was one of
the things that happen right because I
usually do that in Babel and see the
stages he has used Babel or things like
that you know that you can you can put
precedes and was process I like or give
me all the stage to give me all the
stage for so yeah this this is not that
it doesn't in the moment that is caught
that is in June I think is whatever is
in stage four is in the language they
are like a few good one good example of
that is decorators decorators is a stage
two as well so I don't think that even
they are going to they have like what
they call a stage two and ready for
champion that is like the champion or
the person that is proposing that can
push that to the next stage decorators
is ready for champion so I expect that
one day we will make it all the thing is
slide for example the outer property
or the cell properties that you just I
have a property and you can you define
the function immediately that is a stage
zero that is not even a stage one so I
will expect that those things will come
just will appear until who knows I'm
excreted 2018 or something like that but
yeah I think that if something is quote
we learn we learn from history so we
don't do that same mistakes right the
only people that don't learn that is
just in politics but but I think that
that is the important thing that we are
learning the good things that happen is
is that evolution of the language little
by little without changing things that
are happening
javascript is it is awful it's an awful
language look I love programming
languages and JavaScript was an awful
language but we have to live with it at
least that you are like I don't know an
academic working around university to
create the next generation of Haskell or
my friend over here you have to live
with JavaScript there's no other option
the same thing as English I hate English
I remember when I was a kid I'd say I
will never learn English I went to
university and university I have the
chance to learn a foreign language and I
choose Japanese and Here I am
20 years later speaking Japanese so it's
lingua franca we don't have any other
option so just maybe through history
would just see that it was worse in the
past and having proof so I don't know
