talk that I've been probably working on
for six years and you guys get to be the
first ones to to participate i'd like to
say there are things in here that I
really raw to me that are things that I
want to share because I think they're
important there are things that you
might not agree with and that's totally
fine there are things that you might not
like that's also totally fine but first
off I want to just challenge you and I'm
gonna say what are you actually
satisfied are you satisfied with your
life well you satisfied with the people
that are around you are you satisfied
with the way that you take action are
you satisfied with the way that you make
decisions in life it's an important word
satisfied because it means different
things to different people are you
empowered now I chose this word because
I've been picking the brains of Carla
the search right here that does
happiness and this is what it's all
about this is about finding your
happiness as much as anything but are
you empowered are you allowed to do the
things you want to do are you empowered
to do things that you dream of the
things that people say that's stupid why
would you do that you do them anyway and
on that note are you leading are you
actually leading a life that you have
chosen or are you leading are you living
someone else's life are you just
following along and filling in the
pieces and these questions is something
that I'll try and help you with because
I'm guessing most people here I'm not
gonna have a go at you but most people
here have some niggling thing that they
want to fix something they want to do
something might be better how many
people here have families almost
everyone exactly right it's important
it's number one thing there's nothing
more important that your family but
having said that how many people here
wish they had just a little bit more
time to do all the other things exactly
right so and this is for everyone like
I'm no more special than you I have the
same in a number
hours every day I mean I've tried buying
more hours on ebay but doesn't work you
know we have the time we're given but
make the most of it and family is a huge
important part of it and i mentioned
that now up front because is this with
all with family in mind who here has
ambitions see less people right and i
want to change that because ambition is
what makes you live in my book anyway
ambition to excel ambition to be more in
your company ambition to start your own
company whatever it might be it's
important to have ambition and who wants
more like what who wants more than what
you have now exactly that should be all
of you seriously who wants to do more be
more achieve more help more whatever it
is who wants to you know who wants more
now a few weeks ago a guy I know on
Twitter and I'll keep them anonymous
because I don't actually know him
personally but I know I'm personally
through Twitter does that make sense we
all have twitter friends and this guy
reeded this need a new job getting
desperate now to me this was not about
getting a new job this was a guy lovin
god I'm sick of everything I need
something new I needed to change right
and he's not alone there's tons of them
if you just look now this is just
twitter right I use Windows Phones I
can't get snapchat but I'm sure there's
lots there too and just this look at
this guy here I'm ready to die that is
pretty severe and this I just happened
to look at these this is 30th of July
I'm not specifically looking for you
know catastrophic quotes anything
they're just tons of them so there's
something wrong right there are lots of
people that say and this was just need a
new job I search for and I'm sure all
these people actually don't need a new
job they need a change so just for
context and I normally don't introduce
myself as much because no one really
cares if I'm talking about technology it
doesn't matter but in this case I think
it's important because i am now headed
towards living the life and leading the
life that I've chosen right so I run a
small software company a consultancy
crazy Dane software I mean
that logo by the way because I'm the
graphic designer I'm also the chief
architect i'm the admin girl well it's
just me right I'm everything and I want
it that way I want to choose what I do
and what I don't do I helped organize a
conference called didi developer
developer developer has any of you been
to ddd in any city hey look at that
that's awesome we've been doing it for
seven years now say we Alex that sits in
the crowd is a major part of it as well
and there's a bunch of other people like
there's no way you can do this on your
own but I love doing it and I want to
keep doing it I write for pluralsight so
I do video courses as soon as today
Carly and I recorded another what's
called play-by-play we'll be talking
about workplace happiness I thought how
appropriate so well it was grumpiness
but we were turning it into happiness
like we're going boy can't be grumpy
yeah so we're going to make you happy my
microsoft MVP which means that I'm
really loud and I drink the kool-aid of
Microsoft but I'm actually employed by
Microsoft and that's important because
it opens lots of doors and allows me to
have a different head on when I talk to
client and I try and help people I'm a
guru that sounds really fancy doesn't it
but it's for guru I 0 which means I'm
helping them start up a platform writing
articles and in fact not to advertise
too much but you can win a mentoring
session with one of five people where
I'm one of them and Alex's would yet one
of the others as well actually if you
want to I promise I won't be too many
bad bad dad jokes involved I'm under the
boat insiders program which means they
send me stuff because I talk about it
because I am loud about things that I'm
passionate about and that's important
because they recognize that I'm really
really happy in what I'm doing and I'm
happy sharing right just like I am now I
write for a site point which is a
Melbourne company that is now global I'm
doing a series of hololens development
articles and I'm consequently doing a
whole let's talk tomorrow syncfusion
I've just signed to do an e-book for
these guys I've always runs a write a
book and I getting into that much more
in a minute so I do all these things i
do all the things that I really love and
I'm passionate about doing and it's
important
do things that you are passionate about
doing right but it doesn't stop there
because i also am a member of three car
clubs I love classic cars and I love
getting well not so much in the mud butt
drivin through the mud is alright but I
organized cruisers with BMW club and we
have a evil for racing and all the sort
of stuff because i love it we run a B&amp;amp;B
bed-and-breakfast up in the high country
in victoria and we have a small car you
know classic car business restoring and
selling parts and whatnot am I point
that's showing all this is not saying
here you look at me how good I am I'm
just saying I have the same amount of
time as everybody else but I choose to
do all these things cuz I'm passionate
about it because I love it oh and
there's this guy I've no idea what he's
doing there but I have a clone because
he is a hundred percent copy of me
unfortunately and I spent as much time
as I possibly can with him and it's
important family comes first right and I
do get to live here which I'm pretty
proud of because this is an awesome
place absolutely fantastic it's not for
everyone it's out the middle of nowhere
but it's peaceful it's quiet has amazing
into it now come to my talk on friday at
the top conference i'll tell you all
about that internet but before we get
into all the good stuff I want to start
at the beginning and when I say
beginning it's about six or seven years
ago that was the beginning for me it was
a beginning of what I am now it was let
me just here make sure Kobe I had a
house right I thought I had it made I
thought I had a fantastic life I had a
really nice house the house was on top
of a hill overlooking national park I
had no windows big block of land in a
nice quiet street really good really
nice in the outskirts of Melbourne a job
I had a fantastic job actually I love
cars and I got to look at car data every
single day while doing development so my
development test data was cars how fast
they go how many
how many colors and so on it's perfect
like really really like this job and I
had a car i had the car that i want it i
had actually chosen the car that i
wanted i thought but on the outside
people that knew me said you doing well
man you've moved to straight cuz I'm
dating issues because you didn't know
you moved first rally did all these
things you're on you I did well at uni
cuz you know I was told to do well at
uni so I did really well at uni but all
the time I was like this and you might
not know it and I don't want to be too
poopoo but this is going to be some of
you this is so easy to do put on a face
of hey I'm happy I got everything I need
everything that society dictates society
says I must have a house in a car and a
job and I do hooray but I wasn't I
wasn't happy I wasn't content I had this
view I was working with amazing people
really talented which is important don't
stop doing that but this view from the
office was fantastic and it was
everything was go in the right direction
I kept getting better jobs i kept you
know actually getting two cars which i
thought was amazing but all the time
there's this little flame right there's
this tiny flame and I've always had this
flame for whenever I was kid I wanted to
do stuff I was the guy at school that
whenever wasn't one said I do you want
to do that one yeah yeah I'll do it yep
me yep yep I'll do it all the time I
always said yes and when I grew up and I
was taught that society said you must
have a house on a car no job and a
boyfriend and what not this flame just
got pushed aside right because that
wasn't the main thing the main thing was
to get all the checkboxes right to get
ticked off everything that was the
really really important part I was told
by everyone so there's a catalyst in
everyone's life or more than one maybe
for me this is hard I found out my wife
was cheating on me and I don't share
this normally but it's important in this
case because it changed me completely
it's it's not an easy thing for me to
admit that I was the wrong one I was not
what she was looking for
and maybe I pushed her away I've been
told don't to tell me those things but I
learnt from it now this catalyst doesn't
have to be something as you know
detrimental as that it does not but
there are changes in your life that
happens for a reason right and I must
admit you get freaking scared i'm not
going to apply to you i had the worst
time of my life for about a year he was
I hated it but I decided inside you know
that little flame was still there and
inside that was going to be my driving
force right and I had many many thoughts
you know not as such crying but saying
I'm not good enough what am I going to
do why am I going to change I'm just
like everybody else and it wasn't until
I made a very special person who happen
to live with now actually that taught me
that now it's up to you what you want to
do no one's going to tell you what to do
no one's going to help you what you know
help you get there it's all about you
and if you are happy with yourself
everybody else around you are going to
see that and they're going to not copy
it essentially right so I got through
this period and I started doing this I
started setting goals does anyone here
have gold does anyone who wants to share
you don't you really don't have to but
does anyone want to share a goal they
have okay fair enough because goals to
me are very very very specific thing
often people say I've got a goal I want
a Ferrari and you go okay when you know
what how and they can't ask you was it
well I always wanted to go to the pole
and live like the Tibetan monks okay how
goals are the most important thing in my
life it's the thing that drives me every
single day and that's why I'm here
that's why I'm now speaking to you at
NDC so let's talk about how we do these
things right because I promise I was
going to share everything that I've
learned well not everything because we
don't have that much time but smart
girls SMART goals is the most important
thing that you can do
I'm not kidding like if you don't have
goals you might as well just get another
job so smart is there specific so let me
just get my notes right here so the
specific so there who what where when
and you write these things down you
actually put down well so one of my
goals is I want to speak at Ted do you
know give you familiar with Ted that's a
personal goal that I have and I want to
do that by the end of 2018 I haven't
figured out how yet I know that you can
submit yourself as candidate on their
website but it's something I've thought
about the negative last a couple of
months so I'm still formalizing that
goal another one is that I want a 1984
286 for I'm on dl with the original TRX
wheels specific right specific and I
have dates and whatnot and all that yeah
they have to be measurable if you can't
measure how far you are how do you know
when you're finished if it is buying a
car which is something people can relate
to well it's probably saying in three
months i'm going to have four thousand
dollars in eight months i'm going to
have and so on or you put in month by
month but as long as you can measure it
it's a goal if you can't measure it how
do you know when you're done they have
to be attainable so you need to be able
to reach this goal and as you do this
more and more and more you're going to
find out the goals grow and you grow
with them so goals become more
attainable and bigger and then more
attainable again and if you don't set
goals that are relevant or they are high
enough if you go for low if you say are
I like tick the car serviced it's not a
goal because it's not pushing you right
when they have to be s there have to be
wide and high reaching enough that you
need to push yourself to get there so
what other wise what's the point and
then they have to be town by I talked
about this before they have to be a time
on them if you don't have a goal with a
time and a date that's not a goal it's
just a thought or dream and and by all
means now you can certainly ask
questions if you want I'm happy to you
know that's why i said i want a
conversation with all of you this is not
this is my way of doing things if you
have a different way or you don't
understand something please just yell
out and i'll ignore no I'll answer it
the most important thing about goals
though is that you write them down if
you don't write them down they're never
going to happen and it is a
scientifically proven that if you write
them down your fifty percent more likely
to actually achieve these goals because
if you don't write them down they just
become a thought again if you write them
down and look at them every day well
they're constantly in your
sub-conscience are there every decision
you make is possibly on the past to this
goal and actually have a business study
here that harvest business study so not
anyone however three percent of MBAs
earned more than the other two
ninety-seven percent which is fair
enough that's going to happen now
someone's going to be the top three but
those top three also the top three did
bright goals that have goals written
down and follow them so now we came into
money which we'll get to later right and
there's one reason that I do goals and
that is due today what others won't so
that's following the goal you've written
down how to get there right so that
tomorrow you can do what others can't
that is super powerful to me anyway and
obviously I'm not talking about just
today and tomorrow but in general right
if you stop watching TV if you don't
binge watch what if I should have
watched you so I don't know any TV shows
house of cards is a show if you stop
watching that new series watch the whole
thing and said now I'm not going to
watch it I am going to find out a way
that I can online market these things
that I do my free time anyway for
example there's always a choice right
and most people would choose me more i
want to see all the new episodes of my
TV show if you choose not to do that and
you do what others won't then tomorrow
you can do with others can't because you
planted the seed right in this picture
by the way so that's that's my two boys
and because we did goal-setting we were
able to
to the berlin wall which is where this
is in June which was very important
especially for Jordan was 10 to
understand how other people have lived
in the past Ryan he doesn't get it in a
book we took them there there was a
piece of the wall and you're watching
the watchtower from a distance and you
can see what people had to go through
and you got it now there's time for
doing right it's not that difficult
writing down goals and putting them on
the wall the doing bid is the really
hard part but as long as you do a little
bit every day a little bit every other
day and you consistently do something
about your goals you will get there
eventually again do all others do today
what others won't right and sometimes it
feels like this i am not going to kid
you if you set goals that are high
enough you're going to get to a point
where you go god it's a tunnel and i
don't know and there's things everywhere
and it's growing the track and I don't
I'm is it actually going to get to the
end and you have doubt no question about
it but if you follow the path of your
goal you are going to get there might
well be the path that you thought you
were going to take but you'll get there
so goals super super important I if
that's the boutique if you take anything
away from today its goal setting
absolutely one hundred percent no
question but how do you get about
suddenly doing all these goals so I'm
going to talk more about what I've done
more than the generic stuff we just
talked about now for me was networking
networking for me is the most important
thing because I'm a freelancer all of my
work comes through people that I know I
don't get any one contacting me that I
don't know it's always a friend of a
friend or someone else poke to or
someone that's seen me at a conference
like this or something networking is all
about who you know not what you know now
I'm not saying don't be skilled and
don't be serious about your work but
being the best csharp developer or the
best f sharp F sharp docker compiler
dude out there it's not going to get you
anywhere it's not going to get you in
your notoriety if you don't know anyone
that knows about it if you don't tell
people about what you've done if you
don't tell people how
all this is as much as especially nerds
don't like doing it I certain struggle
with it is initially saying hey I built
this really cool thing and I think
you'll like it you're thinking awesome
because you don't want to go oh it's not
that good like me but it is right you
build a cool thing tell people about it
it's important networking and it kind of
works like this so this is I don't even
know what this is but you don't know
where the networking paths are going to
take you right because there's an
intersection coming from over there and
then this thing goes over here and you
just don't know one you start talking to
one person you're going to end up
talking to person number three did you
never even met and they happen to know a
guy that sits in the office in the
building next to that you just don't
know right it is like there's complete
chaos but it's eventually something
materializes and then the flip side of
this is that you need to learn how to
say no because I couldn't I'm terrible
at saying now I like helping people and
I like pleasing people and I like being
there for whoever needs it but if you
don't if you don't say no then your life
just turns into sort of like a okay yeah
I'll do that too and then you end up
like this completely catatonic because
you can't do it all you suddenly said
yes to 80 things that are all top
priority and you just give up he's good
oh yeah and you do one thing and then
you forget about the other 79 so learn
to say no you don't have to be a bastard
about it just say are no that's not my
focus I'm not interested in that but
thank you anyway let's talk more it's
really important to say no especially as
you get better networking and you dude
more you get more people talking to you
you get more things coming your way
that's just how the world works not a
really important point especially in the
freelance world but in any business
scenario or any life scenario is
leverage does anyone here know what I
mean when I say leverage is anyone want
to volunteer you don't have to be quiet
you can yell out yeah
seguin that's pretty good minimum input
maxima up but I haven't actually heard
that one before but it's very true
leverage is taking something you're not
good at or you don't want to do and get
someone else to do it for something in
return does that make sense so in this
case this little girl has leverage right
because she's winning the seesaw thing
even though there's a big dude on the
other end and the reason is that she
probably has you know 100 kilograms of
lead in her pockets or something I
leverage is what you get from someone
else to help you achieve a goal and
leverage always has to be a win-win if
you keep taking and taking and taking
and taking and taking and taking
suddenly you there's no more to take
people will just stop offering their
help and their services the same if you
keep giving if you keep giving to
everyone again you run into the thing of
people just dump everything on you oh do
it last he'll do it he'll be fine and
you end up with all the crap that you
don't want so leverage is for example I
really want to get into hole instead
velopment I love the idea of the whole
lens and the technology but I don't
actually have one right and I don't have
access to the team and Microsoft out of
work for Microsoft but I've found a guy
in Sydney that does who has really good
report for him so I've said hey I'm
going to give you some of my time to do
these things that you don't have time to
do which is going to help you look
better at words and help you in your
business and you know lots of benefits
but on the other hand if you get any
sort of really cool projects let me know
I'll give you a hand and I get my foot
in the door I'm leveraging his position
and he is leveraging my time so leverage
is what makes you do more than you could
on your own it's very important okay
focus this is one I struggle a lot with
like seriously is I put it in here
because I'm really not very good at it
focus is doing one thing for a period of
time I've tried so many different ways
of focusing on a task and I'm not very
good at it but
get there you have to focus on what
you're good at you have to focus your
time and energy on something that will
give you a result if you keep focusing
on things that don't work well you're
not going to move anywhere are you
that's when we get back to the leverage
think you might need to find someone
that's good at it focus is-is bit vague
I must admit it's kind of hard to
verbalize it but it's it's it's me not
using my phone when I'm playing with my
son for half an hour it's it's me not
talking to a client when I should have
been cleaning the B&amp;amp;B actually don't
clean the B&amp;amp;B has a bad example but when
I should have been fixing something on
the B&amp;amp;B right it's it's important to
maintain that focus or at least
recognize when there needs to be your
focus but i'm certainly not very good at
it does anyone have any good ideas for
focusing because i have got a couple
anyone know Carl Franklin's music to
code by yeah there's a few check it out
if you if you're interested there 20
minute or 25 minute instrumental pieces
of music and you put them your headphone
and you do their thing for 20 minutes
until the song stops right it's a way of
getting you into the groove it's got me
use the code by because Frank sacarle
szkoda but it works for any task like
it's not just for coding and I know
color you've used it I've used it so
that's one way of doing it there's
another thing with the Pomodoro
Technique I think it's called but do you
have 20 minutes into a task and you set
a timer and there's a whole system
around it which I'm I can't remember but
there's certainly lots of lots of helps
or ways of getting help to maintain
focus and then this one I like this one
not because it's the 18 that's kind of
cool but you need to surround yourself
with experts right and this is the
sometimes this gets a bit controversial
because you need to be around the people
that you want to be like does that make
sense so if you want to be let's say at
the best community event sky in
Melbourne we need to hang around that
get the dudes that do community
events right you need to learn from then
you need to pick their brains and what
they do and learn from them you can't be
the best F sharp developer if you hang
around a parson team right it's that
simple you need to find people that are
better than you and in for this example
we have a bed breakfast and I am
shocking a gardening I mean I can cut
stuff with a chainsaw pretty good of
that but we need help we needed an
expert so we've hired a caretaker that
works for us and you set up but that's
cost more money but we'll get to the
money in a minute right but the essence
is well if I can earn more than I pay
him in the time he does it well I win
surround yourself with experts that are
willing to help you that are willing to
share knowledge because chances are if
you're the smartest guy in the room or
the smartest girl in the room you're in
the wrong room you will not proceed you
know you will not advance you will not
learn anything new if you are the
smartest guy so I don't know how he does
it I don't know anyone that's smarter
than then mr. Hawkin but you need to
surround yourself with people that are
smarter than you experts and this is
where the controversial bit comes in
because you might have a friend that you
love hanging out with you might have a
friend that comes over to your house
every weekend and it's really funny
great guy great girl but it's really
always pleasant when they're there but
they are on center link they have no
ambition they have no desire to do
anything else they just want to hang out
and have fun I love to work fun because
it never means anything my advice would
be get rid of that friend and it's harsh
but if you want to be more than you are
right now you need to surround yourself
with people that want to be more as well
and this might be a friend that you've
known for 20 years it might be a friend
that you want to help but you that's the
leverage thing right you give and give
and give and give you need to cut him
loose it's harsh I've learned this I've
had friends in the past seven years that
I've decided not to be with and I've
decided not to hang out with them
anymore if they contact me sure I'm
happy to talk but I decided I'm not
going
to spend my time with them because it
doesn't help me as a person it only
makes me give and give and give and I
can't do that I can't keep doing that
because it's not fulfilling for me and
as we saw the start I'm not satisfied
I'm not leading what I want to do that's
the harsh part and that's why I said
lots of people don't like this because
it's hard you know no one said all this
stuff is easy it's taken me six years
seven years right um all right now I'm
running a bit hits schedule so I'm happy
to take questions if you have any
because surely there's thoughts worrying
everywhere here yeah so so the question
is when i do the goals and write them
down do I share them like do you mean
family or friends or just any way it
depends on the goal to be honest if it's
a goal that I need help with I'll
probably tell everybody that wants to
hear about it so they know what my need
about my intentions are but there's also
very very very personal goals that you
said because that helps you become let's
say different in what you are that you
might not want to share but I'll
certainly share goals absolutely like
friends will attest to this that I don't
be pretty verbal about it if there's a
thing that I think more people should
know about it certainly doesn't have to
be you know exclusively for you and who
says you can't have two people on a goal
if you have the same goal absolutely
leverage we're going together right so
yes I'll get to you Carly I can't yes
sir so the question is if you have a
goal and you only achieve it partially
do you mean to modify the girl to then
say I've done it is that were you asking
a very rarely modify the go because
there's a reason I'll set that goal and
some girls would come out and you say
wow that wasn't actually too bad and the
thing is as soon as you set a goal and
you mentally say well I'm going to
achieve it then it's almost doesn't
matter what obstacle you get to it does
like you find a way around it a good
example I had with a with a goal is we
were going to buy a house the house you
saw before and we weren't looking we
found it you know pretty much by you
know X enormous and we looked in with
nav make a move not going to move and
then we decided after looking at it with
a couple of times gotta know we're going
to move and we there was no way we could
get financed for it no way so now we're
having a good setting a goal and there
was a time on it obviously because you
know contracts does it you have to pay
by certain date you default you go to
court all that sort of stuff and we went
no there's a really good way a really
good chance that we can afford it and
we'll find a way I mean it wasn't
completely blinded luck and we sign the
contract without finance and that was
scary oh yeah it was scary but we didn't
modify the goal by the time we found out
that we couldn't really afford the place
we went no we're having this place and
we're going to find a way and we then
cut me ohbert the bridge behind us
essentially and we got there we found a
way so there are i would not modify
girls unless something meant
fundamentally changed no yes have I
reached goals by the said date or when
you don't yeah obviously Uribe because
they'll be factors outside of your
control so if you don't reach your goal
by the certain date yeah you haven't
achieved the goal but it becomes a new
goal and that's what I said they have to
be attainable right they have to be some
realism to what you're trying to do like
i'll say i want to be a professional
footballer what I'm 37 so that's not
gonna happen that's not realistic right
no that's true yeah
um see I could be a karaoke star that no
set goals absolutely yeah do I treat
short-term goals different to long-term
goals no no short-term goals often just
means that they're not sit high enough
they should be a that goal that you're
setting should be a path to a greater
goal because when you set goals you need
to measure it right and that could be
one of the measuring points like when I
wanted to to start speaking in public
because I'm comfortable standing front
of a crowd but I was terrible like I
didn't know what I was doing I couldn't
put a talk together I had a way of doing
it say okay I'm to do I tried and tried
and tried that didn't work then okay I'm
gonna go Toastmasters i'm going to learn
how to speak to an audience and
construct the talk and get feedback and
everything and then i'll do user groups
and now the smaller comfort and now I'm
here right so I didn't go to hear from
yesterday it took six years again do
today with others wrong so tomorrow you
can do what they do with their card yes
ha I am so glad you asked that how do
you narrow down and you said wish list
yep yep no that's that's its key is that
you have a wish list right you have
things that you get ah I'll do this and
this and this business the truth is once
you start looking at it what you
prioritizing me there are things that
you want to do more than others there
are things that you just well that's
just not going to happen it's just the
wish is exactly what it is and you need
to prioritize your goals obviously and
there's nothing wrong with having more
than you know having a bunch of goals
absolutely as long as you can manage it
and you don't go ah you become Jim
Carrey in a catatonic state right you
don't want to do that but narrowing it
down is is very much an individual
journey and you might find that you set
a goal and after six months ago actually
I don't need that go anymore you know
for whatever reason my life changed
something happened take it off get rid
of it but it's a constant process every
day if you look at them every day when
you evaluate where you're going you
need to understand that your goals can
change as well right so they're the same
that day but if something happens you
can certainly adjust them but only in in
the positive right you can't sudden you
see ah I didn't want that Ferrari holden
barina I like it you know don't do that
so yeah I'm Carly had a question as well
yeah I'm good yep I'm good
mm-hmm question is how if I dealt with
what's called the imposter syndrome does
people know where that is no yes whew
the imposter syndrome is when you you
say yeah I want to do something but then
inside you kind of feel like I'm not
good enough there's no way I can do that
why did I say yes I'm just an impostor
at this point saying yeah look at me and
I've dealt with that many times and I
don't know if it's a personality thing
but I just normally just say yes to
things if I want to do it and then I
find a way so it's you get that first
initial and pasta syndrome sickness with
your heart especially when i did my
first in DC Talk in Norway I spent four
days not eating like it was just I just
felt like wire here I don't belong here
it did when it did go really well though
so there was nothing in it but it's such
a common thing so yeah that's what I do
I kind of power through it be different
for everybody you might need to write
down well actually I am good at all
these things so you write a list of a
hundred things that you're good at you
get them I mostly pretty awesome and you
kind of get through that way because
everybody has potential right I don't
feel like I'm better than he you guys
just because I'm here talking about it
everybody has the potential it's just a
matter of getting in a system so you can
actually fulfilling all these all these
dreams and wishes so I said wishes so
should um okay was there one more
question was yeah
so uh huh yep
yeah that's I hadn't thought of that way
but so the question is do you need the
catalyst in your life to make this
change and often it's the bigger the
catalyst the bigger the change often not
always but often I'd say yes I mean if
you do the same thing every day and
nothing is pushing you one way or the
other whether it's yourself or something
else you're not going to change if you
don't have a friend that says you've
been writing that same perl script for
20 years like what the hell are you
doing you know it's you got to have
something that pushes you and prod you
and the universe eventually will do it
whether you react to it or not is a
different matter I'm sick of looking at
mr. Hawkin now sorry that's doing here
so the next thing I have is persistence
because this is this is theory of having
there's ninety-eight percent of the
population and then there's the other to
the ninety-eight percent are the ones
that think they're happy or that don't
really pursue anything and I always use
the example of a job I don't want to poo
poo having a job because it works for
many people just doesn't work for me but
having a job in the dilbert sense right
new trudging through it every day and
persistence is what the two percent has
and that's why I want you guys to be I
want you to be this 2% of the population
that grabs life by the hair and and do
more because it for me it's yeah you
have really crap days of course you do
but the overall thing of it is that you
just go from when to win to win to win
and in case you lost and then win again
but the this the risk that we were
talking about before the heart the
bigger your catalyst is the more risk
willing to take risks you are but
persistence is what makes you get
through all this because you will have
people like all the birds that pecking
pecking pecking you so you have this
goal you shared with someone the girl
yeah that's never going to happen now
what would you do that that's not gonna
work yeah that's the birds they keep
pecking at you right and eventually
they'll win and these birds are often
the people that would never
that would never take the risk that
would never take the leap and those have
usually the people that you get rid of
it's hard when it's your spouse but
persistence as it says the fact of
continuing in an option or cause of
action in spite of difficulty or
opposition so it's a matter of saying
yeah that's your opinion but you know
what I'm going over here right you can
have your opinion and I really don't
care about it because I know where I'm
going while they go are you think ah
yeah should have worn different genes
you're right yeah you know it's it's you
got to have persistent to believe in
what your goals are is what you need to
do because otherwise you're just going
to go either around in circles or you go
back to not having goals and you sit and
you watch house of cards for a whole
weekend right again please don't watch
TV especially not reality TV actually if
you watch my kitchen rules out heads I
just don't get it it is ghana yeah
assistance right some persistence is is
really hard sometimes because if you
have family or you have people you trust
people you respect that keeps saying no
you should do something else then it
gets hard like you start questioning
yourself and you go back to the crying
guy on the couch you go I'm not good
enough why we're doing this but
persistence is what is key and again you
journey might go different direction
than you thought initially but you keep
moving forward right okay here's the one
that I think most people are certainly
people ask me about all the time is
income right because we all need money
to pay bills we like eating but like
sleeping in bed all that sort of stuff
the truth is if you make income your
number one focus and say I need a new
job cuz I need no more money you're
never going to get out of that mentality
money is always going to be what what
rules you and you'll never have enough
you'll never be satisfied you'll never
take you've never lead the life you want
so I I've had people ask cuz
this year I've done I did a talk in
london and then i did a talk in Brussels
a little workshop in Oslo and then I
went back to Oslo and then I went to
Germany and then I am here and I'm going
to person and Sweden again in november
yeah how do you for all that like this
stupid what it income hey you're going
to work and stuff and in in that
particular case it's well leverage again
leverage say in DC pay for flights
accommodation so I don't pay to see is
to be in talk but I'm happy to do it
because it allows me to share my
knowledge with you and it allows me to
let you know that I have this awesome
thing I want to share right that's where
we're talking about before so that's
leverage where in DC gets gets you in
the door to allow you to listen to what
I have to say whether you agree or not
but income is again it's the
ninety-eight percent and it's the tube
ascent and you always hear about the
rich get richer and the poor get poorer
is that right and it's true it is
because the rich not I mean let me just
disclaimed it under by no mean reach
it's not this is based on on books and
one all right this is the rich
understands how to earn money and they
understand how to leverage and they
understand that your time is valuable
right so there are essentially two ways
of income there's two ways that you can
make money does anyone want to venture a
guess of what that is yep yep
it's pretty good pretty good sell time
or sell a product which is you know in
my world that's you've got active income
or you got passive income active income
is when you go to work in a job and you
sit there from 95 you get paid from nine
to five right and let me just kill this
myth of a secure job no such thing
exists doesn't you come to get a good
bought you know someone get run over a
bus it's just not a secure job right it
might feel secure because you've been
there for 10 years but don't let
yourself into that my foot and frame of
thought because then you won't do any of
the things that we talked about earlier
but a job is pet as active income active
income is you trade time for money so
you give some time and you get some
money some people give some time and get
lots of money like movie stars but once
they stop doing the thing they don't get
paid anymore right and this is this is
tricky when you're a freelancer because
you don't have sick leave if you don't
have holiday pay you don't um if you
don't have a client for two weeks where
you don't get any money for two weeks
right and so I've decided that's not
going to be for me slowly so I still do
consulting because that's how I pay the
bills but on the other side we have
passive income and this is the frame of
mind you need to get into and that is an
income that keeps generating even though
you've stopped doing the thing right so
for me it's pluralsight as an example I
do a cause once for pluralsight and they
keep playing the commission for people
watching it right so I might spend 100
hours getting not paid because you don't
get paid up front but those hundred
hours I've done once and then I keep
getting commissioned as long as people
want to watch my courses they keep
paying per our actions per minute really
writing a book which is by the way a
terrible idea if you want to know about
how not to write a book talk to Alex
it's it's writing books a bit there's
two people i know that actually makes a
living off it but it's another way that
you can make royalties from thing though
you produce
thing and it keeps paying right does
that make sense does anyone here and not
have a residual or passive income
there's few people okay that's actually
pretty good unless you're lying but you
want to have these residual income
scores will be investment properties you
get renton every week from people
renting your property whatever it is
it's important so that you spread out
your risk right and that's the way to do
it that's the way that you get more
freedom you get to lead the life you
want to lead and you you have empowered
yourself to do things and take chances
because you have that thing the income
thing that's dealt with don't have to
worry about it and if one thing drops
off if you have seven things that you do
it's annoying but you're not going to
not eat tomorrow right and again this is
not overnight this is again do what
others do today what others won't so you
can do tomorrow what they can't it's
really important really important lesson
okay now your turn and this gifts that
work now very good action who he is
going to go today and write down one
goal one person I want everybody to do
it I'm not kidding because why else did
you just spent an hour with me if you're
not going to do anything about it right
you already have well excellent yep
perfect then make sure you have them
printed out and look at them and follow
them and all that I'm really passionate
about this and that's why I'm being such
a bastard saying to do it because I know
it works I also know it doesn't work if
you don't do it so please please do that
please take that one action at least
because if you have a goal all the
others will follow right because those
are the building blocks you need to
achieve that goal yes sir
not really no so do I have a limit on
how many goals in progress what do you
mean in progress do you have goals that
aren't started now i'm generally asking
like okay no just I thought maybe you
had an idea of what we know but it's
generally but if I set a goal it's it
starts now right it's and I have a path
of how I want to get there and you can
get overwhelmed if you keep taking on
things but that's where you learn to say
no but really if you don't take action
you're going to end up with this guy
right but if you do take action I'm
going to give you one of these are we
can put your name on it but and and I'm
serious if you want help with this i'm
i'm here like tweet me email me ring me
don't knock on my door night that's
creepy but yeah i'm more than happy to
help so if there's no other questions no
other questions yes how do you once it
that's a good question how do you learn
to say no once you've had that
experience of going or not the thing I'm
going to pass out then subconsciously
okay I'm not doing it anyway I said yes
we're not doing it and that then for me
turns into a thorac oh that wasn't fair
on that dude because he just asked me to
do something right yeah sure I'll do it
no one and then I'll walk around go now
I'm just doing it so you learn to
actually it's an it's if you don't
shrink wrap things if you don't
sugarcoat it and tell people no I'm not
doing it because that doesn't suit me or
that's not my focus or you should
probably talk to someone else or while
you're doing yourself people appreciate
that and if they don't then they need to
probably work on themselves yeah you
come first right you come first if you
don't know where you're going if you're
not satisfied how are you gonna help
anyone else how are you going to show
you kids how to be satisfied how are you
going to show you kids how to set goals
like there's no reason kids can't do
girls absolutely jordan was ten had a
goal of learning to ski because i went
skiing whenever he was about seven and
that's before we moved to the new house
now we live 80 minutes from a ski field
so I don't know he pushes that direction
but he's learnt
right so absolutely go for kids as well
yes down the back no sorry oh absolutely
no you celebrate it take every win winds
are yours if you achieve a goal
especially if it's like right now when
you set a goal absolutely crack open a
bottle or something or do a dance
whatever makes you happy and by the way
happiness is very infectious right if
you start smiling clue this on the train
rolling because I like this with Carly
if you start smiling on the train and
just sit there and you're stuck you're
laughing firth then see you always start
smiling right it's super infectious but

yesterday on workplace happiness and
there's so many good things I want to go
through an hour we'd of time so go watch
