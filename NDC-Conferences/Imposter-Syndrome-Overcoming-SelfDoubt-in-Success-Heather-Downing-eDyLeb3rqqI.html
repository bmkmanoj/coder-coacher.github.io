see so many well not faces because all I
can see is a bright light but I'm
assuming you're all smiling yes it has
been such an incredible conference first
of all I want to kind of just introduce
myself so you kind of know a little bit
about Who I am and if you are not
familiar with me I've done quite a lot
in my life I started out coding about
seven years ago so I was a career
changer I came from the hospitality
industry where I spent 11 years saying
I'm sorry I can't help you with that I
got tired of that and decided I wanted
to do something about the problem after
spending hours talking to the different
tech help lions I decided you know I'm
just going to start fixing these things
myself and then eventually got in
trouble for that because that's not my
job and so they said you know you should
just go to school and try to learn about
it
so that's pretty much what I did I found
a trade school and then I started right
away doing work directly for a very
large company in the u.s. that does
Texas right those my very first
internships so I've never known anything
but very large enterprise scale projects
I also enjoy a speaking and I'm a little
bit of an entrepreneur I do quite a bit
of work in the equestrian industry too
because lord knows people who are used
to spending all day outside with their
animals need a little help when it comes
to their data and then on the side I
also do horseback archery as it's
actually something that I've been
pursuing for a while now and my horse
and I are going to Poland next year and
because I am also a nerd fair warning
I've sung if you do an internet search
not that you should but if you do one
you will discover that I may have
dressed up from somebody from Lord of
the Rings and I may have recorded a few
albums in another language that doesn't
really exist
I decided eventually to pull that off of
Spotify because didn't really bear well
for the serious speaker and then I'm
also a semi-professional photographer so
if any of you all would like to have a
picture afterwards just come by
I are booth and I'll be happy to give
you a free one so after all of this I
still feel like a fake a fraud exactly
it's not interesting
I actually don't deserve to be here it's
interesting when I got the invitation to
come and speak here I was filled with
emotion because this is something that
if you talk to any of the speakers in
the circuit he'll this is a fantastic
conference do you not agree yes exactly
it is a status symbol to be able to get
up in front of these brilliant Norwegian
people and to be able to talk to them
about all sorts of different technical
things so when I got the invitation the
first thing I thought of was oh no they
chose me is that not hilarious the
problem is is that 70 percent of us have
experienced something like this in our
life and many people have this issue
persist all the time it is not just
something that pops up every now and
again when it's something that you don't
know so let's go over what the
definition of impostor syndrome is and
whether or not it's even important is
it's a touchy feely subject or is it
more scientific because I am a developer
I decided to pursue the latter it was
difficult for me to go through sessions
with counselors because I wasn't really
going deeply into psychology and I and
having them tell me this is how you feel
but it shouldn't be that way and that
wasn't enough for me I needed to know
more because this terrified me to the
point of where it completely affected my
career and I wanted to share that with
you now so I'll share a little bit of my
story some stories of others what we can
do about this and if you do not suffer
from this because you are in the
majority what you can do for someone
that you do know that does according to
Wikipedia impostor syndrome can be
defined as a collection of feelings of
inadequacy that persists even in the
face of information that indicates that
the opposite is true and it is
experienced internally as chronic
self-doubt and feelings of intellectual
fraudulence
that sounds really serious and he put it
that way for me it was very simple
I didn't
anything that sounded that serious I
just froze and I always felt badly for
anything that I accomplished let's get
into the science shall we
touchy-feely is fantastic on television
but I really wanted to know what the
heck to do about it according to a study
that was done in Georgia State
University in the fall of 1978 they kind
of followed a bunch of women around who
despite their outstanding academic and
professional accomplishments persisted
in believing they were not very bright
and have fooled everybody else and for
imposters
success does not mean happiness this is
an important statement I found this to
be true in all walks of life that you
can't actually enjoy what it is you're
pursuing Impostors often feel fear and
stress and self-doubt and uncomfortable
with their achievements it interferes
with your ability to accept and enjoy
your achievements and it has a negative
impact on your psychological well-being
as well and when those women were faced
with an achievement related tasks
Impostors often experience
uncontrollable anxiety due to their fear
of failure and burnout emotional
exhaustion loss of intrinsic motivation
all these things are reinforced by
repetitions of this impostor cycle
specifically about having shame in your
success now this sounds like oh what a
first world problem I'm so sorry that
you're successful you don't feel it
right it's different than that so I came
from an area that did not celebrate
women doing anything in the field of
science but I found out very quickly
that I wasn't alone it wasn't just women
that went through this actually was
anyone that had difficulty having that
support system and sometimes trying to
live up to this ideology but they could
never reach so what does a cycle look
like I have a really pretty diagram to
show you right so the way that it goes
is kind of like this you have an
achievement related tasks that you're
set to do
so you don't really know very well so
for me that would be something a note
because I'm a dotnet developer and God
bless all of you javascript ones and so
let's pretend I have a client that I
can't say no to and I have to build
something in like two weeks so I said
okay I need you to do this task and I
don't have the opportunity to say no so
I take it on so because I've never done
it
I almost pass out from thinking about
the failure of it I'm a kind of person
who can't go to see a scary movie
because I experience all the same fear
that the characters do and I have
nightmares reoccurring because of that
I'm I feel everything so I already was
experiencing the failure before it even
happens so so not before exactly that's
more than half of you right so what do
you do about this
after you worry then you have a couple
of options either you over prepare and
obsess over this or you procrastinate to
the last minute because you don't want
to think about it and you have to end up
being up your both your back against a
wall and doing it anyway in the case of
this fictional client right let's
pretend that I over prepared I called up
every single JavaScript Felber I knew
who is famous and I'm like Cory tell me
what I need to know about this tell me
about react what do I need to do and
then I just never sleep for the next two
weeks and everything becomes all about
JavaScript so I over prepare and then I
end up accomplishing the task you would
think I would have this wonderful forms
of relief right but why do I have that
feeling of oh god I made it barely to
that deadline I attributed immediately
to Klaus because I stayed up for you
know two weeks straight and I knew all
these super smart people that could help
me with this therefore actually I didn't
really make a miracle happen even though
your client is telling you that's
amazing and you didn't even know this
language and you got this done that's
awesome
and I'm like yeah but it's like I just
know a lot of smart people I mean that's
the reason why it happened and so I
start internalizing that and it kind of
goes a little deeper then it goes into
well
yeah maybe I shouldn't be in tech man
that was terrible feeling I hated that
that was awful
actually I don't think I'm good at this
all and then I get another achievement
related tasks and this whole thing
starts all over again
or if you happened to attribute it to
luck on the other side of that diamond
diagram you just said oh you know I
waited until three days before if out a
template got lucky
you know just happened to be exactly
what I needed so I got lucky there
the problem with luck is that it's not
quantifiable you can't say okay I got
lucky this time and that time in that
time for some reason and they might have
an imposter we don't add any of that up
we don't look at reoccurrences so this
cycle continues and continues who knows
somebody brilliant but you talked to
that when you say good job or that was
great or this is a brilliant piece of
code discounted it immediately yeah
so what does that mean is this really a
big deal am i making it out to big deal
and I'm probably just really emotional
that's the reason that I'm talking about
this right but to somebody who has lots
of confidence this can sound kind of
silly like Oh boohoo
sorry that you actually got your
deadline done you know it does sound
like I'm just trying to pull for
attention but it's not bad at all the
fundamental cause of trouble in the
world today is that the stupid are sure
while the intelligent are full of doubt
is very very true and to illustrate this
I found another little drawing feelings
versus reality let's go over that shall
we so how good you think you are is not
necessarily always how good you really
are you need to fall in a healthy place
on the spectrum preferably in the middle
but let's talk about what it means to be
on the opposite end but done in Kruger
effect has anyone heard of the
dunning-kruger effect a spice okay so
for for a bit of you right I like to
describe this person as gaston from
beating the beast it's just like yes I'm
amazing in fact I'll sing my own song
thank you very much right he's that's
that person who says
no I've been doing this for a long time
and you really should just let me
architect it right you just let me do it
you should just listen to what I say
because I'm amazing not they may not say
they're amazing but they're kind of
intimating it right that is somebody who
maybe isn't that great at all but has
overwhelming confidence to do so this is
very prevalent in sales so um I mean it
is true but strangely enough it's very
prevalent on stackoverflow too and you
know you just got to be careful that
some people are really just talking to
hear themselves talk and not necessarily
to help you out
you know that's really what they're
there for not everyone of course but
that's kind of the definition of
somebody who really has that is that
they're not as good as I say they are
okay so then you go on the opposite end
the spectrum where I fall personally
which is Ana posture because I might be
really good but I you really know how
much I don't know
so I refuse to even look at how far I've
come
but is that again is that a big deal
like why sometimes people confuse this
with humble bragging does anybody ever
heard of humble bragging yeah yes
several right it's actually considered
quite rude in many countries to go into
it a little too much okay since oh and
always is not me thank you but no you
know if you go into too much it just
looks like you're pretending to be
down-to-earth but that's not what
happens here I actually get a lump in my
throat when somebody gives me
compliments I got one yesterday and even
here it still comes back and they're
like oh you know you're really on your
way to wherever you want to go in
software you could could probably carve
your own path and I was just like yeah
and then I could follow my face tomorrow
you know I mean that's how I felt but
instead of voicing that I've learned to
say thank you that's very difficult you
know why because if you say thank you
that means that you are agreeing with
the person that just gave you that
compliment right but they don't view it
that way they view it as thank you for
taking the time to give me the
compliment right so our perspective is
completely different and we need to
change that
so are you in a posture possibly if you
feel like a fake or you attribute any of
your success to look and you discount
your level of success when you reflect
upon what you've done
then probably yes so who's affected by
this and what is it exactly so before we
get into who is affected let me define
this for you I am NOT a psychologist I
don't even play one on TV I just read
Google and I sign some credible
psychology papers that back up the
things that I was looking into right
what I have discovered is that this is
not an actual illness so it's not a
mental health issue this is a state of
mind and you can change it very
important disorientation so it's going
to who's affected according to Amy Cuddy
who's a fantastic TED Talks speaker over
50% of the people who contacted her
after one of her most famous TED Talks
were actually men talking about how they
do have this so it isn't and especially
in our industry who can keep up we have
these amazing rock stars who teach us
maybe at this very conference you're
like how can I ever measure up to this
person who makes it sound so easy when
they say oh it's easy you just do this
and carry the nine and then now you can
out and here you use your neural network
you're like thank you okay I so what
ends up happening is you feel stupid
right because you didn't get that you're
not stupid for something you don't know
but yet that's how you internalize it
right instead of just going well that is
such a cool new concept you go oh my god
I have no idea what I'm doing and that's
exactly what happens so when you
experience that first then it just kind
of drives at home
I actually know many men who goes
through this as well so while the
original study was based around why
women will wait until they feel 110
percent qualified to ask for that
promotion or ask for that razor after
that position they said oh men aren't
like that but actually in software I
find that everyone's like this that a
lot of people wait until they really
feel like they can really do it people
are going to think whatever they want to
about me and there's nothing I can do
about it right this is a statement based
on a brand new
study that just came out recently right
and around the mental health of minority
students so this came out in March of
2017 at the Journal of Counseling
Psychology and the direct quote I took
from it will have the imposter
phenomenon in some cases can even
degrade their mental health who already
perceived prejudices against them
not that they were given but that they
could be given so let's pretend I'm
minority I am NOT currently but let's
pretend that I was that means that I'm
going to assume that because perhaps I'm
Hispanic that even though I am getting
straight A's may be a plus as I am NOT
missing anything on my tests in college
I know that people still perceive me as
somebody who won't make anything of her
life because traditionally speaking this
is the way people perceive maybe
somebody in Latin America or you know
historically right so if I assume that a
prejudice is already being taken I
actually talk myself out of doing well
and in fact half of these students who
were beyond stellar ended up pulling out
of school because they just couldn't
take the pressure even though they were
completely outperforming everyone else
that's pretty fascinating to me so even
though the prejudice wasn't even given
by a classmate it was the perception
that it would be that means that this
problem rests with you to a point now
there are a lot of things in the world
that are put upon us by others but in
this case the proof was that they were
excelling it was on paper they were even
praised by their teachers and so we're
like yeah but nobody'll take me
seriously and I mean they'll never think
about me as anything but this so I just
can't even handle this anymore isn't
that interesting is it just happening
there not at all so there's incredible
people out in the world that also suffer
from this dr. Margaret Chan and has a
fantastic quote about there are a lot of
people that think I'm an expert right
I'm so much aware of all the things I
don't know I paraphrase that early it's
this woman does everything for the World
Health Organization she's amazing she
has done so much and yet she cannot take
a compliment for the life of her Albert
Einstein as well the exaggerated esteem
in which my life work
hell makes me very ill at ease I feel
compelled to think of myself as an
involuntary swindler it also happens in
the celebrity circuit this is actually
the first time I stumbled upon this
phenomenon was of the sky next at any
time I still expect that the no-talent
police will come and arrest me I mean I
loved Mike Myers and so for me I was
like really Oh surely that he should
humble bragging right mmm
surely he doesn't really believe that
when it was true he actually suffer
stomach greatly and his family has had
to really support him through this even
Ricky Gervais the best advice I've ever
received is no one else knows what
they're doing either I think that's true
actually
I love the answer of I'm not smart I'm
just curious and damned persistent so
you know okay that's a good way of
looking at it and this made him
comfortable to enter into the comedy
scene my favourite story though is from
Will Smith I still doubt myself every
single day what people believe is my
self-confidence is actually my reaction
to fear when he was on set Will Smith
used to play pranks on people just to
try to get his nervous energy out he was
so terrified that everybody discounted
one day and that he'd never really make
it he decided in the meantime he was
just going to put jokes on everyone it
actually ended up making the cast and
crew loved him even more and he got even
more support but they all just thought
that he was confident guy running around
putting whoopee cushions on stools you
know like he thought that's who he was
but really he was so fright
you just so frightened because it was
Hollywood is a big place where everybody
just goes through this turnstile right
they go in and they go out there they're
in the light and they're gone
that's how he dealt with it and he does
even now authors also go through this
there's so many different people that
have great insight but I wanted to pull
a couple out that I really love their
work if you find yourself asking
yourself and your friends
am I really a writer am I really an
artist
chances are that you are the counterfeit
innovator is wildly self-confidence and
the real one is scared to death Steven
Pressfield wrote a fantastic book called
the war of arts and I'm highly recommend
that you read it it absolutely pertains
to us as software engineers because what
we do regardless of how logically our is
artistic I feel like we are the greatest
combination of the left and the right
brain we get the opportunity to do both
so his book deals with how you overcome
that mental block of I can't I don't
know what to write or in our case I
don't know how to code this I'm not sure
that I'm going to do anything inspiring
or really great I think I need to follow
someone else's work before coming up
with my own it's really difficult to
break out as I'm just going to follow
whatever framework everybody else is
using versus I'm going to think for
myself and maybe come up with my own
strategy so that's a great book for that
and Neil Gaiman I'm sure many of you are
familiar with him the first problem of
any kind of even limited success is the
unshakable conviction that you are
getting away with something and then at
any moment now they will discover you my
goodness
and even Maya Angelou she's written 11
books but every time she thinks I'm
going to figure me out and I run a game
on everyone one of the most celebrated
authors of all time it even creeps into
our tech right so I knew a lot about the
celebrities but I wasn't sure if anybody
in our space that I'd be familiar with
was going through this and if they were
would they ever admit it I mean why
would you add fuel to the fire her face
but sure enough she all sandberg so
there are still days that she feels like
she's a fraud when she wakes up and
she's not sure she should be there you
know the person who helps Mark
Zuckerberg run Facebook and still does
to this day still feels like she's not
sure that she should be there and yet
she has brought so much of a cultural
shift for them to where the focus is on
caring for their employees Richard
Campbell
I've made a lot of mistakes most
intelligence comes from failure so that
is the way that he deals with those
feelings
and of course Scott Hanselman I feel
like a phony sometimes sometimes I joke
hey it's a good day my badge still works
or I answer how are you with all I'm
still working which is amazing to me
because this is arguably one of the most
celebrated speakers that we have in our
circuit and yet he actually had it
pretty bad for a while and hopefully
it's coming better so again we're going
to go back to this is this healthy
concern or logical doubt this is the
moment where I say okay do I really not
know this it's okay to not know
something or do I know this and I'm just
worried for nothing this is where you
have to bring in an outside perspective
because you're not going to get there on
your own
again I even paused about should I
talked about this to software engineers
because I would much rather talk to them
about natural language processing or
mobile development that's what I do
right why would they listen to me about
touchy-feely subject but because I
actually am qualified because I've gone
through this and I am a recovering
impostor so I figured I might as well
try to share it so that required other
people to be pulled in and many of the
speakers who knew me had to really
counsel me on it's alright to share SES
Lewis put it humility is not thinking
less of yourself but thinking of
yourself less take that with you what is
the difference between insecurity and
humility
if you feel humbled and stunned by the
world around you there's probably a sign
you should embrace what you don't know
the way that I look at this is that I
run towards something that scares me
this which sounds crazy sounds like
something that way back in the day the
Scots would do right there's danger
let's go right but that's actually what
I do now I'm like oh I know nothing
about that particular framework I should
probably learn it then I mean that that
is how I feel because it makes me
uncomfortable that I don't understand it
so is this detrimental to your career it
might be something that you struggle
with personally but does anybody else
affected by the
I mean is it hourly something that will
impact you not too long ago actually
when this was at the height of imposter
ISM I actually thought that I could do
something without asking for help I was
there to prove myself because I just got
a senior title and I'm like okay I'm a
senior now serious business I I have to
do all the things and so I said yes I
can do this thing I actually had no idea
how to do it and I the more I looked
into it the deeper of a hole it was I
realized I had left in my education so I
do not have a degree and for to solve
this problem you had to have a little
bit more advanced mathematics that I
didn't have and so instead of asking for
help I just decided to go through the
Google poll and just try to look up
stuff but really that doesn't make up
for time and so instead of informing my
employer I took that entire two weeks
try and learn just enough to get by and
I did not deliver something that was
crucial to our project on time actually
the day before my manager checked in
with me and he's like are you done with
this and I said actually do you know
anything about this and he was like oh
no um okay so he had to come in with a
bunch of other engineers and work on
that and we missed a deadline anyway so
they let me go because I didn't ask for
help and I held it all in I was in such
I had petrified myself I wasn't able to
work I wasn't able to think clearly I
had to try to do all of it and therefore
I couldn't think at all so because of
this I was convinced that I should go
back to doing hospitality like I did
before I mean even though I had made it
all the way to a senior engineer this
doesn't happen to me
when I was young this didn't happen to
me when I was a junior that's happened
to me as a senior person at a fortune
500 company that is a big deal that's a
lot of responsibility and I felt like I
love myself and every other girl who
tries to do tack down I did I felt that
way and because of that I felt an
obligation to share it because
I was so convinced that I couldn't do it
that I didn't do it I literally made
what I imagined in my brain come true I
manifested my own thoughts
that sounds really deep but it's true if
you believe something about yourself
it comes to fruition it's all based
around fear right so fear can utterly
dominate our behavior it's office
thinking and helping and learning
discovering and sharing and all the
things that we need in abundance because
fear is the mind killer so what do we do
about this what do I do about this Here
I am kind of knee-deep in an industry
that I love but for some reason felt
like I could never rise to right I was
told to fake it till you make it that
sort of doesn't work in soft friction
Airy because you can't pretend that you
know a language you don't it's just too
easy to expose that's not really what
that statement means I kind of hate it I
don't really like the way that that is
expressed at all and Amy kinda puts it
so much better she says you should fake
it until you become it what that really
means is that you should surround
yourself with that topic or with those
people that know those things and and
just be like you know what this is what
they're doing I'm going to do it too and
then along the way you discover that
actually you are also doing it it kind
of sneaks up on you suddenly actually
you do know how to solve that problem
you're not just with the people who know
how to solve it because remember every
one of us are in various stages of not
knowing what we are doing and anybody
who tells you that they are accomplished
and there's really much less of them to
learn I beg to differ I bet there's
something that a developer that comes in
knows that you don't know I mean by
virtue of the fact that you are at a
conference means you are in the top 10%
of developers who want to further their
career it is true it is factual so that
means you care more right so imagine
your surprise when somebody comes in who
is a career changer maybe the age of 50
and who actually just spent a little bit
of time looking up something on big
o-notation and you forgot about that
years ago you know we could all learn
from each other so let's convert that
curiosity that we have about a subject
into confidence that's the way I like to
think now is that I have to convert it
instead of being like I wish I knew that
and it can be like it'll be great when I
know that that's the way I kind of look
at it we need to interpret fear as
excitement I actually posted about this
earlier I'm like I'm at although I'm
excited that's the word I am excited I
can't say that I'm nervous I'm excited
because you can actually reprogram your
brain to interpret it that way
we have limited amount of cognitive
cycles to use so use them wisely it's
good to know what you don't know but
find a mentor in your field do not be
afraid to go up to them I promise you
they'll be flattered please just go up
and say you know all the things please
teach me one can you just look at one
thing I do I know you're busy but please
teach me one or can you show me somebody
who will I promise that kind of question
is usually rewarded and speak
confidently confidently that you don't
know yet but you will that's the way
that I've been able to survive and
continue to grow in this industry don't
compare yourself to other people I just
had to throw that up there we all know
not to do it but we all do it and by
being able to identify these feelings
and recognizing them for what they are
Marianne Pasha who's also another TED
speaker has been able to know they are
just feelings and not facts
because remember the story you are
telling yourself about your competence
or incompetence is all invented so now
with that kind of approach I guess that
means I can just leave and be confident
that I can overcome this right just get
better just believe in yourself right
just blame yourself you'll be better
you'll be great and I can walk away it
doesn't work very well for reprogramming
you can't just hope that you're poorly
written code will someday execute that
you have to rewrite your brain and the
only way that I have found to rewrite it
is to study successful people that don't
have this issue and how they respond to
the same scenarios because if this is
not an illness and it's a state of mind
then how do i reprogram my mind to be in
a different state so I found some people
at my work that were by everybody's
accounts very successful at their jobs
everybody loved them and they seemed to
have confidence and they didn't have the
kind of unshakeable fear I did so I
decided to interview them to kind of get
a little bit of perspective Karen is a
BA analyst and bread is project manager
Heather is in charge of a lot of search
engine optimizations and Preston is an
agile coach so because I mean they just
exude confidence and but you know
generosity and a genuine love for
everything they do if I ask them
questions like how do you approach
having to deliver something you've never
done before Karen said that the first
step would be to get with somebody who
does know right Brad suggestion was to
ask for an appropriate discovery time
and pad your estimates Heather said to
be transparent so you don't offer to hit
a bar you can't reach quickly which is
my problem and Preston said to try not
to make commitments to set yourself up
for failure so these are people again
who generally don't get things wrong
okay but this is how they do approach
these kinds of problems so I said well
are you human I mean do you make
mistakes I mean do you have a memorable
mistake that led to your growth Karen
released a bug into production I didn't
catch it what she fails to mention in
what I captured here is that it was a
very important piece of production code
that affected people's bank accounts so
that was kind of a big deal and remember
she's a celebrated analyst and done a
lot with QA Brad accidentally deleted
years of forth of database records as
we've heard lots of stories last night
of something similar and I'm sure I need
to know is any business audience never
deleted a database record by acts
ha see look we have all screwed up right
how does that she could do everything on
a project and fail also was my issue
kind of interesting we have the same
name and Preston didn't pay attention to
the signs of an unrecoverable situation
and it got him burned more particularly
he didn't pay attention to the fact that
his team was struggling that actually
happens a lot of management sometimes
you just don't notice that your team is
having a hard time and instead of you
know helping them and seeing if we can
get to through the problem they usually
end up pushing them instead and the
whole thing fell apart so what kept them
going after a major failure Karen said
even if you fail things still need to
get done I mean she kind of sounds like
my mom but it's true and I mean whether
or not you're having a confidence crisis
we still have to push that code it still
has to happen so pull yourself up by
your bootstraps it still does need to
happen and Brad said to remember that
everything you do is just a tiny drop in
the bucket of life and Heather just has
a stubbornness to not quit I mean she
says she constantly has something to
prove I like to Preston's answer the
best though because he said that failing
at something does not mean that you are
a failure it is the ultimate learning
experience so that's great those are
peers as a people kind of on my level so
I wanted to ask somebody who would be in
charge of hiring developers or in charge
of a company and ask them more about
that so what do you guys think John was
an architect on a project of mine and he
said that you need to do everything you
can to become the expert even if you
don't feel you're ever going to reach it
just try anyway let it drive you and
find the joy in discovering this is so
important here's a scenario there's a
software engineer he goes oh no I'm
going to find a date I'm parser and oh
god I hate this and I have to go look
for it and just stressing me out
versus Oh awesome I get to learn
something new or solve at the day time
parsing date time parsing awesomes
did you know this is my day time parsing
they're doing the same job with just
just different perspectives and that is
what has gotten him to where he's at and
he says that that is like the magic
if you can find the joy in discovering
it will completely sustain you through
whatever happens debbie says that you
need to have a level of fearlessness to
do what we do which is true more than
anything you have to listen to others
and realize that people do want you to
succeed this is actually a piece of
advice I had when I did my first talk
like you know you realize these people
are given an hour of their life to you
and they really want you to be good they
want you to succeed they want to know
what you have to say that could be of
value to them remember they're on your
side on our CEO said that there's a fine
line between humility and lack of
confidence and pride if you think it's
luck you will stop being able to repeat
your success that was kind of a big
eye-opener for me so I like repeating my
success I like writing my code once and
not repeating it everywhere
all right that's how a skillful but it's
kind of the reverse though in your
career we want to repeat the things that
we're doing well and then continue to
grow from them but if you say I just got
lucky
I was person showed up just in the nick
of time then you're never going to be
able to structure it and set yourself up
for success at all so I also asked how
can you tell if somebody who fails has
the potential to ultimately succeed so
this is the I have a direct report
question is your direct report a good
direct report is your junior developer
or a junior developer right that
question will come up and that's what I
basically was asking how do you know if
that person really has this in them or
just software is not for you you know
how do you know John believes it
nobody's useless and everybody can have
a role in the project and the people he
knows that will succeed will own up to
their failed attempts and are relentless
in their pursuit the CEO said that an
attitude of positivity an ability to
visualize success is what gives them
that potential good leaders can see the
eventual positive outcome in a person
and he looks for someone who does not
remain frozen by their failure when he
said that to me I said you realize
the reason that I was dismissed from
this place I worked like many moons ago
was because I was frozen by that failure
and he says really I would not have
thought that about you Heather
and I was right because I'm changing my
nervous energy into excitement which is
why I'm the person who has lots of big
arm movements and a jump around the
stage is because I am genuinely excited
to be here but that is my way of not
remaining in mobile it's the mind killer
so based on all of this kind of research
that I did in my own little sample group
I kind of came to the conclusion the
reason that I do not feel confident is
because I'm aware of all the things I
don't know so if you're aware of all the
things you don't know and more new
things keep coming out every month if
you're in JavaScript and you're like
what thing do I learn I don't have time
and it's just overwhelming everybody
says in this industry if you talk to
some pretty well-known people it doesn't
really matter what new framework or
language comes out what matters is the
basics what matters is your
problem-solving and if you have holes in
those areas there is something that you
can do about that so Rob Connor came out
with a book recently called the
Impostors handbook and it's actually a
little bit of a primer on what software
developers are supposed to kind of know
okay this is a great book I've read it a
the several iterations in beta and now
it's available to you and I mean I
didn't actually know a whole lot about
big o-notation because I just never had
to touch it before right and I got to
learn about that in this book and he
didn't have a degree either and he
decided that he would plug all the holes
and take us along for the ride and so
it's actually a very well laid out book
and if you're interested in the things
that you think you're missing that will
transcend every generation of software
development that you do this is an
excellent book to get started so the
next image is something I actually print
out and I take with me two different
clients because is true I have to not be
afraid of asking the question I cannot
be afraid of stepping on toes I can't be
afraid of any of it I just have to be
afraid of not signing the truth of the
situation
even if that means that the situation is
kind of uncomfortable especially when it
comes to a really bad codebase and
you're like well I think this is bad
code I think there's a smell here but
these people probably know more than me
and so I mean Who am I to judge I
probably don't know brewing code when I
see it you know and maybe that's what it
is this is something that I run into
regularly especially as I go and I kind
of scan what other people are doing I
find reading other people's code bases
fantastic and terrifying because you
learn so much about the people in their
state of mind when they wrote it were
they in a rush usually yes what was
important to that developer I loved
finding out the person who's naming it
was if they just spent hours on naming
because a means important it is hard but
they didn't really spend a whole lot of
time on these nested for-loops that
about 17 layers deep then there's the
people who think I'm going to be
terribly clever with my code so you can
never decipher what I'm doing I mean I
like being able to tell the personality
of the person based on what they are
right I think that's kind of Awesome but
then it's the whole yeah can you fix it
like tomorrow that's where I become a
little terrified but as long as I find
the truth of the situation whether I can
be the one to fix it or not if I tell
that truth to my clients or to whoever
else it is that I was being brought in
to do I actually find that it disarms
them instead of saying oh yeah I can fix
it I just go wow there's just a lot here
so I'm not sure I know that this part
looks at puzzling we're going to use
that word and I mean I can do this much
but I'm not sure about this so how about
you give me time to do that and I'll
give you updates as I go that's really
honest that's the truth of the situation
I find that everybody responds to that
at every level much better than false
consonants so let's shift our focus team
up with a friend or a partner at work
that can talk up your skills and call
out your achievements for you and then
you can do the same in return this is
called Co bragging and it absolutely
works a good example of this is probably
when I first started doing
mean anything around AI I was so
interested in it that I I found the
people who did it and I would just
remind them how much I learned from them
and they really are impressive but
because it is a growing field and we're
discovering new things all the time that
we could do they would they be like oh I
mean I'm just learning and passing on as
I go I'm like yeah but you make an
impact on me so thank you that's a lot
of value and then in Reverse maybe like
you know I love how persistent that you
are and while this all sounds like we're
just trying to be nice to each other
you're actually rewiring each other's
brains to be comfortable and open with
each other
so in order to get encouragement you
have to give it and you have to give it
first you have to do it first
this can actually change your entire
culture at work so if you have a
not-so-happy environment and everybody
is kind of shows that for work once I'm
happy if you start this cycle you can
radically change your culture without
involving the management of your company
at all this can just be you guys that
can completely change this a good way to
look at this is when we have a
catastrophic failure as a team we have
to start picking out things that we
actually did well in it and start
encouraging that cycle so be kind to
yourself the technology world is very
hard on us luck only gets you so far and
you were the one that acted on the
opportunities you were presented I can't
stress that part enough you are where
you are because you chose to say yes you
chose to trade some of hours of your
time for money or just trade hours of
your time for the love and the pursuit
of it as a side project right you chose
to take that and run with it it wasn't
luck lots of opportunities passed people
by and their life never changes you may
not be able to determine when those
opportunities will come but you're
absolutely in charge of whether or not
you grasp them and in our industry there
is no reason not to grab an opportunity
by the horns and run with it the world
needs us so even if it doesn't work out
chances of you getting another job in 24
ours is pretty good I wouldn't worry
about it too much remember that you're
not an impostor for trying something
that might not work you are a hero I
know that sounds big and enormous but
it's true so the solution that you need
to take home today is that you need to
discover how to be self-aware and
recognize those emotions update your
view of failure as an intense growth
opportunity and fake it until you become
it and pay it forward so if you are a
person that maybe doesn't experience
this but you know someone who does maybe
a friend a colleague a family member
what do you do about this do you just
say hey here's a slide deck I saw it in
DC oz we should look at it like that's
kind of rough right
remember that cycle that I talked about
earlier you need to give encouragement
to get encouragement impostures will be
the hardest to break through but if you
give them opportunities and you
unconfident vacations to just be part of
whatever you're doing whether it's have
a seat at our table and this could get
goose code all the way down to high
school have lunch with us or maybe you
should just try looking at some new
things that you know will put you at the
same level as everyone else that's
actually how I was able to tell myself
that it's okay for me to charge for my
services now because everybody learned
about this particular new technology at
the same time so right I've got just as
much experience in this new tech as
everyone else not to discount years and
years of experience but it should never
hold you back from being able to achieve
what you need to do you don't have to
attain perfection or mastery to be
worthy of a success that you have
achieved so if you take nothing else
away from today I want you to take this
and remember that this also applies to
the person that you make fun of to the
person that you put down the one that
you don't understand you have no idea
what they're going through and I'm not
trying to make all of us be mushy at the
end of this talk but it's true you don't
know why the person that you were
with that is intolerable is the way they
are so if you start with the
encouragement at the very least you'll
break down a wall even if it's somebody
whose mountains higher than where you
are at just say hey I really appreciated
this or your they did a great job at
this even if they know that it's okay
it breaks down walls maybe you should
try it sometime and then maybe we won't
have such a toxic environment where
we're all petrified to succeed because
we're too busy trying to be like the
best one in the room thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
