coming last session of the day so we'll
get through
nice and quickly and get straight to
drinks but I'm really excited to talk to
you today about some some cool power bi
stuff that that I've been doing recently
so my name is Matt Davies I'm a
principal consultant at ratify which
basically means that I'm across a whole
heap of our projects across software
across bi and data and analytics in
general so seen seen lots of cool stuff
and and and excited to share that with
you so I guess like over the last couple
of years we've we've been pretty heavily
involved in the data and analytics space
at ratify and and we've started to build
some some pretty interesting
capabilities and power bi is a tool
that's come up a lot for us and the
scenario that it's come up the most in
is we've we found for for years and
years and years that the biggest scope
creep in all of our projects by far
beyond anything else is reporting when a
client comes to you and they're like we
need we desperately need this report as
a part of the admin system within our
application it has to look exactly like
this it has to have this functionality
but the the issue comes about from the
fact that while you're in your sprints
while you're building your applications
it's really hard to tell what data you
have access to it's really hard to to
know what you actually need is a report
as an end result because your users
haven't used the systems they haven't
they haven't actually played with with
what you're coming up with and tried it
all out so we've been looking for
alternatives and I think power bi is a
really really strong a really really
strong tool in that space is there
anyone not familiar with what power bi
is anyone hasn't played around with it
before cool just couples so I'll so I
guess this isn't like a 101 talk but I
will try and I will try and at least
explain what it is
so that you can so you can follow along
and and I think it should still be
useful for you guys too so I so just I
guess covering what we're going to talk
about so I'll start with some background
which is why I think this whole thing is
really important we'll move on to what
things do we need to think about when
we're building out our applications what
kind of data do we need to capture what
what do we want to have in mind while
we're building our
to make the process easier as we go
through I'll talk a little bit about
ad-hoc exploration which i think is one
of the strongest features of power bi
are the the ability for a non-technical
subject matter experts to explore all
the datasets within an application that
you're building and come up with ideas
and play around with it and figure out
for themselves what insights and reports
they need rather than it being like a
direct part of development itself I'll
talk a little bit about how we can
expose some of the data from the apps
that we're building to power bi in such
a way that it's it's a really low
barrier to entry for business
stakeholders to be playing around with
that data we don't want them to have to
go through really complicated
authentication mechanisms and access
requests to servers and things like that
we want to make it nice and easy
I'll talk about building a report really
briefly again like most of you are kind
of familiar with that by the sounds of
it but just just to sort of touch on
some of the lessons that I will have
covered and lastly we'll cover ok
business stakeholders built a report as
a part of our application development
now how do we take that report and
distribute it out to the business and
productionize it in such a way that it's
not actually going to cause us more
problems down the track cool so I wanted
to talk about big data for about 8
seconds so big data has been the the
buzzword of years and years and years
everyone was doing big data for years
now but what what we sort of found as
ratifies that
yes everyone was going out and
collecting these terabytes of data and
storing them in their data warehouses
and so on but no one's really been
really focused consistently on using
that data until the last until the last
couple of years and what we're seeing
now is that data is in every application
that we're building it's a core part of
you don't just go out and build an app
for a user or a Kuster anymore that
doesn't leverage data and analytics in
some way it's it's it's a part of
everything we're doing and it's a demand
we're seeing from from all of our
customers so I guess that that kind of
has led to something that's commonly
called a data culture which is this idea
that organizations that are really
competitive and strong in the current
are using data to make all of their
decisions on on both their operational
processes but also for like their wider
decision-making from from the lowest
levels right up to the executive levels
of organizations they're expecting that
data is going to be there and in place
to support this type of decision-making
so one of the best examples of an
organization that can leverage that type
of data culture is called a learning
organization which is the idea that if
you support all of your employees to
make their make their own decisions to
provide insight into your decisions
through providing your data provide them
time for reflection and and and time to
come up with their own ideas and
contribute then all of a sudden you have
data sources from across the
organization and insights from across
the organization that you weren't
leveraging before and and part of why
this is so relevant at the moment is
that tools like power bi actually open
up the ability for anyone in the company
to contribute insights based on data
that's available and and that's
something that we've really seen is a
really strong trend so the the quick I
guess 101 on power bi is a it came about
they actually quite old now so actually
I think I think around 10 years old
something something like that in its
original form and it came about as this
idea that cool we've got excel all of
our users are all of our business
stakeholders are really comfortable with
Excel and comfortable with connecting
directly to sequel databases with power
query and and playing around with all
their data and building reports like
that but what what happened over and
over again people would build their
Excel spreadsheets put them in a share
drive somewhere or email them around and
eventually you end up in this situation
where you've got a bunch of out-of-date
Excel reports flying around like I'm
sure everyone's seen it I've seen it a
hundred times and power bi came about as
this idea that you could use all of
those existing skills all of that
knowledge people built up by generating
these excel reports but make
visualization really easy make data
exploration really easy and make sharing
those out really easily as well as give
a really powerful ability for us to
embed those reports within applications
rather than trying to come up with them
ourselves with our own graphing and
charting libraries so that's that's a
sort of 101 and I guess why why we care
as developers or why I think we should
care as developers as I sort of said
like we as ratify have seen this trend
where where customers are demanding more
insights but more so than that we're
seeing a lot of can you build me a
report specifically to answer this one
question or can you can you give me some
insight into this single part of my
customers just like these one soft
questions and they're not really worth
going through full report building
processes within apps they're the sort
of thing where if you empower your
customers they can go understand all
this stuff themselves and the second
part I suppose is that we use this stuff
really heavily in our own business
transparency is a pretty key part of
what we do you can as an employee go in
and see any information you want about
ratifies so how many people we've got
where they are what how much money we're
making what sales opportunities we've
got coming up everything it's all sort
of open and that came about because of
that learning organisation trait we just
empowered everyone as a part of the work
they're already doing to to contribute
power bi reports to build up a shared
dashboard just just through just through
enabling everyone to access that data
and do what they needed with it so
that's that's I suppose why it's been
relevant to me for the last few years
but talking more broadly than that the
first sort of point why why wider
community would care about this is that
bi a typically has just been the realm
of BI specialists so many organizations
have people that are very trained in bi
and very experienced it at pulling
together really convoluted complex data
sources and coming up with really cool
insights into them from that but that's
that's no longer just the realm of those
experts it's tools like this that
empower us to to build these types of
insights and reports ourselves without
having to go to the experts every time
which empowers the experts to start
focusing just on the really complex
stuff and training everyone else on how
to do the more simpler types of problems
so I think that's really cool
the second is that it's it's quite often
a huge pain to build all these reports
yourselves as a part of app dev the yeah
over and over again I found myself in
situations where I'm trying to
understand the latest charting library
that you should be using the latest
animations I need to apply trying to
work with designers to make things look
exactly perfect based on people's
expectations can be a bit of a pain to
do this stuff yourself and I don't think
that's the state we need to anymore we
can use tools like this to just make our
lives so much easier and not have to go
through that and the last reason is that
data exploration that I was talking
about means that we can build the right
reports rather than very early on in
projects building what we think is
relevant so that's that's I guess the
the main focus of the talk today and and
what I hope that you get out of it is
the ability to spend less time on this
reporting type functionality of
application development yourself and
more time on on outsourcing that through
to the people who are actually experts
in understanding that data so the first
thing I want to talk about as part of
that agenda is creating and capturing
data so we're sort of in this world
where and and yeah sort of in this world
where we've got these countless sources
of data data from every possible place
imaginable it's not just the data we
come up with as a part of our
application development there's there's
there's countless different sources and
something that we found as ratify as
we're leveraging more and more software
as a service and as we're leveraging
more off-the-shelf applications for our
own usage is that that introduces a
whole lot of interesting challenges
above and beyond what would happen if
you're just trying to come up with
reports from your own data sets so
there's a whole heap of ways that we can
try and solve that and and and try and
make that easier on ourselves so I
wanted to try and start with I guess
some practical tips for what to think
about it at this sort of early stage
when you're building your apps the first
is if you're using off-the-shelf
applications this might be you're
customizing them as developers or
integrating them with other system
or implementing them in some way try
when you're talking with vendors to
figure out how you get access to your
data very early on so often we hear
stories of vendors who keep the access
to your own data within their own
boundaries and don't really let you get
to it easily they keep the IP behind it
basically and getting access to that
really early is super important if we
want to be able to build insights off it
the second is making sure that you have
the right the right frequency of data so
making sure that if you need real-time
data from a system that you're
implementing or customizing from a
vendor that you can actually get to that
as often as you need to because so often
again you'll you'll have scenarios where
you can only get an update once every 24
hours or something like that and that
might not be enough the insights you
need so something else think about and
try to ensure that you make it easy for
business users to get to those data
sources and that's one that I'll go into
a bit more depth on because it's it's
actually quite a complex topic how do
you a granade sub data sources in such a
way that business users can get to them
easily and build reports off them so
we'll talk about that a little bit more
going forward but something to think
about when you're having early
conversations custom apps so these are
the the sort of four things I'm thinking
about when whenever I'm doing custom
application development the first is
keep all the data that you reasonably
can at the most granular level that you
can throughout app dev and obviously
we've got counter arguments to that that
come up a lot like you're kind of
emergent architecture just capture what
you need as you need to but with data
and insights in particular it's really
hard to go back and add a lot of that
stuff later if if you're opening up the
flexibility for your business users to
build these reports but you have to go
in and make application changes to
support them then that friction actually
stops that working well so finding out
ways to just capture as much as you can
and that's as simple as early in your
app dev process figure out a way to
abstract that information capture figure
out a way to make it so easy that you
don't really have to think about how to
capture that sort of data
the second is try to keep linking
information with other systems
if you're customizing a CRM for example
make sure you're keeping both your ID
for a user as well as the CRN's ID for a
user as well it kind of sounds like
common sense maybe but again that makes
things so much easier later down the
track if you have a way to link together
all these different disparate data sets
third is think about how you might use
reporting feedback loops to improve your
apps and by that I mean if you've got
your stakeholders coming up with
insights as you're building the app they
can feedback information to you as to
whether or not what you're building is
even the right thing to be building it's
just another source of information you
can use for making decisions and the
last is think about questions you might
want to answer later but you don't quite
have the ability to deal with right at
that point in time but keep that list
and make it really visible and and
really obvious to the team so that as
soon as something crops up that's
related to a question you thought about
earlier you can you can deal with it at
that time rather than straight away so
there are hopes and some practical tips
for things to think about when you're
starting to look at power bi so the next
thing to talk about is trying to expose
all that data to power bi in a way that
our business users can get to it easily
without jumping through a whole lot of
hoops so this is where I'll start going
to a few different demos because I think
some of this stuff is probably easier if
I show you has anyone heard of the
adventure works database before yeah
lots of nods good so I use this all the
time but this is basically a data set
for those of you don't know that's just
dummy data that's cleaned up to be an
unfair Lea nonnamous that Microsoft
distributes so I've loaded that ahead of
time into a local sequel database so you
don't have to see that but I'll tweet
out the link in case you in case you
need it at the end you can go grab that
and you can go download basically a
database with a huge amount of useful
information for playing around with
stuff like this
that's so power bi hopefully hopefully
like I said familiar to a fair few of
you but if you haven't seen this tool
before this is the desktop viewer for
power bi you don't need to use a desktop
application to build reports and use
power bi there's a web portal that will
do a fair bit but anytime you're
starting to get into complex scenarios
it's worth getting this because it it
makes your life a hell of a lot easier
so I've got that adventureworks data set
loaded up locally so all I have to do is
get data sequel server in this case it's
on my local DB and it's called
adventureworks 2012 so there's two data
connectivity modes important directquery
import will actually copy all of the
data from from your queries into the
power bi report itself kind of like a
cache which makes things really fast to
develop on it means that you don't have
to wreak worry the database every single
time you change a filter or alter your
data but it means that once you get to
production you have to think about
refresh cycles and and and making sure
that data is up to date and and kept
like that so for this particular demo
i'll use import just because it'll make
things a bit faster for us but we try to
recommend people use direct query as
much as possible because it makes things
so much easier down the track you can so
the question was can you change midway
you can but there's a few things in
direct query that sorry there's a few
things in import type queries that you
can do which will then mean you can't
then change to direct query so as early
as you possibly can
basically so let's pretend I'm a
subject-matter expert working for
working for a bike shop as I think this
example is and I'm interested in in
having a look and my developers hooked
me up with this data set from the app
that they're building so I can come in
here I can look at all these different
tables I get a little preview of what
the data is so I can go all right
interested in that in this case let's
say that I'm interested in looking at
the employees for this organization
so check the box next to that load that
and because I'm on input what this will
do right now is go go directly to that
database directly to that table that
I've mentioned and try and pull in all
of that information directly into the
report and that will load that straight
into power bi desktop so that we can
start altering that and and doing
queries on it so you see it kind of goes
through a few different steps to do that
this can take a while with remote data
sources which another reason that direct
query is a really good idea early on in
most applications unless you're kind of
doing a demo like this locally so that's
loaded in I can see this datasets popped
up on the right but the direction you
want to point most of your stakeholders
to early on is this edit queries tab
where you can again get that preview
view in and you'd sort of see probably
immediately if you haven't seen this
before that it's pretty excel like you
can filter things you can you can pick
and search for different data you can
group data you can make all these
adjustments and you can get this into a
state where it's I guess clean data
that's pretty easy to work with and you
can do all that without any programming
so that's already like a pretty powerful
thing to be giving out to non-technical
users so let's pretend in this case that
I have that I've made some filters i've
i've adjusted this as i think i need to
and then i'll go back into here and I
can click just and this is so simple
that click a box next to these things to
start looking into them and start trying
to generate insights and that's not it's
not easy when you're just looking at a
huge table of data that come up with any
useful insights but when you come into
this view and you start clicking things
that's when you get some useful
knowledge so let's say that I'm
interested in the country of the
employees so I've clicked that that's
all that is is like text fields with
with the country of the employee and
it's gone straight away and said okay
visualization here's a here's a world
map with all of the different countries
that use it from and and kind of look at
this since
right away go so it's kind of
interesting but I don't really get much
out of that like okay there's some
employees in different countries but if
we then say how about we take something
unique like in this case email address
and drag that into size then we start
getting like things that are a little
bit more useful because now we know okay
most of our employees are in North
America as we're building out this
system maybe we want to look at those
specifically to figure out some some
useful ideas from those so that's the
data exploration part of power bi and
like hopefully you can kind of see from
that that by delegating that out to
people who understand these data sets
there they're way better place than us
as developers to figure out what might
be useful as reports so that's that
aspect of it the second aspect of data
exploration is oh my bother going back
to slides but it's basically as soon as
you start giving business stakeholders
direct access to data sources that's
great they can come up with their own
insights awesome but you'll find pretty
quickly that everyone starts coming up
with their own version of things people
will people come up with their own
reports someone in the room next to them
I've seen this before will come up with
almost exactly the same thing but
they'll reach their conclusions in
different ways and you'll end up with
slightly different data sets being held
by slightly different people so one of
the ways that we can try to avert that
problem is something called data catalog
which is another as opposed service now
what this lets employees do all any
employees in an organization is publish
datasets that they're working on er that
they know about within a company so it's
it's basically a giant data dictionary
in more traditional bi terms and you can
just come in as as any user that knows
about some data source that's available
click publish data and you can launch an
application which will which will let
you do that which will let you put the
data source you know about in a publicly
searchable catalog that anyone else can
go find and that just helps avert a
whole other set of problems that can
come up so the app
that pops up with when you click launch
looks just something like this you can
pick a data source so in my case I got
that call adventure works database which
is a sequel server on my local machine I
can type in what that is I won't have
encryption I don't think cool so what
that will do is then give me all of the
databases on my local machine in in a
real scenario you would obviously
ideally be connecting to a sequel server
that's hosted somewhere maybe like a
test or a prod environment but for the
sake of this demo these are all the
databases that are a part of that server
and I'm interested in sharing the
adventure works database with people
particularly let's say the person table
so I can click into that there all the
different columns and the really
interesting part and I'll show you this
in a second is you can include a preview
and a data profile about that that's
really hard to read but but this one
here include preview and this one here
include data profile so you can register
that data set and that will just pop it
straight into the catalog so if I show
you what the catalog looks like make a
little bit more sense as to why that's
so useful
hopefully cool so I'll come in here and
let's say that I'm working for a
sporting organization so I'm just a
Sports Center that organizers let's say
like local volleyball and basketball
games for people and I'm an employee
that's really interested in getting some
insights into what kind of games are
being played so I'll come in here and
I'll just search for games and someone
has someone else in the company has very
kindly published a dataset called casual
games so if I have a look at that you
can see that someone's going in
published a data set that's called
fixture games that's not very useful
that doesn't actually mean much to a to
a non-technical user so they've named
that casual games given a description
there's an expert there so I know who to
contact if I'm interested in that
particular data set it's tagged so I can
go and easily search it and it's got
connection information against it but
the really useful part is preview so I
can go in and see that's the the top 20
rows that I think it's the top 20 rows
that are a part of that data set and go
play around with it without having to
download or connect to anything on my
local computer and like all that data is
available and I can just go use it so
that's super useful you can go to data
profile tab which gives you a bunch of
stats so how many different rows are
there what's the what are some of the
small values what are some of the large
values so you can get some you can get
some idea of what you'd be working with
without even having to actually open it
up but when you do decide to open it up
you're it your users be they technical
or non-technical can go in under open in
they can pull down an Excel spreadsheet
not very useful we kind of want to stay
away from that if we can or they can
pull down a power bi desktop file and
that file is pre set up with that
connection to that data set so you don't
have to go through complicated hoops to
to help them connect to it they can just
go download a file and start playing
around with it if if the data set needs
some kind of permission to access so if
say normally you have to go through a
request processor to get approval to go
get to it the under I think it's under
here
you can yeah sorry for most datasets you
can come under here and type in under
request access I'd like access and that
would that will send a request straight
to whoever the expertise for that data
set so even simplifies processes like
that where you normally have approval in
place so pretty cool and I think that's
a that's a useful tool to start looking
at as a part of making that process
really easy
obviously all data sets are not going to
be as simple as just a sequel database
so we'll talk about the more complicated
ones in a little bit but we want to make
those obviously just as easy if we can -
cool so I think that's it for those two
demos so so great so we've got some
we've got some sequel views we've got
let's let's say that they're sequel we
might have some more complicated stuff
like OData API s we might have really
complicated api's that have custom
pagination or you have to do a special
request to or something like that and
that's where things start getting a
little bit more interesting but let's
assume that we've provided those
datasets to users the next step from
there is how do we get people to
deduplicate on the power bi reports
themselves instead of all coming up with
their own power bi reports which is
almost the same problem that we were in
in the past how do we reuse stuff and as
of about I think it's about a week ago
live connections went to general
availability which is this idea that you
can connect power bi desktop to a data
set that someone else has already
published to power bi without coming up
with your own over again it'll just
connect straight to the one that's
already there which is super useful to
look at but again if we're talking about
complex data sets really complicated
api's or whatever it might be that
that's still not super useful and that's
where data connectors come in so data
connectors are basically a really simple
way using the using a sdk for visual
studio to build your own connectors into
power bi so you can do a connector for
any data set
and what we've started doing in a lot of
cases is coming up with connectors which
wrap all of the complex stuff so wrap up
authentication so that your business
user doesn't have to know if it's off or
if it's or if it's some other
authentication mechanism wrap up that
stuff wrap up the details of the data
itself so provide I guess like a simple
view over the top of an API that they
can just do that exploration with and
play around with and then publish that
as a connector so I'll show you what
that looks like so first step is
grabbing the power query SDK and
probably can't read that link but again
I'll tweet it afterwards the second step
in power bi desktop is to enable that as
an experimental feature so assuming that
I'm still on duplicate good so if you
come in here under options and settings
under options and preview features
you'll see a whole bunch of stuff if you
can't read that that's okay
you'll see a whole bunch of stuff
underneath there which which are custom
features custom experimental features
power bi Scott all of them are actually
really really useful apart from one of
them that I've gotten ticked so it's
worth going in there and having a bit of
a play around if you haven't checked
those out before but one of the main
ones there is custom data connectors so
if we tick that then we can load those
up but I'll show you what one actually
looks like in Visual Studio first so one
of these files is basically or one of
these projects they're pretty simple you
have PQ files and a PQ file is it's
actually M code I don't know if anyone's
played much around with M before but I'm
a fairly fairly simple language that's
used a lot when describing how to work
with data can override back kind of see
that it's still a bit small yeah cool
hopefully that's all right
so what this will describe is a couple
of things about the connector you want
to build so in this case I've said grab
a client ID from from a text file that's
part of the solution grab
secret these are both both parameters
not actually going to bring up the files
of my client ID and secret because I've
learned from all the people who've been
trolled at this conference so far when
they've done that but you basically keep
those in text files along with the
solution or you can go get them from
anywhere else that you need to so um so
encrypt them in with a file system or
however you typically store your
credentials so after that will describe
methods that were interested in in this
case we have one main method which which
you just define by setting the name of
the custom connector equal to a thing
and that thing in this case is hey we're
using OAuth here's the method that you
call when someone wants to authenticate
here's the method that you call when
someone's finished authenticating and
here's some I guess text to help
describe exactly what it is that you
want from users and again you kind of
see why that's so useful when I load up
what this connector looks like
underneath that you can define if you
like some icons and some UI stuff for it
probably not too important to cover but
again it's kind of nice and then the
really interesting part is the actual
methods that you define themselves in
this case we've said go talk to the
github API get the contents of a URL
that we give it get that as jason and
then convert that to a table so instead
of instead of users connecting to an API
I'm getting back a blob of JSON that
makes no sense we've now presented that
in that same Excel view that that had
that sequel database we're looking at
which is really easy for people to work
with in the github case the API has
pagination so each API call that comes
back will have a link to the next page
of data that you could look at and again
that's that's kind of a pain if
non-technical users are trying to build
reports and and try to understand how to
do the pagination we don't want that so
we've got a method here that looks for
that link looks for what page that we're
on right now and fetches any data that
doesn't have so it wraps up all that
complexity so that as a business
stakeholder you don't have to deal with
it which is pretty cool so that's what
that looks like if I build this connect
and open that up in file explorer be
under bent apart because I'm building a
debug so that all build a DES file and a
dot mez file is just that self-contained
data connector so the story for actually
deploying these on to users machines is
not brilliant at the moment you
basically have to copy them into a
folder under my documents that sits on
everyone's computers Microsoft are
working on putting copies of them up in
the store so that people can just go and
point-and-click to download them but I
guess if you really wanted to simplify
that you could like write a script to
help users keep them up to date and the
right folders or something like that for
the sake of this demo I'm just going to
grab that copy that into the right
folder so under documents Microsoft
power bi desktop custom connectors
probably the only part of this that's
that's not quite there yet so again I'll
I'll tweet that out afterwards so I've
added that in you have to restart power
bi after you've done that so that it
picks up any of the new connectors that
have come up as part of this now the
github example I think they've actually
added a real github connector now so
it's not quite as cool of a demo but you
can kind of get the idea at least from
from what this is trying to do so if I
go in here and I do the same thing I did
before get data but this time I search
for github gatherers there's a beta
github one and I click on my github MVC
sample see it straightaway pops up with
a box and in this case it's just asking
me for for a URL I'm probably not going
to mean a lot to most people but you can
customize all of this so I can customize
this box and say please enter the
specific github API URL that that
contains all the data that you're
interested in if it's always the same or
if it's or if it's yeah if it's always
the same you can just obviously put it
in as a part of the connector or you can
give them some way of exploring the API
in coming up with this in our case I'm
going to
grab this one I did earlier so this is
just the list of all users repositories
on github just add just one of their
standard JSON api's so I'll plug that in
and click OK and because I've done this
before it's already authenticated me but
I'll actually go clear everything so
that you can see what this is supposed
to look like it all uses to do all that
so off it all uses Internet Explorer's
engine let me clear all that cancel that
under your under your recent sources we
should be able to see that sorry under
edit queries you can see all the like
previous authentications that you've
done I'm just going to clear out that
one that I did earlier and do that again
so get data RBI in DC sample sorry that
API URL again and this time you can see
that it's asked us what's given us ok
cool you want to connect that API you
aren't signed in typically if you just
do a normal power bi connector that's
out of the box user then has to specify
how they're going to authenticate to
that whereas in this case we've wrapped
up all the details of client secret and
ID and all of that inside the connector
so all we have to do is click sign-in
so that might take a second but that's
basically going to pull up just a
browser window inside power bi just
going to ask us for our for our github
credentials and that will go away and go
through a normal Olaf floor it'll ask me
hey power bi wants to access your
account you're happy with it giving
happy with it understanding what
repositories that you have access to and
assuming that we're all good with that
which hopefully we are that will then
redirect us back to power bi with the
authentication all dealt with so that's
again pretty powerful in just another
way that we can reduce that friction and
and let users start to explore some of
this data themselves
cool so if I connect to that that will
go to the API with our authenticated
token and come back with the data set
now
the github API by default comes back
with a bunch of these record objects
which I'll show you what they look like
so record objects are basically anything
that's a complex object that you can't
just show in a single field so so you'd
expand them out one of the things that
if we were to take this connector a bit
further we could do and another really
powerful thing is describe how to expand
out these these sub objects within an
API so that a user doesn't have to go in
and do this themselves but in our case
we can expand out that column we can see
underneath here we've got a whole lot of
fields like ID name URL etc so we've got
all of our github data and you can see
under there all of the repositories that
that I'm a part of or that I fought
which is getting to be a pretty long
list and underneath there there's
underneath some of these other columns
we've got more record fields so for
example if I expand out this owner field
I can also get a whole lot of sub
information on on the owner of each
repository so again we've taken a data
source that normally you wouldn't just
be able to go explore in Excel and power
bi and wrapped up all the complexity and
and put it out there so it's pretty cool
so I'll close that again I could do the
same thing that I did previously and
start getting more insights into that
and exploring it I don't think we need
to cool so that's that and then the last
point to talk about in terms of
providing that data out to users is this
idea of pre-processing it so your data
might not still make sense to use as if
you don't do something to it first so
there's a bunch of services in Asia
where you can pre-process data you've
obviously got things like machine
learning things like a stream analytics
you've got you've got sequel server
analysis services if you want so you've
got all these steps that if you want you
can apply to data from the apps that
you're building before you provide that
out to you
is useful if your if your datasets are
really really complicated and you need
to simplify them a little bit first or
you want to wrap them up and and and do
analysis on them beforehand so another
thing that's kind of useful to think
about I guess when you're when you're in
your app dev process so I don't want to
spend too much time actually building a
report given that I suspect a lot of you
have done that already before but we
will go back to we'll go back to that
adventureworks example and we'll just
talk about what are some of the things
that we want to make sure people
actually do when they're building
reports to make sure that they're
sustainable and useful for the whole
organization so I'll load up that data
set again now some of the things to
think about when you're teaching people
how to actually do these reports is that
bi dashboards are not and not as useful
if they're just radiating simple
information that you could go find
elsewhere ideally what you want to do
with them is come up with information
that lets you make decisions so make
sure that all of the reports that you
come up with actionable in some way we
try to make sure that all the reports we
come up with are debuggable so if two
people have both built a different
version of a report and they complain
they're different what capacity we're
giving them to actually drill down into
those reports and and understand why
they're different so there's a couple of
things to think about and when your
users are just starting to learn how to
do some of this that obviously might not
be front of mine so let's take that same
example that I did before so we'll take
an employee's country we'll size that up
by some unique field about them so oops
we'll make that a bit bigger so we can
actually see it hopefully you can still
see it up at the back so we've come up
with we've come up with this now if we
want to try and make this debuggable so
that we can understand exactly why
things look like they do a really easy
way to do that is just to add a table so
we can add a table underneath the report
we can put in that table the country the
email address we can put in a whole heap
more information a first name last name
and that already adds some interactivity
to this rather than just a rather than
just a simple visualization we can now
do some cool stuff with it so if I'm
interested in let's say let's say I'm
interested in Aimee Albert's from the US
I'm like okay well what what can we kind
of find out about then if I click into
that that actually drills directly down
into that users record and looks at
things like okay well where are they
from exactly and we can start getting
some some more interesting insights into
it just through making it a little bit
interactive we can add let's add like a
filter on the side so let's say that we
are really interested in filtering just
users that are in a certain certain
province
you
anja then and we zoom this out a bit
then again we can kind of filter this to
something that's a little bit more
useful but the idea is now that we've
just made those two simple changes all
of a sudden this is debuggable if I'm
questioning why there's so many uses in
the US we don't have that many employees
in the US hopefully I'm not questioning
that then we can actually go in and look
at the table and understand why that is
so just some kind of extra things to
think about is trying to make reports
both debuggable
and trying to make them so that they're
so they're interactive or you can get
some kind of useful insights out of them
cool so that's it for that and then the
last thing that I want to talk about is
how we can how we can start distributing
these reports and production izing them
and getting them into a good State yes
we've we've let our subject matter
experts go away and come up with
whatever they've needed to as a part of
our app development but now we want to
actually make sure that these are useful
long term and not just not just waste
away once they stop being maintained so
three ways to share reports in power bi
and there's also a couple of ways to
embed reports as a part of your
application so I'll talk about those two
separate things
after this but let's start with sharing
reports so the simplest way is just
literally to type in someone's email
address and click the share button
probably don't need to demo that but
that's that's the quickest and easiest
way to get a report out there but it
sort of also fraught with a lot of
problems if someone publishes a report
shares it out with other users and then
they leave the organization or they stop
caring about the report but that's
become pretty critical to a business's
process then then all of a sudden that's
sort of dangling there and not very
useful anymore so the way that we get
around that or we have gotten around
that for the last for the last year or
so is something called organizational
content packs has anyone used those
before cool so an organizational content
pack is basically a collection of
reports and dashboards that you want to
publish out to the rest of an
organization and you can go in as anyone
in a company with access to those and
subscribe to them and just see all those
dashboards yourselves on you
on your own power bi service online so
they're just a really simple way of
sharing them as a pack rather than
sharing them from an individual and that
that already gets us a little bit
further in that we can start to deal
with better maintenance around them but
organizational content packs present a
few issues as well that that we've come
across one of those is that if you share
a content pack with with your users it's
hard to distinguish between what reports
came from the content pack and what
reports you've just come up with
yourself it's it's all just sort of one
big list so if I actually show you in
here
so you can see under my workspace maybe
you can see basically I've got a whole
lot of dashboards underneath there about
half of those they're actually from a
Content pack but it's really hard to
figure out which ones are those and
which ones are ones that have come
elsewhere so something that Microsoft
have done is come up with concept of
apps so power bi apps different to power
apps which which is super confusing but
power apps are our totally different
area of azure where you can go and build
applications without doing much
development power bi apps are actually
just an evolution of content packs so
what Microsoft did with power bi apps is
try to solve some of those problems that
I just described so we'll try and make
one so to make a power bi app I need to
make a separate workspace I need to
actually make a dedicated space for
whatever reports I'm dealing with to
liggett to live in so we'll just call
this one NBC I can unlike organizational
content packs I can actually share these
with with security groups and and
subsets of azure ad rather than just
sharing with individual email addresses
so the security story is a little bit
better but in this case let's just say
that I want to share them with anyone
who's a part of my organization and that
will give us a dedicated workspace to
deal with so if I go back to my
to my fancy adventureworks report here
and I published that then I can actually
publish that straight into that
workspace and we can make a power bi app
out of it in to make it really easy to
distribute so I've got a few workspaces
in DC cool so that will go away and just
publish it you might be kind of thinking
at this point how about automation and
I'll talk about that a little bit in a
second but let's say for the sake of
this that that our process for releasing
our reports is just to publish them out
via an app and we're happy to do that
manually so that's published if I go
back into my into my workspace that I've
set up specifically for this app and i
refresh it then i should see our report
as a part of that so under reports cool
I've got this test report and it should
have all of that all of that
adventureworks data and one of the
reasons this works is that I did import
so it's actually copied that data into
the report and then published it if I
did direct query I would need power bi
to be able to talk to my laptop which is
sitting here which wouldn't work so
that's that's all published that works
all of our filters work it's pre
selected the last filter which I had
ticked which is not that useful but
there you go we might say we want to pin
this to a dashboard so obviously ideally
we'd have a few different reports and in
those all into a single dashboard to
give us some shared view but in this
case we've just got our single report
into a dashboard within that workspace
so that's pretty useful now if we want
to share that out with people we can go
into that workspace
and we can do this we can click this
button on the top right which if you
can't really see it that well up the
back is basically just says publish app
we can say this application this reform
it's from NDC whatever some useful
description that people can get to we
can say that the landing page is some
specific thing within the reports so
useful to set up a default view - for
people when they're looking at this in
this case we've only got one report so
it doesn't really matter and again we
can set access to specific individuals
or office 365 groups or we can just
share it with the entire organization so
that's done that gives me a link that I
can go share with people and then I can
give that to anyone who's interested in
those reports they can just go install
that and it will actually show up which
you can see on the left there before
everything redirected as a separate app
as a separate app within everyone's
working environment so it's totally
separate so that's kind of cool and then
you get a nice big heading saying this
report is from the NBC app so they've
sorted out a few of those problems that
we used to have before so that's it for
apps
yeah if anyone's got questions on those
obviously happy to happy to chat about
those afterwards so we've sort of seen
from that okay there's a whole heap of
different ways to share things
there's beyond just those three there's
you can you can do anything with these
you can copy them up to network shares
and just get people to look at them in
power bi desktop if you really have to
you there's actually a power bi server
that you can install on premise if
you're not allowed to have any data
leave your leave your premise and you're
not allowed to use the cloud component
of that again if you have to that's
another useful option you can put them
into sequel server reporting services so
publish the reports into that and share
them with as a part of your reporting
services which if everyone is already
going to one place to look at reports
that's another good option obviously the
power bi service is a lot better in a
lot of ways so nice to migrate away from
reporting services as you can but
another cool thing to to think
about that's kind of useful but for us
specifically we're really interested in
okay we've avoided writing these reports
as a part of our active but our users
still say that they want the reports
within the app they don't want to go off
to another place to have to go look at
them and that's where power bi embedded
comes in now power bi embedded really
similar and that you've come up with you
come up with these reports you publish
them into ideally a dedicated workspace
but then you can actually call an API to
get an embed URL for that report that
you can then put straight into your
application and you can do things like
get a different in bed URL for for all
of your different users so that you're
not just using one publicly accessible
URL but you can call this API getting
embed URL and put those reports straight
into your applications that's that's a
really useful thing to to look at again
it's still going to they're still going
to look like power bi reports you don't
have huge amounts of flexibility in
terms of customizing exactly what they
are but if you can get away with that
trade-off you then avoid needing to do
all this stuff yourself so kind of
another useful thing to know about and
think about cool
so two more things the second last thing
is automation so I mentioned this
briefly the automation story around
power bi at the moment is is still not
that strong I don't think in that you
still in a lot of cases need to click
buttons and do things in the portal to
get things done but fortunately some of
this can be automated there's an API
that will take AP bi X file which is the
files generated by that desktop
application we're looking at and publish
those into a workspace you can get to it
by PowerShell you can there's actually a
REST API that will take the P bi X file
as a form post and so that's a start we
can start to build out SDI pipeline our
dev tests and our pradhans of those
reports in our different workspaces and
then fortunately all our users need to
go do is click into those workspaces and
click publish out from there so at least
we've solved some of that pain but
hopefully as they add more api's we can
automate more and more of this and make
that experience a bit nicer from that
point forward
and the very last thing to talk about is
is I guess our final production izing
our checklist of things to think about
so the first is have we made dashboards
for all of the groupings of reports that
make sense
usually dashboards are useful as a
perspective that a group of users might
have you might have a dashboard for your
sales team who are just interested in
all of the reports related to sales
dashboard for your people team for all
the reports and they're related to
people so coming up with views that are
useful and relevant to people that don't
crowd them with too much other
information something that you can do if
you have had to use import type reports
for whatever reason make sure that
you've set up refresh schedules for
those and ideally communicated on the
report what those refresh schedules are
so add some text inside the report
saying this is only up to - updated
every 24 hours or something like that
just so that everyone in your
organization knows exactly how
up-to-date all the data is and again
they're not kind of clashing over
different views of data think about your
authorization have you got have you got
authorization embedded as needed as a
part of data connectors as we discussed
or have you thought about something else
that needs to happen have you created a
Content pack or an app and made sure
that any of the custom reports people
have built are actually wrapped up in
those and distributed properly have you
set up QA featured questions we didn't
really talk about QA a huge amount but
it's a it's this box here that shows up
above all of your reports so you can
this this particular report probably
won't work terribly well for but if I go
into let's say
if I go into this sample dashboard this
is another one of the data sets that you
can just grab off the power bi site this
one's the human resources sample and you
can see if I click into this I get a
whole lot of Q&amp;amp;A questions that it just
automatically suggests so the first one
is count of new hires so you can
actually just type in queries as natural
language queries and users can kind of
conduct analysis that way in this
particular case that's not working very
well let's try employee count it's a
fairly simple one but again that's just
that's just a way that if you haven't
built a specific report but you've
published a really cool comprehensive
data set people can just go in and play
around and do natural language queries
on it so something that you can do and
which you saw in that example there is
set up a whole lot of a whole lot of
examples of natural language queries
that users might want to do it's pretty
good at figuring out possibilities and
exploring those and giving you options
but if there's queries that wouldn't be
wouldn't be I guess intuitive to machine
learning that that you know about
particularly where aliases of things
come in or you've got crazy acronyms for
different terms you can put it in
suggested queries there which is kind of
nice
so that's something that's good to think
about you can customize colors you can
customize some parts within it so if you
are working with a marketing team that
likes to keep things particular on a
certain brand you can at least go some
way towards that so going through and
making sure what you've published fits
fits as much the criteria as possible
there check if you've added any new data
sets that you've come up with to your
data catalog as we talked about to make
sure that other people can leverage them
and lastly you have got some abilities
especially if you're using gateway
connectors for those of you have come
across those to look at usage statistics
so kind of important I guess to look
through our reports fairly regularly and
check are they actually being used are
they just confusing people and just sort
of getting left off to the side in which
case we might want to tweak them so and
I guess another sort of useful checklist
to think about
and that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
