I've been I'll get into sort of what
I've been doing over the last sort of 18
months pretty soon I let a few people
grab a seat but uh what I want to talk
to you today about is something that I
haven't seen too many talks on we often
always see the talks at conferences
about a certain technology and why this
technology is awesome and the reasons
you should adopt it but very seldom do I
see anyone talking about what are the
impacts when we choose one of these
technologies how does it affect our team
the motivation our ability to hire a
bunch of these other things around the
technology my name's Jake you can hit me
up on Twitter
that's my github and I work for a media
company in Australia called seven West
media so they've got a channel 7 which
is a owns a lot of shows like Home &amp;amp;
Away and a bunch of others quite a large
news station and specifically I work in
the newspaper company of the group which
is W a news so W a news release the
first newspaper and W a and 1833 I was
about four years after Perth in
Australia where I'm from was actually
named a little bit of interesting
history as my great-great great-granddad
was the first colonial secretary so he's
got quite a few notices on this first
edition of the Perth Gazette quite a few
years later that got that paper gotten
renamed to the West Australian newspaper
which is the name of the newspaper today
our team was built in a very short
amount of time so previous to when my
team was created about 18 months ago
the West Australian had actually out
sourced their entire digital strategy so
just a crappy little website through to
a partnership with Yahoo where Yahoo
actually was providing the entire news
platform for WI news our team was
created to bring all of that in-house
and actually take control of the digital
future of this company what I'm gonna
chat you about is a bunch of the
technologies and decisions that we've
taken along the last 18 months and the
way that's actually affected our team
and various other soft sort of edges
around technology so we decided that
we'd build this team and co-located on
the news room floor so this little area
here is where our team are set up we've
got about 20 to 25 people including
product managers designers developers
and such and then where all those TVs
are that's called the super desk so
that's where they actually put the
newspaper together they work to a 5:00
p.m. deadline every day and the cadence
is daily because all the journals come
in and they've got to build a newspaper
from scratch every day that's provided
some really interesting challenges
because this whole organization is built
throughout this newsroom and building
this newspaper every day so our team
when we're building it up had a couple
of goals first to create this new
digital platform so new website and also
sort of mobile apps want it to be
responsive to supplement the existing
newspaper because print media while it's
still a very strong industry obviously
digital is becoming huge people spend so
much time on their phones and unless
you're playing in that space it's just
not gonna work as a company so the main
decisions that I want to cover today
what did we actually build the website
on the choice of CMS and kind of our the
entire tech stack we could have gone
with pre-made products and customized
them build it from scratch those sort of
things we also chose to put a design
system in place and I'm gonna talk a
little bit about what a design system is
and why you might want to consider using
them when we built the mobile app we
started building it in native code just
native Swift and then ended up switching
it over to react native a bit later why
did we do that what was some of the side
effects of that we also switched from
SAS in our initial product launch which
was the West later on we relaunched
Perth now which is another new site we
actually switched over styling
approaches had some really interesting
side effects that I didn't really see
coming and finally one of our current
sort of endeavors is to move towards
continuous deployment we kind of were
aligning trying to achieve continuous
delivery and that was working reasonably
well for us but we want to try and push
a little bit further so there's a heap
of Technology choices and concepts that
I'm going to cover but then get into all
of the sort of reasoning behind it and
the impact around the team if anyone has
any questions as I go feel free to throw
your hand up and we can answer them as
we go so the first thing we wanted to do
is really build our core team values
what what are we going to anchor all of
our decisions around and I highly
recommend actually sort of building a
team Charter or deciding what your team
values are because it impacts all of the
decisions you're going to be making and
you often don't realize how many
decisions are being made I called out
some really big and obvious ones for our
team but there's so many decisions you
make and often many non decisions that
you didn't even consider as really a
decision so we wanted to build our team
around the community
perth has a really good meetup community
that is supportive we've got a bunch of
really cool local conferences which is
surprising in such a small city we
wanted to build cross-functional teams
we didn't really want to segregate by a
sort of back-end and front-end we wanted
to have an adaptable team because
because of the cadence of the business
they're thinking maybe 24 hours in
advance this is very different to many
of the other companies I've worked in so
my background previously was working for
a consulting company called ratify and
they're mainly a.net consulting company
so go in and help different companies
out most companies have a larger cadence
they're working to a 6 12 18 months
2-year plan so most of the time you
you're able to work in these sort of you
don't have to worry about the business
thinking too quickly and changing their
mind all the time
but because of that really fast cadence
of the newspaper we needed the team to
be really adaptable to be able to just
could handle all these curve balls that
are throwing to us the whole time we
wanted to give autonomy over decision so
joining wi News was really interesting
coming from consulting because often
we're trying to encourage the executives
to say give your team autonomy let them
make their own decisions give them the
power to help you succeed we got given
that so we were allowed to choose
whatever technologies we wanted and our
mandate was pretty much to succeed just
get this site relaunched and there are a
number of commercial timings which
everyone hates fixed deadlines but these
were kind of the realities of us joining
the team the business needed to get some
stuff done at it in a certain time so to
do that we needed to be able to make the
decisions and not be impeded by sort of
the executive staff say no you can't
choose this technology
because of no valid reason and then the
main one is don't impact the existing
newsroom late until we actually have a
digital strategy in place the paper is
going to continue being a core part of
this business we need to support the
journals and allow them to sort of take
their craft and bring it online so they
were kind of our main team values that
we wanted to sort of anchor all of our
decisions around so as I said we had a
deadline our team was kind of started to
be built with about six months or so
from when the product had to be
relaunched so that's all of the back end
the front end the tools that the
journals will actually use to curate
content to put it on the front page and
if anyone has built a team before you
should know that it's it's actually a
really difficult proposition to build a
team from scratch you've got to find
people interview them and there's also a
huge risk when you pull a whole lot of
people together you can end up with
awful team culture people don't work
together they're not aligned in their
values and there's a lot of other
problems that can come up so we had to
build a team really quickly I came on
probably about halfway through this
process with about three and a half
months before having to launch the
website at that point had most of the
team and the lake probably had been
working for about two to three weeks on
actually writing code for this platform
the things that new site actually needs
to run is the journals have to be able
to create the content obviously that's
going to go on the page then nearly
every new site is manually curated so
the stuff you see on the front page is
actually curated by journals it's not
just the latest news coming in
the journalists are actually looking at
what's the most relevant choosing and
manually curating that page to make sure
that there's not you don't want to leave
it to chance that these two news stories
that might if you read them next to each
other those two headlines kind of can
play off against each other in really
bad ways these are things that the
journals are constantly thinking about
so they have to curate the content on
the main sort of home page and then
finally we have to actually render the
site and you people have to visit the
site and read it and all of those sort
of things our companies also based it's
an advertising based company so like
most news sites all of the company's
revenue comes from advertising so we
needed to keep that in mind
the journalists actually use a product
from a company in Europe called CCI and
they use a product called news gate so
this is the tool that all the Jarosz
build all their stories up and actually
put the newspaper together so we decided
that we would use node and react and we
would let them author the content in
this existing news platform and then we
would allow them to publish it onto our
website so big we didn't want to choose
one of the sort of main existing CMS's
because most of those come with their
own content curation page management a
whole bunch of concepts that we didn't
want to have to put onto our journals
remember team values in terms of like
what what we want to anchor our
decisions around we didn't want to
impact the existing business so all of
these would have been quite disruptive
to the existing business so we decided
let's go bespoke and build this platform
from 10 platforms from scratch but we
don't need to rebuild the content
authoring because we have news gate so
there are a few real things that I
haven't touched on that fed into this
decision that I found quite interesting
by the time I joined
the decision to build on reactor News
node was already made and that was one
of the reasons I joined I was really
really interested in that technology and
I wanted to use it day to day being a
consultant you just have to use whatever
you clients are using and I really
wanted to get better at react and do
that full-time so this was a really
interesting opportunity for me I got to
use react full-time I had power over the
decisions that were being made was the
first time that I'd moved into a
management position so my role there is
actually the development manager so I am
responsible for the development team and
and their sort of happiness so love the
comp the idea and the opportunities we
get to actually rebuild a new stack from
scratch
being so late to the game you can have a
look at all of these companies around
the world see what they've done and take
all like use all of their failures and
kind of learn from it which is really
exciting so the first thing I talked
about as we wanted to build our team out
of the community and that's what we did
but one of the problems with building a
team out of the community is people have
really cool jobs already so this is one
of the main reasons we went with react
it's not so much that technology was
great and that we really believed in it
is that a Perth is quite strongly
aligned to dotnet and because of that
the main JavaScript framework is angular
those are heap a really strong and
interesting angular projects across
Perth but there was next to no projects
on react so by choosing react as our
technology we had a huge draw card for
people who were interested in the
technology and they wanted to throw
themselves at it as one of the main
reasons that I moved so that allowed us
to really get a couple of cool and
interesting people from the community
that was super motivated and that helped
us build this team really rapidly
so yeah angular was very popular we
ended up going with react
because it's different and we thought
that the like the technology was really
promising and that it would help us
achieve what we wanted to achieve also
because we had the opportunity to look
at all these other companies I had been
looking at what the New York Times had
been doing even before I got into media
because they'd been building their
bespoke news platform out and rebuilt it
a couple of times and around this time
that just started rebuilding their
entire news platform on react as well
they're also really strongly aligned
with the community that a github
organization up and they were releasing
the like bits of their internal tools
and the way they were solving problems
so having such a large and reputable
news company going down this road was a
really good signal for us so what were
some of the main learnings I took out of
this because there were so many roads
that we could have taken and we ended up
going down a particular path
the first one is ad tech and analytics
does not work very well with single page
applications who here uses an ad blocker
out of interest yeah so if you don't you
realize how awful advertising technology
is going from line of business
applications this is the first time I've
actually really touched ad Tech and also
I used an ad blocker as well so I never
saw most of it it's been really
interesting actually having to integrate
with all of these analytics pet like
frameworks and whatnot most of them we
had to do a bunch of hacks around
especially some of the analytics and
sort of industry measurement tools that
are out there that you have to you have
to use on your site otherwise you just
don't end up in these different rating
programs that directly affect how much
money you get paid for putting
advertising on your site we had a huge
amount of problems integrating all over
this ad tech
because it was built four times when you
just had simple server request/response
not single page applications so ads they
pop out
you can't constrain them to their little
iframes because they do all this silly
stuff they want to be able to track
users and do all of that sort of stuff
so originally locked it down and tried
to really restrict the some kind of
analytics and really respect our users
we're still very strong on that and want
to continue pushing into that area but
the technology really impede at us
there's some good signs out there though
because Google is now doing a bunch of
initiatives around advertising tech in
terms of making sure that if your site
is doing like including bad ads that
give a poor user experience they'll
actually start ranking you down which is
kind of cool because the users are
finally starting to be put back in the
forefront react has been a really good
choice for us just in terms of the
technology has been really good fun to
use but it's continued to attract people
to our team we've had a few people drop
in from overseas they were sort of going
to be in Perth for six to nine months
they could join our team
give us a heap of contributions and then
head home it's been really good having
like just being able to use react in
this way I didn't realize how much a
technology can impact the type of people
you get and the their level of interest
is enthusiasm because we did a
single-page application we had to
resolve many problems so with analytics
we want to be able to sort of include
like the length of an article what the
author is all of these sort of things
which if you're using traditional
request response style pages that's
super easy they all of the Dom events
exist do all of that stuff with single
page applications you have to kind of
reinvent
Paige lifecycles you have problems
around scroll restoration
luckily new modern browsers have specs
for that so it's all solved but in IE
and and whatnot you have to sort of
manually manipulate scroll the scroll
depth of the page when you're navigating
between like jump back up to the top and
all of those sort of things it's a
little bit of a pain something has been
really cool as previously coming from a
dotnet background would have dotnet on
the server using MVC or one of these
sort of server-side technologies and
then we'd have JavaScript on the client
that had a bunch of issues like where do
we store our validation logic do we put
it in the front end do we put it in back
end most of the time the correct answer
is put it in both having JavaScript
everywhere both on the client and the
server has meant that our team we could
actually achieve the cross-functional
aspect of our team much better than if
we had two different technologies
because we can cycle people around we're
lucky that we have a team of people who
actually really like learning and like
trying out all of these different areas
and we've removed programming language
as a barrier there so that's been
something that was has been a really
good boon for us that leads me to the
next decision I'm gonna kind of leave
that the first CMS choice behind which
was probably the largest decision it
underpins everything a much smaller and
subtle one is having introducing the
concept of a design system who's heard
of this not too many people so the idea
of a design system over just a component
library is you can bring your patterns
your fonts the way you solve problems in
terms of user experience putting all of
those together so one of the best design
systems I've seen is from Salesforce
they actually publish it online you can
go and view it
that microsoft also has recently rebuilt
outlook comm and they've re-released
their component library in their design
system so design system is kind of a
superset of your component library it
and the focus of it is to capture kind
of the way your team and your business
solve particular user experience
problems so we have a standard way of by
all of our font sizes we have a standard
way of doing form inputs we have a
standard way of spacing out all of our
different components so we have a nice
vertical rhythm across all of our pages
the decision was made very early that we
would try and build a design system and
try and capture all of that sort of
greater than a component library
information so there's a few different
goals this is the side that I had
previously been using sort of build a
component library a bunch of reusable
components to help us move faster the
goals around the component library is
reusability you want a component to be
reusable in a bunch of different
contexts
you kind of want styling to be included
by default so if you're in react or even
angular and you've kind of got a
bootstrap and material UI as these kind
of component libraries that you can pull
in that give you a bunch of styled
components by default kind of get you
running and a component library is
mainly built for the developers in your
team if you go across to the design
language it's photo
focus is a lot more about on the
business and the greater impact of the
team so focus on your domain-specific
language don't use terms for the
development team use terms for the
entire business components in the design
system don't have to be reusable that
was kind of a really interesting point
for me in one of our products perth now
we have a number of different headers up
the top each area
is like we have news sport entertainment
each of those has a certain color
associated with it that that color is
reflected in that entire sort of
subsection of the site before this
approach I would imagine that those sort
of colors would exist in the product
because that kind of makes sense to me
no other product would be reusing those
colors because it's so specific instead
with the design system all of that is
moved into our design system is
documented so when you go into it
you can see blue is the news color and
this is the way we use that blue across
all of the different areas of the site
it has a huge focus on underlying
consistency across everything so in a
component library you kind of focus on
the reusable nature of that component
design system will focus on okay how do
you use typography in each of these
components so these two different
components and doing very different
things
use typography in the same way this sort
of leads it to be a much more focus on
the business and the needs of the
greater team so the designers the
product managers they all use the design
system in their decision-making one of
the side effects has been really
interesting is bringing developers and
designers together because it gives you
a medium that you can actually
collaborate over normally the design
tools are quite different to the
development tools designers sort of live
in sketch in our world and developers
kind of live in inverse code this allows
us to collaborate over the design system
the way I used to build things which I
think I still tend to do is I really
enjoy building things in a product and
then build it again in another product
and this is probably my consultant
experience talking so build it in a
product build it in another product
finally build it in somewhere that's
reusable so like a component
library or an open-source product re
solve the problem for the third time and
then replaced by implementation in the
other products the person that sort of
gave me this idea and I've followed
around is Jimmy Bogart who's also here
he's responsible for audio mapper
but that's the way Auto mapper and
mediator and a bunch of his open-source
projects have been created he solved
that problem over and over at different
clients then finally created a reusable
approach and installed it everywhere so
that's kind of the component library and
the way I used to kind of see building
things the design system thinking has
really changed the way I approach these
problems so it's kind of think about the
problem that I'm trying to solve where
does it fit what other what other
components do we have that solve a
similar problem could we actually solve
it in a way that we is more consistent
with the way we've solved similar
problems across our products if it's a
new problem and it actually deserves a
new solution in the design system then
build the simplest thing that allows you
to solve that problem and then finally
consume it in the products the goals and
impacts of these two different
approaches are really subtle and I've
had a hard time trying to put together
the way to explain this
the other interesting thing is having a
design system does not stop you using
components like reactors are very
component orientated model it doesn't
stop you from being like using this
model this out imagine this outside
dark-blue is a design system component
it's it's something that business knows
about could be like a public article
page or something like that
it's a high-level tangible thing that
the business understand internally will
decompose that into a bunch of reusable
modules and these lower level modules
might be reused across multiple design
system components so it's you've got
this kind of overall
building blocks of ways you solve
problems and then a bunch of little
component library components that feed
in that help you achieve both speed of
development and reusability but also
consistency across products one of the
side effects though and going back to
one of our initial goals was building
cross-functional teams so when you
introduce a component library or any
sort of framework or anything within
your team it introduces friction because
something has to be built in that and
then consumed in the product and there's
this constant temptation to go well why
don't we just write stories which are
build X product in X component in the
component library or the design system
then another story and I'm talking about
sort of scrum at JA level stories here
user stories another story which is
consume it in the product that then gets
taken one step further which is okay why
don't we just create the component team
and then a product team and they can
just solve each of these problems that
creates a huge divide in your team and
it was something that we wanted to
actively strive against because we
wanted to build cross-functional teams
so we we've worked pretty hard to make
sure that we keep the cross-functional
team and stopped that divide happening
but it's something that just naturally
occurs as soon as you have separation of
code bases and building something
somewhere else and then consuming it you
just have that natural temptation to try
and separate those two problems it's
been quite interesting side effect this
causes a little bit of friction because
we tend to build a component we then
have to put up a pull request because
we're using get it we can then publish a
pre-release version of that component
library then consume it in a product
then realize we've got problems and go
through that you can link things up
locally to make it a little bit easier
but separating those two things
doesn't reduce workflow issues that is
another thing we've had to work pretty
hard to make sure the developer
experience is not impacted due to this
decision so what are the learnings from
this one make sure that you've got a
shared understanding of the goals of a
decision when we introduced the composer
idea of a design system we brought new
people onto the team and didn't really
explain why the design system was there
this led to a number of
misunderstandings when I started just
not understanding the reason for a
design system so my tendency to go build
stuff in a product and not put it in the
reusable spot because it's not reusable
it felt very unnatural for me so now try
and make sure that everyone has a really
good shared understanding of the reason
we're doing some things these decisions
are not made just because we actually
have a reason for trying to do some of
these things I have a much greater
appreciation for front-end development
before I would just kind of grab
bootstrap or something I'll kind of come
back to the designs side of things and
didn't really have a great appreciation
for how difficult building a entire site
is with consistent design without one of
these CSS frameworks it requires its own
thinking and architecture and modeling
and that sort of thing so that's where
the design system has come in it's
actually given us that framework to do
sort of front-end level architecture as
well as we have the whole system's
architecture as well very different
problem that's been really interesting
for me
also a number of times we just built
something in the product and didn't
actually plan it out one of the side
effects I found really interesting is
the times that we've hit a new problem
properly planned it out documented the
way it would work in business
terminology and then solve the technical
problems we've ended
with a much better result sometimes like
advertising our team had very little
experience in advertising so we just
built it in the product and kind of
experimented which is cool like it's a
great way to learn but six months 12
months down the track realized we've got
some fundamental sort of issues in the
way we've implemented it which is
slowing us down we've invested in good
testing tools in our component library
in our design system so one of the best
things I was showing a few of the people
in my workshop yesterday was visual
regression testing so if you've got any
sort of component library highly
recommend looking into visual regression
testing we have all of our react
components and in a test we can just say
I want a fish I want a visual snapshot
of this has anyone used snapshot testing
before heard of it so the idea of
snapshot testing is rather than in your
tests doing an assertion which is expect
some value to be another value you just
say expect whatever it's an object it's
an image to match this snapshot that
will write that result to disk and you
check it in as part of your get commit
then someone else checks out that code
when the test runs it checks the value
of being passed with the value that's
been saved to disk so it's like a gold
copy of what the expected result is the
cool thing is about that is it captures
additional things that have been added
as well as just the things you're
asserting so take away from this talk is
in terms of practical things rather than
just things to consider have a look at
snapshot testing it's changed the way I
do testing so we did visual regression
testing which allows us to do a snapshot
visually of a component so we render it
in Chrome and take a screenshot that
image gets dropped onto disk so if a
component changes we get an image which
is the old image stitch to the new image
and then a deer
image/tiff sort highlights all of the
differences in purple that's been
amazing especially when we've got a
component that is composed of 30 40
other little components we can see when
there's bad interactions visually been
such a good investment document
decisions I can't stress this one enough
we had made so many decisions as we went
early in the team and would just do a
little huddle and then yep cool that's
good and then go it would have been so
valuable if we just wrote those down in
a decision log highly recommend creating
a decision log and every time you have
one of these discussions about should we
do it this way or this way only takes
five minutes just document it it's so
useful when new members of the team come
on board and they're like why why is
this done this way highly highly
recommend it because you can you can
revisit any of those conversations but
it is if you don't have sort of the the
history makes it really hard to start
that conversation the next main decision
I wanted to talk about was our
introduction of react native to our
mobile app I'm not going to spend too
long on this one but there was a few
outcomes that were super interesting so
after the West was launched we had a
really short runway we needed we wanted
to launch the mobile app for the West we
had a single mobile developer who is
writing the iOS version in Swift we kind
of were thinking about well if we write
an in react native we can have different
members of the team who already know
react they know JavaScript will have a
lot more in common so hopefully we can
improve collaboration and there won't be
the mobile guy off to the side and then
the rest of the development team so
having that sort of divide of the two
technologies kind of didn't make it feel
like a combined development team
so we decided let's give react native
ago in fact we want by I wanted to allow
our mobile developer to make that
decision because at the end of the day
we want autonomy over our decisions and
by imposing a technology choice on
someone that kind of sucks it takes
control of their own sort of job away
from them so they got a bit of time to
experiment with it learn the technology
and then choose to go down that road
which was pretty interesting
once again deadlines kind of hit and we
made the fundamental mistake of let's
throw people at the problem so what
ended up happening is a whole bunch of
the rest of the team came in and kind of
kicked the existing developer off to the
side and kind of it's really hard to
build shared understanding in a really
short space of time so it just made
developer who had built a bunch of stuff
out feel like his work wasn't that much
appreciated so there were some really
interesting learnings just from
personally from for my point of view in
terms of first time I managed a team
could have prevented this could have
done this in a better way but the main
takeaways for the react native choice
for me
was having multiple platforms we decided
to launch Android sort of halfway
through there is no way we would have
been able to build up an Android version
of this app in the time frame without
react native the shared code and
reusability of this platform actually
worked for us I was quite skeptical I've
used xamarin in the past and and it
requires a little bit of fiddling to
actually achieve this but it worked
quite well it's quite surprised just
because there's a common language to
work in doesn't mean everyone in the
team should so while we say we want a
cross-functional team and people to move
around we don't want them just to jump
on to something because
can that caused a lot of friction for us
and also it has a cost
so because it's abstracted away from
native one of the biggest bits of
feedback I've heard about react native
is because you're working at an
abstraction and that whole react native
platform has its own side effects and
idioms and and whatnot sometimes it's
just quicker to build it as as native it
really depends on what your goals are
for us it was the ability to integrate
the mobile develop development sort of
developers in our team with the greater
development team allow code reviews to
happen and a little bit more
collaboration hopefully down the road
bit more code sharing between the main
website and the app and finally mention
this throwing a team at a deadline is
always a bad idea reading like the
mythical man-month and and similar books
we should know that throwing people at a
problem always a terrible idea and Riaan
first reinforce that for me first hand
we ended up launching and it was it was
fine but it severely hurt happiness of
our mobile developer and we could have
done that a lot better what an
interesting thing that I think came out
of it was because in react native all of
your styling is done in JavaScript we
had a number of developers who were not
very interested in visual styling
because it suddenly was in JavaScript it
was still doing styling work but it felt
slightly different so we got a lot more
engagement with around the visual side
of our applications from people who
previously didn't really care about it
so this leads me to our choice to move
to CSS in j/s has anyone heard of this
recently in the web space so it's a
reasonably new idea but essentially we
have multiple
ways of doing styling on the web we can
do inline styles directly on elements or
we can write CSS where we declare
classes and then on our HTML elements we
can reference those classes and then we
can use CSS is sort of cascade to style
our entire application CSS and jeaious
is still writing CSS but you write it
inside JavaScript it then projects it to
CSS so in react land the way this
happens with glamorous and glamour is we
create styled react components which
when they're rendered inserts the
appropriate CSS classes into a a style
tag that's managed by glamorous so you
get all of the benefits of CSS but it
moves a lot of the problems for us we
wanted to play around with it because we
had theming we needed to have a
component library that supported
multiple different products was a
problem we needed solve we also wanted
to reduce the amount of CSS we were
sending to the browser so because when
we do server-side rendering of our react
application we know exactly what
components are rendered for a particular
request because glamorous is tied to
reiax lifecycle it knows exactly what
styles are required for that page so we
can send just the CSS that's required
for that page rather than a giant
stylesheet that has the styles for
everything so enabled a bunch of
technical things but by far the most
interesting thing was around the impact
of the team so for me when previous to
this whenever I was trying to figure out
how to do styling I'd be like hmm what
do we use okay let's just use bootstrap
because it solves all of these problems
for me and this was this is one of the
main sort of approaches I see most
people taking with styling
unless you come from sort of a design
and that sort of viewpoint web
developers who are not visual tend to
treat CSS like something that's his
black box that's super annoying and that
certainly was me when we switched to
glamorous which it looks something like
this you go glamorous Nev so that is a
nav HTML element and then you pass it a
JavaScript object which is all of the
styles this is still CSS but you can
kind of reference JavaScript variables
in it you can tie it to react lifecycle
and make it data-driven you can do a
bunch of other things with it when we
switch to this we saw some really
interesting dynamic shifts within the
team a bunch of people who just didn't
touch styling at all started gravitating
towards it they're still writing CSS
like this is still CSS it still ends up
in the browser CSS all of the same
concepts apply you still need to
understand CSS the only difference is
the language you're expressing it in but
there was a much greater shift than I
would have expected so the learnings
from this one is CSS and J's increased
engagement across our team for visual
styling work those by far the most
interesting side effect some of our team
because we're using typescript they
jumped in and wrote all of the
typescript definitions for glamorous and
contributed that back to the community
really some interesting side effects
part of the conceptual alignment in
terms of in the web space you have CSS
modules which the idea is scoped CSS
classes to a particular component
there's a number of ways we can do this
if you're not using one of those you've
got these global Styles
which can be referenced in all of these
different areas but because you're
building components it's so easy to
create a global CSS collision I've got
to tie
some buttons i accidentally use a button
class which is defined in two places it
conflicts globally
I now have styling issues that are
really hard to track down because we're
building components focusing on
encapsulating these problems and not
distributing styling problems across our
design system and our products we wanted
to kind of conceptually align the way we
work from a styling point of view with
the way we work with a functionality
point of view because CSS and JIS and
specifically glamorous allows us to
build components which have Styles
attached and scoped to that component we
now have aligned functionality of our
component library with the way we style
they have worked in the same way and
they're conceptually linked that's been
really really awesome we've found that
we have we no longer have styles that
override other styles and products
causing all these maintainability
problem issues it's really just helped
us move a lot faster and increase the
confidence what's been another benefit
with visual regression testing which I
was talking about earlier is as we've
been able to move from sass to CSS in
jeaious like refactoring the entire way
we do it we can make sure we haven't
regressed anything in any of these
components because we convert it all
over if there's any mistakes the visual
snapshots don't match pretty cool
and finally CSS is treated as a concept
not a language so we're actually
thinking about styling and the way CSS
works in the browser rather than the
language we write it in that's been
pretty interesting the final decision
that I wanted to talk about which is
hasn't really come to fruition yet we're
still working on it is the shift to
continuous deployment this for me is
pretty interesting because we were using
scrum that's the way we delivered the
first couple of products
and coming from a consulting world I've
helped build agile teams for different
companies and I kind of thought well
scrum is kind of the easiest agile
methodology for a team to get sort of
start with mainly because it doesn't
require as much discipline as other
methodologies like Kanban so I kind of
thought well in any organization if you
follow scrum and you're pragmatic and
make sure that you follow the sort of
agile tenants then scrum should be able
to succeed there's a few things that
have solidified in my mind around scrum
in particular and this is the reasoning
you would go for it
scrum for me is all about predictability
of a team so how creating sustainable
pace and an rhythm that you're working
in fortnightly time boxes and the team
commits to some sort of work in that
time and then they meet that commitment
I talked earlier about being a news
organization where they're just thinking
maybe 24 hours in advance scrum hurt us
because we didn't actually care about
predictability we wanted to we've got a
huge list of things we want to do and we
don't really care about measuring and
planning out everything we just want to
be working on the most important thing
at any time so a lot of the value that
scrum brings an organization and a team
were things that we really didn't want
or need this caused a lot of conflicts
because we often would change sprint
scope because well we didn't really care
about the commitment so much we we cared
about oh well we have to react to this
like change in the business because
there's a new story come in or
advertising there's a event coming up
they want to book the site in two weeks
like things like that the realities of
the brisbane as' is our two-week time
box was actually hurting our ability
to succeed for the business our goal was
to replace all of this in a certain time
so we moved across to Kanban recently
does anyone know the origins of Kanban
and what this is it is yeah so Toyota
production line Kanban is a Japanese
word and it sounds for signal card and
the way it works is Kanban moves from
kind of a push flow to a pull flow so
that way it would work is if you're on a
particular station and you need a part
you create a Kanban which is kind of
like a work order and then you give it
to the team down the line that needs to
give you something you do it on demand
when you're going to need it and then
they fulfill that order and return the
Kanban to you with whatever you've kind
of requested becomes this pull model and
it focuses on all of the things that we
cared about which was making sure that
when we start a piece of work we get it
into production as fast as possible
there was no value for us waiting until
we had a shippable increment we wanted
to just do the work complete it and get
it into production so Kanban was
actually a really interesting switch
because as soon as we made the move a
lot of the friction we felt with scrum
kind of just went away because weird
aligned our agile processes to our goals
this introduced an interesting problem
where we work using git we then have a
pull request that has a piece of work
and then we merge it in is that done
probably not like as programmers our job
is to deliver value to the business by
just merging it to master you've done
nothing I until that feature is in
production we haven't actually delivered
any value so what we are trying to do is
move the problem of our coders here now
someone has to release it to production
not my problem - well I want to make
sure it's done at this point we want all
of our verification of our code to be
done before it's merged to mainline so
really focus on this idea of mainline
development and once it is merged it
goes to production you don't have to
worry about manually getting sign-off
from someone in the business because
that's a problem of making sure that you
have a shared understanding at the
beginning of your process making sure
that if you're going to build something
for the for the business you should
understand the reasons why and then if
you get to the point that you've merged
it and you've built the wrong thing it
becomes a conversation about how did we
miss the shared understanding at the
beginning so trying to move a lot of
these problems that often occur after
the the code is merged move it away from
the code make it a decision that's
happening much much earlier in the
process so we can move faster and
actually get stuff done continuous
deployment for me is less about the
mechanics of deploying things and more
about well I can build stuff have
confidence that it is complete and
working and going to give business value
ship it it ends up in production I can
get feedback on that almost immediately
while it's still fresh in my mind and
then I can start working on the next
thing focus on things moving through and
flow it also removes this fear of
releasing to production it's a it's
something that if the longer code has
been sitting waiting to be released the
more anxiety and fear that builds up
about actually releasing that code when
you hit merge you're like yep super cool
happy for this to go to production and
then just buy it sitting there all these
worries and doubts actually come in
let's remove that problem it's not for
everyone
you don't want to be doing
continuous deployment if it's going to
go out and if you've made a mistake
people die that's really not responsible
but at the end of the day we're building
a new site as long as we don't as long
as we can focus on recovering quickly
and reducing the types and impact of the
problems we're introducing so heaps of
benefits for us so my main learnings for
talking about that merging when things
are busy it's really hard to finish
things like really finish them it's kind
of that 90% week found a lot of stories
kind of ended up we're kind of waiting
for the product owner to sign this off
and and or it's blocked because you're
just focusing on writing code writing
codes easy actually finishing it making
sure that everyone's happy capturing the
next steps that's hard it requires a
contextual shift when things are really
busy it's really hard to make that shift
when you feel the pain like we persisted
with scrum for a very long time it was
painful and we constantly were missing
our sprint commitments because we were
over committing and changing our sprint
commitments which meant our commitments
meant less we were more focused on
making sure each story was getting done
and not that we wouldn't meet the entire
sprint commitment we should have seen
those signals a lot earlier and acted on
them so if things are painful get the
development team together or the the
greater development team together and
figure out how you can make it better
because often the whole idea of agile is
inspect and adapt we did very little
adapting well we did but it was not at a
process level we kind of should have
been asking bigger questions not just
how can we fix this particular small
problem look a bit more holistically and
accountability within the team is hugely
powerful so moving towards the the idea
that if you merge that pull request it's
going to production you as a developer
become a lot more accountable for the
quality of what you're dropping onto the
main line this is hugely motivating as a
developer because you we have a
blameless postmortem process so if we do
introduce problems into production it's
the whole team's problem not that
person's fault but having that support
with the ability to make weight have
confidence that what you've done is
ready to go to production as hugely
empowering and very satisfying I've got
two honorable mentions of other
impactful decisions we made that I won't
have time to talk about there was a
originating decision where we thought
well because all of that state is stored
in another system and we're just kind of
projecting it and serving up a bunch of
data an elastic search index kind of
feels right for storing all of our site
data that was in retrospect not the
greatest decision because it's an index
has to be rebuilt from scratch you can't
do database migrations and all of those
sort of things so about three weeks
before launch we ripped out our entire
data store and replaced it with Postgres
you can imagine the kind of churn and
stress that that impacts for the team
but that was quite an interesting story
feel free to come grab me throughout the
conference we also switched to
typescript that was hugely impactful
because while converting a code base to
typescript you're constantly having
merged problems you have a new language
for the team to learn that had a lot
more impacts to the team and the
happiness in the short term than I
thought it would have it ended up being
great choice because static type
checking across a large code base great
but that was another one that actually
hurt us have had like in the short term
there's a couple of key takeaways make
decisions make them deliberate don't
don't allow yourself to just have a
non-decision
because it's easier if you're going to
take a decision actually record it make
it a deliberate choice because then you
can deliberately choose to change it
later don't just leave it as a sign of a
default choice so to speak because non
decisions often hurt we delayed a number
of things because we weren't really sure
often just making a decision means that
you can measure and take like in your
retrospectives see if the decision was a
good one highly encourage you to make
two decisions and because it allows you
to then review them over time also when
I've given you a bunch of different
technology related decisions but I've
barely talked about the technology
themselves because most of the time the
impacts is far greater than the
technology itself it impacts your the
team's happiness and their ability to be
motivated and do good work so Dan pink
has a great book Drive highly recommend
it because it's on a team on motivation
and people which will make you succeed
not the technology choices so a good
team will help like we'll make anything
work so that was the power and
consequences of technical decisions I
hope you there's a few things to think
about I'm gonna be around all week and
do I have time for questions not really
that's cool come grab me after thanks
