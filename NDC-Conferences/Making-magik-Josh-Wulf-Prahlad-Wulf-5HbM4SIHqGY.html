carefully take a selfie free for the
folks back in Australia come over way
from Brisbane there cool okay great
thanks ready jumping okay we're going to
turn round this way we're going to catch
all these fabulous people behind us in
here awesome thank you so this talk is
called making magic I'm Josh wolf from
Brisbane Australia's originally born in
New Zealand no live in Australia I
started coding when I was 10 years old
and between the years 2004 to 2014 I
helped build the world's first
billion-dollar open-source software
company a Red Hat and big part of my job
there was integrating JBoss into our
engineering back plan when we acquired
them and I'm one of the summers magic
crafts a year University
hey my name is rod Wolff I'm 14 years
old I was originally born in Peru but
now I live in Australia I am a creditor
to use mentor and I'm the youngest speak
at NBC and in two years two days time I
will be presenting at peridot today's
coolest projects in Dublin Ireland okay
so imagine craft we teach kids to code
JavaScript and minecraft using the
metaphor of magic and magic is the power
that allows people to do impossible
things by saying special words and
that's what computer programming is
Magic craft is the URL dub-dub-dub magic
craft io and if you want to try it out
it's freely available for you to play
with you can go to start magic crafty
own you might ask the question why
JavaScript because javascript is the
furry rodent like mammal of programming
languages it's everywhere and it will
survive the apocalypse and not only that
it will probably even cause it so that's
why JavaScript it's like it runs
everywhere it's a great language for
kids to learn our commitment with magic
crafters that kids discover the power of
code through joyful play and part of the
way that we do that as we create world
records so this is the world record that
we set in February on the Gold Coast
really with 30 kids at Microsoft ignite
it's the Moses on bees killed in
Minecraft from 10 minutes using
javascript lightning very competitive
space but we obviously have what it
takes and we actually set a world record
two nights ago here in Oslo Norway with
30 Norwegian kids it's the most
minecraft zombies killed in a 10 minute
period using javascript fireballs so we
don't break World Records we set world
records because breaking a world record
means taking it away from other kids and
we believe that there's plenty to go
around
and the background commitment that we
have behind what we're doing here the
thing this is really important the
software developers like we really do
have magical powers like we can
literally create something from nothing
by saying special words am i right and
Al commitment what we want to do what we
want to create of what we're doing is
that every child in the world gets to
experience that I'm valuable that
there's something that I am the best in
the world at and that I can make a
difference and so that is what we say is
magic the power that and now a label
enables allows people to do impossible
things by saying special words a little
bit about the technology stack that we
use in magic craft we're using all of
the cloud providers so we got backing
from Amazon Google Microsoft and they're
another one
Amazon Google Microsoft IBM we've
typescript we use react graph QL IBM
Cloudant with several us frameworks some
stuff we use node we even use addy
programming language doc
containerization my sequel database we
use Java obviously because minecraft we
as Jenkins for continuous integration we
use this cool thing called speeders has
anyone heard of speeders before I was in
the things other than the talk by one of
the guys from old code this morning is
talking about containerization so what
speed us does is if I can get to my
hello exit out of this o pad no that's
not working
okay that does work here we go speed us
yeah it's from some guys in Spain and
what it does is when you have dog arised
applications and different docker
containers running on the same host and
they use HTTP to communicate with each
other through the tcp/ip stack what it
does is it subverts that and so they
communicate with each other through
Linux sockets so it's super fast when
you're killing thirteen thousand five
hundred and eighty four zombies in ten
minutes you need that kind of
performance so that's why we are that's
why we use that I start now we can get
rid of this and I want to go back to
this cool and in the other thing that we
use is github social coding so with
integrated magic craft deeply with
github what we want is we want in ten
years time kids to be rolling into a job
interview and go y'all I've been
committing to get home for the last ten
years what's up you know so we
immediately have their code going to
github and we have that collaboration
one of the things that I got from
teaching kids to code is that you know
the way codings normally to and
university is kind of like it's golf
right it's an individual out keyboard
solving a problem but in reality it's
more like football you know it's more
like a team sport and it's the
collaboration the competition and the
cooperation that really makes a
difference so we want to start kids
learning that right from the get-go
minecraft some multiplayer games that's
perfect for that live demo time let's
hope this works
hmm take it this out okay this is
completely unrehearsed it's really live
it's not it's not at all recorded okay
so join magic craft and we're going to
magic craft connecting to the server we
were if I have a network connection here
in DC 2017
ping 8.8.8.8 okay um so it's not running
it is very slowly okay so while that's a
while that's loading I will continue
talking to provide some light
entertainment shows Windows this is what
the spell book looks like it's a it's a
spell book it's a micro IDE in the web
browser it uses typescript in the
background that the kids are coding in
JavaScript because we found that 80% of
coding errors especially the kids are
spelling mistakes and I was like dude I
didn't come to teach them how to spell
I'm going to turn on the typescript you
know linting so that it will check to
see if variables actually exist rather
than silently initializing some
undefined variable and then the kids
like why am i code doesn't work still
loading the terrain I think it's going
to take too long to load so we might
skip over that live demo aspect you take
my word for it in the game what they do
is they find magic words in there and
they type them in their console and then
they magically appear in their spell
book and what this is is it's like micro
pieces of content API documentation the
most basic thing that they can do is
they can serve a log learn how this
demonstrates how to write a spell and
see if this will work no he needs an
internet connection to work what oh here
we go
so they get a spell in this go book it
has a description of what it does
examples how to use it you just copy the
example to create the new spell so you
make your ready to look like that one
click on next write the stone here like
this so they just type it in there they
can even cut and paste it and once they
do that they unlock the full stack
overflow programmer achievements they
have 80% of what they need to know to be
a professional software developer
once they've written spelling there's
they click save spell it gives them a
message go to minecraft and type splash
casts feed me that runs the spell and
minecraft they get immediate - romantic
effects like immediate feedback when I
started coding on the Atari 800 XL I
plugged in my TV I type in 10 print
hello world enter and then I'm like whoa
I made words appear on the TV screen or
my friends are like that's amazing but 4
provides learning to code in 2017 it
takes
but more than that so yeah you're
welcome to try it up oh let me see here
so if I now cast one of my spells
already have the jump spell leads you up
into the air it's not going to kill me
when I land almost dead and I'll show
you my fireball spell I'll show you my
Chain Lightning spell actually this is
probably the most impressive spell in my
arsenal at the moment we especially use
this one it looks good at night so I
changed the time tonight and this is
really good for the zombie apocalypse
when we run that time night and then I
cast my lightning spell it's kind of
excessive but that's how I like to roll
as you can probably tell that's the kind
of thing that the kids like to do we
have an API editor in here so as
developers you can create ap is that the
kids can program too so that's another
thing that you can explore and we're
launching the magic craft open source
platform in Dublin Ireland on Saturday
June 17th and we're working with Lars
lower kids according here in Norway to
make sure that every Norwegian kid gets
to play this for free so now I want to
hand it over to provide to talk about
m61 so in 2010 I got taiwan movies which
sucks is nothing good about it it's just
the worst and the hospital which the
integral part of your type 1 diabetes
you go there regularly and they have to
teach you how to manage your diabetes
and teach other people how to manage
your diabetes because you need help it's
it's not easy so when the hospital
teaches you all the information you need
it's not unlike easy to read information
it's more convoluted in the shadows you
rarely ever understand it so we decided
to create NZT 1 minecraft was type 1
diabetes yes so it is magic raft but I
created it and it simulates type 1
diabetes in Minecraft
so you can learn how to manage your
diabetes and teach other people how
diabetes works because when I first got
it most of my friends were like you
can't eat sugar or any food yeah yeah so
in two days time I will be presenting
MCT one to fifty Romanian ninjas and
kids from 18 different countries in
Dublin Ireland yeah and like NCT one
like you saw me just make a small little
spell there's casting lighting it's kind
of fun right what we realized us a
little while is we had created the
easiest way to make Minecraft
modifications using nothing but a web
browser and the first thing that God
created was provide creating this type 1
diabetes modification you know that
simulates having type 1 diabetes in
there and if you go to our YouTube
channel you see a news report about it
and someone asked me the other day when
did you know that magic craft was a
success and I knew that magic craft was
a success when I saw my son for Lars on
television saying you know when they ask
them will let's make a difference and he
said this won't make a difference for me
now but it will make a difference for
all of the other kids who get diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes that's why I knew
that magic Russell's a success
so I'm Josh wolf this is prologue wolf
and I have something to tell you for a
lot I am your father thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
