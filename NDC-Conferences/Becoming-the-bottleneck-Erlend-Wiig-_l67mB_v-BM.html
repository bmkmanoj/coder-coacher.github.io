work at ni ki AAS is obligatory to said
where the PBC of Norway
I work in radio and TV Muslim I just
assume you've read the abstract and so
on so I'm just going to to to dive right
in and tell you something about how I
become a bottleneck a guy stuck in a
well it's a fine bottle of wine but
stuck in a bottle nonetheless and when I
use the term bottleneck it means a
person that has too many projects too
many planning meetings too many
dependencies or people too many people
are dependent on that person to get
their work completed that's what I mean
by a bottleneck and everything I said
today you have to look it through sort
of a five-year lens I've been working at
my current company now for five years
and this is sort of an accumulation of
stuff I've done and sort of yeah
situation I got myself into in it was in
November last year I really started
thinking about this because my calendar
looked like this and it was actually my
project managers accidentally saw my
calendar and he said hey of calendars
just as full as mine and I get paid to
sort of go to planning meetings and talk
to people while you get paid to do write
code so that's a bad sign I think it's
not meant as some sort of sign of of
importance or anything is also there all
the way around this is the problem I
think it got so bad actually
I had well two stand-ups at the same
time something terrible is going on here
and well I do just basically schedule a
dentist appointment to build polities
just to get some free time to do this
sensei
but let's go back and see how I got in
this situation trying with my limited
drawing skills and personal journey or
mine to get better at drawing and trying
to illustrate here that in the beginning
everything was fine in the beginning
everything was cool he had I work in
this team there's a steady stream of
work coming in from from a downstream
dependency which is the program player
and they were ordering stuff from us and
we were completing it and everything was
really great because you can see the
calendar was pretty manageable there was
some planning meetings to stand up and
so on it's fine we were on sort of we
were had our bases covered we were on
top of every bug we were fixing it
straightaway releasing it to production
we had we answered every question email
within like 15 minutes or something we
were on top of everything then something
happened a few years back we got a bit
bored basically because this steady
stream of work was drying up so we were
not asked to do very much anymore and
downstream dependency that was they were
doing a major refactoring on our data or
just to go back I work in a sort of a
glue project I take some data from some
place I do something with it and hide it
off off to another team and a lot of
things that we'll go through today is
this work between those teams so the
work was drying up we were a bit bored
and this is like looking back at it this
is a seminal moment in in this whole
story because at that time we could have
said well if they are refactoring
something on basically on top of our
data they're doing something with our
data they're going to ask us little
questions about that data we could we
are the domain experts of that data we
could have just stopped then and there
and said
help those guys out because we were
sharing the same models basically we
were sharing the same text back their
own Etsy shop as well we could have just
helped them out basically but we didn't
because they were on another project and
yeah that's a bad sign so what we did
instead was of course create a new
project create more on stream so if the
one stream was drying up we could create
some new ones and that's good well I
love new projects the best best thing in
the world innovation days hack days you
get you know clean slate greenfield all
this you can just think about all the
features you can create think about the
new tech stack everything will be fine
and this new text I could just go new
projects yes so there was a a podcast
CMS system that was broken so we say
well let's let's just take that we
desperately need someone to fix it
because we can't really find the source
code so someone needs to create a new
entity that note was a great success
then there was a another system which
was event transmissions which was
basically a Google Doc as a database put
into production so somebody need to
rewrite that because Google Doc in
production was really a good idea and
there were other project side projects
innovation days and so on but then this
story will take a sort of that downward
spiral everything up to now was cool we
since the original work was drying up we
were free to do other stuff and we did
other stuff and completed other stuff
successfully but what happens what
happened was that a colleague of mine
left the team just to jump join another
team that was fine and then the
consultant who made the transmission
system he also left and I was fine at
all as well because his
it was up he done his work for months or
something but what happens when all
everybody leaves then you could stuck
with the software don't you especially
if you are the only employee left on the
project as I was just for a frame of
reference this project was never more
than five people and never less than two
people so just to give you some scale
and I think it's quite natural that you
get stuck with the responsibility
because as an organization and as a
company you probably like that a a
person that's actually employed is the
sort of the maintainer and owner of the
software and can answer questions and so
on but I think the focusing arrow the
criticism is that there's only one guy
left that was me and we have this image
to discuss this earlier just on the
keynote as well we have this image of
software's just taking the tasks running
with it completing it and you have
software and you can just keep on
running creating new software and and
everything's fine but it's really not
and when I sort of get depressed with
software development or start stop
thinking about social development as
opportunities and more like this is just
an accumulation of responsibilities
we're just putting another block on top
or something else and and we're just
acquiring maintenance because we all
know that every piece of software needs
some maintenance it's at any given time
and if and and we don't really have at
least I've never seen sort of a metric
on how much software we can have it's
like you can't have if you have if you
run a sort of a call center you can have
you can say like well we have a hundred
people they can do ten calls an hour
that gives them some social capacity but
ever I've never seen this sort of it's
not like for a million lines of code you
need
this many developer depending on on your
application we've never we don't have
like a roof that says well you can't go
over this because the organization will
just grind to a halt we just say well
usually just create new software it
gives them value we've stopped put it on
top of the next and then we we carry on
but it comes to a point where if you
just doin 5% maintenance on every
project it comes to a point where just
doing maintenance and and
october/november that that was a place I
found myself in I had like five six
different projects and maintaining all
those and just doing maintenance and
sort of big fixing and just signal to
everyone and that was a sad place which
can lead to and you start thinking about
your sort of career maybe go maybe going
to SharePoint development maybe just
work night and gets burned out of having
maybe just switch jobs to to get a clean
start because then at least you can just
leave all the old crap behind if you're
a consultant you judge always which jobs
every year you probably you don't
recognize these things but it can become
a burden on you because you become this
guy and that's it it is quite a
depressing thing when you're sort of
creator and maintainer or lots of
different cool projects that
individually give value to a lot of
people and they come to you and say well
can't you help me with we can lead this
new feature I can compile country or
welcome to you just fix this one thing
and I can do and it will be awesome but
you just have to start saying no to
everyone that is really bad feeling it's
a feeling of despair basically because
you know this is not like a million
hours a day and it can't please everyone
so you arrived at this dark place at the
bottom of the stairs and this way is
where I found myself this is me on the
right a bit younger it's actually the
saddest picture I could find on myself
and I have a lot of pictures but I don't
know know about so something about the
pictures we take or against the pictures
my wife takes I don't know and but I'm
here today I'm sort of smiling so it has
to turned out ok I suppose and it will
we've sort of arrived now at the bottom
of these stairs is a dark place but we
are going to turn it around and start
talking about solutions because there
are some well I believe there are some
and there's this tree just trying to
illustrate that there's some low-hanging
fruit - very clever yeah so don't start
any new project if you're already filled
up in this project if your schedules
full it's a bad idea to start new ones
be strict with people who call you into
meetings make them state their agenda
and wanted outcomes and so on to
documentation properly so you can hand
it over to people to build some tests to
fix those things and I believe strongly
in this one is related to meetings which
is why do we only invite the senior
people to every meeting well to put a
fine point on it maybe we could invite
some junior developers from time to time
I think they would probably give you a
lot of the same answers and maybe they
don't know the full story but they will
probably go back and and ask their CV
people again for the full story and so
on and there might be some new positions
at the organization that has to
implement like I am with my last job
there was a guy who was so all the
senior person been around basically same
as mine he was into a lot of things and
he was
just to help others basically just to
support persons which might be something
to try but what it's in the abstract and
what I'd like to talk about is open
source and how it relates to all this an
open source is not really a buzzword
anymore I think it sort of one sort of
one hasn't it everything we do Microsoft
is now read somewhere that the biggest
contributor on github and everyone's
doing open source is not really cool
anymore so to say and the basic thing of
the open source model is the pull
request we just say there's some
software out there you can pull it down
yourself you can fix a bug if you found
it in the software or you can add a
feature if you like that and then send a
request back to the maintain and say
please incorporate this so we can both
benefit from from this excellent work I
did for you and I think we could do some
more of that internally in our
organization this is so find very
interesting in the paradox between like
you can contribute to some speed of
software on the other side of the you
know known universe but you can't
contribute codes which people are
sitting 5 meters from you are doing
because there's another team which takes
me and and let me try to explain why I
think it's a good idea and first we have
to go back to how we do project so what
is this anyone it's the combo board sets
on the top not difficult
there's no not clever the work so you
know the concept and probably a lot of
you doing this already you have a
backlog for tasks you wanted to
accomplish you put something to doing
when you want to do it and when you're
done you put it a dump and and
presumably done and well sometimes we
not done you done done and what all
these jokes about done done done and so
on but and what what's this these are
two it's quite similar
it's to combine boats and we're trying
to illustrate here that you have a
Kanban board for team a and you have a
Kanban board for Team B right
so what happens if if you complete some
work in doing here put it it done and
it's supposed to go to the next team
what happens in done does it go to
I guess it can't just go straight to
down that would be some sort of quantum
mechanical thing so that won't happen
you'll probably go to doing if you
really get it negotiating and you really
get it while the project managers are
talking properly between themselves and
everything is working properly but in my
experience usually goes to backlog right
and you get this sort of effect so you
have tasks coming in and it don't go to
like to go straight to the top of the
other teams backlog they probably go all
the way to the bottom and this one goes
this is sir guys just giving up you
complicated to the queue at all and and
that was something that happens in my
situation we were doing work we were
saying well it's finished but it wasn't
really completed so let me give you an
example from reality this is a big
picture and well it's actually a lot of
pictures a big picture made up of a lot
of small pictures I think it's something
like six thousand by 1500 design it's it
was something I created to get this sort
of feature it's called a preview image
so have this video clip and and along
the timeline you can scroll and you get
them adjust a shorter image which
displays what's happening a known
functionality from from Netflix and so
on so I had some code lying around I
collaborated with a front-end developer
who made this thing and that was fine we
were actually a couple of hack dates we
collaborated quite nicely and the
feature was complete and the project
leadership or management was very happy
because they got this new feature from
couple hack days and everything was fine
excellent but then we realized that
taking this to a production would
require some rework of the architecture
and basically going from generating
these large images go back yeah this
image takes like a minute or something
to generate so it's not something you do
on demand we found out that we really
like to do is just pre generate all the
images for every program so I did that I
did my part that reflected the thing I
stored every image on a storage knives
and say the reference in a table and
then the next team were supposed to take
that over because I did my part until
here and then the image reference was
supposed to be exposed in a different
API which I was not in control of there
was another team and this is really the
biggest mistake that we did I done and
with what we've done is but so go back
is that I completed my work here I've
stored the image reference in the
database I'm saying well that's that's
that's the feature complete that's not
really complete is it because the
feature was the whole the whole thing
storing an image in a database knows is
not image reference in the database not
really the best feature for I uses they
they really would like to see the actual
picture so but I didn't complete this
part of the feature because that was
another team and I said I'm finished and
it got stuck in their prioritization
kill and then to this day it isn't it's
not been picked up yet
the features they're working on the old
architecture but it's a bad time because
you get sort of piling up this a
synchronicity of work so steady stream
air coming in and then there's some sort
of delay these backlogs have to sink
sort of and then when someone else picks
something up here you probably have to
talk to somebody up here and then you
get to all these kinds of feedback
trouble because it's probably forgotten
well three weeks ago you've started
something else and you create all this
sort of the term whip is used a lot of
working progress that we having too many
cars on the on the highway so to speak
we should probably focus on getting more
stuff done getting all the way through
the system then then then handing over
and just starting new stuff and we still
get something like this of course it's
the perfect flow every features just
running smoothly all the way through the
system and but that is not trivial I'm
not going to say it's trivial because
what I'm basically saying is that you
have to jump into other people's code
bases and either send them pull requests
or join them and fix fix the thing
together so you might have to jump into
a different code base different coding
styles different cultures and so on and
it might be a different language
altogether but and and you might think
it's just yeah that you have enough with
your own project and you can't really
take the time to help the the other ones
quick I strongly believe in this sort of
circle it will have to have in place to
be able to do this we have to have the
monitoring in tests in place to be able
to you know the people like - well feel
safe when they jump into other people's
code bases and and deploy and
documentation and all these
are important too to be able to switch
is more easily
we shouldn't import everything from my
open source this is the famous Salinas
email we should we should encourage you
know encourage if somebody is picking up
your code and actually contributing
something input valuable back to you
then you should really give them a prize
or something and praise them the last
thing I wanted to discuss with this
component versus feature teams has also
seen this referred to as functional or
versus market teams and the basic idea
is that you have sort of teams laid
after your application so traditionally
maybe had database team maybe had the
front-end team and they had some
components and and these guys have some
components and what we've done me
personally on a veneer in an audio
project is a radio and podcast project
so we've sort of gone from just being on
the metadata layer to focusing on on the
on the podcasting and radio features
that's good because you can i rate more
click quickly and so on as to thinking
at least that you focus on on your
project there but what we get is so in
this picture we've done our realignment
so we have let's say just a one front
end and one back end developer on each
team are this as well this is the way
cuz so some of the components can be
quite easily just given to the to the
teams because they are clearly belong so
a radio app perhaps for instance that it
could clearly belongs to my team now
because we're doing radio but some of
the components are stuck in the middle
sort of half way you know we sort of
belong maybe here does the common APR
maybe there's a common logging framework
whatever they are
our shared among different teams so they
get sort of have half ownership the
halfway belongs to one team and halfway
belongs to another team and that's when
you see I think this notion of guilds
come into play where which is basically
you have the old functional team that
needs to maintain this common thing but
you also have the new teams so because
you need to maintain these common
components still in a sort of well you
need to have a vision for the men and to
some architectural working zone and
maintain them so you have some
components that really belongs to each
team and I have still you pause the
ownership of some components in two
guilds and so on and I will not advocate
going full agile or I'm not going to
advocate even a sort of resource pool
with you you could think to just take
all the developers we have the tasking
you just assign people randomly I'm not
I don't think that will work as well
because people I think people like to
belong to a team for a while but I think
that we need to be sort of flexible and
be sort of agile when it comes to if
there's a top priority here in component
a for management and you need to say
that even though these two guys now
belongs to different teams we need to
just take them together even though it's
just for a while it will make it easier
to to to switch people down and so on
last time yeah good and so that was a
lot of talk about a theme from my Kanban
and so on maybe not too much about open
sourcing and wasn't there supposed to be
a personal story of mind well it is and
has anything conclusion has everything
been better all by calendar now is it's
starting to look a bit better now you
can see these are just two random days I
have
it's basically one hour and yeah
something meeting everything that's good
I'm a sort of in a full-blown trying to
give everything away modis at the moment
so just take take my project you can you
can have it it's fine so I have to do
well well one of the lessons is that
your side project or your baby is not
really healthy to treat them as babies
try to try to get them running in a
stable environment early try to document
the matter so we can just give them away
early start thinking about the matter
not something you want to raise them and
bring into adulthood but something just
send away into kindergarten and leave it
to somebody else because I will free you
from from from being becoming this
bottle link so I've been able to at
least give away one project while I
still receive a lot of emails saying
country fix it and I say no he took the
responsibility so you fix it and well
yeah I said this already document all
tonight think hard about this comeback
because I think as I showed you this
transfer of of work I think it really
often becomes just a sort of a waterfall
model with Kanban board so you just
doing waterfall with individual Kanban
boards in between them and that's not
really still waterfall and get inspired
by open sources I think we need to be
much at least when you're on the same
stacking on the same language and you
know the guys who it should be easy to
jump into other people's stuff but we
still need ownership of these components
we still need maintainer still still
needs to be someone who's actually
approves of these four requested needs
to somebody has a vision of how or what
is going to be in architecture and that
is my final slide so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
