i'm georgia taro from my work for cloud
solutions and I'm also agile VP and I
did a bunch of stuff that you guys don't
care and hey
but pretty much you know micro service
and do that drops as well containers a
lot and I'm following the wrong windows
subsystem feelings from the beginning
but because I think that's a big change
for us and is helping a lot the
developers and well who doesn't want to
have Linux inside your windows and now
have not just one Linux you can pick the
district that you want and now you can
see all these you know open SUSE also
see Linux you boot the door as well and
I have everything running here that's
amazing and it's not is out of beta now
Microsoft's providing support from the
vessel that's coming next month it's for
creators and will be amazing that the
guys can say for the enterprise
companies yeah you can use that you
going Microsoft's going to give support
and that's pretty much you have a common
shell screen where you opening have
Linux run either and it's pretty much
200 megabytes that have to download when
you install that and like 500 megabytes
in your disk and it's just the you know
the shell there is no care no there is
nothing there okay when you install that
that's what you see you see the
different distress here if you run all
together in parallel you can see that
now I can see on the processor screen
you can see exactly what's running and
there is no magic and that's how they
did it
probably they have shared a little bit
since the first version but kind of a
provider and there is no key no it's
just the Linux you know user mode that's
like this 200 megabyte setting so very
lightweight they just start the
initialization for your Linux instance
and you have a bash running and very
soon we probably have multiple instances
or
you can have these now on the a on the
inside the fashion but next month will
be available to everybody and I'm not
going to details here but it's pretty
much how they do it and after that what
they call picot processes like X 10 or
process for Windows we just say okay
that's something that's not native and
from there and you'd like a provider
something to be like an interpreter for
this what they call z-scores here yeah
and they get a Linux esky they translate
that in a native window syscalls and
works a hundred percent not but the law
everything however new release having
improvements and improvements it's
running really well now and why you want
to do that why I need a Linux inside my
lean my windows why don't have like a
veto machine where I can install Linux
go have a veto machine with Linux but
that's different that's running that's
like the real Linux user mode installing
your laptop running in parallel with
your windows you imagine have Windows in
like three or four or five Linux running
in parallel or sharing the same local
host or sharing the same heat source and
you can do like development like say I
don't install ruby or pi/2 or something
on my windows I can leave that inside my
Linux and just we can do some tests if I
can manage it to see that I have all my
Linux open here I can have different
shells I open this screen but that's
fine but the main thing is sorry I can
see my screen here I can only see the
head
see that's my you boot invasion of my
Linux running is just inside my windows
I can do something like that that's a
lot that's a text file that's on my
windows you know further and I just met
with my Linux over here and then I can
do like a graph and get working that and
even better if I go on these
stacks file here and I say you SS that's
horrible
you know and if you save that you can do
something like that let's say if I can
have a day you here I think I have to
you can do like tale and if I go back to
my file and if I say yep that's mean
that we have I not 5 implemented now
that means that you can have a files in
your windows you're doing development
with vs code or some you know editor and
then it can have Linux watching that and
like compiling do all the things inside
Linux then you don't have to install the
compilers the language inside your
windows anymore that's that's pretty
amazing and now there's a lot of people
you know doing different languages using
that and so now you don't have to have a
Mac or Linux just developed we can if
the company is going to provide you can
do any language now with Windows and
that's that's really useful and another
thing that it's coming now out of the
box with these versions
you can see you can see that I have from
there we go to store now I have all the
three dishes so it's probably open on
the second screen but anyway if I can
open someone here yes they are pretty
much the same but just like different
districts and if you go let's say yeah I
think the main thing that I could see
people using you know it's like SSH I
have like he docker install here as well
then I have cubed weed control for Cuba
net you have like a Giselle I then why I
have to install these multiple times if
you can centralize in one environment
and this Linux is very very easy to
rebuild you can just uninstall and
install game you know I can you can
backup it's a little bit slow the file
system sometimes but that's the semi
province there are promise for this
version next month but think about in
your development and how I'm going to
manage these new things that I was just
talking about on my slides and go back
here you see I were to manage containers
there are Linux containers running on
windows coming next month as well how
you guys going to manage Linux container
run is inside Windows Server I think
better using Linux and Linux is coming
to Windows Server 2016 next month as
well it's already available on the
windows insider because we have Windows
Server inside that as well now and next
month when we new 7060 next I shall be
released then you'll be there you'll be
you can install we didn't have windows
subsystem for new cloud native inside
Windows Server there's a lot of
scissored means that can use that have
native SSH
everybody knows a new version of psycho
side will be Linux base and they are
releasing for
for Linux then for Windows after death
then if you look now have containers for
sicko for Linux available and you have
for Windows yet the hours update the
Linux first that telling zai something
that Microsoft is all about the cloud
and we can follow that and are going to
manage it sicko survive running on Linux
I think if you want to keep your desktop
you can use the nominal subsystem for
links for that as well and PowerShell in
UPS everyone anyone try PowerShell on
Linux no one you can install power
sharing on Linux it I even have power
sharing stall here inside one of these
versions and the nice thing of have
mouth profession says it can you can
have you can play with different things
maybe you can run install new version
inside one different district not your
your you know main dish to that you use
it in a daily base it's like having four
or five Linux running in your laptop at
the same time you can have different
configurations and install different
things to play I think that's pretty
amazing and Linux native to a lot of
people you know I use or the UNIX guys
or someone that did did Linux like 20
years ago like myself and say I wanna
use my tools again it was I want to go
there and open like you know if people
using VRI or you know some editors and
why I wanna VI because you're going to
remote desktop like containers there is
no editor there it's no comment line
when you talk about containers or
everything in development you wanna if
you wanna
you know connect them in one container
for some reason that we come online and
that's that's the main reason to have
all these things and like hybrid hybrid
container cluster as well and all these
tools are Linux only like helm and how
to manage that and I'm open for
questions I just I have a quick overview
and if someone want to ask me something
outside or whatever thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
