good lunch if you want to have a nap you
should be
find someone and then I don't see you
say all right the problem is you are
sitting so spread out I'm going to see
if you take a nap so no that's all right
um so my talk is called nice make it
fixable and the reason why I chose that
title is that very often you think of
that you have to make your all your
applications and all your systems they
have to be secure for some kind of value
of secure and I am claiming that's not
possible
because some of the things that you are
protecting yourself from most things
that you cannot possibly know in advance
a good example from the last few weeks
of course is the meltdown Spectre thing
it's it nobody could imagine that
there's no way that you could have known
and so the idea of this entire
presentation is more to set you up so
that you can handle it when something
goes wrong and try to to eliminate a
certain amount of risk but you still
have to be able to live with risk so am
i my name is Patricia oz I'm a
programmer I've been working as a C++
programmer for about twelve years and I
graduated from the University of Russell
in 2005 and then I went to work on the
Opera browser which I hope people used
as I worked on the original opera versa
now called opera classic because that's
what they call it they discontinued
stuff and then one of the original opera
founders he might have to start another
browser company just a few years ago
which is coffee valdine and that's where
I work now but in between I worked at
Cisco for five years and I also was a
Java consultant for two years but it
didn't stick so um first of all security
is a very difficult topic it spans so
many things and so just if you're going
to go into the space and if you're going
to try to to make your applications your
systems your what you produce safer you
have to be kind with yourself because it
it is that quite difficult space we're
used to getting bad feedback but this is
like the ultimate bad feedback right so
the absolute first step that you have to
have and you have to have some way to
people to contact you if there is a
problem with your application on your
systems
and this is surprisingly a problem that
is very common that people don't have so
if you have a security researcher just a
random person that finds something and
they're not able to contact you they
will probably be nice and try to contact
you in several different ways
and if they're not able to then now
though they'll tweet it so what you want
is some way to deter them to contact you
but you also have to understand that
this relationship is a symbiotic
relationship and and they are doing you
a favor they've done a certain amount of
work on your behalf for free if you're
not in a bug bounty kind of situation
they've done a certain amount of work
for free and you have to respect that
work and and in doing that is the
specific type of relationship and most
importantly I think there is to maintain
that relationship is transparency and
being nice so basically just like
somebody reports something to you just
say thank you thank you for for putting
us to us we will the follow it up will
give you some feedback in a day or
something and then you'll tell them
about the timeline and then as long as
you keep people in the loop people are
generally very happy so another thing
that people can get kind of annoyed
about is like everybody everybody is an
expert everybody has an opinion but the
fact is and I think at least that there
are many experts in different kinds of
areas and people that you don't think of
as being security people in your company
actually end up having a lot of
influence on security in your company so
these are this is the outline of my talk
I'm gonna do the first five and then I'm
gonna do a little summary of the first
five minutes and I'm gonna do six
because I I think it's a separate thing
so the first five are different kinds of
problems that you might have in your
project in different ways and how you
can try to counteract them mostly
because you want to be in a situation
where when you get a vulnerability
report you can respond to it quickly and
generally that is often where you end up
having trouble so the first one is the
most important one but okay yeah
actually it should clarify a little bit
what is the system I talk a lot about in
a system or an application or something
but basically you'll see throughout my
talk in the in
the examples that assistant could be
anything and your user could be anybody
it could be an internal user can be an
external user could be an external
system and and and it doesn't have to be
an application it could be a sysadmin
you're managing systems inside of your
company so and a vulnerability it
doesn't really have to be a
vulnerability it could also be a mistake
somebody makes a mistake input and and
your website goes down that is just as
big of a catastrophe as if you were
hacked right yeah so the first one is
the most important one and it is a very
common one especially if you're in
charge of some kind of legacy legacy
system and very often you'll find this
in the public sector where they have
some kind of magic box somewhere which
is in charge of something that was
written in COBOL in the eighties nobody
knows how it works and you don't even
have a COBOL programmer anymore so if
somebody reports something there you're
in big trouble because you think it's
some kind of really old version of
Solaris running there too and this is
this is a problem because you can end up
in this in this even with brand-new
software if you are you are shipping
some kind of Internet of Things device
and you're relying on the user to
actually plug in your thing and update
it manually they want all experience has
shown us a user initiated updates only
go for like 5% if you're lucky and it
depends really on your space if it is
some kind of hardware device you can put
and practically go for zero so there are
many different ways that you can end up
in a problem here but most likely if
you're in charge of some kind of legacy
system it is the fact that you can't
even build this application see if you
have to fix a bug in it and then you you
don't you don't even have a build
environment for it so if you're going to
start protecting yourself from this kind
of thing is basically to see what kind
of systems you have and then try to set
up some kind of way of getting the
source code getting a way to build it
getting a build environment so that when
you get a report you can actually fix it
and because worst case you'll end up
with you have a binary blob and you have
to do like a binary patch cross your
fingers and hope you don't have another
one
and so there's solutions here but we can
give like other types of examples like
the Internet of Things you have lots of
and and this I think is it's sort of
like the history of embedded right we
were in the beginning of the embedded
things they were not connected to the
Internet but so you had a tradition of
you shipping a device and you're giving
it to somebody and the relationship is
over they have it you don't have it
anymore
and then we connected this thing to the
Internet and then suddenly the whole
thing broke down because now suddenly
people can connect to this thing and you
end up having broadcasting sound from
your children's bedroom right and and
you have an other issue and this is like
not even a legacy thing but if you have
you bought a product at some point and
then the company you bought it from they
went out of business
and now suddenly there's a known
vulnerability in this product that you
have and there's no maintenance on it so
how are you going to deal with that all
of these become the the reason this this
becomes your problem the moment you
depend on something and and then you
have to figure out how you want to deal
with it so if it is something there you
can get the code for then just set up a
normal build development environment put
it in a darker image somewhere make sure
that you can build a try and make sure
that what you have is something you
built yourself and that is that is a big
problem you have something that you
don't really know how it's built and now
you're trying to build it yourself but
at least if you manage to make something
that is functionally the same at least
now you know what you're shipping no you
know what's running and you know that
you can fix it but although all the rest
of stuff is like normal development
practices that you would have in any
kind of active development project
problem is that this thing was never in
your active development it's just
something that's running somewhere so
the fix for this is you have to ship it
somehow so you have to get the fix if
you manage to fix the vulnerability you
have to fix it the fix to your user the
problem is the user could be far away
usually be on the other side of the
world and you have no contact with them
so how are you going to get your fix
from inside of your office to
their toy in somebody's bedroom in
Brazil and if you haven't set this up
beforehand it's going to be very very
hard to be able to ship this and you've
seen this in the automotive the industry
they have this problem like if they have
a bug in the car then they generally
have to take all the cars back it's very
expensive
and now you have over-the-air updates of
cars because cars are ruling laptops
these days but you basically want
something like that you want to be built
in Auto update from the beginning so
that you have a deployment channel to
all of these things that you are in
charge of right and if this is shelf
where I would say if I would say if you
can then choose some kind of open source
solution because if you do then you know
you can fix it later the problem is if
you choose another supplier a
professional supplier and they go out of
business you in the same problem again
and second one is a very common problem
I think everybody can relate to it it is
no control over dependencies and this is
a big ball of mud but basically this is
the framework avalanche right this
explosion where you end up depending on
stuff you don't even know what you're
depending on because the transitive
dependencies are so massive that you're
basically pulling in like all of NPM or
you really don't have control anymore
and and the thing is it's not really
your fault because it's kind of set up
that way the whole industry is set up
that way but the problem is now suddenly
you you can have things that you're
pulling in that is causing risk to your
project so there are many ways that this
can bite you in many different ways like
I talked about frameworks but you can
have things like the operating systems
on the machines in your company but you
can also have the operating system
version that your customer is running so
let's say that you're shipping an app
for Android and your Android has has a
huge portion of Android phones in the
world are on outdated Android versions
that have known vulnerabilities in them
so you now suddenly that's this is like
it's not even your phone and suddenly
now it's your problem because if your
application can be exploited through
library
inside of somebody's phone and Malaysia
then suddenly that is your problem so
there are many many different ways and
I'll give it a couple of examples these
are some of them are a little bit like a
year or two ago but I think they there
are all examples of stuff you couldn't
imagine beforehand and there was in
stage fright there were bugs in in in in
the multimedia library on Android it's
basically the parsing of media files so
and and you would of course use the
media library on Android to do media in
your app you would do that that's what
you do you don't ship your own media
library you use the one that's that and
especially because it has hardware
acceleration and all sorts of things and
so you would use it you would use
OpenSSL on the operating system of all
your things and you wouldn't think about
it and now suddenly this is your problem
and then of course the very famous left
pad incident everything so you don't
know about the very famous left pad
incident is that this is this is this is
a the the pity me of the the JavaScript
framework explosion right you end up
pulling in this like micro library
that's supposed to like a pet like
prepend some spaces it's like I don't
know ten lines of JavaScript and and
some guy gets pissed off and he pulls it
over and PM and he breaks ten to 20
percent of the internet and this was not
on anybody's list of things that were
afraid of so how are you going to deal
with this dependency problem and
basically it's trying to get an overview
at least trying to get an over what are
your dependencies what are the versions
do you need them are these up streams
dependable like you've had problems now
where for example people have extensions
in their browser and then somebody buys
their extension and they have a massive
install base and now they're using it to
as a deployment channel for deploying
malware or Bitcoin miners to your users
it's like this is not something that
somebody installed you
Extension ever thought about right and
and these things are difficult so you so
this is basically just a plain kind of
software auditing and and trying to get
an overview but you won't eliminate all
your risk but you will be aware of a lot
of it and that's what it is if some
somebody reports there is a
vulnerability and a certain version of a
library you know what version you're on
and you know maybe ok if I adjust the
version on this and I have to adjust all
of these as well and you know that's
going to take three weeks because you've
done it before so how did people deal
with these that we talked about earlier
and with stage fright and also to a
certain extent heartbleed if it was on a
system that could not be updated let's
say an old Android phone app started
working around it because basically most
of these are at least especially stage
fright if you could sanitize the input
before you sent it into the library then
you could protect yourself from the
vulnerability so that's what some did
like the Firefox browser did was hardly
mostly everybody was pushing everybody
to update and patch an update and patch
but there's lots of systems that are
still running with her plea and with
left pad it's yeah people just stopped
depending on left pad but it didn't
really stop them it's like left pad was
only an example right but everybody felt
that left pad was a little bit too
embarrassing ok the team is gone it's
also a very common problem but it's also
come problem in many different ways very
often you will have companies where
they're not primarily a software company
so they will have like like department
that does something and then you know
they have a project and they hire in a
bunch of consultants to do these things
and then at a certain point the project
is over because people who don't work in
IT actually believe that things can be
over and then they send everybody home
and now there's a vulnerability in this
thing and nobody in your company has
even seen the code and they open it up
and it's like how do you even deal with
this and but it could also be that you
know they were fired
they were downsized these people and the
the problem is that people don't realize
especially management often realized
that a lot of the knowledge about your
system is in people's heads and when
those people disappear large portions of
the knowledge inside of your company
also disappears and but you can also had
then you had an outsourced all along
right somebody somebody else did it and
then at a certain point you had to take
it in or they delivered it to you and
but still you have no knowledge of it
and then you have this bus factor which
I think almost every project has some at
least one or two of those indispensable
people that are like when they go on
vacation everybody says no nobody knows
how to build this thing and and those
those people are the good thing about
them is the people who do this are
generally they don't leave because
they're set they'll never get down
sights like no matter what happens they
are this is job security you are
indispensable but the thing is they
might you know they like it hot and they
might get sick they might go on like a
sabbatical or they might do something
and this is a risk that you have if a
lot of the major part of the knowledge
in your companies in somebody's head so
in the public sector you will often see
that people try to take it back try to
take it on again because I think people
are realizing more and more that IT is
not a department IT is our business it
is the core of our business no matter
what your business is and we're also
seeing that more in the public sector
also they're realizing that actually
computer systems is public sector and
instead of it being just a department
but it is it's a growing process and
what the Bandon frameworks yeah you have
lots of the independent like
interdependency stuff you can't upgrade
something because then you have to
upgrade something else we can't upgrade
that and then you're sitting on an old
version you try to patch the one that
you have which is basically a fork and
then in this this can lead you into a
very strange place and this is the fix
you have to own it you have to actually
take it on I know it was somebody else's
problem and I know
you didn't like them because that's the
thing you generally feel like somebody
dropped a big bowl of mud on you right
now you have this big problem and you
didn't even make this problem and it
doesn't feel fair but to move on this is
a psychological process you kind of have
to come to the stage you have to accept
it you have to accept that this problem
is now yours and you have to take it on
and own it and and figure out how can i
what do I need to change for me to feel
responsible for this thing what do I
need to change for me to take it in to
my house you know in the public sector
you saw a lot of back sourcing and but
then for abandoned frameworks you can
try to replace with an equivalent or
remove the dependencies and things like
that but one of the things that I think
is very important is that if you want to
really experience the end users
situation because very often you will
see that you people complain that the
user did something stupid and I I don't
like that because your users should be
your friends it should be family you
should care about them but very often
you don't really understand their
situation unless you use the systems
unless you use the application yourself
and so I think that that is a goal in
itself to try to be a user of anything
that you make so that you have the user
experience so and this this is the one
that everybody is afraid of and this is
the one that I think is the easiest
there is some kind of vulnerability in
your code and the reason why it's easier
and these are many different ways that
that can happen but the reason why it's
easier is because if you have a
development project and you have the
code and you're working on the code then
basically you have a build environment
you have configuration you have your
handling your configuration handing your
builds your handling your version
control you have your developers they
know the code you have generally
deployment channel you might even have
auto update I mean you are set for
pushing this fix this is like this
should be you find it you fix it you
push it and you're done it's fabulous
but even though and this is an example
from Norway today i'ma - no no it's just
it's a chain of grocery stores in Norway
it says it's the biggest one and we're
not really good at diversifying this
grocery store so we have like three
chains and they're exactly the same but
this is one of the biggest ones and they
had made an app for their customers and
they'd only had an in place store for
like two months and then the thing is it
was very popular because it's a very
popular chain of grocery stores and so
they ended up having quickly over
throughout those two months maybe 15% of
the Norwegian population to download and
install this app that's quite it's very
successful really and of course then
somebody had to have a look right and
every and this whole one you good he he
realized that he could retrieve all
sorts of grocery shopping information
about anybody using credentials that
were hard-coded in an app and then he
tried to report this and that's this is
back to to being able to handle the
reports coming in if you are not
prepared if your organization is not
prepared then what happened to him is
going to happen with you because
basically this was handled by PR and
marketing and PR and marketing they have
one job they should defend the brand
right so he's coming here with this like
super negative exploding thing and they
totally went after him they they they
managed to say both at the same time
that they were not hacked and that he
hacked them I am not really sure how
that actually were and then they said
they would report him to the police and
of course that was the absolute worst
they exploded in all of the newspapers
right because basically what you're
showing in that kind of situation is
that you don't have control that's what
everybody thinks it's like you have all
of this personal information but you
don't have any control and you don't
care about security and I can trust you
and basically you went from defending
the branch actually just destroying the
brand
and the thing is this was the best
okay scenario this should have been
perfect all they had to do was say thank
you and this they had they had all of
the developers there there were
everybody this was an active project
they had and it was only an app it was
in Play Store they could even push the
changelog to the end user so the user
could see on that phone that it was
fixed I mean this is like this is set
for success but even then if you don't
realize that PR and marketing is also a
part of security in the organization
suddenly this can happen to you I have
another example which turned out totally
different but it's probably also
horrible at the time so you have the
normal things like you have to live it
you have to this isn't something that is
you can't do security and then you're
done it's something that you kind of
have to do all along it's a part of your
process
and that's also a thing that I want you
can't make it secure no things will be
out of your control you make mistakes
you what you have to do is you have to
set up something so that you can survive
it if something bad happens then you
have a way of handling it and you can
handle it in a way that is professional
but it's true throughout the talk is if
you can't ship the fix then it doesn't
matter there's no reason to fix
something if you can ship the fix to the
end-user so that is always where you
have to begin and I'm going to take this
is another example and I really I found
it really interesting because I saw it
happening live on
I was following them on Twitter at the
time and it was an accident right there
was a sysadmin he was doing regular
maintenance you know to do digital and
then something he wasn't in a not the
place he thought he was and then there
was a service in the RM - our F star our
incident and he basically deleted
everything they had and you know people
noticed so suddenly everybody's like
well what happened what happened
everything's gone what happened and they
were like the thing is they went out and
they said they said this this
we had assist someone that we were doing
regular maintenance there was an
accident we didn't add this right away
there's my time set it and then they
went but don't worry we have backups and
then you saw in real time as backup
number one backup number two backup
number three failed and they were live
tweeting this thing can you imagine
being the person sitting there doing
this and having this massive failure
being broadcast on internet live I'm
sure it was horrible and but the thing
is but the thing that I I really found
fascinating about this thing is to a big
section of their public they gained the
trust by in something that was basically
a massive disaster and what when the
reason why they gained Trust is because
after this entire gruesome ordeal and
I'm sure some psych care psychiatric
treatment was necessary after this uh
all of their users knew two things about
them one they will never have a backup
fail ever they will test all of their
backups they will make sure this is
going to be the most safe backup system
ever invented because they never want to
do this again it was horrifying but
secondly they won't hide it from you if
something happens they won't hide it
from you and we've seen cases in this
year with Equifax with many of these
companies where they have lost tons of
sensitive information about people and
they just didn't tell anybody and what
you know about these people is first
they're gonna take their backups really
seriously but secondly if something
happens even if it's horrifying they
will tell you and this builds trust and
can you imagine having this an absolute
disaster and actually gaining trust I
talked to people who said that they've
switched from github to get lab because
of this incident
this is the last of my challenges right
and it is my boss made me do it and I
think we have to bring it up because
there's something that we don't talk
about a lot what if what you're set told
to do is the bug what if your boss tells
you to do something that you know you
shouldn't do and it could be that you
know you know it's as you're creating a
security issue for your user you might
be as a privacy problem for your user
but it might be unethical or it might be
blatantly illegal the thing that you
have been told to do and how are you
gonna handle it I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna
give an example because and this I also
found very interesting at the time it
was a game and they had they had a new
version and they had something they
called an anti crack solution I liked
when they had like fancy names for stuff
and basically it was a driver and then
they installed the driver in the user
system and then they could sniff around
and like poke around and check and stuff
but basically this driver what it did
was it basically you could send it in a
function pointer and it would execute
whatever you sent in with kernel
privileges it's very useful and in in
the security business they offer calls
things like that in this class of things
often a rootkit and the unfortunate
thing is that when you first have this
installed in the user system than
anybody can use it right it's not just
the game but the thing that fascinated
me about this thing was that if you know
how to write a driver you know this is a
bad idea I cannot imagine that the
person who did this was not perfectly
understanding that this was really dumb
and we should not do this so the what
made me think was like why didn't you
say anything and I think that is
something that is much bigger than our
teens because what I see for example in
Norway we it's very very difficult to
fire somebody in Norway
extremely difficult like it's such a big
process you generally try to make them
quick so at what you see then you build
a culture where people are not afraid to
be fired and when people are not afraid
to be fired they're much more honest
with you
so in Norway you can have somebody it
was like two steps down going up to his
boss's boss and saying that this project
is dumb and shouldn't be done and
getting away with it that's the thing
that you would do but I would see when I
was working in Cisco which is like a
global company we had like this huge
team in the US and then we had a team in
Norway and the cultures were so
different and I talked to some of these
people in the US and I was like so what
do you guys say when he was like you
know this thing is dumb and they were
like no because they have they have
maybe one day notice maybe two weeks
notice they live in a country where very
often they're the sole provider for
their families and they live in a
country that has no universal health
care so you think somebody's going to
risk their entire family's health care
their entire family's income or their
home to help the company no they won't
they will shut up and they will say yes
sir I'll do that right away sir and then
they'll be on LinkedIn trying to get
another job so so how so the thing is
it's it's very difficult to fix those
high level stuff like you can't make
workers rights be something in your
country it's very difficult to solve
this problem as an individual and so I
talked to many people and I realized
that one solution that a lot of people
have done and that worked in real life
is is find a powerful ally and this is
sort of it's something that people do a
lot but it's sort of like you whisper to
somebody at the coffee machine something
that you think they should do and it's
the CTO and you know that it will end up
in a meeting and that somebody gets done
it's the sort of like that so you have
to figure out somebody high up in the
organization that you can talk to and
they just kind of bring it up and the
thing is what you're hoping is that this
person will then say oh I think this is
dumb but they have the clout to pull it
off right and then you and when the
whole thing trickles now
- your lovely getting but oh really and
then you get away with it so you managed
to actually stop something that you
don't want to do without having to deal
with the fallout of being difficult
right and I have at the last last resort
and I have to point out I consider to be
a last resort not because of the company
but because of you and that is public
whistleblowing and the reason for that
is it's really bad for your CV it's
really you know you might you might get
away with it it's like you I I don't
there are not many companies they're
gonna love you if you out them in the
newspaper but maybe you get away with it
I don't know but the thing is this going
to be very difficult to get that other
job afterwards because they're googling
you they'll figure out this is the
person that runs to the newspaper about
stuff and they're not gonna hire you so
I would be very careful about a public
whistleblowing um or just like I'm not
going to do this and quit no it's like
if you if you get into the point where
you're gonna quit be on LinkedIn call
all your contests I'm looking for
something different don't like that I'm
really happy but I'm thinking maybe a
little change would be good don't say
anything just go and then was the end
people like well why are you leaving are
you unhappy it's like no no no I just
thought I would have a little change and
if it's really really bad and you really
can't stay because they're asking you to
do something illegal and you know you
have to quit you're like um no I I
decided to spend more time with my
family that's what all the politicians
say they're always going to spend some
time with their families right so don't
don't think you are too small and it's
too much risk so don't take it on you
but don't do anything illegal because a
guy just went to jail and he was just an
engineer went to jail over the over the
Volkswagen diesel fumes thing there
wasn't a manager who went to jail it was
an engineer that went to jail can you
imagine being convicted because somebody
told you to like fiddle with the test
results of diesel fumes so
be careful but don't do anything illegal
because you might end up in jail and
there's you have these unsung heroes
that manage to change things inside of
their companies by but this is very
office politics see stuff right if
you're managing to pull it off or if you
know somebody who's really good at
office politics that can do it for you
then you kind of have to fiddle it a
little bit but you have like crazy last
resort like Edward Snowden where you
just go like and then you hide in Russia
and most people can't do that so there's
a lot of different things you have to
ship it you have to try to get control
over it you have to try to own it you
have to try to make it yours you have to
live it you have to have a process on
doing this as you go and you have to try
to protect it from the really dumb stuff
but if you're going to remember anything
is on this slide you need a security
hotline you need somebody in some way
for people to contact you you have to
ship your fix you have to figure out how
you're gonna ship for all of your things
how are you going to ship and then you
can't do it on your own there are people
all over the organization are going to
be instrumental to make use is that it's
successful and there's another
discipline in that and that comes now
and that's designing the user experience
of security and I'm going to give you a
screen shot and I hope people will
recognize it maybe that you've seen it
and like the last couple of weeks
everybody know what this is yeah for you
don't know what this is
this is the unfortunate screen ah that
and and you can ignore that the red and
the green stuff that was me trying to be
helpful so you would see it but
basically this is the the screen where
somebody clicked wrong and caused all of
Hawaii to think that we're gonna die I
don't think anybody in this room would
design anything like this but you we
can't fault this guy I'm a serious you
can't fault this guy for clicking the
wrong thing and and like somebody joked
on Twitter's like
you slack yeah or have used if you do
like at everyone or at channel you get
this little thing going are you sure you
want to do this because you're going to
hit this many people this many times
those and then somebody joked like yeah
when everyone has a better security user
interface then this missile missile
warning system and this is a problem and
there are many many reasons why this is
wrong and first of all the users won't
read people and generally will try like
engineers will go like yeah we'll write
lots of warnings so put like a warning
triangle and we'll do all these things
to make the user not do this right but
the user is not interested in all of
your text they're not gonna read it all
they want is to make it go away because
they have a thing that they want to do
and it's on the other side of all of
your stuff so they're gonna try to make
this thing whatever you put out and go
away if they can make it go in any way
they can then will make it go away and
they will not read anything to get there
so you have to try to make less is more
don't have so much text don't actually
ask the user just don't just go like
this is the right well this is the right
thing to do don't ask your users should
do you want to send this encrypted or
not encrypted and your user will go like
what is encrypted I don't know maybe
it's magic
probably best to do without magic no
don't ask the user just say send right
there's no reason why the user should
know how this thing is sent and and and
make sure that the defaults are the good
ones that that you know if you just
click Next you'll end up in the right
place the good place the safe place when
you know that the user will only try to
get rid of this dialog you put there to
make sure that their default behavior is
going to be the thing that puts them in
the right place but if you really really
really have to and I say most the time
you don't but if you really really have
to then explain it with language that
the user understands and this is
something that we're really bad at we've
gotten much better at graphical design
except this Hawaiian system we've got
much better at user experience
accept this alliance system um but we're
still really really really bad at
language in this business and and we and
we don't even realize very often that
we're bad with language we use words
then have a certain amount a certain
meaning in our our profession and we
give them to a user that is not in that
profession and they have a totally
different meaning to that word and I
have I have a non tech example of this I
have a daughter and she's sad 17 I had
it when I was 21 so I was young and it
was great having a teenager but um she's
like in all sorts of fandoms and she was
like and she had like these people that
she wants to hook up and like this
whatever fandom universe that they is in
and she'd go like I ship this person and
this person that's something that she
says right and then when I talk I say
that I ship a product so this is like a
joke we have where we like pretend play
with her meaning where in my context
when she plays with with my meaning in
her context which makes no sense at all
but the thing is when we bring in her
grandma ship means totally it's either a
boat or you send something by mail but
it has nothing to do with the product or
people hooking up and the thing is that
very often we do this and you'll see
this more and most explicitly in
translations that you will you will have
some external company and translate your
strings for your UI and then we'll come
back and the thing is if you don't have
a native speaker you'll go like yeah
this is probably good I don't understand
how you will fit it on my button it's
good unfortunately Dutch I have to have
a bigger button but it's it's true um
but the thing is if you don't have a
native speaker that understands the
application they can't even tell you
that is wrong and and you you can like
what I saw in Opera and in Vivaldi we
had volunteers that did translations and
then in one way you could say like oh
that's very unprofessional but the
people who did it they weren't
enthusiastic about the product they used
the product they it's like they knew
everything when they made like and and
they were the reason why they did the
translation was because they
did their countrymen to use this
fabulous thing that they had you know
and so that all of the strings they were
they were localized to local meanings to
local expressions and then when I was at
Cisco they decided I was going to
professionalize all of this they put it
out to an external company they sent to
all the strings they sent a little
explanation of the context of all the
strings and then the translations came
back and they were horrible they were
like and and and you realize that this
word means three different things and
they translated to the totally wrong
thing behind we had one thing which was
a concept of the active speaker I wasn't
it was a teleconference that's right so
you had a person I was the talker it was
translated to being the active speaker
but in this case speaker being a speaker
like like up there like like a speaker
and a microphone kind of speaker which
isn't even a person it doesn't make any
sense and and we saw things like that
over and over again so if you're going
to use language be very explicit but
also you have my last example in this
case is something window stood and they
are in the 90s they would have the
dialogue if they had a crash you get a
dialogue up and instead like an illegal
action was performed and they used it
goes like I'm sorry I'm gonna call the
police I don't know if I click okay will
it be okay like I don't know what
happened I I did something apparently I
did something wrong I don't know what I
did yeah and we do this okay
so just be careful and and your users
are going to be trusting and don't blame
them for that they have other concerns
in their life they're going to be
trusting and we have to try to do as
much as we can to put them in a good
place so they're going to trust you with
all sorts of things they're going to
trust you with their baby pictures now
you're gonna say you you can put them in
your cloud I feel they're safer there
than in my house right and what happens
when the backups fail or somebody's baby
pictures right you can't do that again
so you have to be trustworthy you have
to realize that people trust you and you
have to
feel that responsibility of being able
to live up to that trust so remember
everybody is an expert everybody in your
company they have different roles they
can work in PR or marketing or they can
work as a sysadmin though they can be
something but they're experts in their
area and they will be instrumental to
making security work in your company so
these were the challenges
hopefully you have ideas for your own
projects and you have to realize that
you can do all of these things but you
have to design for security in your user
interfaces you have to design for it you
have to make sure that the user is set
up for success and don't end up with a
bunch of links with lots of text and
they end up sending scaring the life out
of all of Hawaii and that's my talk make
it fixable and I have I come I come from
you've all day I make a browser I have
some stuff that is here and the t-shirts
are only women's cut thank you guys so
please take them so I don't have to take
them home so so even if your guy you can
take when you have a girlfriend right
thank you
