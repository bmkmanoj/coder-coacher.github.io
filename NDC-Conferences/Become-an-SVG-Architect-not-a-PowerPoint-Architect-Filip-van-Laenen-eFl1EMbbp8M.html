Philip Allen and I'm going to talk about
being in SVG architect and why you
should become one instead of being in a
PowerPoint architect I'm not going to
talk about the practice of being a Power
Point architect so I'm not going to talk
about what it is so that is a good thing
or a bad thing on how to become one or
how to avoid to become one I'm just
going to talk about power point as an
architecture drawing tool and my problem
well it's not just about power point
leader it's also the same for keynote
and for impress the problem with power
point is that every drawing that you
make in PowerPoint you're drawing an
architecture it looks at PowerPoint II
and is the same for impress and keynote
they look so impressive as a keynote II
because it's the same color if you just
use the default shapes and you don't do
anything special with it the same kind
of style strokes the lines every drawing
looks the same so you drawing won't look
differently from somebody else's
architecture drawing and if you're doing
a presentation for a customer they won't
remember it this is how the same drawing
looks in SVG so I'll just made the same
drawing but look at small details like
getting the colors right that's much
easier if you start with SVG and you
don't have a default color set it seems
to get it right but you can do better
styling get the strokes in there you can
have from rounded corners completing a
glow can put in a shadow so these are
all sorts of things that you can do in
PowerPoint we present keynote ooh
but if you do it in SVG SVG drawing -
it's easy to actually do it to take the
time to do it because by default it lags
if you're going to remember one lady
from this picture which one is it going
to be it's the one the doubt stands
right so styling methods unfortunately
the best drawing you make if it looks
dull because it's a PowerPoint
architecture type of drawing your
customer probably won't remember it I
think you will remember the lady in red
star matter so you have to get the
colors right use the your company's
palette you have to do so work with the
styling like the strokes and the arrows
stuff like that you may want to put this
on glow or shadows but don't need to
don't put too much in it because
sometimes if you overdo it it starts to
look a little bit silly you can use
shades and it customize it the way you
want them I can get the forms right it's
much easy to do it in SVG if you need
custom shapes you have the whole
Internet of your open library for
clipart and it's open as in open to
reuse open to modify open to extent and
if you do something smart with it please
also remember to share it but these are
just some shapes that are picked from
from the internet if you need something
like a map or a flag or something like
that you can actually use the whole
Wikipedia because most of the drawings
in Wikipedia are SVG based so you can
just pick it from there
apply your style to it and use it in
your presentation or a drawing as if you
made it yourself that's sometimes quite
impressive I have had presentations for
people just remember the representation
from the Norway map with analytic colors
SVG is scalable so it means that if you
want to blow it up or you want to only
use a detail of one of those icons
that's not probably you can just enlarge
it without any problem
and at the last resort you can also do
free drawing you can of course do free
drawing in PowerPoint or keynote in
interest too but it is not the same
thing you're very limited to these kind
of shapes and arrows and the slice they
provide
if you want to use it - I can recommend
Inkscape which is a very good one it's
open-source you can download it and use
it on any operating system so this is
how it looks like it maybe need a better
argument is that SVG is XML so you have
joins its source code so you can pretend
you're doing technical work as a power
point architect you can even do some
programming because it's XML it can
replace the colors from red to a little
bit more yellow kind of color just by
opening up your document in a text
editor and do a search and replace
I think that's difficult in in
PowerPoint to do you can even change the
phone just by doing your research and
replace on the XML file and for example
adapt to drawing from one style to
another style just by scripting it
that's cool so not just the PowerPoint
architect with where everybody's
laughing Ikki you can actually pretend
you one of the guys on the floor as we
do is also part of html5 so anybody can
view it if you have a browser that
supports html5 you can look at the
drawing so you can send it out nobody
has any excuse to say oh I can't open it
because I don't have this your installed
everybody can import it you can actually
import SVG into PowerPoint and everybody
can reuse it and if you share it on the
Internet to the library even better just
as a note whenever I put a drawing on an
internal wiki or something I exported to
PNG just to be sure that looks good
but differently if you look at the
source code you can see things like text
rectangular ellipse so you can actually
understand and do stuff inside the XML
document fix small things to get it just
right just the way you want it
so next time you're going to make it
drawing which one do you want to make
the dull one with the power pointy
colors you want to have one that's a bit
more outstanding SVG is an open standard
because there's no default styling it it
helps you to actually use some time and
attention to put the style on it so you
get a better style a final you can
pretend to you're actually doing some
technical work good luck Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
