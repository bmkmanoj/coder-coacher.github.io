I am working at an in-house system for
our sellers like for sellers at our
company to do place orders and stuff
we're already married they have to use
my software they don't have a choice so
it turns out that's when it's even more
important what a good to us because
every minute that your sellers spend in
your system that they don't actually
have to spend in your system but they do
because your system is complicated
that's money lost by our company every
time they can't place an order because
simply too hard to figure out how to
this money lost for your company and
every time they place the wrong order
but not only money lost by your company
but that's a customer loss to your
sellers right so bad us can cost a lot
of money I know there's like firsthand
and my my team for example and some of
my teammates do a lot of admin in
internal tools and these internal tools
no one cares about you guys so they
spend hours and hours and hours doing
useless stuff that the system should be
doing for them like making a decision to
go for me to be in fact UX is very
little to do with graphical design and
stuff like that you would have often
thought of something but some arts
majors should do like not really as
developers we should be thinking about
things like which dependency injection
sheehan scheme we should use or how to
architect the system but it's super
important to think about dux part two
and we are the people who can do that
the UX is hard because it's kind of a
subjective subject it's kind of like the
touchy-feely thing does this feel right
Stace like there is no patterns and
practices when it comes to you XO stay
and wait or patterns and practices for
how you should order your files and in
an angular application for example but
lucky for us these guys sleeve hurts
Mike Medlock
and it used to be us researchers at
Microsoft working in the xbox team and
what they did was they did a systematic
approach to two ux something that when i
first slide it appealed really i'll make
it appeal a lot to me as a developer
because it's very like step by step and
not so subjective it's like very
beginning you can feel it so what I did
was they took about a hundred years of
user interface research obviously not
all computer user interface research but
the research of the user interfaces of
everyday things because it turns out
that your user interface of the computer
is not all that different to you to user
interface of of any kind of machine or
any kind of object in fact i'm going to
say while i'm using a lot of windows
stuff in this talk because i'm from
microsoft this has nothing to do with
Microsoft Technology so windows or
anything tasty user interfaces in
general so what he did was they took all
this research and they said all these
smart people they talk about user
interfaces what is it that there really
are talking about like what are the
common things that they say a good user
is they should do and what are the
common things do they say it shouldn't
do and they came up with a system called
tenets and traps what's in it there are
nine of them and we're going to go
through them that a tenet is basically
an attribute of a good user interface
something that all user interfaces
should have and then there are traps
that are problems that degrade good
interface design and we're going to take
a look at some of them too and to do
that we're going to take a look at
something that's not a computer well it
kind of is a computer but not in in in
the same sense that we might think would
so obviously a self-service checkout
system and we're going to go through all
the tenants in the context of this not
necessarily really in the context of
this we're going to get a little bit
more involved and go to Sweden where
this is our
service checkout system it's actually I
think it has a better user interface I
think there's an echo let's see so sorry
the first thing so in Sweden the way it
works is that you go to one of these
fans you swipe a loyalty card and the
swiping up devoid of the card is kind of
important because not only do they make
you do the work but they should be doing
like the cheers work but they also check
everything like they kind of have a
record of who you are and what you're
buying so they can send your
personalized ads and stuff like that so
you're doing this for them and you give
a lot of good way a lot of data but
that's not what this is about so you
pick up one of these scanners and then
you walk around store scan the items and
at the end you leave the scanner in the
stand and you swipe the loyalty card
again and you check out you're done so
when you get to this the very first time
you're going to use this it needs to be
easy to understand what you should do it
needs to be easy to understand that you
should swipe the card pick it up it
should be easy to understand how you
should scan the items so the first
tenant is understandable that's the
first attribute because if it wasn't
what would happen is that you would
never use this like you would rather go
to the cashier and and and have them
scan the things for you or if they would
have to have a cashier kind of explained
things for you it would be useless to
the stores because then it would have to
employ the cashiers to do the work
anyways that you want to avoid for them
too now each of these tenets like
understandable it's an adjective and
then it comes with a sentence so when
you look at these and you hear the
sudden like if you look at someone using
your user interface let me say oh I know
what I can do then it is understandable
so that's kind of least explaining what
it's done it is
if on the other hand they say I don't
know what to do then it's not
understandable and then you have to go
down and look at what traps you might be
running into and kind of try to avoid
them so that is the first of mine the
next one is that it has to be fiscally
effortless to use this if you're not
developing a game it should be
physically effortless to use your your
software specifically effortless meaning
that if you know what to do it should be
easy to do it so in the case of the
scanner and the way you're going to work
this is you're going to use the scanner
in one hand you're going to pick up like
a bad you start putting things in and
scanning them so in the case of the
scanner you need to you need to be able
to do everything one-handed for example
if you can't do it with one hand like it
requires two hands it just becomes too
physically too hard to execute us
physically also other things you need to
think about in this case aside for
example when you do scales it shouldn't
be hard to kind of hit the target no
matter what the lighting is and
everything so if it is hard that's also
not specifically advertised if you know
what to do you should be able to do it
like super quickly it also have to be
responsive responsive meaning that for
example when you do scan them items it
should give immediate feedback so it
should give off a beep or something
because if it doesn't give off that we
then what's going to happen is you're
going to start scanning like two or
three times because you don't realize
that the you actually did beep something
and you're going to end up paying for in
our three cartons of milk instead of one
which is it would be kind of annoying
now there are some things that take a
lot longer than is likely now the
millisecond Sydney but do you need for
the response but in that case you have
to have some feedback telling you that
we're working on it but for simple
things it should give immediate feedback
it should also be efficient officials
meaning that
you should do things and a few steps as
possible or at least in a few perceived
sex as possible so in the case of the
scanner if you want to scan like tennis
things less steps might be scanning
something clicking on the plus sign and
typing into number 10 or in number 9 but
that wouldn't be very efficient in this
case because that would mean I have to
change hands so efficiently doesn't
necessarily always mean less stuff this
means less proceed steps or more
efficient in this case it needs to be
forgiving for giving meaning that if you
did something wrong you should be able
to undo it unless it's something that's
like you exploded a nuclear plant and
you can't undo but in most cases you
should be able to undo like for example
a perfect version of the the forgiving
software is word where you can basically
undo until you get to a blank statement
so I've heard I because I haven't
actually used the self-service checkout
here but I've heard that if you do scan
something twice here you have to call
Anna cashier to to undo so obviously
it's not forgiving if we didn't know how
would be with these scanners use- skin
if you if you happen to scan something
twice so that's pretty nice it should
also be discreet discreet meaning for
example it doesn't know we're here so if
you type in a password you shouldn't
echo the password back or a credit card
number or something like that or if you
do something wrong with a scanner it
shouldn't like beep really loud and kind
of alert everyone else attention or
maybe hey the girl mile 5 is buying a
whole lot of well private stuff one way
that it's not discreet in fact this
scanner system that we use the sweetness
and once you've scanned your loyalty
card you will get like a monthly
statement coming back saying here here's
your bonus
and here is twenty-five percent off on
on these things you buy regularly so
sometimes when I go to the store I like
to like buy a piece of chocolate or to
just kind of get a reward for going to
the grocery store yes my husband
necessarily doesn't necessarily need to
know that but we do get a whole lot of
twenty-five percent off chocolate bars
so that's not being discreet so in some
cases like a typical case of not being
discreet dislike it do you remember the
early days of Netflix where if you log
in via Facebook account it would pop up
and say what movies you were watching on
facebook yes I'm glad to change that so
it's being mindful of what you're
sharing it also needs to be protective
protective meaning that I don't lose my
data typical case where things are not
protective is whenever you fill out a
web form and then you go to the next
page and then you decide oh my god i
need to change something you go back and
suddenly the form is cleared at every
single time i have no clue why people do
this like that is not being protective
in the case of the scanner it turns out
it is actually very protective so one of
my friends her name is Jessica she does
like a lot of our hackathons so which
normally goes to the store before the
hackathons and by Spike energy drink
hundreds of them and pizzas and stuff
like that so she was at one time buying
all these things and she was kind of in
a hurry to get to the hackathon and it
turns out the scanner yes turned black
on her in the middle of the purchase so
she was like really don't really feel
like you know I was going about scanning
all these things again but she went to
cashier and nasty I need a new scanner
she was really really pissed but when
she got the new scanner the scanner had
all her items on there like so that was
an example of a very protective system
so that's the kind of stuff that Mesa go
ah this is really nice and I wasn't make
it feel warm and fuzzy about a user
interface it also needs to be
habituating habituating meaning that and
once you've done something two or three
times you should be able to do it
automatically so the first time you go
to the store and scan you might be like
kind of did I scan something or how does
this work and you know but the next time
and the next time in the next time it
should be automatic and shouldn't even
be thinking about having a scanner in
your hand typical things that are
habituating it's for example if you put
like the ok button always being in the
right place because if you switch things
around and you put the cancel button
where the ok button I'm supposed to be
that always ends up in disaster so you
want things to be easy to habituate and
finally last one and I'm not going to
spend pretty much any time on this but
I'm just leaving it in there is
beautiful beautiful doesn't necessarily
mean Mona Lisa beautiful and this is
like doesn't need it doesn't need to
have nice colors and unicorns and stuff
it does need to look professional it
doesn't need to be like me to look like
you actually did put some effort into
creating the user interface because if
you didn't put in the effort into making
a nice user interface how am I going to
trust that you did put some effort into
the Security section or into the
architecture as a whole I'm not going to
trust you with my credit card unless the
system looks professional so these are
dependent and then they come with a set
of traps by no means are we going to go
through all of these we're going to take
a few examples of the more common ones
but these are the traps and in fact they
look like cards because it is actually
physically a deck when you're using it
normally and but you don't have to worry
about that so much right now so the
elephant in the room
is that we're missing one of the items
or one of the attributes which is
intuitive everyone says that a good user
interface needs to be intuitive right
intuitive meaning that you can do
something least automatically like
without any conscious recent we're going
to do it a bit of a user study actually
I want you to stand up if you will and
we're going to use a very intuitive user
interface so how many of you played xbox
would connect know what not a single
person okay a PS Move like using yeah
okay so what I want you to do is I want
you to raise your right hand and kind of
grab grab onto the blue the blue box
there and then I'm going to display a
second screen and I want you to take us
from this screen to the next screen
would you suggest you're okay you guys
ready 123 okay pretty much everybody
look the same way going like this so
it's a very intuitive user interface it
goes all you what to do now we're going
to take this one more time and go one
two three okay how to looked a little
bit different suddenly it's not so
intuitive it will do one more try one
two three yeah okay so you can sit down
if you want to um what happened there
was or the reason the reason and be it
worked the first time and it didn't work
the second a third time it's because
there are no intuitive gestures there
are always things that we have learned
or we have yet to learn so the only
thing that you can hope for your
software to be is easily understood like
or understandable in fact the reason why
the first one worked is because there is
an equivalent in the real world
moving things but other isn't magic
there is no way you can copy things like
magic and a copier but um yeah there is
no gesture in the real world that goes
to to copy so let's go ahead and go to
the understandable part understandable
was has four different sets of tracks it
has perceptible noticeable
comprehensible and confirmatory so the
first one come precepted will main set
if you're going to perform a task if
they take a picture or something if
there's something on the screen that
will help you do that is there like a
button take picture or you certain like
it doesn't necessarily have to be
something you touch could be something
you hear or something you like something
you can speak or something but if it on
the screen and they are the second one
then noticeable is if it is on the
screen do you notice it so for example
if you if you go to a website and you
have like the five bars where the ad is
normally are and you put something in
there will probably not notice it
because it's not in your noticeable area
so to speak so perceptible noticeable if
it is there and you notice it do you
understand what this is for like what is
 this poor for example and
finally if you do something and if you
get feedback do you understand how to
handle that feedback so this is windows
8 and specifically male in Windows 8
does anyone know how to search for an
email in Windows 8 yeah so the way to
search for an email is windows in
Windows 8 is through the search charm
very few people even remember this this
is an invisible element it was never on
the screen and therefore it's like super
hard for people to to get it because
what they did was basically they went in
and showed you a quick video when you
install the windows 8 but my mom for
example I was the one installing her
windows 8 so she never got the video and
she doesn't she didn't know how to use
the Sharks were for example so this is
an invisible element they fixed it by
actually returning the search to the
screen so the reason they did this in
the first place was because they wanted
to do like a minimalized a Legum in
minimal user interface remove all the
chrome is focus on the content but
sometimes you can get a little bit too
far but adding back to search fixes that
problem now here's another minimal
define this is the Apple TV or at the
apple TV remote does anyone know how to
fast forward okay yeah 12 a couple of
people so the way to fast forward on the
apple TV is by pressing from the top
area on the right hand side also an
invisible element again a minimal design
where where you don't want fairly have
it looks like the regular remote
controls with all the buttons because
that's ugly and not only is like once
you want to know what to do like you'll
remember it and it's good problem is
that sometimes it's dark so sometimes
you don't even know which side is up and
down on this thing so there is a fix for
that so this is an invisible element and
affixes the rubber now i want to point
this out as an example of this is an
invisible element is generally a bad
thing to do invisible elements but
sometimes you have to make a trade off
and you have to think about like what is
it i want to accomplish with this and in
this case they wanted to accomplish your
really clean design like a clean-looking
design and the trade-off was the first
someone tries to fast forward they're
going to fail but the second time
they're going to fast forward they're
probably going to know how to do it
because once you'd know how to push like
once you know that this is a touchable
area it's good sometimes not all traps
aren't necessarily something that you
need to fix now this is like if it hold
up your thumb and hold it up kind of
this area this is how much you can see
it one so the nail of your of your thumb
approximately much thing that I see a
lot more she's got like crazy eyes I
don't know but it turns out that this is
really how much you can see it once and
what your brain does is it kind of still
send the whole picture or its filth in
at least a part of the picture the
things you need you need because it
works super fast scanning and putting
them together but our attention is
limited and we decide which parts of the
screen are going to be interesting at
this point or wish parts of the screen
that we're not expecting to find like
this particular item on so for damage
hold on one second
I can go to ok we're going to do sorry
about this I didn't want to start the
video before I got to tell you what to
do
okay so i'm going to show you a video
about basically how our attention is
limited and some of your mind may have
already seen this video but i still want
you to follow along and kind of do the
tasks if you will
everybody got that okay I'm not too yes
this guy this is michael madras by the
way the guy who a multi-disc
I think oh yeah it's highly disturbing
if you didn't see the gorilla the first
time watching it the second time so I'm
not going to ask how many people saw the
gorilla because i'm going to assume that
about half of you who hasn't seen this
before sadhus but how many people had
seen this video before okay and keep
your hands up now I don't all of you
like who didn't see the gorilla the
second time you didn't see the gorilla
yeah no I'm talking about like when you
saw the video again you didn't see the
gorillas okay impressive there's
normally out of the people who had seen
this video before pretty much all of
them will see the gorilla because they
know an expected to be there why is this
important well if you're reviewing your
own user interfaces it means that you
can't like unsee how to do the charms
bar or how to do fast forward as expect
that but I knew your new users will fail
to see so when you do reviews or two
phases have someone else use them and
watch them instead of like testing them
yourself but anyways eaten like you will
always miss things that you don't expect
to see so this is an early version this
is zach xbox 360 and actually not
something that went into production even
but where do i go to search for video in
this this is a one purpose left blurry
kind of only showing the places where
you focus so normally ninety percent of
all people would focus on this section
and expect to see the search here too so
maybe going into to the video app but
kind of expecting to see some kind of
search turns out this is where you're
supposed to
search in fact pressing the y on the on
the control this is called an
effectively invisible element just like
the gorilla like it was there but you
didn't see it or some people can see it
so sometimes you can have things on the
screen but no matter how many times you
look it will like they will not appear
today six days by by adding in the
search section right where your focus is
where this is a word 2007 where's the
print button here so the expectation at
least for me and for I think a lot of it
is that supposed to be file print right
but suddenly file didn't exist instead
like I said they put it on the system
menu which it's a non comprehend element
because you're not expecting it to be
there and in fact it doesn't even look
like a button it could be a logo or
something and they fix this by putting
back the file so if you've conditioned
from one over years and years to do
something don't go around changing it
it's stupid and they fixed it even in
Magadan update to to work 2007 this is a
an iphone i think maybe iphone one what
are you go to listen to music so I heard
something I tues turns out so what yeah
so you would kind of expect to go to
iTunes because that's the music notes
and everything so but it is ipod so this
is the case of
it looks right but it's wrong and the
trap here is something called an
inviting dead end which means that
you're going to always try it well
unless you actually know what to do
you're going to always try to go into
itunes and never find it sort of like a
nippy never find it is going to look
more in the itunes section you're not
actually going to go out and kind of
wander around the other ones so they fix
these two by changing and to a music
section down here now I should point out
it basically everything that I'm showing
here are things that are considered
pretty good user interfaces to begin
with so these very small flaws I'm
intentionally not putting things in here
that are considered super bad user
interfaces but used to show you that
even like people that are really good
definers they'll do a lot of a lot of
weird decisions sometimes now what is
this so this is a washbasin and reason
you know that is because there is a
sticker on alright if you have to put a
sticker on a washbasin I think you're
doing something wrong so for guys this
is an inviting dead end
and for women it's an unconference
didn't yes seriously it took kind of
transcended 22 non-computer things to
look at an election coming up in the
state I don't know why I'm saying a way
because I'm nothing to face but there
was an election in the year 2000 and i'm
not sure if any of you recall what
happened but was basically a battle
between boar and bush a lot of people
thought at Al Gore would win and then
there was this third guy Pat Buchanan
and he was I mean he didn't get no votes
but he didn't get like a whole lot of
road except for in Palm Beach and it
wasn't like he was campaigning doing all
his campaigning in Palm Beach this was
due to one of the biggest you i floss in
the US history i would say the florida
butterfly ballot you guys heard of this
so the way this worked was if you want
to vote for the Democratic Party you
were supposed to click like people who
voted for the Democratic Party would
click here because it seemed logical
they should have actually clicked here
they instead by clicking there they
managed to vote for Pat Buchanan's so
this might actually have lost al gore
like the potus position right so bad you
I or bad us could mean Oh give me a
pretty bad things if I decide this is
called poor grouping when the grouping
kind of like makes it hard for you to
see what you do what to do another
example of this I'm you to call so
clicking this button baby no this one
are they this happens all the time you
probably seem like there is a radio
button over here and a label over here
and yeah like so this exists everywhere
and then under is the confirmation so if
you get feedback you should it should be
actionable feedback like this one for
example in PowerPoint I know exactly
what to do I open up my debugger and I
figure out my truest national but yeah
my mom probably know so these were form
of the trap and in the understandable
section now this was a really long
session don't worry the other ones are
not going to be like that but
understandable habituating and efficient
are some of the like if you were to rank
these attribute those three would be
like these the more important ones
physically effortless have to do a lot
with targeting and readability so to
make some like to make an honest
physically effortless user interface you
would have really small buttons that no
one could reach or you would put for
example read text and a green background
preferably with the background scrolling
or something like that in super small
font but if you want to have physically
effortless user interface you would make
sure that people can read even if you're
doing something on a larger screen make
sure the text is bigger make sure the
contrast is mize and that the buttons
are actually targetable once things so
this is me playing one of my favorite
games lego star wars and i would like to
sit in the cell phone play this game but
I really can't read anything on the
screen like the figurines are super
super small so this game is not
physically effortless this was an
example of another game but until the
update was often master
the effortless because pushing this
retry button what you had to do a lot
was so much impossible but you want to
catch those polka this is an example of
like a spective user interface for a
messaging system or at least a mock-up
of a messaging system where you post
something and then someone else can go
ahead and like or comment or or flag as
inappropriate you might think that II
except for being ugly and things it's
not necessarily all that bad for as user
interface Co but once you put it in the
right screen you realize that targeting
those button means that when I actually
want to like something a probabilistic
like it is inappropriate so it's super
important when you do look at your user
interfaces that you do look at them in
the right context and you like
especially like if you look to things
like the scanner it has to be in the
context of someone actually going around
shopping and maybe in in a dark room or
yeah basically putting it in the right
context so the traps here is basically a
physical challenge and also something
called accidental activation for meaning
that I was trying to put like push the
like button but i guess the flag as
inappropriate i think this is the the
epitome of the accidental activation how
many of you have taken the screenshot
and accidentally shut off your phone
yeah so um there is there's even a
website talking about how to take
screenshots I think that kind of
explains the issue with screenshots but
this is of course accidental activation
because it's really hard to push them at
the same time and not manage to do the
power off and it's also an invisible
element which means that you're not
necessarily like at least me I don't
remember if it's like power and volume
down or was it home button or
mad especially because I change phones a
lot so that's a Trustin one thing you
see here is that sometimes there are
multiple traps in one single problem
there's usually one that's the more
problematic one and if you fix that root
problem the other one will go away too
so don't worry there are multiple you
fix the one and the other one will
probably go away responsiveness the
worst conference I think 2000 mine or
something where Google and Bing um did
the user research project where they
introduced latency on their search so
what I did was basically search for
something and then they decided to
introduce like you a thousand
milliseconds latency so one second
latency until you get the response back
and it turns out that when you add when
they added about a thousand milliseconds
of latency the quick trade went down by
one point nine percent and the revenue
per user like ad revenue producer went
down by two point eight percent if you
added another bit of latency it went
down like it mr. Scalise very very fast
you've probably been in this situation
where you go to website is performing
slowly and then you kind of let loose
concentrations you don't even remember
why you were there in the first place
and you go to the next tab may forget
about that website and suddenly that
responsibility that response bad
responsiveness cost of us as a customer
so responsiveness is really really
important for for a good user interface
now anything that is considered fast to
do like beeping should be you should get
an immediate response and if something
takes a little bit longer let's say it's
taking more than around half a second
you should always have some kind of
feedback like a spinner or something
and if it takes more than one to two
seconds that feedback has to be
continuous so it needs to continuously
tell you what it's doing or that
something is happening because we spoke
about the spinner then people are
eventually going to things I think that
things are hung efficiency is also kind
of divided into four different sections
so the first one being information
overload so this is how you find a jeep
dealer so this is in 2002 they had this
way to find a jeep dealer lots and lots
of texts some of this text is
essentially step-by-step instructions
but because of the way it's formatted
it's impossible to read so this text
takes you a good few minutes to read
which kind of delays you in and actually
performing the task if you do happen to
read it most people probably wouldn't so
they fix this carlos by liquid in bullet
points and things and making it more
readable so it's faster for you to scale
and then finally they fixed it and one
kind of all Google I think and this was
the only thing that was needed like all
this extra information about how to do
things was something that you still laid
you as the users so think about it like
whenever you're kind of putting tons and
tons of instructions in there consider
if maybe there is something that you
could do to do all these things for the
user instead of having them read all the
instructions and fill things in because
it really does change the complexity of
using the system this is the xbox calm
website asking hey do you want to buy an
xbox and halo and then in my recent
activity there is me playing xbox
or missing halo on the Xbox ones you've
been there right you've seen these as
for things you've already bought and the
system should know you are the bottom
why is it asking you for information but
you already gave this is called system
of Nicias is even computers to be a
nomination or this one supposed to be a
thing that helps your efficiency by auto
correcting things but I find that in any
given sentence that i right I probably
end up correcting the order correct one
two three four times before it finally
gets what I'm trying to say so if you're
going to do a prediction make sure it's
a good prediction an example this is for
example when when you have a website and
you're going to select like asking the
user to say select the country that
you're in spending I'm like I guess if
you're in Australia the three lights
because you're in the top but if you
live in Sweden it kind of sucks having
to scroll through 128 countries before i
get to Sweden it should be predicting
like given the geolocation island should
be fairly easy to predict what i'm going
to say about what compromise the next
three forgiving discreet and protective
i'm not going to talk too much about
actually but let's go to the habituating
one so think back to the first time you
drove a car and if you haven't ever
driven a car is pretending the teatro
part or that you played the guitar here
or something so the first time you drove
a car at least my experience and was it
was super hard there are a lot of things
to remember the first time we drive the
car like anything from how you kind of
turn the key to man okay so the right
one is the gas or which one is the
breaking up I can't remember and
then at the same time you have to kind
of fix up your share except the mirrors
and remember all the stop signs and all
the the other traffic signs and and then
there are other people on the 32 but
kind of destroy everything for you so
there is a lot of stuff to think about
like the first time you drive your car
if you think back to the last time you
drove the car it was probably something
that went pretty automatic like it can
solve like super hard equations in the
car while driving you probably don't
even know it is like most of the stuff
isn't what the softlines hopefully but
other random things are going on on the
side of the car but what would happen if
you had two sets of pedals would it be
easier or would it be harder to drive
the car I would say that it would
definitely be harder because not only do
like it would seem like more efficient
because you have more stuff to use but
you have to always make a decision but
whether you should use one or the other
and always thinking man if I would have
used the other one would that have been
more like would have would other been
better more efficient or did I lose
something here why is there even two
options to do this one thing and what
would happen is whenever you drove like
north-south you would have the pedals
one way and then when you drive east
west the pedals suddenly change like
they put the ok cancel button like an
yes that would be horrible so um these
things are trying to express it
gratuitous redundancy like having
multiple ways to do the same thing or a
variable outcome when pushing the same
pedal suddenly gives a different outcome
all of these are things that makes it
not have been
trading so this is facebook how do you
send a private message to someone and
don't use the messenger app it's like in
the actual Facebook ID turns out that
there is one two three four fourteen
like I haven't bothered to put them all
on there 14 ways to send a private
message to someone yes from the Facebook
ID which one is better and whenever your
friends ask you so how do you send a
private message which one do you explain
to them I have no clue why they put all
these ways to create private messages in
here and I think the fact that there is
separate messenger app kind of explains
that there was a problem that needed to
be social work so in your apps or in
your applications from the same place
don't give the user multiple ways to
perform the same task having said that
there are places we do want to have some
redundancies like for example and if you
think about a phone it's my second
current going to like the contacts and
from there start a conversation or from
the phone button and go in and select a
contact from there and make the phone
call like that but in that case is ok
because you go in with different
purposes in the sense like once you
started off wanting to make a call and
then you decided who you wanted to make
that call to or sit in the second case
you wanted to communicate with this
particular person and you selected to do
that by using a phone call so it's ok to
have some redundancy but from the same
screen it's usually very bad for
habituating purposes to have multiple
ways to do something like in this case
how do you get to room number 3600 here
or here
well but yeah you understand what I'm
talking about variable outcome you know
like when the pedal suddenly changed
places so this is when it's phone 7
where is he push the search button it
went to Bing to search unless you're in
in a first-party act like email in that
case it would search email so unless you
actually knew what the first party apple
is and which ones were considered first
party asked you had no clue whether the
search button North going to take you to
an in-app search or banks which means
that you're less inclined to use it this
is called variable outcomes so they fix
this later by putting the search button
in the apps and making research always
go to being our or Cortana in later
pieces this is iOS an earlier version
where text messages or emails how do you
create a new text message or nearly
email well this is I create a new text
message and didn't sorry create a new
email would have been nice if the button
also is in the right place so having the
button in in the same place creates like
muscle memory and that's kind of what
you want to achieve that's what makes
you not think about the UI but actually
you perform your task and that's an
inconsistent settlement and in this case
they actually fixed it a little bit put
it in the same location but they managed
to change it so that one still has like
the editor looking button and then one
has a new keyword so again something
that just stops you that extra second
thinking is this the same thing is this
what I want to do okay so but it does
kind of delay and make you think about a
user interface in a way that you should
never have to think about the user
interface
the expense of home miss means that you
shouldn't have multiple starting point
it's nice to always have for example one
start screen that no matter what task
you're supposed to perform you can
always go back to that start screen and
find your way like trigger your way down
instead of for example on D on the xbox
360 there was the start screen and then
if you push the the Xbox button it would
pop up like the system screen and unless
you knew which options you had to fix in
the system screen and which ones were on
the home screen it's kind of hard to
figure out like even where to begin
looking for something so these were some
of the the traps and there is a website
called you I traps calm kind of list
them all it's not actually I get some
third-party that just wanted to list
them all so you listed your mala fuse if
you want to go in and look at what they
are the way I used is is I go through
and when i whenever i'm reviewing a user
interface i will look at three or four
common areas or common scenarios that i
want to kind of review and they should
be like things that you expect someone
to do all the times because these are
the ones that you want to focus on you
can't focus on like the whole user
interface but you can't focus on the
thing is that they will do like a two
percent of the time before example on
the phone take a picture and then you go
through all the ways that you could do
this task so taking a picture them on a
phone could be done for example from the
Photos app using a camera button we're
going in and sliding up on on the ISO
and pressing the camera button there so
there are a lot of different ways that
you can do this and you walk through
where you have a user walk through all
of them and then you identify and log
any traffic you observe so anytime
they say something that kind of doesn't
match up to the sentences that were
listed in the beginning I kind of tried
to figure out a case so what's there is
slower no response okay so we need to
look at that a disease if that's
something we want to fix and if you
can't find a trap at least try to
identify the area it was failing like so
the tenets that was failing and I
finally document didn't do like a group
discussion with your team to figure out
which ones you actually do want to
bother fixing because in a case for
example with the with the Apple TV
remote even though there was a trap it's
not necessarily something that you do
want to fix by putting a button on there
and say you might want to fix it by the
first few times kind of showing an
on-screen hint about what you should be
doing or something or maybe not even
care about it at all because some traps
even do they do exist are not important
enough to to spend time on or or risk
deterring other parts of the user
interface force but this is the way like
I do this normally when I do this with
customers I will spend like three hours
or something with them and that's
usually enough to go through the main
scenarios and get people's minds
thinking about how do you fix it and
make a substantially better user
interface and or in the words of bill
Buxton we have to adopt an approach that
makes us first get to write a sign like
the right features but also get to
define right make sure the user
interface kind of matches and make make
the most use of the features I'm test
work for Microsoft my developer in a
definer and I hope that this last hour
has given you some tools and maybe some
ideas on how to create better user
interfaces thank you
we're time for a few questions if you
guys want yeah okay so it used to be
very much so the question was what are
my thoughts on and the metro or the
previously known as metro not being very
colorful and my answer to that is that
in the windows 8 and windows 8 era it
was very prescriptive and it's like you
almost had to do something a certain way
to get proved and sore it's not like
that anymore I think in the NS a-- I
think you have a lot of room to put in
your own branding and to put to make it
what you want it to be so and the fact
that the the original templates are not
very colorful should not should not make
you not create a colorful template so I
think in fact you should try to stray
away as much as possible from the
templates still keeping in mind like the
clean nose and and you know the grid
when I say the grid I don't mean like
the squares i mean like that things are
actually properly aligned and things yet
keeping things clean I think that's you
should look at principles but not
necessarily feel bound by them but yeah
that's worthy basically for anything
whether it be the windows to sign
language or or Android or iOS or
anything really yes
how do you decide which ones are worth
fixing and which ones are not so as a
comparison we have the printing button
which is hidden the local menu which was
fixed well for the TV remote which was
kind of knob fix so how do you decide
which one is the worst fixing which are
not so um how do I decide what's worth
fixing or not it depends a lot on what
the design goal of the system is so in
the case of in the case of the Apple TV
for example I can't tell why they chose
to fix or not fix but I can I can think
that the reason why they don't change
that is because it's easy to find other
ways to get people to understand what to
do and once they do understand what to
do then it's not a problem anymore so it
depends on how critical the issues in
the case of of word I think it was very
hard to to get someone unstuck in the
whole file print thing because you've
conditioned them for so long to think
but file print but it's this idea of
like having removing the file button it
was turned out to be a bad idea it
depends on on how critical the features
are and how easy it is for people to
discover them anyways
and so the question was do I am I use
different colors and different creatures
are we talking about geographically yeah
so I I do think that if you're creating
global software which must applaud when
you need to be mindful of how things are
view in a different areas of course
probably the color because color means
different things in different areas but
also like the iconography in the things
like that is very important so yeah
definitely what do you need to look at
is essentially given a subset of your
users like a real subset that kind of
includes most of the people you want to
address when they are the one who are
eventually we'll have to say what is a
good or what is a bad interface if you
will I know that question the bathroom
was like bit weird but for example at
Microsoft specifically with Windows and
right now there is a lot of feedback
coming in through the insider program
through from all over the world and and
that's taken seriously in terms of like
fixing the US loss in the system and
other course okay yeah one more and then
I also
so the question is how do i get around
and the people with the strongest
opinions getting their way in the ux
discussion i think the same way you get
around people having the strongest
opinion about what framework you're
using in your system so go back to
basics what is it but it's important for
this in this case and in an order
ordering system it's important for the
sellers to be able to perform like to be
able to create an order and this minimal
amount of time as possible while having
a customer site that's what should
govern like how your us should look not
what someone internally think okay thank
