welcome to open source from the trenches
lessons learned creating a popular
dotnet open source library so just a
couple of moments about me my name is
James Union King I am a developer from
Wellington New Zealand I originally made
these slides for NDC oslo so slight
modification required I am a developer
and consultant at a New Zealand company
called antigen if you are interested in
moving to New Zealand you could
potentially come work for us but what
I'm most known for is working on
json.net and the experiences of that
will form the basis of this talk today
so first thing I want to talk about and
sort of as a disclaimer say that my
experiences and open source could
potentially be different from a lot of
other peoples so there are many
different kinds of open source projects
there's large collaborative projects or
for example scripts es there's a lot of
developers working on that project
together they're open source projects
are run by companies and a lot of people
who contribute to it our paid employees
of a company so marks off on the.net
framework and asp.net that's an example
and then there are projects that just
have one or two main contributors so
examples of that are Auto mapper and
auto FAQ and Jason Donette also falls
onto that last one and as well as there
being many different types of projects
are many different ways of contributing
so you could be someone who's just
contributing via creating issues or
reporting bugs you could submit pull
requests or you could create a project
and runner projects I be a project
maintainer so my experiences are sort of
gathered around based around being a
project maintainer of a large open sore
project by myself so I must walk a
mentor to walk through the history of
json.net and sort of talk about what
I've learned along the way so we'll
start at the start how did Jason die
Nick get started so I originally started
Jason Don it because of an ASP not
asp.net webforms control i was working
on so it was of a javascript dialogue
control servos a java script dialogues
nested within the browser and it was for
web forms it was a dialogue control
somewhere where you might find for
jquery or bootstrap by today's standards
it's nothing special but i'm back then
when everyone was going crazy over Ajax
and all look we can update a div without
refreshing the entire page it was was
all right I was pretty happy with it has
anyone here written a lot of web forms
okay I'm really sorry so here we can see
a bunch of web form isms so we've got
the good old runat server does anyone
miss runat server one hand you're sick
we've got the data source embedded
directly in the page so this would have
been so some Microsoft Project Manager a
program manager way back in 2005 he
could demo dragging and dropping a
sequel data source on to a web form and
then figure of a sequel data source
directly within visual comm seek will be
embedded directly am of you that was a
bad time there's Styles hard-coded
directly against the control who needs
CSS not Microsoft and at runtime I'm
sure of us with one control was probably
outputting many kilobytes and to the
viewstate again posted back with every
web request so it was all pretty awful
but I was happy because I don't know any
better as a Microsoft developer at the
time some people spent their teens and
twenties doing drugs I did web forms so
the problem was my web control it was
very JavaScript driven I was all the
values are being set in the view
on the server but web forms I was really
designed about writing HTML of designed
back in 2000-2001 with the birth of
dotnet so I could write the initial HTML
no problem so the HTML was where I then
inject the JavaScript control using
javascript but I needed a way to take
all the values that I'd set on the
server and then send them to JavaScript
so write them to the view and my first
cut as you can see here as I try to do
everything manually with in code I would
check did someone set whether there is
an overlay displayed when the JavaScript
dialog is displayed and if yes then I
wrote it out is there would set of yes
I'll write it out what their height set
if he s I'll write it out but it was all
very verbose and manual and error-prone
and I wasn't very happy with it and I
looked at that and I thought you know
what I'm really doing is I'm a server
I'm setting some configuration and then
I'm sending it to the client what I
really want to do is I want to data
format that I can serialize all my data
to and then on the client I just read it
so I did what any developer would have
done back in two thousand six I used xml
specifically I use XML serializer so it
was super easy on the server one line
one line and you're done but I quickly
discovered the XML it's real pain in the
ass work with in JavaScript first you
need to load that entire string into a
document which is easiest have been done
because of all the different browsers
and way they do XML slightly differently
then you need to do stuff like
document.getelementbyid give it overly
visible when you check with a vet
returned of result or not and if it did
then you give at elements and you'd
extract the value from it and it was
horrible and even a relatively
experienced developer like me at a time
could tell that this this was wrong this
wasn't the this wasn't the best approach
so fortunately at the same time well
just after I discovered JavaScript
object literals and suddenly the
JavaScript was easy so this is what I
just
rode out to test it and it was easy
because i was working literally with a
normal javascript object the parsing was
done when that script tag was paused and
i didn't really need to do anything i
just had a JavaScript object ready to go
but now I had a new problem that was
creating the JavaScript object literal I
couldn't find any donít libraries to do
it so that was the beginning of Jason da
net so the first version was released
back in June 2006 so just so over ten
years ago and every time I just well
once I had finished I'm writing it and
using it with my web dialogue I wrote a
blog post I zipped up some source code
in a dll file and uploaded it to my blog
and I was pretty much it now at the time
Jason was so new so Jason was also sort
of defined as a standard back in two
thousand six by Douglas Crockford that a
lot of classes and json.net didn't
actually start with the word Jason so if
you're familiar with Jason convert so
Jason gavotte serialize object
deserialized object and objects like j
object and JRA they were originally
JavaScript's convert JavaScript array
JavaScript object and it wasn't until a
couple of releases later when the
terminology Jason caught on that i
started renaming things and this photo
it's of wellington so that's where i
live i'm guessing the fireworks at a
celebrate guy fawkes and not the release
of Jason Donette so what I found with
starting Jason gone ahead as open source
starts with solving a problem it starts
with one or two developers they've got a
problem that they need to solve and they
see the opportunity to solve it or take
something into a better and then it just
so happens that along the way they take
what we've done and their project may
just put it online I was talking with
Jimmy who wrote auto pamper auto MF ER
and he said that he wrote water mapper
just because he needed to use it at work
and it wasn't until nine months later
Betty he just happened to turn it into a
project and upload it to github and it's
quite amazing how many similar popular
Donnie
objects start up in this way so we've
got in log and we've got in unit mock
and autumn a forum and Jessen Donaire so
at this point you've got a library and
maybe you've put it up somewhere for
people to use where do you go from there
there are a couple of options you could
leave your blog posts and github and
have it on new get and just allow
developers to discover it organically or
maybe you could go out and proactively
reach out to developers and let them
know that you've create created
something that it exists and I think
that's reaching out to developers is
something that we're not really familiar
with that it reaches outside our comfort
zone we got a training code we can write
an open source library but how do we get
people to actually start using it so
with jacent on their part of a reason I
release it as open source so I
originally wrote it because I had a
problem that I need to solve but reason
I released it was because I had a brand
new blog and I wanted content for my
blog and I wanted to get traffic so when
I released Jason Don it I wrote a blog
post I mean I sort of submitted it to a
number of news sites so the one you can
see here this is a Jackson Sobek in 2006
Ajax was the big buzz word of the day
and age axion was like the hub of tech
for some reason so I submit of a blog
post here and they republish it a nice
got quite a few hits which was great so
also fun fact Scott Hanselman was the
very first commenter of the very first
blog post about json.net and I'm pretty
sure he found his way to my blog
probably by ajax in 14 minutes later he
also then submitted the first bug so
thank you very much Scott but he gave a
lot of great detail you don't usually
get bug reports that detailed so what I
found was reaching out to developers is
that that first blog post is quite
important and what you want is you want
something that explains the problem that
your project solves
and how easy it is to use and I think
this is actually something I didn't do
very well with Jason Don had my first
blog post was sort of more technically
focused on some low-level achievements
so I wrote a foreword only Jason reader
and afford only jesting right of it were
very memory efficient and it's sort of
what I showed off on my blog but
commenters will come along and they'd
look about and say that's kind of hard
to use I don't want to use that now that
first release of Jason on it it had a
serializer like you could see realize
things and just one line but I don't
show that off so I think nailing that
first blog post is key and once you've
done it once you can then sort of sort
of reuse that content so if you ever a
future want to have a basic website you
can just take that initial description
and raise it reuse it if you have
documentation you can take those basic
quick start guides and reuse them so a
good elevator pitch for your open source
project as always useful to have and if
you really want to go to step beyond you
can create a screencast video so Anthony
and neck from the glimpse project there
they made a screencast of showing off
glimpse and as you can see it ended up
with over 40,000 views which is really
quite remarkable and they created a lot
with helping popularized glomps and in
the beginning so you've written a blog
post where can you submit it ajax ian is
not the tech powerhouse that it used to
be the first place of social media so
you can tweet it and read it's another
place you can go is a couple of good
subreddits you can look at the asp.net
team and the.net team a microsoft also
do their part to sort of evangelize open
source projects and blog posts that
community members right so the asp.net
team is a weekly community stand-up
video that they stream life and as part
of it there's a John Galloway loves
community section and he sort of well
sort of plug open source projects and
blogs that have
throughout the throughout the week and
in Lake Lure likewise to.net team they
have a weekly blog post with links to
donate related blog posts and they also
focus on nuget packages so one a week
they also focus on as a marine game app
once a week and also a Unity game and
the final place I'd really recommend as
stack overflow so stack overflow is the
place people go when they've got a
problem and if you can get to sac
overflow and find people who have an
issue that you're open source project
solves you can answer them you can show
them how it's done and then you can just
link back to your your blog post or
website or nuget package or github and
this is actually something I did quite a
lot with jacent on that back when Stack
Overflow started up I would look through
it occasionally and I'd find questions
from people who had issues that perhaps
JavaScript serializer which is built
internet or data contract Jason
serializer also built under dotnet they
had issues that those libraries didn't
solve I'd show them how json.net solve
them I mean I'd link them back to my
website and some of those questions now
have hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of views so it's the sort of thing which
really pays off over time so I will
share with you my number one tip for
getting developers attention so this is
the one weird trick to make developers
lose weight or something so developers
love performance they love comparing
performance they love talking about
performance I love seeing performance
improve how often have you heard someone
say you should try x I hear it's really
fast so what I've noticed over time so
every every version of Jason Don it will
not every version but most versions of
json.net am I released I write a blog
post and as part of our blog post I
quite often will sub highlight some
performance improvement I've made so ms
release I did a couple of years ago
I really improved how if sharp
discriminated unions are serialized in
deserialize I went from a whole bunch of
reflection happening every time to cash
reflection and I've noticed that
developers we may see and blog posts to
talk about performance they're much more
highly avoided liked shared whatever
then other ones so I've noticed us so
much that when I sort of sat down and I
decided come up with like a tagline for
json.net of like a short one line and
description so i built it straight into
the description so Jason on net is a
popular high-performance Jason framework
for dotnet so if you're doing this don't
don't lie about performance so you want
to keep performance of mind you want to
work on it you want to be fast but don't
lie about performance don't be a dick
and cook up scenarios where you when and
your benchmark is the best and everyone
else loses horribly and also don't
obsess about being a fast asleep
there'll always be some library that
will take what you've got or maybe
they'll move some peps useful feature
and like suddenly they're fast from a
benchmarks but maybe they're harder to
use I get Jason Lynette isn't the
fastest serializer so there's a
serializer called jil jil which is
faster I mean it does that by using ILM
it heavily which means pretty much
whenever you want to serialize a type it
uses ILM it to pretty much generate a
custom serializer on the flavors tuned
exactly for your type so it means jill
is faster but it also means because it
uses ilms I can't run everywhere because
I elam it isn't supported and ahead of
time compilation so yeah they're very
pros of cons but my recommendation is
always just think about performance and
sort of highlight it when talking about
your library developers eat it up
so now I want to talk about motivation
so what has motivated me to keep working
on json.net so at this point I had
something which worked for me it solved
my problem i had put it out there on my
blog and my blog was getting lots of
hits at this point i felt like i was
done it was time to walk away so yeah it
works for me I've got popular blog posts
I was also when I started working on
Jason done it I'd only finish University
like a year earlier I only had one job
ever so it was something to put on my
resume and this wasn't just something
that I felt when people asked me I would
say they would ask me what my plans were
i would say i was done so way back in
two thousand six is an email
conversation between a couple of other
people who wrote javascript and jason
libraries and net so ajax dotnet pro and
j-roc this will both focus more on web
services rather than just call Jason
like Jason done it was and ever time
they were considerably more popular yeah
this was just a discussion what do you
think about combining our libraries and
my response to them is you're completely
welcome to take what I've done and reuse
it and learn from it but I feel like
I've achieved all I want to achieve and
I'm going to go work on something else
something else which interests me and
ever time that is what open source felt
to me I felt like you would put out a
blog post or maybe you'd write an
article on co project and then you'll be
done and you go work on something else
so what changed why do I keep working on
it so would you believe it was complex
so i may have just made some old co plex
project managers day so i made one final
release of json.net too complex and part
of a reason I did that was ever time the
source code was sort of hosted and
visual sourcesafe on my desktop in my
room
it's jason dinettes that old started out
on visual sourcesafe and the zip file
was like sitting in a subdirectory
underneath my Donaire powered blog but
what I didn't realize at a time when I
moved to cope Lex as I was suddenly
getting all these new features and ways
of interacting with the community so
suddenly I had discussions I had ways to
have people come along and request new
features and talk about how they were
using json.net issues for bugs people
could submit reviews and I could see
statistics of how downloads for growing
and people were adopting it source code
it was TFS ever time i think the way you
collaborated and submitted code was
you're going to cope Lex I mean like you
would download a zip file containing all
the source code and you unzip it you'd
make some changes and you observe it
back up again and you upload it back to
cope Lex then I would have to download
it and I'd have to unzip it then I'd
have to like to manually merge things it
was awful but otherwise complex was it
was alright so without realizing it
suddenly I had a community so I could
talk with people I could learn how they
were using Jason on it what was easy
what was hard and for me this was a
motivation I think I like programming
challenges and I think this is true for
most developers otherwise during our
spare time weird off we'd go off and
climb mountains and row cakes and stuff
but I prefer my programming challenges
to be practical rather than theoretical
and seeing people practically use my
library in a real world and have issues
with it I mean I'd like come up with fix
rodents only their real-world example
was much better and that was really
motivating for me of course sometimes
having a community can be difficult you
don't always agree and things can
quickly escalate then if you do
something that they don't like but
that's working with developers and it's
better yeah
sometimes it's annoying but for most
part is it's a great time so since I
started way back then just having source
code on my blog and and download and
link the ways of interacting with people
and the open source community has
continued to grow grow so I talked about
it earlier there's issues and on
codeplex and github nougat has really
revolutionized the way that open source
developers and regular donít developers
a quiet open source and also you can see
on new get quite comprehensive stats of
how your library has been downloaded and
also you can see other libraries take
dependencies on you which you wouldn't
have seen before you've got sites like
tech and power who do benchmarks and in
my case overtaken powers mainly focused
on web benchmarks but in my case there's
a blog called burning monk which looks
more at donít serialization it does
benchmarks of different libraries in
that space and this has really push open
source developers to be better and
faster competing into each other being
measured against each other like this
yes and github and other distributed
source control systems have obviously
made contributing and collaborating much
easier and finally twitter has really
revolutionized ways for people to come
along and tell you that you're wrong and
you're bad and you should feel bad so
two years after i first released
json.net adoption really started to grow
i was getting a lot of downloads and
with all those downloads i was also
getting a lot of requests for help what
went from maybe one question a week had
become maybe one or more a day so here's
a graph of Jason da net downloads from
Cole x over time and it's kind of
interesting look at it's got a really
weird shape unfortunately Co Plex didn't
put years on that I don't think they
expected people to
we'll be using it in 10 years so we can
see here back in November 2014 I
marriage downloads on to github and as
soon as I did that so most people
started downloading things from github
rather than coke Lex although still
quite a surprisingly large number of
people do use co clicks for downloads we
can see in jus january two thousand
eleven i first uploaded the package to
nougat and after that sort of downloads
from co plex sort of started to level
off as more people use new get to
acquire the library rather than
downloading the zip file you can see way
back in March 2008 so that's when I
released Jason on air too and although
it looks kind of small of a time when I
released Jason da near to sort of
downloads pretty much doubled which was
I was very excited about their blood
back then doesn't look so impressive now
so it was about 2008-2009 as when I
really started feeling overwhelmed and
it wasn't just the people asking for
help it was that they were asking for
help not because of bugs and the library
or because of missing features the
features were there that they needed as
just they didn't know about them they
didn't know how to use them so it was at
that point I really started to put some
effort and writing documentation and the
first thing I learnt is XML
documentation alone by itself isn't
enough so XML documentation that's a
thing it's the text that you see when
you use intellisense and also a lot of
websites like msdn you can to build HTML
from it and it should becomes the API
documentation now this kind of XML
documentation is useful maybe if you
want to find out what an individual
class or method does but it really
doesn't help developers solve high level
problems so if we use a metaphor of a
coffee machine you think
xml documentation kind of like low-level
descriptions of all of different parts
of a coffee machine now if you're
familiar with the coffee machine you
could probably use this sort of
documentation to figure out how to make
a cup of coffee or maybe you've just got
a lot of time and a lot of patience
you're happy to experiment but what you
really want is a user as you want a high
level guide telling you how to achieve
your goal you want a cup of coffee here
is the library the coffee machine to do
it for you and here is how you use it so
the other kind of documentation i found
was really useful as developers they
love examples they just want to see an
example of their problem their exact
problem being solved and then they want
to cough here so it's not the best way
to improve as a developer but that's the
way developers apparently like to work
so back in 2012 I had a long flight back
from a conference in Europe so flying
back from Europe to New Zealand it's
about 35 to 40 hours many flights lot of
layover and I was coming back from a
conference now super energized to be a
conference about open source so my goal
and that 40 hour of flight was to write
100 samples for Jason Donette I did not
give their I think I maybe got up to
about 50 but you you can see I'm sort of
like a list of them down on on the
left-hand side of their that screenshot
but this this one example Lomas was the
most popular one it gets thousands and
thousands of views every month and all
together those examples probably get
over a hundred thousand views every
month it's really quite remarkable so
another thing I learnt for reducing
support the amount of time you need to
give support is how your library fails
is important so one of my passions is da
need API design so this is the only sort
of time I'll jump into that and must
talk
but you can think when you're using a
library even though I've just said
documentation is really important users
don't tend to read documentation at
first so if they encounter a problem
they're going to try and solve it a
little themselves and then when they
concede defeat they'll go off and look
at stack overflow or Google or the
documentation so what you want is a user
fails you want to let them know why they
failed so ms code sample up here this is
the most common error people tend to
have with jacent on it you've got a
person which has hobbies my hobbies is a
collection but the user is trying to
deserialize a string into that
collection which will work they don't
they don't match up so the error I
originally got and the initial versions
of json.net as I tell them this expected
JSON array contract got JSON string
contract there's using a lot of
low-level internal types that really
doesn't help the user and may use it
gets that and they were all very
confused I used to get tons and tons of
support requests about that and probably
on Stack Overflow be lots of questions
what's this era mean so I started
improving on it so this was v2 of that
error message era converting
system.string to type I list string of
strength and it certainly improved her
that reduce the number of support
requests and but it was still was the
the most common way was still the most
common problem people were having
adjacent on it so I improved it smaller
so Eric converting the value of and I
tell them the value to the type I mean I
give them a path to it Emma Jason so
that hobbies as represents the hobbies
to the left of the string i mean i'll
give them the line number my position
and so once i got to that level of
detail most developers could pretty
quickly figure out hey wait a second the
hobbies that i was trying to deserialize
I list as a string those don't match up
and if you compare it to the original
error yeah its really night-and-day when
it comes to solving solving your problem
so those are a couple of my tips on how
you should give support how shouldn't
you give support so if someone asks for
any help over any of these mediums I
just I say no and the reason I say no is
because they simply don't scale when you
answer a question you want to answer it
once and have it somewhere that is
easily searchable and discoverable and
have other developers reuse your aunt's
and multiple times in the future so
where should you give support sec
overflow John skeeters nodding so my
reply to developers asking for help on
github is I'll close their quest I'll
close their issue and I'll say please
repost this on Stack Overflow because i
use stack overflow for support now a
great thing about sec overflow is not
only is it easier to search both to fire
its own search and also by google google
rates Stack Overflow quite highly as
there are also many many developers on
Stack Overflow eager to answer questions
everyone loves Stack Overflow reputation
so there's only one of you is probably
like a dozen people interested in
answering questions about json.net or
more on on stack overflow so the screen
shot here you can see is of the json.net
tag so I recommend when you've got an
open source project encourage the usage
of a tag and that way people can use
that tag to quickly find more help about
json.net you can see here there's about
five well almost six thousand questions
about json.net on stack overflow and
some of those questions over on the left
they've got hundreds of thousands of
views if you're just one developer
answer
each developers questions one by one as
it's obviously completely impossible so
I recommend using stack overflow as a
resource so as well as making it easier
for developers to help themselves and
sub-skills aim you need to invest in
making your own development easier so
one of the best things I ever did when
working on json.net as I took an entire
day during during one weekend many years
ago and I sat down and I learnt power
show I learned sake so sake is a sort of
a build script a build library for sake
full power show so if similar to make
and rake and cake and I built a script
that would build json.net imma meet the
many versions of Jason Donette so
there's version of Jason on it for
dining two and three point five and four
and 4.5 and silver lights and so on and
so on it would build all those together
and to a new get package it would build
the documentation it would run all the
tests and tests for each one of those
different libraries or package
everything together in a zip file and
we'll do that all with one click of a
button I'm a time investor and doing
that is probably repaid itself dozens of
times over back again so as well as just
being able to run that on my own local
machine to verify that there aren't any
issues and Jessen on it I've been able
to take it and put it on a build server
so I'm a screenshot here you can see is
app fair so players a Don yet focused
website that offers build in a build
server as a service and i really
recommend it it's super easy to get
started and get going like you can
literally create an account point it at
a at a github repo maybe a little bit of
configuration to tell it where the
solution
and then this thing will just go off and
I'll get you a salt content it'll
download it onto itself and all build
your project it's really easy and it
also has a free option for open source
projects so for things I haven't
automated I like to make checklists so
this is my official real json.net
release checklist completely unchanged
so I run through this checklist every
time I release a new version of json.net
the most part is automated but there are
a couple of things I do manually in
there am a reason I find most useful is
quite often with open source there's big
periods of time in between releasing new
versions so sometimes it might be a week
between json.net releases because
there's an urgent bug sometimes it might
be six months and having a checklist
means I'm confident that if i follow
this checklist I'm going to put out a
good release of json.net I'm not going
to break everyone because i forgot to
strong name where I forgot to increment
the version number or I forgot some file
out of the nuget package and yeah if I
break jason dinero all hell will break
loose and finally the most important
investment i think you can make and
develop making development easier as
unit tests so unlike a commercial
project you might be working on with
lots of other developers you there there
is no test team there are no testers to
double check that the release that
you're about to put out to the wild is
good so you need unit tests to be able
to capture any mistakes you might make
and also capture anything regressions
you make in any breaking changes you
inadvertently make so I've put a lot of
effort into unit testing with JSON Don
it so you can see there is about two and
a half thousand units estimate top left
corner and also I quite like to use code
coverage so json.net has between 90 and
ninety-five percent coverage so that's
heading all the important paths and
before I release a new version
jason on here quite often I'll run code
coverage a man I'll go look at the
feature I've just said and I'll just
make sure there's a test heading all the
important lines and before it goes out
onto the wild so I think that the main
takeaway I've learned while working on
Jason Don it as it's just grown in such
a huge scale is you do need to take time
to invest and making your own life
easier when it comes to doing
development don't get too focused on
solving the problem of a day that a user
approaches you with otherwise things
just become completely unwieldy and
messy and horrible and it stops being
fun to work on having a lot of unit
tests that you can rely on means I've
been able to go into Jason on net and
make some quite enormous changes of the
wave is the internals work as I've
learned and grown as a developer and if
I didn't have all those units here so
simply wouldn't have the confidence to
do that because I would introduce bugs
without myself knowing so now I want to
talk about people so dealing with people
it's interesting so what I want to focus
on here is how to maintain your
enjoyment while still interacting with
other developers so focus on what can
you do to keep your mental health so
this is a this is a pretty funny tweet
by a guy whose work at github and I
think it's quite easy for it to become
true and the reason I think it becomes
true is because of what you as an
open-source maintainer see of users who
are adopting your library so what you
see is an open-source maintainer is
really just a tub of a nice work the
main way you see developers as via
github issues and github issues are
usually only when people come to you
when we've got a problem so there's bugs
of its features requests or there's
something that you haven't touched and
so long or they want strong naming or
they don't want strong name in
that being the main way that you
interact with users and that you see
users using your library can sub color
your perception of like entire success
or failure of your library if everyone
who's talking to me about Jason done it
as having problems then I must be doing
an awful job I must be horrible I should
just give up and stop but what you
realize is that so below the tip of the
iceberg is just a silent majority of
developers using your library and
getting stuff done like they might still
be having may be an issue they don't
know how to do something but they go to
a documentation we fix it maybe a go to
stack overflow and they fix it but
they've solved their problem and they're
happy and have moved on to something
else and modes of a developer's you
don't really see so the other thing i'd
recommend with Wickham of people is
don't be afraid to say no so I've
already mentioned that if people come to
me for help I just say please direct
questions to stack overflow and maybe if
someone doesn't answer your question
maybe because it's quite difficult I'll
look at it after maybe a week or so and
also say no to features that you don't
want I think there's a lot of pressure
to merge every pull request or add every
feature not all pull requests are good
not all features are good and I've had
to do this quite a lot of Jason dinette
so for years people used to ask me to
make a web framework that exposed Jason
Bohn it let's say we hate WCF and we
hate the way it does Jason can you
please turn Jason Don it into a web web
framework and I said no because I knew
if I started developing a web framework
then I'd need to worry about stuff like
doing authorization and authentication
and cashing it would have been an
entirely new project by itself and i
already had more than enough to work on
with Jason on net so it's important like
you put a boundary around what you'd
want to work on and then focus with them
there been boundary and yeah my reply
that most of people who asked that was
ok so
else can do it and eventually someone
did so Microsoft then adopted json.net
when they built Web API so this is
another another good tweet you can say
no now and maybe reconsider it in the
future but as soon as you say yes you
kind of need to support it forever so
with Jason on it I'm often quite patient
and if I get feature requests that I'm
all unsure about I just think about it
for a while maybe I'll say no maybe I'll
say yes yeah don't don't give it into
the pressure to merge every pull request
and do every feature and something i
really recommend as guiding your
contributors so github supports this
idea of a contributing markdown file nms
volumes of give instructions about you
can give instructions to contributors so
people creating new issues or pull
requests about how to contribute to your
project so with the one i've written for
json.net i sort of explain what
information i need to be able to
reproduce your bug so I need if you've
got an issue serializing stuff i need
the Jason I need the class I maybe need
whatever settings you using if you want
to submit a pull request I tell people
could you please if it's a big pull
request mention my feature to me first
because I don't want to reject all your
changes that you put a lot of work into
so github once you have created this
contributing markdown file as then
visible whenever someone creates a new
issue or a new pull request so you can
see up there please review the
guidelines for contributing to this
repository it so that's a link to their
markdown file i just mentioned earlier
so finally I'll end with y open source
why do all this work it seems like a lot
of hassle and a lot of heartache and
I'll start off with a slightly
controversial topic that will be of
money so a first ever talk I did about
open source was called successful open
source and before I even started talking
someone in the audience asked me so is
this where you tell us how to make money
and that's some people's view of open
source it's successful when it starts
making money and of course this is an
unnecessary but some open source
projects do grow quite large you mean
quite time consuming for the people we
work on it and maintain it so I thought
I'd just like of a couple of moments
into talking about money in my
experiences so is everyone watched south
park so South Park has its episode about
these gnomes that steal your underpants
and they have this business plan so step
one steal underpants step 2 we're not
quite sure yet step three profit so I'm
a context or open source I will tell you
what step two is not and it's not do
nothing so if you've got a popular open
source project that may be some big
fortune 500 company has started using
and maybe it saves their fortune 500
company maybe hundreds of developer
hours you probably shouldn't expect them
to just come along out of nowhere and
give you a check and say this is for all
the time you have saved us good work
that's not all let's that doesn't happen
in my experience so if that doesn't work
what can you do so one option is once a
ship so this is what the glimpsed guys
have well what they used to do with red
gate so red gate sponsored netqin
anthony to work on glympse for a couple
of years I know Nancy also expected some
sponsorships so a company needed an
entity to run on Donnie core and they
sponsor
one of the developers to work full-time
on Nancy for a while to upgrade it to
donate core you can do commercial ad on
so this is something I do and also hang
fire so hang fire is like a dotnet
scheduling library and we both sell
add-ons you can do commercial support
from training and consulting and an
example of a company who does this as
the people behind in service bus so
there are lots of options out there it's
hard to know what would work for your
project if you wanted to go on that
direction but that's a true alias of
everything so another reason you might
do open source is to learn new things
working on open source gives you the
opportunity to work on and learn things
you might never would have otherwise so
this less as just some things off the
top of my head that I either did for the
first time ordered for the only time
while working on json.net you can see
unit testing is up there json.net was
the very first time I ever did unit
testing and if you look at the state of
virgin dinette unit tests you would
believe me because they're a mess and as
well as those is sort of like more
intangible things you can learn so I've
learned I'm sort of how to interact with
other developers to customers if you
will requesting features and having to
sort of say no and explain to them why
they can't have something you solve also
learn how to be responsible about
managing a project putting out a good
release maintaining quality mmm is also
just the confidence the confidence that
you can create a library of code that's
used by hundreds or maybe thousands of
developers around the world and making
get stuff done and they can use your
stuff and your stuff can solve problems
another thing that's really great is you
can be used by other great apps so one
of the things I enjoy most is seeing how
other people use json.net
so since I started working on it has
become part of Asia ravendb its ships
with asp.net a lot of nougat is quite
heavily Jason based and may use json.net
and even full Jason databases ravendb
and document DB it's absolutely amazing
that they would use json.net and as well
as these apps I absolutely love playing
computer games but I really have no
desire to go and make my own one so
seeing json.net being used and computer
games is really amazing and something
that I never would have imagined seeing
it used in games that I quite enjoy like
Halo and Pokemon go it's it's pretty
cool and you can meet interesting people
when you go to a conference you quite
often instantly have something
interesting to talk about you can talk
about either they're a user and you can
just talk about their experiences using
your open source project or maybe their
fellow open-source maintainer so you can
talk about how each project is going and
this is really great for me I'm a bit of
an introvert and it's great to have
something just to talk about at
conferences with other people and yeah
you meet great people and sort of get to
know them that you might not have other
what otherwise which is really awesome
and finally open source lets you spread
your ideas so I think open source is a
unique opportunity for developers
earlier in a week I went on a tour of
the Sydney Opera House and as we went
through the guide talked about the
history of the Sydney Opera House and
how it was built and one of the things
she mentioned is that when they
originally started making on it decided
to make it they put out or a quest for
designs and there are over 200 design
submitted but only one was chosen and
one was built
as developers open source means that we
can build our designs without having to
be chosen we can just if we have a text
editor and a compiler we can just go
ahead and do it and it's really amazing
opportunity for us and the other thing
that open source gives us is the
opportunity to build software how we
think it should be built so if we look
at some of the different Jason
serializers each of us came from a
slightly different perspective and build
something slightly differently so if
json.net I've always had in my mind that
the goal should be it should be able to
serialize and deserialize everything and
it should make the easy possible it
should make the simple easy and the hard
possible the person who wrote Jill he
actually works at stack overflow he's
very focused on performance so his goal
was speed ultimate speed and then
there's another library by another
developer called simple JSON and he just
wanted simple that didn't have any
dependencies on it so his Jason
serialize exists all just in a single
file no dependencies so open source is a
unique opportunity for us as developers
to be able to spread our our ideas to
other people so that's all I have time
to talk to you about today if you found
this talk interesting there are a couple
of other ones i recommend so Nick
mulliner and Paul bets vote each talked
about open source these are actually
both from in DC strangely enough Nick
talks about open source projects this
and governance sort of more the
organization of open source and Paul
focuses on growing and open source
projects adoption and hopefully our
popularity so I recommend those talks if
you are interested in learning more and
that's it I hope you've enjoyed my talk
I'll stay up a front for a while if you
want talk to me or ask any questions and
I hope you enjoy the rest of a
conference thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
