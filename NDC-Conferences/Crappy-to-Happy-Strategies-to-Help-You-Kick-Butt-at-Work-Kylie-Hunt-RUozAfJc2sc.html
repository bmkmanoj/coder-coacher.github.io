happy from crappy to happy now my name
is Kylie hunt for those who don't know
you and I am here to help you go from
crappy to happy strategies to help you
kick butt at work now today is going to
be a very interesting day because we're
going to deal with four of the key
things that we commonly deal with at
work and they are dealing with a shitty
boss because a lot of us deal or are
dealing with that shifting to a better
work-life balance or work-life
integration work-life blend in this time
of 24/7 technology it's really difficult
to to switch off strategies to tackle
unfairness and finally embracing
workplace change
now before I kick off I'd like to
understand a little bit more about you
guys I want to gauge the amount of
crappiness in the room right now so this
is really interesting I try and do this
in in all my talks and it's really
interesting to see around the world how
different people are so you have three
choices so think of what you like first
thing on a Monday morning okay first
choice how many of you guys are like
this on a Monday morning I love my job
this is awesome I would get paid I
wouldn't get paid not that I'd tell
anyone but okay so we've got a handful
of people maybe 5% of the organization
some of you may actually wink if your
boss is sitting next to you right now
all right got it thanks guys
second choice how many of you wake up
and you're just a bit like me I do what
I do probably not the most effective but
I get it done in the end I don't really
love it but I just do it
okay what kind of a majority of people
how many of you like this guy this guy
scares the out of me and for those
who were kind of sneakily putting their
hands up you guys come and see me
afterwards cause I think you might need
a hug
that was probably only about 5% of me so
the rest of you are either in denial or
not prepared to tell me how you're
feeling at the moment so I'm more than
happy for you to come up and after the
session and have a little counseling
session if need be
I have freebies they are good so hang
around now let's just have a look at how
you fare with the rest of the world so
back in 2013 there was a fabulous report
that Gallup did and they surveyed a
hundred and forty countries including
Australia to gauge how employees
generally feel they had the three
categories not my awesome you know
Jeremy Clarkson ones but they found that
13 percent of us really loved our jobs
right we're happy we're committed to
we're engaged in and we're really happy
to get up and go to work on a Monday
morning that's only 13 percent so the
people that are here we're maybe 5% so
I'm glad you're here right the majority
of us are the Box guy we're me just go
into what we need to do not the most
productive the scary part is that the
shitty garbage man actually outnumbers
the Jeremy Clarkson's of the world by
nearly 2 to 1 now think of the
productivity cost think of the amount of
penis that happens so thank god you're
here
because you keep me in my job now for
those who are here last year at NDC this
is a slide that you have seen before so
I do apologize for this but I'm not
going to apologize for harping on this
because your boss might say brilliant
you've been to NDC what did you learn
well I learnt that there's lots of
crappiness and garbagemen can be scary
and he'll go or she'll go fantastic
great what else
well actually happiness impacts the
bottom line right well it incorrectly it
impacts profitability if I'm happy I can
help improve your profitability by a
hundred and forty seven percent and you
boss will go what else
well my customers will be happy oh I
won't be leaving anytime soon if I'm
happier turnover decreases by sixty five
percent shrinkage that refers to theft
if anyone's got a degraded mind twenty
eight percent
absenteeism goes down thirty-seven
percent and your odds of success if
you're a start-up goes up four hundred
percent if you have happiness on the
agenda so if you take one thing away
today not just the freebies please take
a photo of this slide show it to your
boss please put happiness on the agenda
picket because it is not some airy-fairy
come by uh let's sit around it's all
great it actually makes a really big
impact so moving on we still got some
cameras up this is all recorded as well
if this helps now just a bit of a change
of pace I'd like to share with you my
story and I'm going to sit down I'm
going to read this a little bit because
it's kind of a bit emotional
don't worry I'm not gonna be crying or
you don't need to leave sir honestly
there won't be tears I promise you're
allowed to leave if you're going out for
coffee if you bring me one as well Oh
see you later no Tim Tams for you okay
so I've got a journey from crappy to
happy that I would really like to share
with you because you know I just want to
make it real for you
I a few years ago from the outside it
looked like I had an awesome job I was a
director in a company I'd been there for
12 years I was respected
I was part-time which in the property
industry is really difficult to get and
great salary but I was miserable I was
getting to the point of being the
garbage man I wasn't quite there yet
because that was just too scary but it
was just it was horrible and I was like
that because I had a boss who was
misaligned a culture within the company
that was misaligned and I just I'd walk
into the office and I just feel awful
what just I don't know part of me was
being stripped away and even on Sunday
afternoons if you were here at my talk
last year I was suffering from smun days
which is the moment on a Sunday
afternoon when you feel like
because you realized tomorrow's Monday
and you have to go to work alright so
there is such a thing as Mondays I tried
telling my doctor that and trying to get
an official diagnosis but I did actually
go to my doctor and because I was
stressed and she put me on stress leave
she also put me on Valium
now when your doctor puts you on valium
in order to deal with the stresses at
work that's pretty effed up and I had to
take stock because it started to impact
my family and I've got two young kids
I've got a five year old girl and a
seven year old boy and
and I started to think about what legacy
I was leaving them and the whole legacy
issue came from the impact that my dad
had on me my dad helped me write my
first resume he cried when I told him
that I'd been promoted to an associate
director when I was 28 he didn't cry
when I told him I was pregnant that was
the kind of dad that I had he was old
school right now
my dad instilled in me an amazing work
ethic old-school so gold watch
retirement loyalty with the company was
really big with him my dad died of
cancer five and a half years ago and I
was 12 weeks pregnant at the time with
with our daughter as well as 12 weeks
pregnant at his funeral and dad dying
taught me the importance of legacy and
you know what legacy am i leaving my
kids and what would they remember that I
was always grumpy on a Sunday afternoon
that Mommy needed you know little white
pills in order to help her get through
the day so not cool and just not right
and it was to the point where you know
what am i teaching my kids when it's
their turn to go into the workforce you
know that you can't be happy at work
that the happiness that work is meant to
be that just work and it's something
that we can't be passionate about or
enjoy or anything like that so I kind of
got the shits and realized that it
really shouldn't take a death in the
family or little white pills to tell us
that we should be happy at work so I
reinvented myself I quit my job and
right now workplace happiness guru and
whatever I want to call myself
and the reason I'm sharing this with you
is because you were the only one that
can change your situation I can give you
the tools I can give you my experience
and from what I've learned from my
clients and what they tell me
and what people come and tell me in
conferences and things but at the end of
the day it's up to you guys to do
something about it and I'm really
pleased that you've taken the first step
and you've come here today so just a
little thank you for taking that first
step so moving on to something a little
bit more lighthearted let's get into
these four steps let's look at how we
can kick some butt that's not my kid I
wish it was right so we are here to kick
some butt and let's look at the four
common struggles so the first one of how
we deal with a bad boss now I would
wager that at least 1/2 of the room have
had to deal with the crappy boss at some
time or other or maybe you're dealing
with one right now maybe you are one
right now we'll get to you in a minute
now when I'm talking about a bad boss
I'm talking about someone who makes you
feel oppressed belittled humiliated and
it's not just a one-off you know it's
not just you know we can all have a bad
day we can all be a bit of a prick at
times and and that if we're stressed or
under the wrong circumstances but I'm
talking about a consistent pattern of
behavior here when I'm talking about a
bad boss so the first thing is we need
to understand that picking the right
boss is just as and I would actually
argue more than more important than
finding the right job now the reason I
say that is because managers can change
our work situation they can give us good
tasks bad tasks they can make life easy
or hard
they can say yes he can go on holiday or
they can say yes she can go on holiday
but you've got to do what right so
there's this power imbalance that
happens between managers and employees
bad managers have got really bad
influence over us
which is why having a good relationship
with your manager is just so important
but the great news is you are not
powerless you don't need to quietly
accept a bad boss in fact it's quite the
opposite if your boss is not treating
you or your coworkers right you've got
the responsibility to do something about
it because it's just think about it's
not just the impact that this has on
yourself it impacts your family impacts
your kids think about the legacy issue
don't let it get to little white pills
and things like that so as you know I
had a challenging boss which forced me
to leave the company as well as a few
other issues he was a passive-aggressive
micro manager and when I had the exit
interview with the HR director he said
as part of the you know typical spell
would you recommend someone from outside
the company come and work with this
particular boss and I've gone yes and
he's gone really why would you say that
and I said I myself can't work well with
a passive-aggressive micro manager but
other people relish that they know how
to handle that kind of personality for
me it was an absolute nightmare but for
someone like my husband for example he'd
just see it as a challenge he'd laugh
and and just sort of play around with
that and see how much he could get the
guy rolled up I couldn't do that just
I'm a very different person so you know
on the one hand my boss was lovely in
some instances and horrible for me in
others but he was a really professional
professional person but
boss it was this is being recorded so I
need to be a little bit mindful so just
be mindful that the boss that you have
might not be great for you but it
doesn't mean that that person is not
great for someone else so we just need
to be mindful of compatibility when you
do have a bad boss
it can take 22 months to get over them
that's insane
but if you think about the amount of
stress that you go through dealing with
them they get a negativity day in day
out week in week out the constant stress
it actually shifts our brain towards
depression negativity and it also wears
down our immune system so it's not
surprising that we then get more colds
we're at risk of more heart disease
we're at risk of more strokes if we have
a shitty boss holy we could die
that's scary right now it's it's not
just our health that's at risk as well
when when we're constantly stressed and
hating our job and being like the the
garbage man we're not exactly performing
at our best either and so then there's
vicious cycle starts we're not
performing at our best because we don't
like to like our job then our
performance review start to suffer then
our payer starts to suffer and it's
almost a downward spiral from there so
the message here is we have to do
something about it
so what do we do first of all we need to
recognize that there were three
different types of bosses it's really
fun trying to pick some of the images
for this and I was thinking ah do I go a
Donald Trump or no actually he knows
he's bad so I'm gonna have to come up
with someone else so I've gone from the
pointy-haired boss through Dilbert I
don't think he knows that he's bad now
he's the first one that we'll handle
because what we need to do in this
situation is until proven otherwise we
need to assume
that bad bosses don't know they're bad
they probably haven't been told and if
you're familiar with the management
theory of the Peter Principle they've
probably never been trained and Peter
Principle is where people get continued
to get promoted until they get to a
point where they're actually incompetent
in their job and that might be managing
people not all people managers are good
at managing people
unfortunately so remember we're talking
about a pattern of behavior here so
let's assume that this pointy-head boss
is unconsciously incompetent luckily
most managers fall into this category
now what we can do about this is I had a
young lady named Carolyn who contacted
me a few months ago from the UK violent
in didn't know her from a Barra site but
she saw my Pluralsight course on solving
workplace grumpiness and she reached out
and she said Kylie I've joined this new
company and my boss has a bit of a not
very nice person
and I need some tactics on how I can
deal with him and I've got okay what's
he doing and and she said he's just not
listening and he keeps cutting me off
and keeps questioning what I'm doing and
I said does he know that he's doing that
she goes what I don't know I've gone
okay how about you get we came up with a
bit of a game plan and so she ended up
taking him out for coffee so we took him
out of the workplace into a neutral
territory took him out for a coffee and
she sat down and she said I really want
to want to thrive here and in order for
me to thrive I need some constructive
feedback from you that's how I would
work best and I really want to be as
productive as possible so can you please
give me some feedback in these
particular forms and it became a really
constructive discussion to the point
where they came up with the game plan
they he's suggested that they follow up
in three weeks to
how that we're going and she gave me a
call back and she got she said that was
the most empowering discussion I've ever
had and I'll take it with me through my
career now so please you can do
something about it and I would encourage
you to think about how you work best and
then communicate that with your boss the
second element this is Travis from uber
he's been having a bit of a challenging
time he is on his way out and he's
making life a little bit difficult he's
if you don't know him he's been one of
his challenges is around the whole
sexual harassment thing and anyway he
has said and I quote so I don't want to
get this wrong
I must fundamentally changes a leader
and grow up I think that could apply to
a number of people that we know in
leadership positions at the moment now
these kind of people need our support
and good advice in order to do better
now I have a client in IT and they are
actually represented in the audience
here and I'm really trying hard not to
look at them right now and they got me
in to have a look at their onboarding
program and as part of the program what
was revealed to me was that their
culture needed a little bit of tweaking
and the leadership approach needed a
little bit of tweaking as well one of
the things that came out of it was they
had the most passionate dedicated leader
he had everything in his head and he
loved his employees but no one knew no
one knew how grateful he felt and how
much he loved his employees so one of
the things I tried to get him to do now
I'm sorry I'm not suggesting and I'm not
looking at the people that I'm not
suggesting that your boss is anything
like Travis what I'm implying here is
that he knew that he needed a little bit
of help and I'm really grateful that he
got me in and
the end result was cake okay it's a
really good result so this person is now
showing acts of kindness and acts of
gratitude and showing his staff that he
appreciates them which was freakin
awesome when I got this photo through
from one of his staff members who didn't
send this through I just loved the size
difference right the little one for
Duncan thanks for being a real star and
the big one for Stevo thanks for being
awesome that to me is a boss who knows
that he can improve and this was an
example of him improving in action I
absolutely love this and they've called
me Kylie karma Factory
which I that's just cool so the third
kind of boss is the one that doesn't
care either way yeah there was a real
race for you know who should I use for
number three and as of yesterday Pauline
handstand might have even featured I
don't know I don't want to get political
but Wow when you put in bad boss in
Google Images Pandora's box okay number
three these are the bosses that don't
care either way whether they good or bad
they're basically assholes these
managers are usually beyond helping and
I would suggest that you run there's
really not that much in all honesty that
we can do to try and change
personalities because this is a
personality change that we would need in
order for them to become a better boss
so what can you do if you're faced with
one of these three bosses now as I've
mentioned thankfully most bad bosses
fall into category number one handful
number two number three run okay so if
you face with one or two and the tools
I'm talking about work equally well if
you've got really shitty colleagues as
well don't know if it works on husbands
or wives maybe give it a go
we'll see steps to managing a bad boss
so as I've mentioned assume no
intention so they might not know that
they're bad take them out for a coffee
out of the work environment and say hey
in order for me to work more
productively this is what I need from
you do it sooner rather than later we've
seen it takes 22 months to get over a
bad boss and if you don't do it you
might die from a heart attack or a
stroke we don't want that to happen your
family doesn't want that to happen
choose the right time to talk don't do
it straight after a meeting don't do it
in the corridor set time aside to have a
dedicated talk with your manager so that
they are focused and they're off their
freaking phone because everyone is on
their phone all the time we want focus
from them explain the effects that their
actions have on you on your work for
example mr. such-and-such or mrs.
such-and-such whatever you call them
when you do X it makes me do Y and I
feel Zed so if you can give them
tangible realistic examples they're able
to process things a little bit better
as I've mentioned not all people
managers are good at managing people so
we need to help them through the process
help them get the best out of you
because you know what you need to do a
good job they don't necessarily do make
a plan and follow up just like my
friends from LinkedIn this is really
important because it's all well and good
to have a discussion and your manager
might go yep I've ticked the box I've
had a chat and my team's all now
hunky-dory they've gone from crappy to
happy because we've spoken about it and
then nothing happens that is the last
thing we want we need action and let's
have some milestones let's put some
timelines to it let's get all technical
and analytical this is the right
audience for it and probably one of the
most important things is to praise your
manager when they get it right because
so many times we expect our manager to
praise
us and it's often just a one-way street
I will get out of your way so you can
take photos but it needs to be a two-way
street
you know managers don't often get praise
and how do we feel when we get praise we
feel really good about ourselves
so let's give our manager praise when
they do the right thing it's I'm not
suggesting we treat them like
five-year-olds but if we think of it in
that kind of context when I give my
daughter praise she will do more of the
behavior that I want her to see so the
point remains the same do something do
it now and praise people when they get
it right if that doesn't work try this
there's proven I keep getting electric
shocks
there's proven medical benefits to just
thinking about the idea of swearing at
your boss okay now that's not saying it
out loud or anything like that have a
think about it give it a go
don't say that loud can if you want as
long as your boss isn't sitting next
year so the people who wind you know
right moving on is your number two
shifting to a better work/life balance
now research shows that we're more
stressed we're unhappier we're faster
than ever and this is meant to be the
age of modern technology life's meant to
be hunky-dory everything is meant to be
nice and easy and it's just not cool now
this is a writer downer how am I kidding
this is a tech audience you're not gonna
write it down so it's up on screen okay
we live in a world that celebrates
activity and work ignores renewal and
recovery but first to recognize that we
need both in order to order to thrive
take a photo
cuz I know you're not gonna write it
down I shouldn't have it's not a writer
downer but it's so true we need to take
time out the ironic thing is that you're
taking photos with your phone and here I
am about to say you need to put your
phone away I've only just cottoned onto
that I will work on that for my next
presentation if you don't keep learning
what's the point in being here
right so the umbilical cord to work as
longer than it's ever been we can go on
holidays but yet we're still stuck at
work because we can be contacted or by
email 24/7 or Skype so on the past over
the past 20 years our lives have sort of
come under siege because there's almost
this unspoken expectation that we can
always be contactable so when I'm
talking about work-life balance
it's almost a misleading concept because
it doesn't always mean equal right it's
not like you get eight hours of work it
has a play a you know it just doesn't
work out that way
if we try to schedule an equal amount of
work or equal amount of hours for
everything that we want to do it's just
going to be unrealistic
so life needs to be much much more fluid
so the best individual work-life balance
will vary over time and often on a daily
basis so what's right for you today
might not be right for you tomorrow and
if you have kids it'll be different if
you don't have kids if you're
approaching retirement age it'll be
different when you're starting out your
career so we need to have some
flexibility and fluidity in there and
there's no perfect balance that you
should be aiming for so let's just have
it think of the work-life balance let's
not call it that let's call it work life
harmony or integration or flexibility or
flow or fill in the blank but it's got
to work for you guys what's weird is
that we've got this sort of strange
notion that we need to work long hours
in order to be productive and to be seen
to be doing a good job but it's
absolutely crazy there was this girl in
Indonesia back in 2013 who tweeted this
24 hours later she was dead the autopsy
said that she had died from exhaustion
overwork and an energy drink known as
Thai Red Bull and leading up to this she
tweeted that she had contemplated moving
her bed into the office and in another
tweet that she was delighted that she
had had arrived home before midnight
this is not something we should
celebrate this really should be a
wake-up call for all of us we need to
reject the cult
of overwork I will work has always
become a credential of prosperity these
days but long worker roads our physical
health our mental health because it
leaves us less time to look after
ourselves to eat well to exercise to
spend time with our friends and family
and past a certain point overworked
people become less efficient and less
effective but and the results are
cumulative as well but how much work is
too much work well here's another one
fear boss
tipping work for productivity 39 hours a
week in Oslo they had it right they on
average for doing about 36 hours a week
and here in Australia our average is
about 41 hours a week so people who are
working 50 60 70 hours a week they're
not showing that they're working really
hard they're just showing that they're
working really ineffectively
inefficiently which leads me to the
first step in improving work/life
balance integration it's to look at how
we focus our time how we spend our time
for example when we go to work we're not
necessarily always at our peak
performance right we get in we make a
cup of coffee we go and see if see our
friends we might sort of plan things for
the day what if we were to plan things
for the day the night before so we get
into work you know we still need our
coffee or two it's important and we just
nail it for now just go hard and get
stuff done and then you're on a roll you
get momentum right it's important what
if you said instead of oh I'm gonna get
this done today what if you said I'm
gonna get this done in two hours and set
yourself a time limit see how more
productive you'd be and let's value
productivity over extra hours someone
might say oh I stayed until 10 o'clock
last night and instead of saying I
stayed until 11 you can say well why'd
you stay til 10
want to go home see your family
the gym do something fun as I said let's
reject this cold serve overworked and
not be that poor girl who passed away
unplug we have to so don't text at your
kids soccer game please don't email when
you're on vacation take your annual
leave in Australia we're terrible at
taking and your leave why because it the
perception is that we're not hard
workers if we take her annual leave what
crap we have to change that we must
change it because if we don't take our
annual leave we get lazy
we don't eat properly we get that's
because we don't have time to exercise
and then we don't think clearly we're
not creative we're not innovative and
we're just not being the best people
that we can be I'm rather passionate
about this next element is to chunk it
down and have an hour of power so I use
this myself I absolutely love it in the
morning let's have an hour where you
focus on getting one thing done you turn
off all distractions shut the door if
you can do whatever you need to do but
you focus on that one thing and you just
power through to get it done now what I
love about this is that you're not going
to get distracted because the study
shows that when we get distracted it can
take 20 minutes 20 minutes for us to get
back to that same degree of focus that
we had before
clearly not effective not productive and
certainly makes as crappy as I've said
I'm not going to harp on this anymore I
think you've got my passion for this
let's reject the cult of overwork and
protect your morning's
now there's an amazing psychologist
called Ron Friedman and he said the
first three hours of your day are the
most precious for maximized productivity
because your brain overnight
specifically the prefrontal cortex if
we're going to get technical
it's the most active and readily
creative immediately following sleep so
when you wake up your mind is that it's
most creative and active and thoughtful
and ready for the day so I want to go
into this just a little bit more because
that's normally me right I love my
mornings I love my bed my kids on the
other hand they're up at like 601
because I've said you're allowed to get
out of bed after 6 o'clock so it's 601 I
hear the patter of little feet going
down the stairs torch Scooby Doo want a
weekend because that's the only time
they're allowed to watch TV
and I'm there going oh I just want to
stay in bed a little bit longer but
after doing a lot of research for this
presentation I was like nope I'm going
to get out of bed and I'm actually going
to get some stuff done and as much as I
did miss that the first few times the
amount of stuff I got done was
incredible because my kids were
entertained and I was able to feel so
good about myself because I had an hour
of quiet time to get stuff done and so
for the rest of the day it didn't matter
what I did or didn't do because I had
achieved what I needed to do in that
first hour so I highly recommend not
being the Homer Simpson in there to
cinnamon bun maybe occasionally but this
works it's amazing I know it's not easy
for people who have kids and stuff like
that try and do something that that
works for you guys there's also
something called the 19
understand 1991 rules so this came from
a gentleman called Robin Sharma this is
where you focus for 90 days for the
first 19 minutes on your number one
priority so there are a few different
techniques that we can try here
depending on your particular
circumstances this one is a really good
one it's also if if you've heard of eat
that frog ya know that can work really
well as well and getting a few nods so
eat that frog the the premise of that is
if you eat a frog first thing in the
morning and that's the worst thing
that's going to happen to you for the
day so your day is just going to improve
from there google it but whatever you do
please protect your mornings and spend
your mornings on output not input now
this is fundamental and if you end up
coming to pub comp tonight who's coming
to pub home tonight awesome
there is a brilliant gif that will make
sure that you will not forget this
figured it because it is the most
disgusting gif ever of an animal that
will make sure that you remember to
focus on output not important I couldn't
put it up here because it's it's just
too gross but yeah right so crappy too
happy issue number three as I mentioned
I have two kids ages 7 and 5 so I hear
about unfairness all the time I was also
made redundant when I was 5 months
pregnant so I get the whole unfairness
thing now let's have a look at what it
is about unfairness that gets us all
worked up now it turns out that we have
a desire for unfairness and it's built
into us at a biological level I want to
try something
told you that big freebies no yes no
yeah actually good you might know yes
here you go pink shirt because you're
wearing a pink shirt yeah
are you are you Australian give you that
pin who's not Australian there you go
alright what else we got mmm one for you
none for you there you go you can have
that you can have that one you can swap
if you want to there you go No
because you noted you get Vegemite Hagar
No yeah all right I'm not gonna miss you
guys
it's don't worry it's more this side of
the room you go
Oh whew guys heads up share them place
you guys funny cuz you're on this side
of the room yeah hey guy welcome you're
smiling too much you get Vegemite man
none for you know you've had yogurt No
hmm that how's that taste Aaron yeah how
good and can't forget you guys on the
side hey guy can go here no it's you're
busy working there you go
and the sound guards at the back they go
Ryan you're welcome
crew you go now who is who wants to go
to pub humph but doesn't have a ticket
yet like who's absolutely desperate to
go to pub comp I'm serious here would
give their right arm for puck off I need
to see hands I'm serious guys
if you don't have a ticket for pub comp
and you really want one hand up straight
in the air okay yeah right hands up
those who love me
hands up those who hate me unfairness
sucks doesn't it all right now I gave
out Tim Tims Vegemite a pub freak PubCon
ticket and nothing simply on the basis
of nothing it's like because now isn't
it ridiculous that that happens in the
workplace we get treated differently for
absolutely no freaking reason at times
in the workplace sometimes people get
paid differently because of the way they
dress sometimes they get treated
differently because of their gender it's
ridiculous it sucks and people enjoying
the chimp terms might not agree with me
right now but it does suck
the people who received nothing or who
receive Vegemite and absolutely hate it
your amygdalas in your brain are going
nuts right now
so that is the part of your brain that
it glows actually white so this is where
I'm talking about this unfairness we
have this this biological urge this need
to be treated fairly and when we're not
it feels like crap it feels awful but
when we get something just because it
feels wonderful so you owe me a big time
in now the reason I've included in
unfairness in one of our as one of our
four elements here is because it's one
of the most demotivating factors in the
workplace so because of the little stunt
I just pulled the people that didn't
receive anything or who received fed you
might imagine working with me now
imagine if I was your boss you'd hate me
people here has saved Tim Tams yeah
you'd love me and the people who
received Tim Tams you might even come
and work with me for less money how's
that fair all right so unfairness is a
really big issue now it's not always
easy to be fair because we're human we
cannot change that we have a subjective
way of perceiving things and if this
bias that I want to spend a few moments
on because bias is what helps us make
decisions that helped me make decisions
just then in that experiment but it's
really hard because we receive 11
million bits of information every moment
it's insane because we can only
consciously process about 40 bits so if
you imagine walking down George Street
which is the main street in Sydney here
jonno it looks like crap at the moment
with all of the the roadworks but
walking down George Street lots of stuff
happening and people and roadworks and
everything how are you able to see your
friend on the other end of the street
you've got to filter out all the other
stuff going on and be able to focus on
that particular person how are we able
to do that well it's called unconscious
bias ninety nine point Delta
well the Delta here is covered by our
unconscious a Malcolm Gladwell in his
awesome book called blink says that our
unconscious attitudes might be entirely
different from our stated values so I
might say I am NOT I am ethnically
inclusive but if someone was to study
who I gave Tim terms and Vegemite to it
might say something completely different
I have no idea
imagine how the experiment that I just
did influences how we train people how
we hire people how we promote them into
leadership positions and how we listen
to people's ideas as well so what are
some strategies that we can use to
tackle unfairness well first of all we
need to recognize that there is
something called unconscious bias which
is what I use to give out my freebies to
learn more about that there's actually
an awesome video that Google have done
called unconscious at work and there's
the there's the link I strongly suggest
you have a look at it because there's
some fabulous information in there and
it's free so the first thing in
recognizing this unconscious bias is
education
the second element is to step back from
conclusions so we need to remember that
injustice is in the eye of the beholder
so we need to make sure that we're
assessing the situation accurately and
for that there's no substitute for
perspective so if we feel that we're
being treated unfairly I suggest we go
and talk to a trusted friend or
colleague who can help us get a better
perspective on things because even just
the process of confiding in others can
help us mitigate the negative feelings
that we're expecting the next one is a
tricky one but it's something that we
can do with a bit of help let go what
you can't control no one could control
what I did or did not hand out you need
to decide where you put your most
precious resource which is your energy
and your time I want you to recognize
when you are having an emotional
reaction and take a breath and just
choose how you are best responding to it
so for example when I was made redundant
when I was pregnant it was legitimate by
the way a legitimate redundancy I still
don't know why it kind of happened but
it was legitimate I left the company
obviously ended up having my baby and as
things transgressed fifteen months later
I was invited back to the company and
that was sort of 42% pay rise because my
pride had a price
so sometimes unfairness can work out
well hey you can take the moral high
ground now sometimes it's okay to get on
your high horse and stay there because
the view from up there is much better
anyway because matching grudge for
grudge just doesn't really get anyone
anywhere so sometimes you do need to
take the high road and it helps you look
at the situation a little bit more
critically
and you can learn something about your
coworker or the organization or even
yourself to help understand what's going
on and in a bit more of a detached way
because when we're treated unfairly we
you know it's quite an emotive
experience the other thing we can do is
to keep a record and by keeping a record
it just can be useful to to feel
empowered and feel more in control of
the situation once again it can help you
feel see things a little bit more
clearly and maybe even identify some
patterns in the behavior so for example
if there are let's say there are a few
people who have taken credit for the
work of someone else if you find that
someone's taken credit for work you've
done perhaps next time you can protect
yourself if you if you've come up with a
great idea and you can let's say you've
said it you know in a meeting and and
everyone's gone yeah that's an awesome
idea or you can send an email and say
hey I'm really glad you liked my idea of
such-and-such let's look to implement it
in such-and-such
you know let's put it down in an email
and say I'm glad you liked my idea of
you know just so that it's out there and
they know who owns it that's just one
example one idea and then finally reach
out directly and privately as well to
the other person so if you're trying to
resolve a situation where someone else
may be misunderstood you then reach out
directly it makes no sense to waste your
emotions defending yourself to other
people when you could just be explaining
your intentions to the person who
treated you unfairly yeah so pick up the
phone don't do it by email
things can get misconstrued in email so
please go old-school pick up the phone
and start off the conversation by
stating your intentions because maybe
they just misunderstood your your
intentions and you don't need to justify
what you did as being right or wrong
just explain that you think that they
might have been misunderstood and if you
need to apologize for not being clear
the first time then do that but don't
let your emotions
don't waste your emotions on things that
that don't matter and finally embracing
workplace change sorry
there's loads of info out there for
managers to deal with workplace change
but really not that much for employees
to deal with workplace change and we
very often feel helpless when things
happen to us because often it happens
from above right
someone from above will say right we're
going to do things differently and we
kind of go okay we don't know why this
is this has come about we're just told
that this is what's going to happen so I
just want to go through a few things as
to how we can deal with it so we all
love change we want someone else to do
it first right because change can be
hard I won't go into the detail here but
suffice to say that change is actually a
process now over time when someone says
things are going to change we go oh
sugar I'm in shock then we go into
denial frustration just depression then
we start to experiment then there's a
decision okay this is what we're going
to do and then integration right we're
going to do it the reason why we're
often scared shitless about change
is because this particular process is
based on the five stages of grief no
wonder we're scared of change and don't
like it it's like we going through grief
it sucks
so what can we do about it
the reason we don't like it is because
of fear but change is inevitable right
and change is necessary for businesses
to strive good
survive and thrive so we need to know
how to overcome these fears and what are
we what are we scared of we're scared of
failure scared of six-carat success I
can't talk are not scared of looking
silly
I'm fear of the unknown as well and how
we thrive it's through predictability in
routine and a sense of control and we
when we don't have that we have this
element of fear so when we're going
through a change process it's not the
change itself it's the transition that
we have the issue with right it's that
for that grief cycle that we go through
now it's normal to feel nervous and
upset when things are out of our control
because we're wired to respond like that
but this can often translate into
anxiety so what we can do to embrace
workplace workplace change is to
acknowledge that it happens now I had
one boss for years and he was promising
me you'll get this promotion you'll get
this promotion just do this this and
this and then you'll get the promotion
that you want and I'm like alright
awesome so worked my butt off working 50
60 hour weeks I wasn't working as
efficiently as I should and then he left
and all these promises I was going to
get this promotion in like three months
and but no he left and I was like sugar
what do I do now right things have
changed right okay so I need to set some
new goals
right okay I've got one nine months
later I went and had a baby so things
can be good you need to talk about it as
well so I would go and have lunch with
with the colleague just to try and voice
the concern
that I had with the change because it
wasn't just my boss leaving there was
lots of structural changes this was
going through the GFC and it really
helped me have that reality check so
incidentally talking about it has been a
common theme with a lot of these
survival tactics here and I might just
say that if you have a best mate at work
your chances of being happy versus
crappy increases by 50% so people who
have got best friends at work a 50%
happier than those who don't
so i really suggest that you focus on
that as well as a way to help go from
crappy to happy as well so stay positive
as best you can
yes happens but you've dealt with
change before in the past you can do it
again understand how transitions work we
know that there's a cycle and we know
that it does have an end point and then
finally try and get involved in the
change if you can volunteer for being
part of the the committee that's
initiating the change because then you
can feel more in control so the bottom
line is change isn't going anywhere we
need to learn how to overcome our fear
of it now it changes the reality of any
workplace and if it's not it needs to be
because the riskiest thing that we can
do is not change so today we have learnt
that kylie can be a bitch
we know that kicking crappiness ins butt
is happening in the workplace and pardon
the pun
but you're now part of the movement
happy crappy yeah wake up everyone thank
you so much for your time thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
