going to take these post-it notes uh
gathered and kind of do a a grouping
here and I'm going to ask a few
questions as we go but this only take a
second we have a few more thank you well
look at that all right I'll put that one
there this is fun for me but it's also
got a purpose not sure where that one
goes okay
if you can't read this I apologize but
I'm going to try to I'll read them off
we have a grouping that's rather common
as so interesting
okay alrighty hey everybody so this talk
is about estimates and no estimates
we'll come back to this in a moment
no estimates with a question mark but I
want to start out just coming up with a
common definition of what we're talking
about now everybody's way up above me
here I can't see everybody very well but
we'll have another participatory part to
this and when we do that I'll have you
will figure out how we're going to do
that so I want to talk to you about
first of all the hashtag of no estimates
that's just sort of a consequence of
talking about no estimates if you do it
in Twitter you end up eventually with a
hashtag on it so I want to talk about a
little bit and then come up to a couple
definitions of things so we have a
common understanding so first of all the
hashtag I first started using this in
2012 and I believe I was the first one
at least in this conversation to use the
hashtag of no estimates but what I was
intending because this came from earlier
talks that I had given was to I was
talking about the sorts of things that
people are reluctant to talk about that
I think we should be talking about when
we're doing software development and so
basically these are the status quo sort
of items the things that
we just do because that's what we do and
I believe it's in those areas that we
hide a lot of our problems because we're
no longer willing to discuss these
things maybe it's too hard to discuss
them may we're not allowed to discuss
them but one example that was estimates
and as I started talking about these
sorts of things and talking about
estimates it really turned out that
there was a lot of reluctance to talk
about it but once you got talking about
it there was also a lot of what I would
say difficulty in having a calm
discussion so I thought we should be
able to have a calm discussion about it
so that's basically what the hashtag was
for I started using it in 2012 I didn't
invent this hashtag to be controversial
I used it to show to use as a marker for
this bigger discussion and I was I'd
read a little article for someone else
that had been discussing this with about
a project I worked on where we did not
use estimates and then wanted to know
how did that work how did that go so I
wrote this article about it and it
really actually turned out that that got
a lot of attention and so it started
building the conversation that I was
really looking for I wanted to find
people who were interested in talking
with me about problems they had seen
with estimates and how they dealt with
it so that was basically you know what
was interesting to me and this was a
mechanism for getting that I'm going to
plug in my clicker thing here and see if
that works okay
so the thing is the controversy came for
free this was not what I intended it
just was something that had happened so
let's go from there
I like to share this concept right here
I learned this about 20 or 30 years ago
maybe actually 35 years ago from a
gentleman so I wanted to learn some
stuff from and I tracked him down and I
said you know I got this stuff I want to
learn from you and he said yeah I'd be
happy to show you however that's
important stuff but there's something
that's a lot more important and he
shared this quote from an artist with me
from about a hundred years ago and I
took this to heart basically if we use
this for software
development this we could read as the
object isn't to create great software
it's to be in that wonderful state where
great software is inevitable and I like
to think of it a little bit more
expanded and that is to think that this
isn't about creating software as such
it's about creating the environment in
which software will just happen and the
right stuff will happen I want everybody
to excel in their life and to excel in
their work and when we do that we create
that environment we're going to get
better stuff done we're going to get the
right things done so what happened for
me is this kind of game became a guiding
light and that's what I'm sharing here
over all that is that if we can make an
environment where it's safe for us to
talk about things like are the estimates
helping us that's going to help us
overall already so we have to narrow
down the conversation because otherwise
this goes into too much to talk about so
if I narrow down the conversation to a
specific use of estimates and that's all
I want to talk about for the moment then
we can have a sane conversation and I'm
going to give you a little bit of that
so first I want to start with this this
is about I'm asking what is an estimate
what in what is the essence of what an
estimate is I've grouped them over here
as the things that come to me close to
guests so here's one that says a wild
guess here's somebody who said wrong an
estimate is wrong I think that that kind
of is a comment that's saying regardless
have how we do it it's still not very
helpful to us and I'm going to kind of
group that and guess is that okay -
putting yes so everybody think that's
okay okay
so here's one that says a guess here's
one that says guess here's one that says
it's a number and I would take that to
mean it's sort of a meaningless number
is that okay to call that a guess tell
me no or yes yes okay I don't want to
force you to think the same way I do
what I want to do is come to a common
understanding we can move that out if we
want to a glance into a crystal ball I'm
going to put that under guess is that
okay
a guess guess automatically goes under
guess guess work
a guess a guess a guess I want to get
every one of these up there a lottery
that's almost worse than a guess but I'm
going to put that over there right and
this last one here is a prediction is it
okay to call a prediction a guess I'm
gonna call that a guess we may have
different beliefs about that oh here's
one that says a wish so that's kind of
saying well I hope it's going to be like
this so I'm going to put that under
guess if that's all right with you all
righty now here's some other kinds of
words its breakable it's difficult it's
an expectation so is it really so I'm
going to move this over I think to there
it's getting an idea of how long
something will take does it really give
you an idea of how long something will
take or is it a guess about how long
something will take nobody's willing to
you're afraid of what I'll do to you if
you say it wrong let's let's just we'll
leave that over here it's an interval
I'm not sure how to rate that one so I'm
just going to put that here here we have
time a measurement I'm not sure an
estimate is a measurement but maybe it's
an estimate of a measurement it's a its
resources its cost so I could say it
this way an estimate is a guess about
the time or the resources of the cost so
that makes sense
and over here we have a deadline an
expectation or an expectation so guess
an estimate is a guess about the time
cost effort whatever so we can set a
deadline that's the beginnings of what I
usually find so when I do this I did
this several times going to skip to
ahead this is one where I had a group of
about 100 people who responded this pile
over here is Ida Kate use my arrow here
doesn't work very good about 25 of those
stickies say guess or something close
enough that the group accepted as guess
and then we've got time cost
work so we're making it's the same thing
you came up with here I've done this
exercise something like 200 times now
and I get a very similar layout to this
so are we agreed that an estimate is a
guess about time or cost so we can do
some kind of planning is that good
enough shout it out if you if you gets
that you just tell me I'm wrong if I'm
wrong tell you I'm right if I'm right
all right so I'm right enough so then I
could come up with this kind of a
definition so this is what I want to be
talking about its approximate
calculation or judgment we could call
that a guess about the time amount of
time work timer elapsed time we'll talk
that about that next to create a project
to feature some bit of work in
developing software so that's sort of
how I want to do it when we say it's a
calculation or approximate calculation
or judgment I'm going to replace the
word guess I think it's a guess I should
just change that in the slides all
righty so let's do an estimate you're
going to have to somebody's going to
have to shout out so I hate to put you
on the spot here it is we're going to
take this little thing to estimate three
months from today you will need to write
your name on a white in this card with a
blue fountain pen how long will that
take to actually do the work we're not
telling you three months it's the day
you need to do the work how long is that
going to take
somebody 10 seconds you'd have to get
everything first but we could write the
name in 10 seconds or is that what we
said let's stick with 10 seconds but
you're kind of going down the right path
that's what we need to ask because if I
asked you so if it's 10 seconds to write
our name we have everything we need to
do it what if we needed to do it right
now
how long would it take somebody venture
I guess an hour what do we need to do to
be able to do it we have to find the
index card and we have to find the pen
so that's sort of what you were asking
right so the actual work of writing the
name may not be all the work
but an hour I would say it's possible
that could be optimistic because first
of all you don't know what size of an
index card we need to write it on and
you don't know if we allow it to have
lines on it or not so that's a beginning
what about another requirement when I
say a blue fountain pen do I mean a
fountain pen with blue ink or a fountain
pen it is blue in color if you brought
it to me and it's a and it's blue ink I
go that's not what I meant used to black
fountain pen then you wouldn't have met
the requirement so this is kind of the
problem with estimates of all the time
we think we understand what we need to
make the estimate of we'll get onto this
a little bit later so this I just want
to show about the actual work time which
is the time it takes to do the work if
we don't have any waiting we don't have
any we don't have anybody interrupting
us we have all the things we need to do
it and the day goes relatively well so
that might be the actual time to do it
no context switching what happens when
the boss comes in and taps you on the
shoulder and they say can I interrupt
you for a moment and what do you answer
when they do that you already have so
clearly you can so the other part of it
though is the elapsed time so that's how
much time sometimes we call this cycle
time or lead time I use elapsed that's
the time from when we first start to
work till we're done with it so in the
case of the writing with the fountain
pen when we started is when we went out
and got more requirements and says you
what size of a card could have lines on
it is that a blue pen or is a blue ink
or whatever and then we go and buy the
things that we need may we order them
online and we get them now we do the
actual work which is what we thought
they were as asked us to estimate in the
first place and then we can deliver it
so that could take a while in fact I've
done this like I said this exercise a
several hundred times in the audience I
usually ask does anybody actually have a
fountain pen with blue ink an actual
fountain pen does anybody have one here
this is a rare thing anymore because we
usually don't even have pens on us you
know we're using our
our Twitter device that's about all we
got so if we have these two different
understandings of what an instrument is
about that we really need there's some
stuff we got to figure out there's
really some stuff we got to figure out
our estimate is going to be useful for
us until we have a good definition now I
like to do this little exercise and I
think I have enough people here to do it
but I'm not going to do it on post-it
notes what I'm going to ask us to do is
to gather into groups of three and four
if you're sitting there people that
looks like you can actually interact
with them without getting in a fight
then group up that way if nobody wants
to work with you that's telling you
something you should pay attention to so
what I want you to do is just group into
groups of three or four quickly come up
with three four or five ideas about why
do we do estimates and then I'm going to
put a timer on then I'm going to kind of
ask the audience so each group be ready
with a couple of your ideas or maybe
just one idea and then we'll go and see
how many unique ideas we can find why do
you why do we do estimates you ready to
do that talk to the people near you or
you can turn around talk to people
behind you if the people behind you are
turning around talking to the people
behind them then talk to people in front
of you go ahead and do it you got three
minutes I bet you we have enough ideas
now do we does everybody did everybody
come up with least a couple ideas so
somebody just give me the first somebody
give me one of the ideas why do we do
estimates because we have to
because you've been asked to do it by
somebody you can't deny okay anything
different than that one well I should
ask first how many got something like
that so that's at least twelve or
fifteen groups and we only have twenty
groups here maybe right what else do we
get for learning okay what else so time
effort tracking the tracking system we
use requires this yes so we're doing
this so we can guess whether we can do
this amount of work within a specific
amount of time okay what else to plan
resources do we plant enough corn this
year is that what we mean like did we
buy of human resources okay they tell us
nowadays don't call humans resources I
call them people what else
cost-benefit so a cost-benefit analysis
as to whether there's a chance this will
make money for us two weeks to develop
we'll do something else because we won't
get enough benefit out of it right what
else anything different to set
priorities should we do this first or
that first what else
to see if we have the same understanding
anything different what's that for
pricing so that's so we can give
somebody a price this software would
cost you eight million six hundred and
fifty thousand five thousand money units
and that's what we need to tell them so
they can make a decision is that what
we're saying you're giving a bit so
somebody else can use that information
you're giving it to them to give them a
idea of the cost and that is one of the
things we had there any others I have a
feeling there's probably five or six
others but their nuances let's work with
that because I think I can work with
that
so in software development we use
estimates to attempt to predict the
future because for example we can do the
cost analysis and determine if the
benefit is sufficient only based on our
estimates when we actually do the work
maybe nobody wants to use the software
we just wrote and we goofed up on the
value estimate but I'm not really
talking about value estimates here just
the cost side but part of it is let's
figure out the cost so we want to know
things like when will it be done how
much will it cost what can we get done
during this period of time I think all
these you brought up how many people
will we need what can we get for this
money and then of course you said over
here because we have to because
somebody's forcing us to do them and we
want to keep our job so this is sort of
what we talked about this is close to
what you gave me here but somebody else
takes a couple of you took it a little
bit further because we don't just do
these estimates and then we get that
information we're going to use the
information for something and so
basically we why do we do them we use
this information to help us make
decisions and I think this is part of
where the problem starts because we want
to help making decisions then I've asked
this question in many places I very
rarely hear back this we want this
information to help us make good
decisions they just want to help make
decisions I actually brought with me a
very economical decision-making
mechanism with me
and if I flip this coin I'm not sure
which is heads or tails but I could say
the side with the date and I say if the
side with the date comes up then we'll
do this and if not we won't that helped
me make the decision because maybe
others were reluctant to make the
decision so we don't just need help
making the decision we want help making
a good decision so but we heard another
one too so most of it is we want
information that helps us make the
decision also to explode
- spark the conversation so I think a
couple of you here kind of said that
this opens up the floor to the
conversation I'm going to kind of cover
that later if we have enough time I
think there are other and perhaps better
ways to have that conversation I'm just
kind of suggesting that so I'm going to
share with you some of my thinking so we
don't have enough time to make this a
full workshop so but I just wanted to
get a little bit of this to get
information from you hopefully we're on
the same page as understanding why do we
do the estimates and what an estimate is
we're making some guesses to help us
hopefully make good decisions
so part ii there are 83 parts so we're
going to have to rush through the rest
of them I want to talk about how it
started for me have any of you heard me
tell this before anybody here okay
because I was here a couple years ago
and maybe they've replaced all the
developers they had then with new
developers I guess so I want to tell
this story because I once this occurred
for me I started noticing something
similar all over the place and that's
what started making me think we better
be talking about this so I took a job in
1999 it was the second quarter of 1999 I
just finished a contract it was glorious
the people didn't do estimates they
worked in a very extreme programming
manner of delivering something into
production or close to production
depending on what exactly they were
doing daily they would take on some work
work very closely with the customer
start delivering stuff right away and
there weren't any estimates needed for
what they were doing I really liked
everything about what they were doing I
thought I want more of this and so as I
learned about it was extreme programming
most of what they were doing we would
recognize now as being agile so I
thought I like this I want more of this
well I couldn't find anything like this
exactly and there was nothing called
agile then agile didn't come along till
2001 as a term as a way of thinking
about it so this was the scenario there
were there was a large important project
for a company with they were hiring 200
software developers most of them were
quite young I was one of the oldest in
the group and this was almost well 20
years ago almost and but what I liked
about it they were going to do what's
called IID which is iterative
incremental development it's sort of
like agile the idea would be that you're
going to do some bit of work you're
going to get it into use you can learn
something from it but they left out to
get it into use part still they were
doing these iterations I liked it I
wanted more of that and also a big part
of this is that they were going to do a
lessons learned at the end of each
iteration it was sort of an open-ended
contract for me but they thought this
work would take three to six months how
long is a three-month project by the way
can anybody tell me three-month project
is about two years it's very accurate
thank you so this did turn into about a
two-year project I left after six months
because I didn't want to be part of that
what I would consider nastiness of the
test test and fix cycle and breaking
things and fixing them and they break
something else in fixing them and it
went on for a long time there okay so I
like this so here we are the first week
they grabbed gathered everybody together
and we charged out to do our designing
and our basically upfront work for this
iteration we were determining how much
can we get done how long would it take
to do this thing versus that thing they
were making decisions like that and then
they designed the the modules we were
going to write and off we would go to
write them and at the end of the three
weeks or six weeks we did the lessons
learned I noticed two things from the
lessons learned meetings that we had
that really stuck out the first one was
our estimates were off they weren't very
helpful to us why did it why did we not
get as much done and why was why was
there a
a lot of things that took much longer
than we thought they should take they
asked how are we going to fix this so
what would you do if your estimates are
off what is one way that you can fix
them maybe somebody could shout that out
what do you do well multiply it by a
number let's use four but yes that let's
Pat it but what do we do what can we do
we can inflate them well that's kind of
the easy way they really wanted to
sincerely do something get better at
estimates that's what they thought we
need to get better at estimates there's
a bunch of young people they really
haven't had a chance to learn how to do
estimates they have to get better at
estimates so the management firms said
we'll give some trainers in here we'll
learn how to do the estimates also the
other thing I noticed was kind of
twofold
we didn't really we didn't understand
the requirements and they kept changing
well during the development period so
what do we do about that anybody want to
take a stab at it
we should plan better which kind of
means we should understand better the
requirements so there wasn't clear
requirements so let's get clearer
requirements and let's understand them
better and what else we're closer with
the client I'm looking for one thing we
often do let's cover the second one the
requirements kept changing let's not
allow them to change so that's called
change control hopefully you're not
living in that world anymore but that's
what we decide we needed to do now I
didn't decide that me being slightly
older than everyone else had already
seen these problems and I had a
suspicion they weren't actually the real
problems so we worked hard to get better
we got some study on how to do estimates
we practiced we we worked diligently to
do better estimates and we worked hard
to control the changes and understand
things better in the first place we
charged off on our second iteration of
six weeks at the end of which we had our
lessons learned I noticed two things
maybe kind of three that we were having
a problem with that came up as being
important enough for us to try and
prove what were those two things the
estimates were off and the requirements
were unclear and they kept changing I
don't need to go through it very I can
just bring them all out we know what's
happening here they decided to do the
same thing let's get better at estimates
we just clearly didn't get better last
time let's control the changes let's
understand things better we actually
worked hard to do that everybody there
was very diligent about getting better
at their craft they were trying to learn
to do what was expected of them what
they were told to do I'm glad you were
here that was a good thing to say we
charged off to do the work and at the
are lessons learned what did we find
same thing so what do we do about this
at by this point I thought I should say
something you know there was like six or
seven of us that were about my age group
and most everybody else was half our age
and I thought being that kind of older
guy I wasn't a manager I was just one of
the developers I thought I should bring
this up and this is exactly what I said
I don't think we're actually dealing
with the problem we're having I think
we're dealing with us what I would call
a symptom of a problem and I had seen
enough of these iterations three
iterations that I could say this might
be a pattern so you hear this quote from
Einstein they attribute to Einstein does
anybody know the quote I'm referring to
doing the same thing over and over and
expecting a different outcome should be
the definition of insanity I don't know
if you actually said that but maybe he
did that's sort of what I saw here they
were expecting to learn something from
doing this over and over so I actually
told them this in a meeting after that
meeting nobody would talk to me and that
went on for several days and I finally
cornered somebody in a hallway a young
man
unfortunately for young people even
though they're faster and stronger than
us older people they get surprised so I
cornered him and he didn't know how to
get away I actually literally put my
arms out and I said Jim and he couldn't
turn away now he had to talk
with me why won't anybody talk with me
and he said the managers told us not to
talk with you so this told me that yeah
I actually hit a nerve this was a bigger
problem than just us not being good at
something I won't go into the details
any more of that but that led me to
think I need to give a name to this
thing so this is what I had noticed we
would do something we would end up with
some problems we would try to fix the
problems we would go further in doing
that thing again
and this cycle would just continue and I
gave this a name and I think that this
is the same pattern I've seen now for
almost 20 years at many of the places
I've worked I call it the cycle of
continuous no improvements and this can
go on and on week after week or month
after month we do retrospectives we pick
things we want to get better at and we
never get better at them okay so I want
to move just a little further and I want
to go kind of quickly through the next
set of stuff but I want to wrap this up
by saying if if the estimates were off
was a symptom what was the actual
problem I'm not asking you to answer
that but I would like you to think about
that and have conversations about that
this is part of why I'm going out and
doing these talks is I want people to
start being willing to talk about these
things if the requirements weren't clear
is just a symptom and not the problem
then what's the actual problem in other
words if we define the requirements a
lot better up front and I still didn't
solve our problem then because it was
really about the understanding but what
is the problem the last one was they
kept changing if that's not the problem
keeping them from changing won't solve
it what might be the actual problem so
I'm not again I'm not asking you to
answer that right now these are the
kinds of things I think we need to be
talking about let's stop looking at
symptoms and calling them problems let's
gather up the symptoms and see what
problems they might be actually the
symptom of it's kind of like if you get
a if you have a food allergy and you get
a rash on your skin and you put cream on
the rash what
be dealing with the symptom of the food
allergy that's kind of what I'm talking
about here so parts are remembered now
we only have 80 parts left after this
I'm going to talk about some questions
really quickly let me do this quickly
this is usually done for me as a seven
minute lightening talk but I want to
introduce it with this concept from
Peter block transformation comes more
from pursuing profound questions than
seeking practical answers this reminds
me of something my dad used to tell me
when I was a kid I heard him say there's
something like this several times he
said a really good question leads to a
better question not to an answer until
you finally get to a question that
resolves itself so you keep asking a
little bit better questions based on the
question you already have that can lead
you to a to the real thing you need to
be dealing with so I kind of like that
idea
so sometimes I will take a topic that
I'm interested in and I've noticed thing
that everybody wants to get to how do we
solve this and I want to say what's the
right question to ask instead of how do
we solve it so I'll go through a series
of questions I'll make up as many good
questions I can I'll make up a question
and I'll reverse the question I'll ask
it from two different points of view
I'll ask other people what would you
think about it I'm looking for that
better question and I think that's
served me pretty good so first of all I
like to imagine how wonderful things
could be even though I don't know if how
we would get there I just know that we
can always steer towards better if we
have a process that or a way of thinking
that allows us to do it and I like to
take pretty usually pretty small baby
steps it's not always the only way this
is really about the difference between
the things we think we want and the
really wonderful things that we could
have if we allowed ourselves to have
them but there might be some problems
are getting our way so first of all we
want control uncertainty control and
certainty maybe a problem when we ask to
have control uncertainty maybe there's
something else we should be talking
about
and in this case we're talking about we
want control certainty of the time the
cost we didn't quite get schedules on
here but we would normally if we had a
hundred of these we would find something
like that there you see where we're at
here we want certainty of these things
so to get that certainty we need to make
a bunch of guesses and we try to do them
as good as we can
some people come scientific or educated
or a reason to guess they're still just
guesses so we can do the planning that
we need to do I would ask this question
can we improve our chance at wonderful
if we give up this desire to have
control uncertainty it's worth pondering
what does this have to do with estimates
so this is what I like to think I
believe that there may be whenever I see
a symptom like this or something that's
showing itself to potentially be a
symptom I start wondering is there a
hidden problem and I want to start
investigating that and asking those
questions
I don't think of estimates as being the
problem I rarely see estimates
themselves as the problem I think that
they're a potential symptom if I start
investigating and I don't find a real
problem quickly then the estimates
probably aren't a problem our ARDS
aren't a symptom of a problem they're
just there but I'm looking for what
could be wrong with it everybody does
estimates everywhere I've been and
through many many projects almost
everybody does estimates why do we do
them well partly because they seem like
the right thing to do how can something
that seems so right to so many people
actually be wrong but to me this is a
great picture my wife does all the
pictures that I use in my talks
she's a children's book illustrator and
author she did this for another story
you probably recognize sort of the theme
of this one but I like this because this
nice attractive candy house it could be
a fun thing to go and enjoy an afternoon
there until you get too sick eating
candy I suppose but I like to smoke
that's coming out the chimney it's kind
of indicating there's something sinister
going on here so that's why I like to
use this in this
often the things that look the best are
miss guiding us we have to be careful
about that one question I'd like to ask
is how much work did we have to do to
get to the point where we had sufficient
information to come up with what we
might consider a reasonable guess how
much do we invest in the first place how
much did we estimate that work I've
actually had people ask can you estimate
how long it would take to estimate this
project have you has anybody else ever
had that I'm gonna see there's at least
15 people who've had that asked of them
how do we want to make a estimate about
the estimate about the estimate of how
long it will take us to do the work
how many estimates do we need before we
decide we'll even do the estimate that's
tricky this one I referred to earlier
how do we know we made a good decision
one that I often hear is we use the
estimates to decide whether we should do
project date or project B if we decide
to do project 2a and we do it what have
we learned about project B along the way
nothing and if project a fails we're
really in a fix because we made a best
guess as to which projects we should do
and now we really didn't learn anything
should have we done the other one do we
know it was a good decision about the
priorities about how many people we
should hire whatever the decision
happens to be so I like to use this a
little bit as sort of commentary from
Russell Acuff you should read some of
his things he's got stuff on YouTube as
well I believe he passed away a couple
decades or a decade or so ago managers
who don't know how to measure what they
want start wanting what they can measure
I don't think I have to even say
anything about that I've seen this I I
would guess most of you have seen this
because we can measure something that
starts becoming our goal there's another
famous quote I think is a good heart
slog someone will have to tell me as
soon as you turn a measure into a target
it stops being a reasonable measure
these are troubling things let's go on
are these things we think we want like
those things we know we can measure are
they a trap is it start us thinking that
we need
to get those things and I'm going to ask
does it make us become inflexible and
this is sort of the idea the sunk cost
fallacy we've already spent a hundred
thousand money units on this thing we
don't want to throw that away we should
get it done and then we spend another
hundred thousand and another hundred
thousand of course here a hundred
thousand is like a week's pay right I
don't know but you know what I'm saying
right so whatever you're using to judge
we've already spent a bunch of money
that can force us into thinking we need
to keep down this past that really isn't
going to end well for us but we don't
yet know if it's going to end well we
need a better way to think about things
is it a hardening agent what I've seen
often is once people make a decision
they're reluctant to unmake the decision
and I think that's something we need to
really consider we should make it easy
to undo decisions as soon as we have
information that shows us maybe we're
going down the wrong path so I'll give
just one example of a thing is on-time
and on-budget a good measure of success
on a project I'm not really going to ask
you to say it out loud but think about
that for a moment if you get the project
done on time and on budget what do we
really know it might be what we know is
that we padded it like you were saying
here so much that we couldn't get it
wrong and once we padded something that
much we end up using all the time we
allocated for it I've seen that also a
lot of times hopefully you haven't much
but it's not uncommon I'm going to share
a couple of the what I would call
creative accounting things I've seen we
talked about the padding of the
estimates so if we know we need to pad
that why do we need to pad the estimates
anyway my shot shout that out for me
because they're an actor and we know if
something is going to go wrong and it's
probably based on there are a bunch of
unknowns that we can't know right now
we're doing the estimates at the point
in the project we know the least amount
about it so we're worried let's Pat it
well that's a creative that's not is
that really a helpful thing to do we're
just trying to manage somebody's
expectations but I've seen this feature
cuts a feature cut is when we've done a
substantial amount of work on a project
and we have some features that we know
are we're not gonna be able to deliver
because they're not getting through our
testing process and we literally cut cut
those features out that's to get us done
on time but if we're done on time but
and we cut features did we really get
done on time
we got ton up by the deadline but it
wasn't for all the stuff we thought we
could get done another one this is quite
a bit more hideous and that is that we
are asked to not put our time against
the bookkeeping for this project I will
not ask for a show of hands on that
because that indicates some really deep
problems but in your heart if you know
you've been asked to do this you might
really want to delve into what is the
ramifications of this a similar thing to
it is we're asked to work a lot of hours
near the end of the project you get
crunch time I will have set if anybody
ever had crunch time we had to work
extra hours at the end of the project
way I'd say way over half of you've
raised your hands what this basically
means is the next project they will say
all that other project takes six weeks
this next one's like that one it will
only take six weeks which implies we're
all going to have to work a lot of extra
time near the end if it was really that
easily compared and it's not but these
kinds of creative estimating mechanisms
or I should say creative accounting
around it ruins our chance of having
good data if good data could help us I'm
going to suspect good data wouldn't so I
would ask this question is getting
better at estimates actually going to
help if it's just a symptom it probably
won't it's getting better the only way
so I kind of like to do use this as a
kind of a bit of a joke but it's really
true for me you've heard the old idea of
garbage in garbage out with data if you
give garbage into your reporting system
your reports are going to be worthless
but for me and junk food
I have weighed a lot more than I weigh
right now if I eat the junk food garbage
in garbage stays and then I have
problems losing that weight so can you
eat junk food in a better way to chew it
more slowly do you chew it more quickly
do you only eat it at a certain time of
day that might help what things can we
do to make the junk food less of a pro
besides eating less of it or none of it
what can we do well I want to suggest
some of the possibilities but yeah you
can't eat junk food in a safe way that
will get rid of the problems of the junk
food okay so maybe there are
alternatives the alternative on the junk
food is one thing is don't eat the junk
food another one would be fill yourself
up on healthy food and if you still have
some room left well then you don't have
as much room for the junk food I don't
know you come up with your own ideas
this is a really question that I want to
ask if the kinds of decisions that we're
making require that we use estimates
maybe there are some other kinds of
decisions we should be making on our
projects
I've already seen for talks here today
at least well three talks in the part of
another one and I'm hearing a lot of
this over and over ideas about how can
we work in such a way that we deliver
small batches really quickly and learn
from what we're doing it's probably part
of the theme of modern software
development there are other kinds of
decisions but we're asking what are
those decisions what would they be maybe
there are better ways so we have just
enough time to cover a couple more
things I want to wrap this up by asking
first of all what should we be certain
about and I'll give you the answer of
what I think I think we should be
certain about that we have an
environment where people can excel in
their life and people can excel in their
work where it's easy for them do the
best they can and they love doing it if
we create that environment we're going
to get the best results this group of
people and this company is able to get
at the same time then we're going to be
creating an environment where the great
solutions are inevitable based on that
earlier slide I want it to just be we
put everything in place so great things
will happen that's the way I like to
approach it what must we control there's
lots of answers I can give for this but
this is the one that's worked best for
me I think let's control our urge to
control things I'll let that sink in for
a second but if we just quit worrying
about having that control that might be
the best thing to learn to control once
we've done that
on the pain of all this other stuff can
go away I'm going to share a little
saying from birthday bonus
does anybody know who that is so I say
his name correctly so that sound about
right
it's only one or two of you know who it
is so I think he's right now the
vice-president of performance at statoil
and he's written this book called beyond
implementing beyond budgeting but he's
got this little saying I really like the
fear of losing control is a big barrier
to try to change the fear is a barrier
but much of that control is just an
illusion of control and I would say in
most cases it is playing out an illusion
of control but the fear is real and
that's the problem we can't ignore that
that fear exists so we can't just rush
back to our company and say I heard this
guy talking about no estimates and I'd
like to do this and then when you get
there you get fired for saying things
like that so I think that's kind of a
warning I know of two people who came
back to me after hearing one of my talks
or having me come and talk with their
group about it that they got laid off or
fired because they were trying to
introduce these kinds of ideas so I
don't say rush into it I say be cautious
maybe influence change so that at least
in your company you're allowed to talk
about is this thing working is that
thing working
what might we be able to do better
that's sort of where we're at so I think
that I'd like to how much time we have
left 10 10 minutes 15 minutes oh I
should slow down and talk much slower I
have two sections I still want to cover
I do have a lot more material than this
I'm going to be here for the rest of the
conference if you want to talk about
this I'm up for that
I want to just share some ideas I've
heard some from other people most of
these I've heard at conferences or on
videos of toxic conferences Mary
poppendieck who's probably spoken at
this conference I don't know said this
at the keynote at the agile XP I mean
the XP 2016 last year I like this really
successful digital organizations do not
estimate estimates are for cost centers
not for prod
the cost Center is a place in a company
or a department in a company where it
doesn't directly generate income they're
there to manage something like the
facilities and their job is to make sure
everybody's got a desk that will lead to
us being able to work but it doesn't
actually generate income for the company
so what are estimates good for she is
saying the estimates are good for the
cost centers that makes sense there Kent
Beck who hopefully all got some of these
books Kent Beck has just got he's just
full of wonderful ideas and he shares
them all the time I love this one an
alternative to estimates to the most
important thing until either it ships or
it's no longer the most important thing
that's a simple rule it's easy to try
and you would know pretty quickly if
it's working for you or not that's
that's worth experimenting with I like
this one from Martin Fowler again I'm
showing these slides I want to tell you
I don't know whether they agree with me
on anything I'm not trying to say this
is proof of what I'm doing I'm just
sharing some other things I've seen
Martin says this team's progress at
first they struggle with estimating and
then they get pretty good at it and
eventually to get to the point where
they don't need it or often don't need
it I'd like to start at the we often
don't need it part and not worry about
that trying to get better at them I
think he's implying here and I could be
wrong that we still need to go through
this process of getting to where we
don't need them anymore
I like what this Michelle McCarthy says
as she has a radio or a podcast kind of
a show with her husband Jim one of the
problems with the schedule is that it
gives us the idea that we can take that
long so whenever we make a schedule
we're tricking ourselves I think it's
what there was a law of that as well is
it Parkinson's law or something like
that you know work will grow to fill the
time we've allocated for it once we make
that schedule well you know we're going
to get wasted into that schedule we put
things off until the last minute all
sorts of things another really great I
love Ron Jeffries and I really enjoyed
this book he came out with recently
nature of software development
estimating when will be done is wrong
forcing the answer is worse and I think
that that's sort of what you brought up
we do the estimates because we're told
we need to do the estimates
I've heard Bob Martin speak on estimates
several times he has a talk on doing
estimates and you can get a video of it
from some of the conference's gennady's
also got a video on his website where
you the clean coder website where you
can buy the video there really
entertaining but he basically said this
the only honest estimate is I don't know
now he still advocates for estimates I
don't have a problem with that but if we
really understand at the end of any
estimate we have to remind our boss or
the person who's asked for it or whoever
thinks they need the estimate to still
say here's my estimate but really I
don't know so after a while they get
kind of where they go maybe we shouldn't
ask that guy for estimates anymore I
don't know but this is sort of I think
what he's suggesting he also says I
quoted him from a talk most estimates
are lies so he's trying to get us to
where we're doing at least honest
estimates so I'll share a couple more
Joshua Carey atsuki I worked with him
for a bit in industrial logic he's a
wonderful guy he's experimented he says
in 2007 with what can we do instead of
estimates especially the 'story point
estimates and velocity and they dropped
using them and when I worked with him
for six months I was with his company we
didn't do any estimates at all we were
programming almost every day remotely
doing some mob programming I never heard
anyone ask for an estimate or I never
heard anyone giving an estimate I show
Fred Brooks you know who fred brooks is
he wrote the mythical man-month
he's got this set of essays just because
he's so friendly and it makes me by
association look like I'm a good guy so
I like this I don't know if he's ever
said anything about estimates that
really plays into my thinking but I like
this one it is very difficult to make a
vigorous plausible job risking defense
of an estimate that it's derived by no
quantitative method supported by little
data and certified chiefly by the
hunches of managers now I'm not sure if
that really is alignment with what I'm
talking about but I like this I like the
way he talks I'm going to share a couple
slides from people who have also been
talking about this
Vasko - already wrote a book I think you
can get this book rather economically
online
this is something that he says basically
what he's saying here is that we make
estimates about a system we know nothing
about we think that we have something we
can make predictions on but we haven't
anything to observe yet I like that
Neil Killick was one of the original
people also talking about no estimates
starting in 2012 and I like this little
one that he says here there are ways to
deliver software with no estimates and
people are figuring out how to do this
if somebody says you can't do this
I disagree I've been working this way
for almost 10 years starting 2009 I have
not done a estimate for software
development and I've worked on dozens if
not a hundred projects in that time
interesting to me that people say you
can't do this
double poncho who is given three or four
great talks you can find online he's got
a lot too good to say about biases and
and our assumptions and our the ideas
that we just do things and we don't
realize what's employing us to do them
so it's worth looking up some of the
stuff he's done estimates predispose us
to a solution I've talked about that
already as we went but what this means
to me is once we've kind of made the
estimate we probably are going to stick
with that path until maybe it's too late
for us Alan's here he's given another
talk he also talks he has a great video
on no estimates well worth the hour it
would take to watch it easy to find in
YouTube he says why do we estimate
anyway it's just a habit a ritual we do
it even when we can't come up with an
actual reason you came up with some
reasons but I've been to a lot of places
where you just do your estimates and you
just can't question it so we're getting
near the being done I think that I want
to quickly run through this next little
part this is how I've actually worked
without estimates and they do it
probably faster than I should but I
think I can do it in five minutes is
that about right five minutes so often
they want people ask can you add you
know do you have any questions near the
end of something like this I don't think
that's reasonable for us to do here so
I'll be here the rest of the conference
just
ask me questions and we can talk we
don't need to do it like this I'm just
the same as the rest of you just closer
to the end of my life okay so the value
of another's experience is not to tell
us whether or how we should do something
it's to give us some kind of hope that
we can also improve our our environment
where we're working this is what I'm
about so I'm going to tell you a lot of
times a product expert a product owner
whatever brings you a project as if it's
this work of art everything's neat
everything's in its place it's really
clean they want to bring to you put it
on your desk and say that's the project
we want it's all defined see you later
they think they've defined the project
but this is full of those symptoms that
we were talking about I think the
project looks a little more like this
there's a different work of art this
indicates to me there's all kinds of
stuff we're thinking about and put a lot
of stuff we don't even recognize yet and
I think it's even worse that around the
edges it's cloudy and when we get near
the edge we go oh man there's a whole
bunch of this over there and down below
and up above and we're surrounded by all
these things we can never know if up
front so this is what I believe it's in
the doing of the work that we can
discover the work that we must do we
have to start doing stuff so we can
expose reality let's find something to
work on and try to deliver that we won't
do this as an exercise but this is what
I'm going to cover for just a second
often what ends up happening is we do
estimates so we can have the
conversation about how long something
like take and we want to learn more
about it but what's important is the
criteria on which we base those
estimates let's see what that is for me
I'm not looking for size or smallness
I'm looking for something I can work on
and I put it this way it has to have
some kind of potential value it has to
be recognizable
it means like in that Jackson Pollock
painting I could see the different
orange spots orange this is kind of
anything those things might be cohesive
maybe those things should be brought
together let's look at what that was it
needs to be understandable once we get
something I want to be able to
understand it if this is all the
requirements
on this project I can't understand this
whole project but I can understand some
small part of it if I take that small
part I have something I maybe can get a
chance to understand if it's potentially
valuable let's just say I recognize that
part as being potentially valuable and
I'm talking with my customer so yeah
that would be valuable for us to have I
can figure out what's cohesive what
belongs together and what doesn't and
figure out which one of these do we want
to work on first and now I've gotten
something quite a bit smaller and I did
no estimates this is clearly smaller
than what this was originally and each
one of these bits is smaller this is now
smaller because we've taken out
something to work on I want it to be
distinct that to me means that it's very
clearly a chunk this is something that's
distinct that I could decouple from the
rest and I want it to be cohesive this
stuff actually belongs together if we
have five drop-down boxes but two of
them can be done as a pair and the other
three can be done separately let's do
the two first what we've done is we've
got so many Canal D couple work on
deliver into use and determine what do
we learn from this what I like to see is
that this requires no estimates and when
I find those qualities I have something
I can work on and this gives us another
cycle that cycle is we do a little of
this we do the work on it so we can
learn something from it and on we go
over and over we're delivering from day
one I've worked on many projects now
where we started delivering something of
value in the first day or two and we
just kept adding bits to it I'm not
going to give this example because we've
run out of time but in this example what
I talk about is how we discovered that
there were some things that were more
obviously important to the customer than
others let's start on those and if 80%
of the features give us or 20% of the
features give us most of what we want
for 80% of what we want let's go for
those we can't find those automatically
we have to do some work of actually
delivering and seeing if it's delivering
value once we found one of those things
we think has value I want to do as
little as it is possible when we do as
little of it as possible I'm looking for
the 20% of that feature that will give
most the reason we wanted that feature
we do this I call it 80/20 80/20 it
basically means we can do as little as
four percent of this project and deliver
most of what the customer wanted and
I've seen this in action many times now
I call this deliver features until bored
because once you start doing this the
customer starts realizing they didn't
want the rest of that they got the big
things that there was important to them
done so let's end this up if we could
crank up our ability to do that let's do
that and see how that works for us
that's basically this pattern that we
have an idea we act on it we deliver
something we've learned something and we
go on and at every step we will learn
things we can always go to the story
stage and say not this isn't good let's
go back to another idea or get to the
designing code and say this isn't too
bad but we want to change some things we
have to be open to that now you're hear
me talk about the symptoms that we saw
earlier and what was really the
underneath problem for example change
will happen we don't get to say stop the
changes because it's just going to
happen and of course this is what agile
is about we just do that over and over
and over and over now we should be done
right now so I'm going to go this is the
last slide I've been doing this for
eight plus years and it's worked for me
over and over again and for about the
eight years before it I was
experimenting with it in different
environments and was able to use it
occasionally once a year I'd get some
kind of project where I could do that so
the most important slide of the whole
pack don't forget to vote green when you
leave you put the green card in the
thing and I'm going to be here all day
and the rest of the week I'm happy to
talk with you so thank you very much
