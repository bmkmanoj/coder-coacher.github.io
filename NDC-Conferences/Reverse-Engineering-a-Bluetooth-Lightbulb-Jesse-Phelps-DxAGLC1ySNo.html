about I'm an agile engineering coach and
things that I care about in that role
are feedback loops and team-building and
fun and so we wanted to make build
lights as part of what that all equates
to in our world and you know build
lights are not anything new does anybody
have any of any kind now all right so a
couple people you know lots of options
out there there are some that I've seen
people who actually sell that you can
buy but we wanted to have it be a part
of a team-building exercise to figure
out how to do it ourselves and in that
process we bought a bulb and contacted
the company to get a spec on how you
might be able to communicate it with our
communicate with it with our own code
and told him what we wanted to do and
they basically responded and said that's
a nice idea but no and they wouldn't
tell us how to actually do it so we said
challenge accepted
and set about to figure out how does the
bulb actually work how will we intercept
the communication and have our own code
control the bulb to make these build
lights so that's what those whole
processes came from was being told that
we can't do something and then us
wanting to figure it out so we're gonna
talk about here a little bit is just a
little bit about Bluetooth Low Energy
how it works I'm using teamcity
running in docker container on my
machine here I have an Intel Edison to
actually communicate with the bulb and
have teamcity talk to to manage that
communication the Bluetooth bulb and
then we're gonna do packet sniffing on
that communication between the app that
actually runs the bulb normally the
reverse engineer how that communication
works will use Wireshark to inspect that
protocol and then we'll put it all
together into our own package of code to
be able to control it the way we want
I'll get to that all right
so Bluetooth Low Energy I'm sure
everybody's familiar with it originally
it was actually called Bluetooth smart
but ble Bluetooth Low Energy is what we
all call it now
and it uses this mechanism one of them
anyway is generic attributes you'll see
it's generic attribute profiles and
they're basically key value pairs so you
have an address a handle and you give it
a value and that's how you actually have
all the communication occur in this
Bluetooth Low Energy
and this GATT profile mechanism so
teamcity
I'm just running on my machine like I
said I mean everybody's using something
for continuous integration at this point
right anybody not okay
so I have it running in docker on here
and then there are plugins that you can
put in a team city and I grabbed one
that's called web hooks and it allows me
to just have team city do callbacks to
any address with this particular
structured payload and that gives me
what the status is of that build whether
it's passed failed or in progress
so that's what I'm pulling that in here
honey people are not using containers
anyway all right so I would invest the
time in learning about them soon if you
haven't I mean this is kind of a really
simple overview that I just grabbed from
docker on what they are but does anybody
not know what a container is all right
so we can skip over this all right so I
know this is hard to read on here but
basically this is that payload from the
web hooks and the main thing that we
care about in here are I want to know
the build result what you see up here is
failure in this sample here and there's
also a build status in here that says
whether it's in progress right now or
not state description I think finished
running or finished or started is what
you get out of that all right so the
Intel Edison the Intel Edison is a
really small form-factor microcontroller
that actually it's a full computer that
Intel had out as their IOT was one of
the many IOT platforms that was put out
this is actually the Edison just this
chip here the rest of this board is
their Arduino breakout
and you can emulate an Arduino with the
rest of this board and you have all of
the the form factor headers on here to
be able to use the shield's on this as
well so it's a really nice chip in the
IOT offering space in my opinion this is
the specs on the Edison now and then
this is that breakout board like I said
you need something that Edison is meant
to actually be a production quality chip
that you could use in whatever your real
devices so when you have just the Edison
you don't have anything that you can
easily connect to it there's actually a
70 pin header that you have to have so I
use the Arduino breakout board now I
have some bad news about this though
well I think this was a great platform
Intel has decided to abandon IOT devices
they've realized that it's too
competitive of market and they're not
they don't really know how to operate in
it so they're getting out however good
news is that the Raspberry Pi 3 has
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in on it so
you should be able to use that and do
the exact same thing and you won't have
to add any additional hardware so that's
good you can't you could not do that I
mean could you yes everything can be
done but the amount of work that you're
going to have to go through is going to
be quite extensive because an Arduino is
just a microcontroller and you need
something to actually manage the
Bluetooth stack and communicate so the
systems that are actually a full you
know computing environment are going to
be much more much simpler to deal with
to set this up so alright so the bulb
that I'm using is a flux LED bulb I
don't know I don't know about how all of
the Australian power stuff would work
with this so I don't know what to
recommend in terms of I mean I assume a
hue or any other LED bulb should work
but this is what I got in the US and
just bought it from bluetooth light bulb
calm it was like 20 bucks for the bulb
and the app to control it is free
have an Android iPhone app and I'll run
that in a minute to just kind of show
you what it is but in theory this whole
process should work with any any bulb
any device all right so what we're gonna
get into packet capturing on here on
Android devices you can actually have it
log all of the Bluetooth communication
that it has between the phone and any
device and to do that you go into the
developer options and you turn on the
Bluetooth HCI snoop and depending on the
actual manufacturer of the device that
you're using that data is going to be
logged to different locations on the one
that I have it actually puts it on the
SD card but you'll just have to kind of
research it and figure out for your
particular vendor and I think even I
think even now certain versions of the
OS put it in different place too so it's
kind of a mess but that's how you get
this information easily all right
anybody ever use Wireshark anybody not
familiar with it at all all right so I
think the best way to describe it is
it's like fiddler do you know what
fiddler is all right it's like that
except deeper Fiddler's just getting you
application layer information HTTP calls
Wireshark is all the way down the stack
I mean you get down to your Ethernet
frames that are actually going out on
electrically like you can get the bits
of what's really happening here for the
whole ethernet packet and then it gives
you a lot of tooling that's built into
it to actually help you inspect that and
decipher what those headers are and the
addresses and everything else so very
very powerful tool and convenient for us
it also will work for Bluetooth so we
can actually get the Bluetooth stack has
has several layers to it we just need
the attribute profile layer out and this
can handle stripping that out of the
whole packet for us and make it easier
to get to and then we're gonna put this
all together and I have a node server
that's going to be running on the Edison
and again you should be able to run that
on Raspberry Pi 3 and then I'll have
teamcity running on my local
machine that'll use the webhooks to make
calls back to the Edison and then
there's a node package called noble it's
node Bluetooth Low Energy
and you can use that to easily do the
communication for Bluetooth Low Energy
and then that will actually send the
signals to the bulb to control it so any
questions about that alright and I'm
running this all off of my having the
devices all communicate through my phone
because conference Wi-Fi is never
reliable enough for this so hopefully
this'll all work well here alright let's
do it so first thing here is let me turn
on my Bold and I'll run the app alright
so this app when it runs it picks up
whatever devices are out there and it
knows that it is a bulb that's
compatible with this based on the
identifier on that broadcast address so
it's always gonna be called LED blue -
and then a serial number that identifies
like the version of the bulb so it's
picked that up and I can connect to it
and then now I can simply just have it
change the color of the bulb you can do
they have these functions in here so I
could set it to do this red gradual
change and it just kind of pulses and
there are different colors you can pick
for that you can actually have it set to
do to music
I mean it's they have a lot of features
in their app we just kind of wanted to
have you know a a simple green for
success a red for failure and then what
we wanted was a pulsing blue for build
as in progress so that was what we set
up now to actually get data for what's
this communication happening how do we
make this all work it seemed logical to
you know I have the logging turned on
well I need to fill that log with
repeating patterns so that I can easily
find them and start to identify what
is what is actually a signal that I'm
intending to give the bulb versus the
all the other communication that might
just be part of how the signal gets
there and how the app talks to the bulb
right so hang on it turned off on me so
to actually get that log data you just
want to you know turn it on and off a
bunch of times and maybe I'll rotate
through the colors a bunch and maybe
I'll tap back and forth between a couple
of colors that so I want to get like a
repeating pattern and log right so that
I can identify it when I see that and
that'll help me understand what might
really be relevant here so we filled up
the log now now I'm not actually gonna
move the log file from my phone because
it's actually a huge pain to do I
already have brought one over here so
here is oh I guess I need to kill my
presentation all right so here's
Wireshark so I just
you take that log file that snoop log
filed directly off of your phone and
just tell Wireshark to load it just say
open it and it will handle everything
it'll recognize what it is it's nice and
easy so this is the log file that I've
pulled off of here and I see all of this
Bluetooth communication information in
here and you know I don't really know
what any of this means this is all
basically nonsense to me at this point
so I just kind of continue to look
through it and I start to see this ATT
thing which I know is a way that that
generic attribute is often written when
I'm reading things online so I continue
looking through this and I see a bunch
of these ATT statements in here and you
know I see this this got these these
handles listed here let's let's kind of
continue looking through here and see
what we find anything anything
meaningful stands out at us so now I
know from my original time stamps when I
did this that you know it was further
down in the log here when I when the
time that actually happened so I'm
looking here and I see these
this right request stuff and that seems
like it's actually the device park
potentially telling the bulb to do
something right so I see this handle of
0 0 4 3 and it has this value I don't
know what these things mean at all
but I'm at least starting to get an idea
of what might be useful to be looking
for so let's continue looking down and
here's another write request let's let's
keep looking for some of those alright
so here is where we'll start to see I
was turning it on and off and you know
this looks like the same command being
sent but just toggling back and forth
right so that might be useful for us to
keep track of that maybe this is how I
turn it on and off and as we continue to
go down here further we start to see
some things that look like color values
maybe that I'm on a wheel and I'm just
making incremental changes right these
addresses this add to this value here
doesn't have a lot of changing to it
let's keep going down further and you
know it just I started to discern the
pattern here right that like this is
just a hex value of color in the middle
of this packet so that's also useful for
us to keep track of now let's see how
might we get the Edison to actually talk
to the bulb directly and start playing
around with it so the IDE that they have
for the Edison is the Intel XDK
and basically it has an SSH terminal it
has a terminal that works over Bluetooth
but I'm just going to do the the serial
terminal here and just running Linux on
here Yocto Linux is what it's called
Linux has the Bluetooth stack is called
bluesy and so you can go out and read
about that and and get an understanding
of it well there are a couple of tools
that come in that stack and one of those
is called GATT tool G ATT tool and
that's what we're gonna use to actually
try to connect to the bulb and send me
see what happens one of the first things
we need to do though before we can do
that is figure out what's the actual
address for this bulb because when we
want to use gat tool it's expecting us
to give it an address to actually
connect to so we have to find that so to
get that address let me disconnect the
phone so one of the things that you'll
note about the Bluetooth devices is
aspecting ble devices when they first
power on they just start broadcasting
that they're available to connect to and
then as soon as something connects to it
it stops that broadcast and it won't
listen for another connect request so I
have to actually tell it to disconnect I
have to have the phone disconnect from
the bulb so that the bulb will listen
again all right
so power cycle the bulb here and then
there's another tool called Bluetooth
CTL and this is now just talking to the
Bluetooth controller on the Edison and I
can issue certain commands to it so I'm
gonna tell it to do a scan now whenever
I do this at a conference menu I've
already actually recorded the address of
this because at a conference venue
there's so much Bluetooth traffic that
it's impossible to sort through it and
find it and sometimes this actually
makes the Edison crash and I have to
restart it but it's still kind of fun to
see so I'm gonna turn this on and try to
turn it off real fast those are all of
the Bluetooth devices out there right
now that are broadcasting their address
and and if you allow it to run longer
some of them oh hey look there's the
bulb actually whether you're able to
find it here's some camera in the mix
there a tile alta so you start to see
what some of the things are and you can
also I've seen people use this to be
able to actually like track the
Bluetooth devices where they are located
because you get your signal strength on
some of these as well so anyway that
itself is just like a fun thing to play
with in large places and see what all's
out there among the crowd that you're in
so we have the address now there though
and as I said I already grabbed it
earlier so now we can use this gat tool
and give it that address and I'm gonna
go into interactive mode so you can
actually have just single statements
that you pass through gat tool and
single command line executions but I'm
going to go in interactive mode so the
first thing we need to do is connect to
the bulb all right so now we're
connected and let's see what we can do
here if we take one of these and we want
to do as you see here this is this right
command if you go read the spec that
ties to this char right request so I'm
going to send it a write request to that
handle of zero zero actually I do need
to say zero zero four three and we'll
give it this value
I don't know did it actually change
let's go back to the power on and off
that might be easier to play with first
all right
so let's take that one oh it didn't even
copy mine valued the right way okay
CC 2 4 3 3 all right bulb turned off and
if we look through here at these other
packets so the difference on this one
was 2 3 3 3 so let's change that and the
bulbs back on that is so much fun every
time I do that like just being able to
press keys and make the bulb turn on and
off I love it alright so now we know how
to turn the bulb on and off let's go
back to where the colors show up alright
so actually I'm gonna just copy this out
of the code because it isn't copying it
properly from Wireshark so alright so
let's throw this value in here so I've
set this to be just green so let's see
if this works it did not
I got disconnected alright I reconnected
to it let's see what happens there we go
it's green so that must mean then that
that should be red and
so it actually it I mean that is what it
is but it doesn't it doesn't actually
respond to that or black and we there we
go so there's blue all right so I didn't
actually I don't actually have it in
this packet log for the pulsing color
but that is one of the things that I
already have in my code here so I'll
just grab it and we can test that oh one
of the things to here so you'll see in
this write method we'll come back
through more of this but I'm not always
writing to this handle I'm sometimes
writing to 2e and what I found was once
I added more bulbs the address when I
remember when I first brought up the on
the phone and it's LED blue - and then
an identifier well I I've discovered two
versions at least of the of the bulb and
if it starts with a seven in that
identifier then the handle is for three
if it starts with an eight then the
handle is 2e so you may have those kind
of difficulties if you try to do this
and have different versions of the bulbs
that you're interacting with okay let me
find this real quick here
so here we go all right build finished
build started so this is the value for
build started and this should be the
pulsing blue yeah so what I found with
this is on that app you can actually
change the speed of the pulsing on the
on the bulb and that speed is controlled
by I think this 3/4 here I don't
remember what it is but everything about
it everything you saw the app doing can
all be toggled as part of the the values
that you're sending and usually they're
paired
together in some way so that speed of
the change is actually embedded in and
in this I just don't remember what it is
I just chose this speed and it was fine
so any questions about that so far wire
I mean across all of it I'm about to
bring in team city so I have I have team
city running my builds it then years as
a plugin called web hooks to make
callbacks to the Edison which will have
a node server running on there listening
for those and then it uses an NPM
package called Noble to actually send
the packets off to the bulb yeah I guess
that's it and then the bulb yeah the
bulb expect to be able to yes yeah all
right so now let's take a look over at
team city here so as I said I have this
running in a docker container and I've
got both the server and the agent
running on my machine here and what I
have set up in team city is just a dumb
build that reports failure or success
based on the so my actual it's just a
command-line statement that is built or
running and I just have an echo fail or
not and then the failure condition is
looking to see is that text in the
output and if it is that's how a team
city is registering this as a failure
obviously this isn't how you would
really set this up right but just for
demo purposes so then there is this
plugin web hooks that you just download
there's a link on team city's website in
their plugin list for this web hooks
plugin and you just upload the plug-in
zip and it will install it and then on
every level so you can do it like a
whole project level or you can do it at
a specific configuration level I think
you can actually do
server level even two you can then set
up these web hooks so I'm actually going
to change that address so that's that's
where it's getting tied in to make those
callbacks to the Edison when the build
process is running any questions about
that part alright so now let's go back
over to the Edison and let's take a look
at some more of this code that I have in
here so and a disclaimer this is not how
I write production code this is just us
hacking around and having fun and so we
just it's sloppy alright so there are a
couple of things that we needed we
needed a place to be able to have the
Edison actually listen for that callback
data but then we also needed to give it
some configuration information because
we had multiple bulbs that we were
bringing into the mix as well and
there's actually no identifiers on the
bulb itself to tell you which bulb is
which hang on one second here let me run
this
so there's no identifiers on the bulb
itself that tells you what it's address
is so you just kind of have to play with
it and figure it out
so we
all right so now I have this is our code
that we wrote to do all this and I'll
need to think I said power cycle this is
again because this app is now running
and needs to pick it up itself
all right hang on let me start this I
had that gat tool still open while I
started the actual app and they
conflicted with each other okay so it
was listening the bulb was broadcasting
it saw the discovery for that LED blue
and then it immediately grabbed a hold
of it and connected so the the app
that's running on the Edison is now
talking to the bulb and as you saw it
just set it to green that's our sort of
default state so in the web app here we
just get that ID IDs of what all the
bulbs are and then we added an identify
feature here and just have it cycle
through the colors so we could actually
identify visually which bulb was
associated with that identifier and then
when this launches up it actually uses
the teamcity api's and gets the list of
all the build configurations that are
out there and we just have the one so
you can then assign those two together
so now this bulb would be linked to this
actual project here so let's look
through the code just a little more so
this is coming in and when we have a
build started for that notify type in
that webhook package we just send it
that this is the signal for that pulsing
blue that we did earlier and then when a
build finish and a success we give it
green and when a build finished and
result this failure we give it red and
then we do have some kicks some
occasions where you might have a build
interrupted for a variety of reasons and
we had it go what is that
I guess purple know what is red and
green I don't know
that is a brown okay yeah I guess that
makes sense so so yeah so we get a brown
color yeah that's what we're trying to
rush trying to figure out is it okay yes
that makes sense yeah so yes yellow is B
we don't know what's really going on it
was interrupted so that's really all
that's happening in here and we have
this in command that is which is what we
looked at earlier here so one of the
actually the first thing it does
we found that Bluetooth Low Energy is a
little finicky and so you might be
connected and for no obvious reason you
just get disconnected which actually you
saw happen when I was using the GATT
tool earlier I sent the right request
and it was just disconnected for no good
reason so I basically just have a if not
connected connect in every time we send
a command to keep it working and then
depending on the version of the bulb if
it's peripheral name starts with an
eight we use two e otherwise we use four
three right now so I have no idea how
long this list could grow and again the
company has not told me anything when
I've asked them for follow up on you
know any help at all so and the rest of
this is pretty straightforward we're
listening to when it boots up this is
the this is the setup for being able to
actually talk to team city and get the
list of build configs that are out there
and yeah I think that's pretty much I
mean I don't think it's I don't need to
go through all the details the code like
you can write the code just that's the
general gist of it alright so now let's
actually fire off on team city and put
it all together here and watch it happen
so this should be a fail condition
oh I said I needed to change that IP
address didn't I I did not change that
yeah but we just won't have anything
happen on the boat okay so I need to get
the address from the Edison if' all
right and then you need to change the
web hook
all right and unfortunately I may have
to restart teamcity because this is one
of the problems with the web hooks if
the web hook fires and attempts to
actually talk to something and can't it
does not fail gracefully it actually
just blows up under the hood so yeah I
didn't write that code so let me restart
that real fast
I mean so we were using teamcity so that
choice was already made the Edison I had
already for like I have a variety of IOT
devices just playing with them and at
the time it was the only one that had
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in so that was
easy
you know just sort of okay well let me
see if I can make it work with this the
bulb was just sort of randomly chosen I
mean I guess that's all of it right the
rest just kind of fills in the gaps
yeah yeah I mean it could have been
written in anything right like it
doesn't have to be a node that's the
server running on here it didn't have to
be expressed that's the web server you
just pick whatever you want like you
could have done it in Python just as
well python has a lot of ble libraries
for it as well so and the same the same
idea should work across with with
whatever you know language and structure
right like the real the real interesting
part here was the reverse engineering
the protocol for the bulb that was the
that was the part that we didn't know
how to do all the rest of it was just
writing code we know how to do that we
know how to have team city work we know
how to do those bits it was really the
figuring out can we actually figure out
how this bulb is working and then have
our own code control it reconstruct them
with our own code yeah yep exactly
all right so this is restarted the agent
reconnected make sure save my webhook
setting change okay so now we should be
good
it is yes yeah so the agent alright so
it worked
so the agent seems to be there's there's
like a decent lag between the agent and
the server and the webhook fires when
the agent fires and then the server gets
updated after the fact so that seems to
be what's happening all right now we
don't want to see red that's that's not
satisfying we want to see green so let's
go in here and exactly huh all right so
let's run this again well that's I was
saying is the agent seems to trigger the
webhook call immediately and then
updates the server afterward so all
right there we go we're green so isn't
that exciting like that's fun all right
so the last little bit here I'm not
going to get into super deep with it but
you know let's say you had devices that
you don't have an app for that you have
Bluetooth Low Energy devices that talk
to each other and you want to be able to
get into that and you can't capture the
packets from an app on a phone to do it
well that's where the uber tooth comes
in so uber tooth is not technically
bluetooth on purpose and for one reason
the real Bluetooth spec requires and if
you're going to put the label on there
you have to adhere to it requires that a
Bluetooth device only accept and and
pass on packets that are addressed to it
or broadcast packets which are dress
everything the uber tooth says I'm just
gonna take everything I see so you can
have an uber tooth and as long as the
communication is not encrypted
which ble isn't you can intercept all
the ble packets and actually record them
off now you can have encryption within
the communication itself just to just to
be clear like the data though itself is
just still standard ble packets however
if you happen to capture the
communication when the pairing occurs
you can man in the middle basically and
get the get the pairing key which is
what controls the whole encryption that
would take place afterward so you can
still get all the data so Bluetooth Low
Energy is really bad for medical devices
I don't know why people are thinking
about like using it and talking about it
like it's so simple we should just do
that that's a terrible idea
all that data is going to be easy to to
sniff and grab out of the air so but
yeah uber tooth is terrifying and the
one thing that you'll have to if you if
you do decide to go this way and this is
this is a hard mode like this was easy
this is way harder if you decide to use
something like an uber tooth to try to
intercept packets of communication there
are multiple channels that that
Bluetooth can communicate on and your
cell cellular device is actually going
to switch among those channels when it's
listening for broadcasts the uber tooth
only has one radio in it and it's a
really dumb device and you have to tell
it what channel to be on and if you
don't tell it it's just going to default
to one of them so just to just sort of a
pro tip if you do try to use it and you
are finding that you're not getting data
for some reason it's probably because
the device is broadcasting on a
different channel and you'll have to you
know go in and change that and this also
works through Wireshark you're gonna set
up a first-in first-out buffer on your
on your machine all that data will just
come straight into Wireshark and
Wireshark can pull all of that off but
like at the command line setup is when
you're gonna have to change the channel
potentially in terms of what you're
looking at so there's that if if you
don't have an app and you want to know
how to do this same exact process just
you need to get an uber tooth to be able
to grab the communique
instead of logging it off on a mobile
device so any questions about any of
this
anything that you want me to to go over
again any any ideas or questions that
you might have for particular scenarios
you're looking at what's the question I
mean so like I think Fitbit has an API
so I don't think you would have to
really have an issue you know like
they're not gonna tell you know you
can't get the data because they're all
about the data
right but that's a thing that you could
do as well and and I use the uber tooth
and sniff the communication off of a
Fitbit just to see you know how would
that work
and same thing you can you can get all
that data
I mean lights lights have easy easy
applications because of being able to
control them and have visual feedback
for things but but any any Bluetooth
low-energy device you could do this with
I mean I don't whatever right like a lot
of the wearable devices are all ble so
you can get the data off of those or
your neighbors yes that is true as well
yeah you could so I actually didn't use
an Arduino I used an Intel Edison to do
that so yeah you could do it straight to
your laptop we the company that I was at
all of our all of our CI was done in the
cloud and so our team city server wasn't
on Prem anywhere and we needed something
on Prem that could do this and actually
talk to the bulbs in our office and we
didn't want to have a computer that was
dedicated to it because all of us just
had our individual laptops and that was
it we had nothing else in the office for
that so getting a microcontroller to do
this was much easier and a lot cheaper
and cooler that's right yeah our clients
when they would come in and they would
see the bulbs and they would see the and
we didn't use the the large form factor
there's another breakout board you can
get that's a it's just slightly bigger
than the chip itself and when our
clients would come in it was a good
talking piece you know a showpiece kind
of thing to have them see it and they
got all excited about it and seeing the
bulbs go off while they were in the
office was always fun does that have
Bluetooth on it as well I don't I don't
know if it does I okay I know the three
has both so but you if you I mean you
can get separate Bluetooth you know
separate ble device chips that you can
just put on whatever you already have
it's just easier if you don't have to
deal with all that it seems to yes yes
so don't do that I mean it was it wasn't
a big deal for us again because our
stuff all live in the cloud like we had
teamcity crashed on us like three or
four times when we were first getting
this set up and it was not a big deal
for us to just go out and restart it and
yeah but once we got once we knew that
was the issue then we just made sure we
didn't do that anymore and it wasn't
ever a problem again no we don't have
that one the other thing about the
Edison is it's powerful enough to be
able to run a VPN on it and so that was
how we got to tied into our CI
environment was we had open VPN client
on the Edison so it could just connect
in and then we had our DHCP give it a
specific address every time and that was
how team said he didn't can talk back to
it Oh
okay perfect yeah yeah the Edison is
pretty powerful and I mean and it was it
was the most powerful at the time I
assume the Raspberry Pi 3 is is powerful
enough to run a VPN on at this point but
running a VPN is pretty computationally
intense and a lot of IOT devices choke
if you try to do it but I think that
they're getting to the point now where
they're powerful enough they can handle
it or at least close enough oh yeah that
might yeah yeah any other questions
about this anybody want to see it again
a Tesla would have been right out all
right well that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
