of what I was just doing if you are just
now coming in is that I always play a
song off on my Spotify playlist because
I think one of the best things to start
a conversation is music write music
genres because sometimes what we listen
to actually binds us a lot closer
together than we think
so I actually now have an epic coding
playlist that has been compiled from all
the places that I've visited and all the
different developers who say you have to
play that while you're coding you have
to play that while you're cutting so
part of my request of you guys is that
regardless of what you take away please
give me a suggestion before I leave of
something that I can add and that way
you can grow and grow nice well I'm
Heather and if you've if you're not all
that familiar with dotnet I'm sorry it's
awesome I do it all the time but on top
of that I've kind of grown into a
polyglot programmer right so I branched
out into the internet of things there's
what we call it now but at the time it
was just device development something
that was sensor based or mobility based
and when I discovered voice I got really
excited because it kind of meshed my two
worlds together building services and
dealing with devices I have I've only
ever built for large companies so
because of that I tend to want to solve
big problems right away and that's
something that I've grown kind of over
the years into adjusting that sometimes
you can solve small problems first to
eventually get to your big one I also do
horseback archery on the side and
there's actually quite a few in and
around the London area if you're
interested in horseback archery I think
you have a an association here that does
that there's an addition to jousting so
I feel like I'm right at home as soon as
I land it I excited and of course I do
photography as well so basically I am a
little bit of everything but a lot of
coding so let's get to the point shall
we this quote right here from the CEO of
bitly really got to me
humans can talk at 140 words per minute
but they can only type 40 and that
on average I suppose if you might have
an elderly person they might be able to
type 15 right you you can never type as
fast as you can talk or think and so
with that in mind I'm really interested
in saving time and saving frustration
the whole reason that I got into coding
in the first place is because I wanted
to make people's life better to free
them up to be more human right why
should we be doing these things that
take us too long that could be offloaded
to another process but unfortunately
conversational interfaces have really
disappointed us for a long time now I
don't know how many of you phone your
utility companies right and they send
you through this long voice prompts that
once you get eight or seven eight to ten
layers deep you start getting a little
bit of PTSD you're concerned that if you
say the wrong thing then you have to
start all over and then it's terrible
well this technology has been around for
a while but developers have not always
been on board with what it means to
build a conversation in code so that's
kind of what we're going to talk about
today because this is not it on any one
platform I'm going to talk about
concepts specifically and you can apply
them to your own syntax but just a way
to think and approach building for
conversational interfaces and this is
absolutely interactive so if you wish to
ask questions by all means just make
sure that you come up and grab the
microphone and I'll stop
so if we consider all the capabilities
that we have now there's so many
different devices that are capable of it
but more importantly are backed by a
really good artificial intelligence
platform that can really take a lot of
the stress out of us trying to analyze
we can have a lot better natural
interactions this might fool you into
thinking and I'm going to talk to you
about user experience design and you
would be wrong and right so after I
started working for a digital marketing
company I realized that the big
disconnect was that the we had brilliant
designers and experienced builders but
we were still coding in the same way
so because of the way we were thinking
we would tell them know 90% of the time
when it really all it took was an
adjustment of our mindset and that's
kind of what we're going to go over
today
so because I'm technical let's start
with statistics shall we
70% of Google assistant requests comes
through natural voice not keyboard for
those of you who have never seen this
before this is a Google home Mini I was
very excited when they came out for
Christmas and I got myself one and over
8 million homes have echo devices this
is an echo dot right that was way more
than they expected for the last year and
that number has only risen just in the
very beginning of the first quarter I'm
gonna go over a little bit of use cases
as well as to why you should care about
this no matter what you're building so
whether you are doing this for
enterprise or you're doing this for your
own startup your own side projects you
should be supporting voice as a
developer it should be another input
that you can plug in because and I
understand that I'm in Europe now but
that's a really big number to me for it
to have that many Prime members that can
order things in two days or less that's
really huge and that's just one
ecosystem that's just one country and
now they have spread quite a bit they
are already getting ready to promote in
Japan and that's also going to very
large as Japan tends to embrace
technology a little bit faster than the
u.s. does well it's not for a lack of
knowing about it there are about 12,000
skills and climbing in their marketplace
just in the Lexus store and that's an
enormous amount you would think we would
hear radian reviews about all these
things and on Google assistant
unfortunately there's only three percent
chance of retention e that's not very
good and some people might argue that it
just wasn't a good idea it wasn't a well
thought out skill maybe that's what's
going on maybe maybe even on an Alexa on
the echo platform a lot of them don't
even have any customer reviews or their
one stars so what is wrong here we have
had the technology
gee probably since the late 80s we've
started spinning up servers a lot faster
now to be able to handle processing
quicker so then why isn't this working
do people not want it how can they have
sold all these devices if people don't
want it what what is this about right
here's an example of a review that I
would consider from a educated consumer
most consumers have no idea the
separation between the company that
built the device and all the third-party
softwares that can run on it they just
think oh there's something's wrong with
my phone
they don't really separate it very well
but this gentleman did all he really
wanted to know was context and state
that's what he's asking for here he
doesn't want to have to ask the same
command over because what you're looking
at here is not necessarily the fault of
the designer is the fault of the
developer and here's why I say that well
it's true the designer may or may not
have had more leverage in the room when
deciding this the developer probably
said happy path let's go with happy path
they just have to ask it again so this
is lazy development you know and
somebody once told me that a good
developer is lazy developer and I don't
think this is what they're talking about
I think they're talking more about you
know thinking about how you don't have
to work so much right
but this degrades the experience for a
user and again you're going to learn a
little bit of UX because if you don't
know a little bit about it you can't
build this because I was part of three
teams who tried to build this and failed
until we finally kind of stepped over
and learned a little bit about
conversation and then we were able to
restructure all of our architecture so
why should you build for voice maybe you
don't work at a marketing company maybe
not so why should you do that because in
many aspects just asking a question and
getting an answer is the best way if you
have to navigate through seven layers
deep of an FAQ section that's not fun
even if you think hey it's all alright I
built a mobile app for that how long
does it take for them to pull out the
phone
scroll through find the app even if it's
the first button on there even if it's
the first one how long does it take you
to do that versus just asking a question
really quick and just getting announcer
really quick this is where you can
really shine as developers what I really
love about this is that most of this is
technical most of this they don't even
see it is pure functionality paired with
voice so this really appealed to me
because I'm terrible drawing
I'm terrible colors CSS is not my friend
so you know I was excited about the idea
that I can make something that would
really make people's lives better and
kind of wow them without having to look
on Fiverr and hire a designer but
because I wanted to do that I had to
learn a little bit about what it meant
to converse with them so let's get into
the linguistic consideration aspect of
trying to build for this what I want to
talk about specifically is a service
driven architecture this is not
something that you would be doing like
an SDK you can do that for Siri you can
do that for katana but we're talking
about entire ecosystems that your
businesses are gonna want to tap into
you're gonna want to be in the same
space as where they order things you
know daily from Amazon or where they
interact all the time on Google Maps
you're gonna want to be in that space
because you already have all this
context you can share information
trust me it's much easier to do this in
a service so let's talk about natural
language processing what Google and
Amazon and Microsoft and Apple have done
for us is they have abstracted this
concept away almost completely and
offloaded it to their own AI processing
right so for Alexa it's backed by Lex
that is the big brain behind actually
processing everything that the user is
saying or whatever is being sent in text
and it's the same for each one of these
platforms has their own we have Luis
right IBM has their own and so because
of these you can decide whether or not
you want to reinvent that wheel but you
know four or five very large
corporations have done it
pretty good job and I would suggest
leveraging that what I like about being
in their ecosystem is that once they
determine what was said then they can
hand you over and intention they can
hand you over hey this was triggered
they want to talk to you that's really
what we want to get to if you would do
any sort of middleware if you do
anything where you just want to deal
with business logic for your company or
for your project this is the space you
want to be in it's easy to develop in it
it's easy for the users should
understand there is no learning curve
whatsoever because you already know how
to talk and you don't have to do one of
those guide and click throughs of how to
use an application they just start
asking questions what's great about this
is that depending on which ecosystem
you're in maybe you can capture users
asking questions that you have not
planned for which is really cool is
normally you're just kind of limited to
that navigation that you've already
preset that they can see but instead if
they're like well can I do this you can
decide if you want to capture that and
say no or if you want to capture it for
the future reference and say hey we get
all this feedback from users trying to
do this thing maybe we should build that
it's just so much more powerful and it's
easier for people to trust the piece of
software that you're building to be very
specific for those who are not aware NOP
is a branch of artificial intelligence
that deals with analyzing and
understanding and generating all the
languages that humans use naturally in
order to interface with computers in
both written and spoken contexts so when
I say NLP that's what I'm referring to
there are many abbreviations that use
NLP and I wanted to be very specific
about that luckily for us we don't have
to think about it mostly we have to
think about it in terms of mapping we
get to think about that aspect but we
don't have to worry about analyzing any
sort of audio which brings me to the
pillars of truth Paul Grice is this
fantastic gentleman was kind of thought
in some circles as a grandfather of
voice conversations just development in
general when it came to how to structure
things in a way that people would
identify with
and continue to keep the conversation
going I had to study this in order to
learn how to do it myself because I was
not a natural communicator I had to
figure out how to speak to people that
I've never spoken to before and what he
said is that if you focus on these four
things you'll be successful with almost
every interaction to some level even if
they're from a different country and
they speak a different language as long
as you focus narrowly on these things
you'll be successful so what does that
mean so think about the quality of
something that you built because I work
in a marketing company it can be very
tempting for people to get over
enthusiastic about the product they're
trying to sell right maybe it's not very
truthful about what they're trying to
sell and maybe you shouldn't be selling
anything when you're just talking to
your users that's a really important
aspect of being trusted if your brief
people won't give up on you remember
that 3% that 3% should stick out in your
event three percent retention on an
enormous platform is really bad so how
do we fix that retention rate you don't
want to bore them for 10 minutes you
want to make sure these interactions are
very quick you have to be sure it's
relevant to the conversation so try not
to steer the conversation in a direction
that user doesn't want it to go and be
very clear that's more important than
anything being verbose is wonderful when
you get to read it in a book when you
have time to read it in a book but it's
almost always better to leave out as
many words as possible without being
wooden and this sounds like kind of a
lot to take in and maybe it's abstract
but you kind of know good interactions
when you see them right I for the first
time got to go on your metro system the
tube right and and I always it just kind
of stuck in my head the whole mind the
gap thing didn't say anything else just
by the way don't die and fall you know
down into the shaft it would be good you
know but that was all that was needed I
already knew I wanted to go out so it
didn't say hey in order to exit go by
the doors and then step over to you know
the gap and then go down the corner none
of that was said it was just mind the
gap because obviously you're probably
trying to get from here to there so
there's a little bit of assumption and
context and state that's taken into
consideration there right so just keep
that in mind and you'll have very very
successful skills which brings me to the
co-operative principle how many biddy
how many people have heard of this in
the audience anybody yes a fresh
audience I love it
all right here's a good example of a
happy path flow versus a cooperative
path flow and we'll just go through it
really quickly so if your user asked to
set an alarm and you just verify you
know what time they want that alarm for
then all you have to do is verify and
say yes I've got it being cooperative
means what if the user was in the
process of putting their shoes on or
what have you and they kind of forgot to
answer parts of the question or maybe
they started to so think about your
methods did you build a method that
specifically you know has parameters of
day and time so that's two parameters
right what if they only give you Tuesday
what are you gonna do say sorry you have
to give me the date and the time that is
what currently happens this is what
should be happening
you should say what time do you want it
for I'm Tuesday okay got that so that
means you're acknowledging that you
actually listened and got the first
piece of information even though it's
not everything that you wanted and then
just the additional piece and by you
know sending that confirmation with all
the pieces it showed that you were
listening to the user you're retaining
what they said this is how you mitigate
the problems that we have when we call
our utility companies right I get so
anxious when I I'm getting so deep and
then I screw up and then I have to start
over and that's when the users start
being trained to be wary of the whole
process so this allows them to just kind
of relax and give pieces of information
as they can that means that the way you
structure code kind of changes doesn't
it you might say oh it doesn't change
that much but I promise you pull up your
most recent program have you handled the
situation maybe if you had really good
architectural thought process but you
should be doing this all the time this
just allows it to be naturally modular
and naturally conversational and
cooperative yeah try not to ask answer a
question with another question
this sounds like all these things sound
really obvious but when when we sit down
we're more concerned about our
performance or more concerned about how
beautiful our dryer code is and so we
tend to not think about this part and in
reality because this aspect of voice is
so new using it in this way developers
are heavily relied upon to give their
opinion so you're going to be sitting in
these meetings and they're like well
what do we do next what do we say next
it's kind of up to you to start owning a
little bit of the voice conversation
process because you have to build it
right so start having an opinion about
this
there's just no hierarchy to this entire
thing that's another way to think about
it you might have state you might have
some context but there they should be
able to enter and exit any point in your
skill and have it work flawlessly and
that sounds just overwhelming to me as a
developer so I'm like no no no here's
front door you come through the front
door and that's all you get to do but in
reality when somebody comes up to your
house they have to find the front door
so maybe they might peer in the side of
no they'd wonder how to even get started
and that is very very common so because
of that you have to think about what
questions could they ask and what should
we say that's pretty much all it is
think about it much more like an
assistant so for those of you who like
Marvel comics you know think about it
like Jarvis like Jarvis will just answer
the question that he's been given but
he's also mindful right that AI is
mindful of the time oh by the way you
know you do have a an appointment you're
late for now oh do you want the same
shirt you had last time actually I just
decided here's the shirts that you
always get if you want something
different let me know so those are
things that can really delight your user
right this is an example of what I mean
by enter from many doors right so we
have a function called order right
intent let's say that I'm Ober and I
want to order a car right so I could say
it in a variety of
I could say I like to order a taxi or
please can you book me a ride currently
this is not what happens in our
allocations part of the power of being
able to leverage one of these platforms
is that they allow you to map that
relationship so when should you learn
this well based on all these metrics and
how many devices are in circulation
that's actually low that's what it's
supposed to be at the end of 2017 but
just two weeks ago it's already at 38
million that's pretty crazy just from
Christmas that's pretty crazy so if I
mean it depends on who you are it isn't
a billion in front of that but it's
going to be changing it's going to be
doubling itself every year by 2020 so
it's coming and when I say it's coming
it's already here for lots of countries
yours included it's just something that
you should just start being able to
support learn it right now so what are
your opportunities what can you do with
this what does it look like for you I
got some use cases up here that are very
successful so I'm going to go through a
couple just to give you an idea and you
guys have Domino's Pizza here yes
well guys on the bikes you know that
deliver pizza yes so Donna's Pizza
decided to go all-in with technology
several years ago and just try
everything you know kind of throw darts
at a dartboard and see what sticks well
this one really stuck for them because
their users already made a profile a
long time ago you know on their website
or in their ecosystem and most of their
users tend to like the same kinds of
Pizza who would have thought all right
so because they already had all their
preferences and they actually were
sitting down watching Game of Thrones
with a developer saying it would be
great if I could just tell like so to
order me you know get the get my regular
and not have to answer any other
questions and he's like I can make that
happen so that's what happened is that
they made it like it's a two-step
process you say hey Alexa as Domino's to
order me my regular pizza and I said
great it'll be there in 20 minutes and
that's the whole process because they
already saved all your payment
information from
or they already had your name they
already know where you live it's in your
home that was it
you would think oh that's that doesn't
really work they took over an additional
4% of the entire pizza market share in
the world in q4 of 2017 with that
because all they had to do was introduce
a better convenience because it was
faster than calling it was faster than
going the website faster than using the
mobile app so what what I'm starting to
learn is that maybe setup is not the
right place for a voice not the initial
input but if you're doing anything with
repetition if you're doing anything
frequently voice can really shine for
you American Express is interesting so
they have kind of like an information
monitor that they wanted to do like you
know how are how is my credit card when
it was it last you use all those things
what are my what is my balance it's
funny because wired actually put out an
article talking about worrying about the
security of having a device in your home
that would answer questions I don't want
people to know my bank balance that
sounds terrible you know several years
ago we were also told that it's not
secure enough to build a mobile app for
bank but here we are because there's
always a trade-off right a lot of users
want the convenience of knowing so
they're willing to say it's all right I
can set up some sort of security
password or something to allow me the
convenience of seeing this right on my
device it was the same in the home and
now that user profiles are starting to
get even more intelligent on these
platforms it'll recognize your voice on
many of these so you can decide whether
or not you want your children to ask how
much money you got left you know to buy
them presents for Christmas or it could
just be you or you can setup two-factor
authentication
right so we can decide if you want to
text your user a secret word to say and
then they just say it out loud and it
unlocks the feature there's lots of ways
we can do this and American Express
totally bought in and once they bought
in a lot of other banks started as well
Campbell's kitchens are very fun so I
think this is one example of hands-free
cooking that I really liked
it's it's one of those Hey
all I have in here is bread and Vegemite
so camel is what can I do with that
they're like actually I can you know
send things via Amazon Prime to you you
know to make soup that would go really
well of that sentence right or I can
tell you how to make step by step your
Vegemite sandwich what would you like
they said oh I want to tell me step by
step but my hands are full now I have
all the stuff all over and spill it and
then I say hey Campbell's give me the
next step and there was already state
retention because after four to five
seconds they stopped listening but you
retained the last step right so all you
have to do is say hey just tell the
skill that I want to do the next thing
and that experience went over very well
and also increased their bottom line for
more fun things and Heiser Busch is a
beer company is a brewery in the States
that's pretty well known for its big
horses that pull kegs of beer right well
they had noticed they had a sales
problem with their Ultra 95 beer which
is basically water with a little bit of
beer in it and I know who drink that
right exactly they're in the Midwest we
don't we tend to drink full-bodied nice
craft beers that seems to be the thing
but they had a lot of this right so one
thing that they zeroed in on is the
health conscious movement that was
happening in the states right they
really wanted to get in on that so what
they ended up designing was an app that
told you how many based on how many
beers you consumed and what kind they
were how many pushups you had to do to
burn the calories for it and it sounds
silly millions of people use this
because it was hands-free so they would
just be like okay and five and they're
like how many Alexa is like seven and
they actually had a voice that would be
like yelling at them like you didn't do
enough and and then and so when they
said okay I'm done and they're like
would you like to do less push-ups I'll
turn 95
and the sales skyrocketed because who
wants to do more work I mean it's and it
sounds just ridiculous but so did Angry
Birds so I'm just pointing out but
because sometimes games can work really
well in this context too of course
obvious things like those stories and
doing things with kids you know there's
lots of different ways that you can do
things that are not visual right what do
you want to build now that I gave you
examples I'm sure you're thinking
alright so here's some practical ones
there's some fun ones you know depending
on where you are there are so many that
are really good when I say so many more
than I can count on one hand
unfortunately apparently less than 3%
right the major players in this and I'm
really talking about obviously on Amazon
and Google you know Apple has said we're
gonna get into the service driven voice
AI space but we're not there yet so you
can use our API you are sorry yeah you
can use our SDK and do things directly
down on the device that they have to
install it's the same thing for Cortana
and of course you can do service driven
Cortana work through like hololens or
something like that or of course your
laptop but really we're talking about
being in the home where people don't
have to have their laptop or a really
expensive piece of equipment in order to
interact with them I mean this was 39
not dollars u.s. that's pretty low I
think this was on sale for 25 for
Christmas now that puts it in the realm
of possibility for you know second world
third world countries to be able to use
this as well because then it doesn't
cost as much remember the whole
Raspberry Pi thing right I said if we
make it inexpensive enough more people
will use it the more people use it the
better the connected experience that we
have let's talk about what a flash
briefing skill is shall we so this of
course is very specific to Amazon's but
it actually works the same way for
Google as well so a flash briefing means
let me get on a twitter feed that is
spoken which sounds terrible but it
isn't because if you want to continue to
keep connections with your users and to
not
get you and have that retention you need
to be useful in little flashes hence
flash briefing so this is an aggregation
of all the different flash briefing
skills that could be built so you the
user gets to choose what they want most
people do like NPR or you know the
weather but it could also be maybe the
silly tweet of the day it could be
whatever you want them to know about for
their meeting they could be little tiny
thing it's meant to be very quick less
than 10 seconds right just something
small
this works out very well in the gamma
fication space so let's say your radio
show for you to show or something like
that and you want to give away something
so you tell people if you enable you
know our flash briefing skill every day
we'll just tell you the code that will
unlock this free thing for you but you
have to listen you know and during your
flash briefing and then gives it to you
same thing we do on Radio right ok just
wait until it call in at the right
moment right you can change this through
a CMS you can hook that all up for
people and make this something that's
really fun to do but what I first got
introduced to this whole ecosystem was
through Alexa turn the lights off right
so that's called a smart home skill
what's great about smart home skills is
that she doesn't talk back haha right
yes
she doesn't talk back she just does the
thing isn't that nice and so that's the
idea is that really you're just enabling
disabling some sort of remote device via
the voice this is really fun it doesn't
have to just be your refrigerator than
have to be an oven it can be a drone and
that's what I've been doing lately is
that I plugged in my little parent
spider drones and I say engage and they
go like this it's fantastic right so I
look I'm I kind of look like a magical
or something it's very fun basically you
know you just need a couple of things in
order for that to work it's pretty easy
then there's the custom skill this one
can do anything you want it to but this
is the one I probably create the most
often so you kind of start off here
right the customer asks you a question
or gives you command
and then the platform will interpret it
and send it to your voice service saying
hey this is what this is the what they
probably meant by that so go take care
of it right so what does that even look
like they send JSON Ted off it's very
exciting something that we all know and
love
right and then we get to write JSON back
and say this is what you say now this is
what you do now and if you can do in
addition is a graphical representation
rendered in the companion app it's the
same way for Google assistant how many
people here use Android in a way that
they actually talk to it yeah okay cool
Siri yeah okay so you see sometimes you
can see a summary of things that you've
said occasionally depends on whether or
not the developer wanted you to that's
where you would do this so this is part
of the entire message that you send back
it's not a separate thing it's basically
the same for Google and that will get
into the components so how you think
about this right intense so you can just
think about them as events but I use the
word intent a lot because intent doesn't
really matter which door you've got in
the house with it just matters you got
in the house and you're specifically in
the front room right the utterances are
how you got into the house right
that's the one-to-many relationship and
then there's the invocation name so
invocation name means that because these
are branded ecosystems they would really
like the wake words to be the name of
the ecosystem or something similar I
love that computer was enabled for Alexa
I was excited so I can use that instead
to wake up whatever device is listening
and then use an invocation name so
dominoes is the invocation name and of
course service so this is the big thing
this is where you're going to cause is
where you're going to code the most and
portal configurations so if you have if
you're a friend end developer and you
don't really like to do a whole lot of
back-end code e that's alright
this is also where you can spend lots of
time because you can tweak the
people say things and handle them as
part of your intent you can map
different ways I live across the hallway
from somebody who is from Afghanistan
she's about ten years old and she loves
to stop by my apartment door which is
nice and thin and I have my echo sitting
right next to the door to tell me
whether and she says Alexa it's a good
rain today and it already registered her
as a secondary user right it's pretty
funny I figured it out after looking at
my logs after a while like who in the
middle of the day is talking to my
device and I actually figured out that
because she has an accent though she
would cut out parts of the phrase right
and so because of that I said oh you
know I'm gonna add in some additional
phrases to help her out for like my
custom skill and then knocked on her
door and said I made you I made you a
voice experiences she's like you did
like yeah absolutely
so what it is is it's a rewarding kind
of bought right so because I already
know because her parents send me an
email every so often of what her grades
are she just comes by and based on her
grade it sends her a congratulatory kind
of a thing every time so she's like you
know you did an A in this last week
you're gonna be even better today will
be an A+ things like that it was very
small but she loved it she thought it
was great and I spent a lot of time
making sure that it understood her and
you think well well then why am i
investing in this ecosystem that's
supposed to do natural language
processing right why would I do that
for a couple of reasons I created a
skill in English but she doesn't speak
English very well part of what Amazon
has done lately has been creating
English UK because of all of your
cultural differences you say things like
Cheers
what does that even mean you know
depends on your context and so it
actually runs it through a separate
process and to give you intent this is
what they are intending to mean by this
right but until that happens for every
single person with broken English from
every
ground you may need to help it out a
little but in general is pretty good so
if you're interested in any of the
visual components this can make for a
very impactful experience can I looks
like this by default not too bad
right you don't really have to put lots
of design into it but this is what it
kind of looks like on your phone it just
has you know the basic information about
your application and whatever you want
it's actually considered good practice
through Google to not say exactly what
she said but maybe a summary at the end
of your conversation so you can have a
back and forth for a little bit and then
summarize this works really really well
for things like directions or recipe
cards or anything like that it works
really well because then there's a
visual reference after it if you want
it's not necessary it's if you want but
this is probably the my favorite part so
tethered screen how many go if you guys
here worked have worked at all with
WebSockets
yeah yeah cool people so I had this idea
after watching a presentation from
Nestle they did this whole thing where
they wanted to instead of using like
chromecast they wanted to on these
enormous screens if this display they
wanted to be able to talk to whichever
assistant they wanted and have recipes
chosen and given with additional visual
feedback that was really big because
they wanted to showcase their products
you know and they did it through
WebSockets so I said that would be
really cool so I took this a step
further and I did this for a very large
convention called Kansas City developer
conference in the States there's about
two thousand people it's a big hall lots
of echoing perfect for testing this out
right so put it together where you could
ask things like okay tell me when Jimmy
Bogart is speaking or tell me about any
sessions about natural language
processing or JavaScript and it because
it's a keyword search for me I would
just aggregate them all together and
show them on the screen because it's so
fast to go through Amazon servers or
Google servers and it was so fast to do
the WebSocket it was at the same time
every time she answered verbally while
you got additional visual feedback she
could say just little things though
remember we don't want her to be really
verbose we didn't want her to read every
description we just wanted to say there
are several today and there's one
starting in like 20 minutes or she could
say Jimmy Bogart is speaking at this
time in this is time in room two and for
all all the really basic things you need
to know but if you wanted more details
you could see it behind it it was very
very successful it's something that's
going to be growing quite a bit and so I
built that with web api using signal r
for my WebSockets it worked very well
and built the whole thing in 48 hours so
this is not difficult to do as I can
tell you this is a bunch of JSON really
you just get to spend some time making
sure the conversation is right which
brings me to what intense kind of look
like sorry for the pixelation but this
is pretty much the structure you would
get you would say hey the user said
something that triggers your event your
intent okay and then it will give you
any additional data with it so there are
plenty of things that they could say
that may not give you additional data
you can just say hey order me my last
pizza that's not something where you'd
need to pass along a parameter right so
maybe you would do this with no slots at
all slots are just placeholders for
additional words that the users say it
says that you need to know like
horoscopes so because it's going to be
dynamic I have no idea which sign
they're gonna say I don't know if
they're gonna tell me I'm a Virgo I'm a
Leo I'm or whatever so I create a slot
for that and then I create a custom data
type which is a derivative of just the
base object right so can be whatever I
want it to be it's kind of nice it's
pretty simple or you could do this with
something that isn't human so let's say
you want to talk to something through
Alexa right that is hooked up to a robot
or hooked up to robot maybe that's using
a keyboard hooked up to a drone whatever
have you and it might kind of look like
this so the input type might say drone
here instead you know depends on what
you want to do
and so those slots here's an example of
that same youths right here you know
that's how you would lay out the
structure of the request the intent is
usually named and it's said in a such a
way that can be recalled quickly this is
any sort of evaluation that you need for
the utterance and then there's your slot
you can have a combination of slots you
can just say slots as well that's a
little trickier because it's really
tough with addresses right there's just
so many places people can live and I
really don't want to create a list a
drop-down of possible addresses
everywhere in the UK so sometimes you
have to leave the slot at whatever
length the user has I think you have up
to nine but that means you have to train
it you have to train it and say this
address could be three words long it
could be four words long it could be
five words on
so that's training to model how many of
you guys in here have played around with
machine learning at all yeah that's just
basic office keishon of the machine
learning algorithm that they've got so
all you're doing is doing something
specifically tailored for what you've
got I never I can't talk to you about
that one-to-many relationship so what
about expression you know I always
thought that it kind of sounded a little
wooden you know talking to these it got
better over time but if you listen to
even now some of Google's voices that
you can choose from it's pretty funny no
I can't wait for Eddie Izzard to be my
voice you know I'm ready for that can do
you have any control over this at all
but say this conely really comes up when
you are a company who has very specific
ways of expressing yourself right
maybe the Old Spice guy or the poopourri
lady or whatever it is you want to very
specifically have character and
personality good news for you it does
exist a way to completely mesh this to
your desires right SS ml stands for
speech synthesis markup language yeah
just like HTML and CSS but for your
voice it's very cool you can do
everything now in addition to
you saying oh replace this with this
word you can make that dynamic you can
have her paws you can state I want to
play a little audio foul before she
talks after she talks whatever you'd
like to do you can now control the prose
you can control the pitch you can
control if she whispers if she yells now
you've got a lot more controls and if
your front end developers and designers
were sad that you took away the jobs
from them because we're doing voice this
is where they live now they get to play
all around with it and it's really fun
she actually does a pretty good job on
her own Google does a pretty good job on
its own as well with having a
personality but if they really want to
be specific has its you know ghost Tales
from the Crypt you know before Bitcoin
or whatever it is you know you get to
play around with it and it's a lot of
fun if you're interested in the official
spec it's been out for about 12 years
surprise it's been out on w3 so
definitely check that out but in
addition to this each one of the
ecosystems have registered for specific
additional tags just for their system so
there are little we call them speech
cons does anybody heard of speech cons
nope okay well you know what emoticons
are right you know you know what those
are
they're emojis for your voice so you can
tell her to say things like hooray
but it does it shorthand and she says
right just automatically little like
tiny things you know or well I never you
know something very you know that has a
specific cadence to it little things so
that you don't actually have to sit
there and play with every single decibel
level there are some like quick
shortcuts and they're called speech cons
really really fun and it's growing all
the time if you're interested in
additional references about this we're
gonna talk a little bit more about an
intense sequencing but free/busy has a
great blog post on it that I highly
suggest you take a look at what's
interesting about doing voice is that it
is stateless like Alexa has no idea
about what you're talking about it just
hands things back and forth but it does
know that you started a voice session so
you do have a little bit of wiggle room
you can put variables you can put any
sort of value
inside of that session but you really
it's up to you to save it to a database
somewhere but like while the session is
alive while the users talking back and
forth you do have some retention if you
choose to but it's not there by default
you just go ahead and add it to the
array right
and if you want to play around with SSM
Elm or be spoken is fantastic you can
play with different audio levels right
away and this last one I have wonder do
I have any Trekkies in their room so
anybody like Star Trek anymore so just
me yes okay so L cars is the name of the
system that runs on the computer in the
starship enterprise right so that was my
first introduction to the idea of just
talking to a computer and at doing
things for you I thought it was so neat
and I always kind of wanted to have that
experience so the very first skill that
I wrote was an L car's example skill
where I could say things just like you
know Picard to the bridge or I could say
engage and if I say that it would play
the sound of the warp engines going it
was great like I got to and they would
retain which Starbase I told it to go to
or what started I was on it was great
and over time it would say Oh welcome
back counselor because counselor Troi
was the best one so yes she said by
default but you could also change what
ranking you were so like different kinds
of things like that I put this out at
github if you want to play around it is
dotnet based but I only did that because
I didn't see an example in dotnet on any
of their websites and you can use their
SDKs but you don't have to really at the
end of the day it's just a rest endpoint
with some JSON and I can deal with that
right we just reverse engineered that
and created something that looks like I
could extend an existing project that
already is doing stuff for mobile and
just add an endpoint for voice right so
I could reuse already all of the
business logic I've been doing and I did
this at a local little we have we have a
gas station right and in Kansas City
it's called quick trip it's very fun and
I wanted to play around to see if I
could order a food you know in this with
the same service that I built for it to
be ordered on the phone right it's we
already built that why not extend it
yeah I took a sweet that's it and that
was with testing with professional
people testing it it just didn't take us
long because now that we had a clear
vision of what we wanted to do it didn't
have to sound the same or have the same
kind of flow and it didn't but we use
the same business logic so we didn't
reinvent that wheel that's why this is
really exciting to me is that you don't
have to start all over from scratch
doing device development
I think this prediction is amazing
because that percentage is also
incorrect now now it's at 32 32% of our
interactions are through conversations
with smart machines that's crazy I love
that but it's so crazy to me so it's
definitely not a fad especially if you
think about the accessibility part of it
right so I don't know how many of you
are asked to be compliant for people
with different levels of disabilities
but also just maybe different styles of
learning different styles of navigating
and this is just going to be one that
all developers eventually probably in
the next couple of years will be
expected to have in your tool belt the
good news is it's not really that scary
and it's a lot of fun to play with the
biggest thing I want you to take away
though when you structure your code is
that all the various user responses that
you get are opportunities they are not
errors they're people they speak
differently they have different
Cadence's and that doesn't mean you
can't service them you have to just kind
of delight them and then they will
constantly use your app again and again
I mean it's amazing the examples of
things that people like and retain are
very simple and it can be simple it
should be short but you should still
delight them with what you already
understood about what they said don't
make them repeat themselves it sucks for
them just as much as it sucks for us to
write in code try not to repeat it it's
really important that you show them
you're listening and that's how you gain
the trust of a user
so in conclusion make sure you create a
cooperative conversational experiences
if nothing else you'll walk away with
that right learn the market and find
where you can provide value for that if
you work in the medical industry this is
huge when you're in a place that is
office written with germs you know why
would you have people touching or
running things down just say this is
what my ailment is or this is my problem
it can be done in their own words and
the way that they say it and it can go
straight to a nurse straight to a doctor
you don't have to worry about
contaminating things there's a lot of
use for this make sure that you keep
skills short and to the point
just just build it very specifically in
focus don't doing big overarching skill
that can do all the things that this
medical company can do or all the things
build for specific purpose and start
building your prototypes now if you can
do it in about two hours and that's with
fuddling around a little bit you can do
that in the weekend and it's really fun
to do specifically with your kids
because nothing delights them more than
being able to make something happen
right don't just come up with a voice
idea make sure you come up with an idea
that is best suited for voice so maybe
filling out your taxes orally is not
going to be fun like maybe allow that to
be something that you do with the web
application but there's still an awful
lot of places for you to grow with this
