early session it's a smooth start into
the day because this is a non technical
talk so you can relax a little bit but
not too much because the thing we are
talking about is very important I want
to talk about elephants and movers and
other problems in the room let's see
what this means my name is Sammy
negotiator and I'm chief consultant at
get next I t connect site is a
consulting company and helps IT and tech
companies to improve the communication
to improve leadership we address
problems in tissues in meetings and
teamwork and all those stuff which has
to do with human interaction and I think
it's a very important part because a
human interaction is the basis for your
success and so that's what we are doing
on this topic I was traveling around the
world on the last year you see all the
conferences i have been last year and
yesterday the new conference year
started for me yesterday Act gave my
first talk this year at software quality
days in Vienna and in the afternoon I
came here to have an evening the
spectacular failure talk and this
morning is the last step of a very
challenging 24 hours trip three talks
within 24 hours with all different
topics that was yeah quite interesting
for me I ran a lot of articles in German
as well as an English language you can
have a look devops come and info q is an
english and so perhaps you want to check
out what i am writing about last year we
have organized them up stays kill the
first time
him that devops days wasn't q was quite
a success and we are going to run this
event in 2018 again and yeah it's a lot
about culture a lot of our tools but
it's a community event not so big like
NEC conferences only about 120 people or
something like that really community
event when you want to stay informed
about my work just connect over these
possibilities this year I'm going to
start a book project about agile
communication and if you want to stay
informed about that you can also choose
these possibilities and if you want to
google my work please use both names my
former name was ameena Bionic appendix
and a lot of my work my videos and
articles you will find another old name
so both is possible to be honest I'm not
a technical woman I have no roots in
techniques and when I entered a few
years ago the tech world I was very
surprised about all the things you are
interested besides tech yeah you are
very proud a keen on on movies on super
hero movies and so on and I think not
rising that's a slogan we found when we
were in Vienna in the window and so I
said oh that's a good picture for my
talks I need this one and when we want
not rising rising into the new world a
new age I want a new new world of
working together this here is very
important when we change when we talk
about changing things and I'm talking
about the human part of your work and it
has a lot of to do with change there are
three attitudes I need to change
something I want to change
something and I change something I think
you can imagine that I change something
is the best attitude not talking long
about it just doing it the bad part is I
need to change something that's some one
other who is telling you so now you have
to do something and you do not really
want it and that's the hard way so just
for the introduction my first discovery
in tech world beside all those
superheroes was that people in tech love
animals have any one of you ever been to
DevOps days when you have been to dev up
space you have heard about a lot of
animals that have you know where have
you been to Israel tel Aviv ok ok i have
been to paris to amsterdam to Tel Aviv
Frank you where have i been to devops
days they talk a lot about animals i
will show you i call the zoo of tech and
you will find about that on the internet
too they talk about cats they talk about
monkeys they have dogs and i put the
Dinos in goats donkeys horses what makes
me really wonder what unicorns a lot of
software developers logical thinking
people are talking a lot about unicorns
have you ever seen a real unicorn I just
know these pink ones for the gods to
play with and so and when I heard the
first time about unicorns that oh my God
where am I is this really a tech
conference at but yet it was and I talk
about elephants and I thought when I
prepare this talk i can add another
animal and that is the news it's not my
idea with the moose it's cut it comes
from a book i will tell you about later
so I'm sorry but I think I won't tell
you anything new today because what I'm
talking about is so-called common sense
but why do I talk about common sense the
reason is that we all talk about common
sense but when you look at reality it's
really well so my goals are to make you
think about your personal situation in
your team and your company in your
private life perhaps I want to motivate
you to change something on these
personal situation I want that you
remember my talk my words and I want
that you talk about it with your
colleagues with your friends you do not
have to be the self the same opinion
than I am it's okay when you talk about
it and discuss it and that makes it
possible that common sense become some
kind of common practice that's the first
step to make common sense common
practice and I think that's very
important because a lot of teams
struggle about struggle of these issues
I will talk about so now it's time for
Moses who of you has ever seen a moose
in reality and they are really shy guys
these losses and most of the time you
know there should be somewhere moved
around but it's hard to discover them
sometimes you are the lucky one and you
see one in reality we have moved us
around everywhere and I tell you a true
story in one company I work for a long
long time ago we had a accountant we
call her Eve in this case if once had a
love affair with the union CEO but it
was also long time ago but they were
still friends this could be a move
and we would see if this moose is a good
one or a bad one in the story the mousse
is there but it could be good of it she
had a direct superior her CFO the CFO
was not part of the family the family
who founded the company and to run the
company he has no conflict skills
whenever conflict arises he closes the
door of his office and said not my task
they should clear it up on Ellen and he
was not very interested in the team for
him it was not important was working on
the team so doesn't make sense to to
struggle with all those sites in this
department that's really an elephant
when you have a manager who is not
interested in the team when you have a
manager who has not no conflict skills
that's really an elephant because it's
his task to clear up situations is this
task to make good atmosphere again so
that the team can work if she had a
colleague and these colleague admires
her pays a lot of tension to Eve
appreciated her and she was very lawyer
to Eve and Eve pacer was information
information she got from her friend it
was their friend and you can imagine the
Union CEO knows a lot of things which is
not publicly spoken about so she has a
lot of information and she pays the her
colleague with these information and had
the feeling of being very very important
but there are other colleagues to and
she had not such a good relationship
with all these other colleagues but they
had to work together this is another
moose we will see if it is a good one or
a bad one
one day if came to her CFO and she
complained about a lot of overtime she
had to do and that she's the only one
with all those excellent qualifications
and she's not able to do all those work
any longer so what did he do he came
over and asked me Serena we need a new
accountant with very special squid
skills and we needed ASAP okay that was
my job at a time and I looked for new
accountant I found the first one with
very excellent references she was there
for three months and then we had to fire
her because the feedback was that
references skills were not good enough
okay could happen we found another one
also very very excellent references all
the skills on paper we need it but three
months later the same thing feedback was
no she's not good enough for us we need
another one hmm it was really hard for
me because I thought okay two ladies
with excellent references not good
enough for us that's strange but the
manager told me search for another one
okay I found a hot one this lady was a
little bit older more experienced in
life and she had the situation that her
husband was earning a lot of money so
she did not really need to work she
wanted to wanted this job because she
liked to be an accountant but it was not
necessary for so she started the drop
and after four months she came to me and
said let me know i will leave the job
yeah well what what's going on yeah the
atmosphere is that bad whenever I'm not
there they put information tasks and
what I have to do in my cupboard on the
bottom of it and that needs all other
paper and then a week later they came to
me and say hey why haven't you done the
work I gave to you so really mobbing
really bad mobbing on the job I couldn't
do anything about her leaving the
company but I was wondering if this is a
good idea to get new accountants again
and again and if they really wanted a
new account and it was the question with
which come up to me so I found out there
was really a big elephant in the room
these two ladies had a good relationship
the other ladies didn't have one I asked
all the people around what's going on in
your in your department of hell alone
those two are just hanging around
together making their own stuff and
whenever they talk to us they treat us
in a bad way and that was what happened
with the new ones and the four is the
third one she wanted to work because she
liked to work and she said no in this
atmosphere that's not a good idea for me
that's not fun so I leave and for her it
was okay so I went back to DCF Owen said
we have to do anything about it that's
not the way it works we can't look for
new accountants again and again and
again you have to sign out what if
really wants and you have to talk to Eve
that's not the way how to treat someone
in the team but he no conflict ability
knowing that she had a very good
relation to the Union CEO and did not
know which consequences it would have to
talk to her what do you think I see done
nothing he said okay then we won't get
any accountant we will pay her more
money and she is satisfied so she had
cost a lot of trouble and get more money
for it cool isn't it the easy way for
the CFO not what she really wanted I
think she wanted to hear oh if you're
the best please do it for us and so on
yeah but the signal which is sent out to
all others in the team is a catastrophe
he can treat us in a very bad way and
earn small for it so all those movies
which were in the room which could have
turned into good one turned into bed one
and become big elephants so what is the
move it moves is from the book goes in
the project management by Dennis Perkins
and approve moose itself is not good not
bad it's about power career relationship
and failures and weaknesses so the four
legs of the mousse so and we have to see
what happens with the moves when we look
at Korea it can turn out into a bad
thing when someone is striving for a
good career to go higher and higher and
higher it could happen that this person
knows no bounds all the person is
focusing on is Korea nothing else and it
could lead to self exploitation the good
side is that someone who wants a good
career also says okay I want a good
work-life integration the positive
atmosphere so that work
is also fun could be both when you're
striving for career the bad one or the
good side of it the power power is an
important motivation for a lot of people
and it can lead to greet just to have
power no other purpose just to have
power over people oh you can use power
and some kind of influence to change
something relationship usually the
relationship itself is nothing bad but
it becomes some kind of bad thing when
we talk about corruption nepotism are
taking own advantages just using my
relationship for my own purpose or I can
use my relationship for the best of all
when we want to change something in the
team and I am the person has the best
relationship to the manager perhaps it's
up to me to go and say hey boss let's
talk about a new idea we have and
perhaps my good relationship to this
boss is the best way to make him or her
think about this new idea and we have
the part of failure and weaknesses the
bad side is try to hide those failures
and start the blame game or seeing
failures and weaknesses is a chance for
myself and for the whole team so a moose
can be good or bad can turn into good or
bad but sometimes it turns into the
backside and so I may introduce you to
my co speaker guess what his name is no
idea Dumbo
and the elephant enters the room to be
honest I like elephants but I don't like
these elephants I'm now going to talk
about situation one who there's
mellophone do do you see the elephant to
any idea how we can get him out of the
stage can you please help me rimmel come
try does not work come on help me please
perhaps you can carry him away together
yeah I take back you okay and let's put
him over there come on so you far away
thank you very much sometimes you can
get out an elephant by recognizing
realizing that there's an elephant and
asking someone hey what can we do to get
this elephant out of the room and when
you start early enough and the elephant
is that small it's easy but most of the
time we say oh there's an elephant
better don't look at this because if I
look at it I have to do something I
don't know what to do so no I won't tell
you man I need anybody about it if
anybody else is the elephant they can do
something about it not me but when
you're working on a team it's not only
about you there may be a colleague which
sees the elephant 2 and this colleague
have seen that I have seen the elephant
since ourselves
sabina has seen elephant too but she
hasn't done anything she hadn't said
anything hmm she's more experienced than
I so I better say anything it's not my
task so oh they're not a colleague who
has also seen the elephant and who has
also seen that I have seen the elephant
but this colleague does not want to keep
quiet about it and perhaps this
colleague started started start the game
of Chinese whisper your no Chinese
football yeah why does this happen one
reason could be that people are
overstrained with the situation of
realizing that there's an elephant in
the room or they have no idea what to do
about it and it's always bad to talk
about the thing and you have no idea how
the solution could be all they have made
very experienced and experiences in
addressing such an elephant perhaps
there is no trust in the team what
happened when I talk about it remember
the CFO has no trust what happened to
him when he talks to his accountant huh
all they were afraid of the consequences
what could happen after another one will
do it for me rely on others is always a
good idea they feel not responsible for
the team so what I have I to do with
this perhaps they are feeling that they
are the wrong person they are more
experienced people to can manage this
better than I perhaps there's not a
really team and no interested interest
in it or they are following
own goals so I have other issues that's
not my issue let's get it off but the
most problematic thing is that you have
no transparency and that's the most
possible reason why these things happen
the elephant in the room is the issue of
transparency they don't want you to know
anything so they don't share anything
has is a quote of Michael Franken
professor of law and he said this
elephant in the room is an issue of
transparency when there's no
transparency these elephants have the
possibility to grow what happens when
Chinese whispers starts the results are
they cost a lot of time how long is it
ago that you have played Chinese whisper
I think it's not that long ago it's what
happens all the time in offices day by
day but these Chinese whisper games
costs a lot of time they cost a lot of
energy you spent a lot of your energy or
brain energy in talking about these
topics and they caused another wall of
confusion and wrong things which are
delivered you know when you give an
information from one person to another
the original information is not the same
as your result at the end of this chain
but this wrong information is believed
as a real fact so that's very dangerous
when someone tells you a thing it gives
you an information which is wrong but
you think it's right
and you behave according to this wrong
fact it causes a lot of trouble so as a
time goes by our elephant costs a lot of
resources growth and produces it's
always the same you put energy in and at
the end something else comes ourselves
and the elephant grows bigger because of
all of energy and produces much more
 now it's harder to get the elephant
out of the room because it's bigger and
yep it's not that easy anymore and
sometimes the elephant becomes a real
grown-up one with a good working
production the whole room filled up with
elephant and if you want if you
have this grown-up elephant it costs a
lot of your energy it smells because of
all the it is a bad example for all
the people around it makes the original
situation worse cause at the beginning
we had a small one and now we have a
real big one and when you now want to
get the elephant out of the room the
door is not enough anymore you have to
tear down the walls it's not that easy
anymore to get him out of the room and
now please replace the word elephant
with the word problem and the whole
story I told you will also make sense
the elephant in the room is the
unaddressed
problem what kind of problem ever hmm
now you may think our problem we don't
say problem anymore I know a lot of
colleagues of mine who are teaching
communication are telling you no don't
use the word problem it's a bad word
it's not motivating use the word
challenge I think that portrait because
when situations are bad we don't have a
challenge we have a problem euston we
have a problem i know i have to say
euston we have a challenge no that does
not work a problem means we have to act
now the challenges okay we can go on
tomorrow no we can't go on tomorrow when
we see a problem we have to act as soon
as possible to be honest with people
tend to make a problem out of everything
not everything we call a problem is
really a problem some of them are
challenges but we have still problems
and when we have a problem we have to
name it when there's an elephant in the
room introduce him it's what Randy
Pausch one set and I think that's very
important when we realize in our team
that we have a problem then we have to
introduce this problem and say hey let's
talk about it otherwise you won't find a
solution for this who of you has or had
an unaddressed elephant in the room
within the team the company okay
so sorry about that but with these
unaddressed elephant you would stuck in
mediocrity you have to do something
about it you have to work on a solution
to get the elephant out of the room
otherwise you will always find ways to
work around this elephant and this costs
time and discuss a lot of your capacity
and success has not this time to work
around this cause of bad decisions
because you always look for a solution
around dolls problem it costs a lot of
resources and these resources in a team
are time money and motivation and having
certain unaddressed elephant in the room
it's really a question about motivation
you don't want to go to your office
anymore you don't want to do this stuff
and in the end it cuz could cost people
and believe me those people who will
leave the team most of the time the very
good people the people you need to find
a solution the people you need to get
this elephant out of the room those
people who know how good they are are
those who leave first because I say oh I
don't want this anymore I just want to
have fun at work and that's not the
surrounding what I can have this so
having an elephant in the room could
really be a problem of motivation of
having the right people in the team who
can solve these problems
but people have to talk about problems
sorry people have to talk about others
problems so on the one hand we love to
talk about problems but it's better to
talk about other people's problems
because then I'm not in charge to do
anything so and it's so cool I can say
hey have you seen they have a proud to
have an elephant in the room cool let's
have a look what they are going to do
about that and my own one is standing
right in front of me but that's not that
interesting because I would have to
change perhaps aww i would have to do
some things I don't like so it's better
to talk about the things other people
have to fight with but there's a kind of
loop negative loop a wrong decision
causes loss of motivation loss of
motivation is lots of responsibility
this caused the loss of corporate
identity comes a lot of lots of
engagement and yeah lot of success and
leads to new wrong decisions and so it
goes on and on and on so when you re an
elephant it's a good idea if you want to
get a company down sometimes this
happens if you ignore these problems
they become really big one so you have
to do something about it who has to do
something about it who is the authorized
personal to do something about these
unaddressed problems this is just a
manager who's it
yes my why I was funny was it who's in
charge there everyone could be in charge
everyone who has seen the elephant and
says okay that's not a good idea to have
this sue in our office let's do
something about it who's playing golf
with you I haven't been in such a bad
situation yet because I haven't played
on such a course but I can imagine how
hard it is when your ball is lying in
the sand with this big wall in front of
you but no matter how bad the situation
is no direct you to the pin you have to
do something otherwise you can creat the
game so it's up to you to be the active
game changer and that's it in real life
too when we are in front of a situation
which is very hard for us yeah we can
wait until another one comes and helps
us out or we could choose the way to be
the active game changer and I think
that's the best way being dependent on
other people who help you out ok could
happen but what if they there is no one
who will help you it's up to you to help
you but I some haters most hated
questions the first one is why is the
situation as it is the question for the
reasons or their origin what is your
role in it which is your part in this
story your responsibility and what can
you do to solve the problem it's about
the solution but all these three
questions to one thing we have to change
something about it
time for action and this means we had to
get off our comfort zone our usual
habits perhaps have to change the habit
to say nothing and we have to adapt a
new habit to speak out loud and say hey
let's talk about it what can we do we
have to find a solution even if it hurts
finding solutions for big problems
sometimes hurt but better it hurts now
as if all the team struggles with
failures and other problems it's like a
trip into the dark we never know what's
lying ahead of us because you can't see
what will happen when we talk about
these problems what will happen when we
try to solve it but when we stay there
the elephant becomes the chance to grow
up and become very strong the bad thing
about is about it is that there is no
one no sighs no one-size-fits-all
solution because each problem is a very
individual problem and each team is very
individual so it's up to the team up to
the individuals to find a solution which
is good for them I have some first eight
tips what you can do on the first hand
the first important thing is to open
eyes and ears to be able to realize
those small little elephants to act as
soon as possible the next thing is to
treat problems in an open way not the
screen Chinese whisper game
but talked about it in the team in an
open way and so that everyone knows ok
we all have seen this elephant and now
it's okay to speak about it as soon as
possible no blame games it does not make
sense to find out who is the one who
causes this problem that's not what we
are looking for no blame games facts and
emotions on the one hasn't we have
effects what is the fact about this
problem and which emotions are caused by
these problems and in this case the
emotions are very very important because
these emotions it's bad mouth emotions
needs to be motivated and so on so facts
and emotions although you are all
developers and although some of you may
think that emotions are not important in
this case emotions are really important
on the first hand kinda quick solution
kind of first aid solution what can we
do now but then please try to the graph
discover the genesis and to discover the
why don't do it like a lot of doctors
are doing when you come with a symptom
to a to a doctor they give you some pool
to make the symptom go away but when you
haven't discovered the original of these
symptoms some other symptoms will pop up
and that's what happens when you do not
try to discover where this problem
originally comes from on the first hand
a quick solution but dan go deeper and
try to find out what is the real reason
that we have had this problem and then
start to
and one important thing to do all the
stuff is communication improve your
communication so that you can talk in no
way that you can find out which are the
the reasons for it and that you can find
solutions together here's some
classified information for you don't
tell your miniature that I have told you
if this a situation you want to be in
know this guy loves the situation he's
sleeping together with these lions and
so on he's able to do because he's the
expert he knows them very well he's the
expert in it and for you it is if
sometimes the problem is too big to
solve it on your own ask for help from
outside that's the reason why I asked
you for help to bring this elephant way
it was too big for me I could not manage
it on my own now when you're at work
Demmings once said the transformation
requires a view from outside
transformation is a real big problem a
real big challenge depends on the
company you are in and when you are
stacked and such a big problem you
sometimes have this tunnel view you
can't see what's going on at the right
or the left hand and so it's not easy to
find a good solution and when you have
someone from the outside it can be a
convert you can be a good friend or
whatever it's easier to get another view
on this on these problems and find
another solution but you can do
something to prevent getting enema
elephants in the room and the first
thing is that you find common goals for
your team the second is that you value
come
it means of higher than consensus
finding commitments you all want to work
for when you adopt a good feedback
culture on your company if Kyle feedback
which comes very soon it is much easier
to address upcoming problems cultures
important thing culture of transparency
you have seen elephants in the room an
issue afternoon of transparency Trust is
very important I just talked about
problems when I trust my team when I
have no trust I have fear of
consequences so I won't say anything the
culture of a positive failure culture so
that failures are welcome that various
thing to learn off and find values for
your teams when you have good values
when you have a good culture people
within the team will do nearly
everything to defend those good Carter
they won't let bad things happen because
they really like to work in this
environment and they want to stay there
most of us have some time experienced
how hard it is to work in an environment
when there's no trust where there is no
transparency and with no fun at work so
when we found the team the company where
we have a positive culture with all
those topics then we will do everything
to keep it because we like it
the earlier the better right from the
start okay it's not possible everywhere
across here sometimes already within a
team soul that does not mean that you
can't start with it now but the earlier
the better we prepare for this adventure
discover new opportunities and when you
are able to address upcoming problems as
