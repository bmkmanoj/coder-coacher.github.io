to share a link to the slides after the
session so you have to worry about
taking photos or desperately taking
notes if there's anything you see that
you think is really great hi and welcome
to angular angular I still almost
angular2 war stories hi and welcome to
angel of war stories we're here today to
share our stories about building and
deploying angular applications now when
you come to a lot of war stories talk
still here they're the things that
people don't really like about the
subject matter all the things I wish you
could change but you're not going to
hear that from us today because we
actually really love angular what we're
here today to share with is the lessons
that we've learned from the decisions
that we've had to make on our angular
journey and our goal is to save you from
burning time to help you to write be to
ask the right questions and to come to
the right answers i'm adam stephenson
i'm a solution architect at fsw in
australia so i actually run the
queensland office so you might have
heard of the Gold Coast of Australia all
the beautiful beaches are so let's let's
just be on the road for me so that's
really great I specialize in building
large enterprise web applications so
I've been doing angular and asp.net
course inside both in Vita and I also
run five bootcamp which is the training
arm of SSW I've run my name is Duncan I
worked with Adam in Brisbane Australia
at SSW and I've been really lucky in the
last two years to pretty much just live
and breathe angular and I spent about
half my time on client site writing code
in teams and the other half traveling
around and running workshops and other
things or Pluralsight courses and it's
been really great in a selfish sense
because I get to hang out with lots of
trainers and other people and just talk
shop all the time and get to learn lots
of tips and tricks and best practices so
hopefully today we can share some of
those you know tips and tricks from from
all of those conversations awesome so
now this isn't a 101 talk but we are
going to start off with what is angel
and why should you care then we'll talk
about what to do if you've got a lot of
angular 1 code and you're thinking about
my greater than what to do there we're
going to have a look at module loaders
and build systems we'll talk about type
scripts and ideas we look at CSS
frameworks and widgets and then where
the rubber really meets the road is only
cover
observables rfcs and redux and this is
different covering some of the more
complex advanced
books around underlined kind of getting
you going with those so what is angular
why should you care
Before we jump to that let's take a
little walk down memory lane of putting
javascript in the browser so it all
started with JavaScript from Netscape in
95 when Brendan Eich wrote it supposedly
in two weeks which is kind of crazy
because it's taking over the world and
then in 2002 we got xhr requests and
this was really important because we
didn't all of a sudden we didn't have to
refresh the page to be able to get data
so our user experience got better then
in 2006 we got jquery which was kind of
important because it was the first time
we started to see big names like Google
and Microsoft and Apple decide not to
rewrite their own and start sharing some
libraries and then 2008 we got the
Chrome browser and the v8 engine people
got more ambitious in the browser we
started to see crazy things like Google
Maps which at the time when it came out
was pretty revolutionary then we got
node in 2009 which for us is really
important as front-end developers
because we got the node package manager
which is the dominant package manager at
the moment then we got knockout in 2010
which has kind of been knocked out and
then we got we got angularjs as well at
the same time and so this is kind of
interesting that angular is like seven
years old so they've learnt a lot kind
of as a team doing lots of work together
but angularjs wasn't perfect so we still
react come onto the scene from Facebook
and that got a lot of attention and is
still a great framework and very popular
and we also got time typescript in 2013
as well which but if you're a developer
like me you'll be going oh it was cool
in 2013 as well but it wasn't really
until last year when Google or angular
announced they'll be making angular 2 in
it but all the cool kids started to pay
attention and they thought it only just
came out so we also got in 2016 as I
mentioned angular 2 finally was released
and we also got ACMA script 6 which was
like the biggest upgrade to the language
specification for JavaScript in a lot of
years and it was a pretty big deal and
then in 2017 this year we got angular 4
which is pretty awesome so angular is
now evergreen so angular so angular 2
has been replaced by angular Hall and
just the same way that chrome
continually ships new versions and
you're not come all
completely aware of what version it is
we're actually going to see a much more
frequent release cadence in angular so
we're going to see new versions coming
out every six months but the great thing
is it doesn't mean there's going to be a
lot of breaking changes it's just going
to be evergreen and continually updating
but you'll still hear our stuff up and
saying gila one or two or four the rest
of the talk so because we're all
transitioning to just saying
yeah angular the angular team says we
should just call it angular now we
shouldn't be calling it angular 2
angular 4 but there's some bad habits
that we definitely made them so angel is
just a JavaScript framework right well
it was when the angular team released
angularjs they described it as a
superhero of JavaScript framework it's
always to be the best of the best
JavaScript frameworks but angular 2 has
a much more lofty goal they described as
one front one framework mobile and
desktop so the goal wasn't just to be
the best of the best JavaScript
frameworks for building applications -
one in writing web browsers it's also
designed to be the best way to build
mobile applications that are going to
run on iOS and Android and to build
desktop applications for Windows Linux
and our effects so it's pretty ambitious
what was the main problem with angularjs
it was slow if you're trying to build a
really big complex application or you're
trying to get your application to run on
an underpowered Android device it had
lots of performance issues it was a real
focus of the angular team we're now
building on your to an angular is now
really fast so we've got optimized code
generation so all of the HTML templates
are compiled down into really highly
optimized JavaScript we've got Universal
for server-side rendering and SEO so the
initial page load is really fast and
we've got code splitting so now when you
go to the first page of the application
it doesn't download all the JavaScript
to the whole application it's only going
to download the JavaScript in chunks as
you navigate around the application now
the real reason that I love angular the
most is the productivity I am in charge
of shipping features I write code every
day I run a number of teams and as
consultants you know we're in charge of
delivering value to the business and my
guys they disagree on everything they
don't agree on laptops they all like
different mobile
like different operating systems there
are like different owner ends but they
actually all of them really like angular
because that it really helps us deliver
value so the component model is great it
makes composing your applications really
easy the template syntax is really
simple but really powerful
we've got typescript so now we've got
strong typing sound JavaScript and the
age of CLI makes it really easy to do a
production build output the other thing
we like about angular is that it's a
complete framework so out of the box we
get route and testing
internationalization animation
accessibility and a production build
tool so that's all in the boxes anger
and all of those features keep getting
upgraded as angular progresses the other
big deal for us is that angel is the
most popular framework what I'm having a
look at here is a Google Trends graph
showing keyword searches for front-end
frameworks and we can see that really
it's a two horse race with between angel
and react but we're not in high school
anymore wise popularity a big deal well
the more popular frameworks are easier
to learn there's more online courses
there's more blogs there's often better
documentation
well you never tha tably get stuck
there's more X's on Stack Overflow
there's more community writing
third-party libraries we also think
they're going to stick around for longer
you look at angularjs it's been used in
production now for seven years and
that's like a hundred and forty years in
JavaScript framework use you do and I
also think these statistics are really
interesting so in the last month
reactors had four and a half million
downloads in angular so the latest
version of angular has of one and a half
million so really this is just as far as
popularity goes it's really a two horse
race with angular and react so let's
have a quick talk about this component
model that Adam mentioned we won't spend
too long in this but at the heart of the
component model you have a typescript
class where you put your properties and
methods and on top of this you put some
metadata and this metadata is what lets
angular know that this typescript class
is actually an angular component but
it's also responsible for gluing the
component to the template and you could
call this thing a module
which basically means you can share this
module with any file in your application
so you can reuse this component and if
you have properties or methods on your
component class that you want to share
with your template you can do that with
angular's property binding and if you
have events on the template that arrays
like button clicks then you can listen
for those with angular's event binding
and you can stick other components on
this template or directives and if you
have a reusable code like HTTP requests
you can stick those in angular services
and use angular's dependency injection
to share those around with your
components so once you have one
component two components three end up in
a component tree and the top of your
componentry you'll usually have
something called an app component and if
app components job is really just to
render or start your application up but
underneath that you would have for
example a to-do component and this new
component is what would call a
presentation or component so or a smart
component so what it's responsible for
doing is being able to communicate with
an angular service get to do the lead to
lose to actual logic work but it doesn't
really render very much but it is the
parent for some presentational
components or dumb components so for
here we would have a to-do list
component and it's job really is just to
be able to receive the lists of to do's
and put it on the page and then you
might have a to-do input component and
this input components job is just
literally to get the inputted text and
emit an event of what was inputted so
when you take this structure and you
start thinking about angular modules
then you start to get some benefits so
angular has its own module system as
well and we could say this whole thing
is a module so basically a module is a
list of saying for this section of my
application here here are the
dependencies and right now we're just
got one big module so for the whole app
but we could split this up and we could
say okay now I've got a module for my
app component which loads every time
it's just got the minimum it needs and
then I could have another module that
represents all the things that this red
section here needs all the JavaScript
for that section still can't do very
much useful things with this but as soon
as I add another component like a home
page I could make that its own angular
module and now we can start doing code
splitting so you navigate to the home
page you only get the JavaScript in the
orange you navigate to the to-do page
then you get all the JavaScript in the
red section so this is like trivial to
implement but it's a big change and
can really affect your performance so
angular itself is really easy we never
hear people complain about learning to
do services or data binding or routing
or any of those sort of things but
angular like many front-end frameworks
at the moment make you confront modern
web development and you have to learn a
bunch of stuff you're going to need to
learn to use typescript which is not too
difficult you're going to need to learn
to be pretty good at rxjs or reactive
extensions for javascript and you're
also going to need to be pretty good at
understanding modules not just
JavaScript modules but angular modules
and module loading and module bundling
because that's how you're going to with
that understanding make a performant
application that's smaller for the
browser so in summary why do we like
angular and why you should care well
it's super fast and it's cross-platform
that's pretty cool it's also going to
make you more productive in your teams
it's a complete framework and it's
enterprise friendly we don't have to go
explain to our you know insurance
company or government project and say oh
you know have you heard of angular
they've already heard of it before and
they're happy to use it and you can be
more ambitious let's face it the reason
we like new frameworks is we can build
more stuff with it so rather than
reaching out to a library for something
like a type-ahead it's something that's
trivial to make with a component based
architecture in rxjs yourself so what
about if we've got a great big codebase
in angular 1 and they're thinking about
upgrading what are the options well it's
easy to choose a new framework when
you're starting a new project but what
if you're adding a new feature on in
angularjs here's something I want you to
think about every line of angular 1 you
write today's technical debt so if you
spend six months now writing angularjs
code in six months time that's six
months of angularjs that at some time
down the track you're going to have to
upgrade to a modern framework so what
are you going to do if you've already
got an angularjs project well most
people see that they think that they
have two options they can either do a
big bang rewrite or they can do an
upgrade so let's talk about the upgrade
options it is actually possible to put
angular 1 and angel 2 for all in the
same project using something called the
upgrade adapter we don't we don't really
think it's worth it the benefit is is
that in your angular 1 project you can
actually start writing
for today this is actually going to be a
really big refactor though especially if
your angular 1 project is still being
written like 2014 angularjs and you're
not using typescript you're not using a
module loader and you're not using
angular components there's also a
performance implication now you're
downloading angularjs and you're
downloading angular 2 and there's also a
steeper learning curve because instead
of just learning angel now you're
learning angular but mixed in with
angularjs what we think is a better
option is to start writing your angular
1 like it's angular 4 click typescript
and dissolution get a module bundler
index solution and start writing angular
1.5 components this is a much lower risk
approach and it means you start learning
the angular 4 concepts it also means
that down the track you've got a faster
future path to a rewrite the downside of
course is at the end of the day you are
still writing an angular 1 app now
hopefully there are some people here
maybe there's some people here going
I love angular and I'm going to go and
I'm going to talk the boss into letting
me do a Big Bang rewrite and what we're
going to do is we're going to take our
existing up and then we're going to
start a new app then we're going to
build the same functionality but in this
nice new shiny code and the benefit is
of course of that is it's nice and fun
and clean we don't recommend that either
because it's really high risk at the
same time that you're maintaining your
existing system you're fixing bugs in it
you've got the businesses demanding new
features you know be delivered soon
you're still working in this solution at
the same time you're building a brand
new Greenfield project on the new
technologies it's really high risk and
at the end of the day you're just
recreating the problem you know and the
boss knows that in a couple of years
you'll be coming back and going hey
we've got to do another Big Bang rewrite
because now there's a newest shinier
technology what we think is a much
better approach is to start rewriting
into smaller apps so when the business
comes to you and says here's a new
feature we like you to add you abstract
out the common part to abstract the
authentication to abstract out styling
and then you actually just create a new
angular application to deal with the new
feature so the benefit of this is it
lets you start writing angular for today
much easier to get approval just to
start working on the new technology
because you're only asking for approval
on a particular feature and you're doing
away with the perpetual cycle of having
to do BIGBANG rewrites the downside is
there's DevOps overhead you do need to
go through you know some complexity
about abstracting and authentication etc
and but it can be it can be reasonably
easy we've got a project that's a very
big angularjs project where it's sitting
on top of asp.net views and to be able
to put angular 2 in that project all we
did was create a new angular 2 new
asp.net view and we've got the angular 2
sitting on that so there's a as you
change between the features you change
between angular 1 and 2 and that was an
easy way to get up and go hmm it's been
it's actually been an interesting
experience for me I got to write 3
applications for a customer smaller
applications or start to look the same
so they were separate they were deployed
separately and the company bought
themselves a big chunk of headache
having to separate that there ought
service but when the user used it just
looked like one application so it was
quite an interesting experience because
we were on the table were like ok what
are we going to do we're going to we're
going to write another angular 1 app or
a 2 app on the next thing but we don't
really need to have to worry about what
all the other stuff is because that
angularjs code is actually fine it's
only like a year old so rewriting all
that would be a total pain so they're in
this unique position where they can just
make another small app and then they can
just start that in whatever they want it
could be 2 or 4 or react or whatever so
it was a really interesting experience
to being in that position not to be
having to worry about migrating and so
forth and it's always what we look for
first is to not come back over our other
code to see if we can split off into
something else
definitely so in summary when you're
thinking about should I be upgrading or
rewriting it's really important to focus
on the fact that your angularjs is
technical debt and it's more effort to
migrate slowly because it's a lot safer
and that ideally what you'd consider
doing is rewriting into smaller
front-end applications alright let's
have a chat about module loaders and
bundlers and build systems and all of
that sort of stuff
the problem with angularjs we had it was
pretty slow and that's because you had
to load the entire thing in the browser
there was a few edge cases you could get
around that but not many people were
doing it
and to get round this deal of having
huge downloads we wrote our own build
systems and there were time consuming to
fix and keep up to date to try and crush
down the size of what we sent to the
browser but at the end we still had slow
ups it wasn't uncommon for an app to
have you know ten kind of graphs on the
front in a dashboard and ten HTTP
requests for each of them and the thing
would take five seconds to load so it
was a challenge for us and it was a pain
and JavaScript used to be really simple
back then as well things weren't too bad
sometimes we didn't need a build system
and in angularjs the simplest way to get
started was just to do this you could
have an angularjs file and index.html
page and that's all you would need to
start writing in a version one now this
is the easiest way to get started
writing angular version 2 or 4 using the
angular CLI so this is 2024 thousand
files as of today what it's a lot of
files and it's 200 megabytes so of
course you can't send you can't send 24
thousand files down into the browser
you're going to have to have a build
tool and that's kind of the point we're
making here is you got to go through a
journey to understand some of this stuff
to have a way to process what you need
out of those 24,000 files take the bits
of JavaScript you want put them in your
own 4 or 5 JavaScript files and send
that down to the browser and this is
where modules help and we've got both
JavaScript and angular modules so with
the JavaScript modules it would look
something like this where we're going to
put this export word in front of the
function and say we're exporting this
function and this function really just
adds two values and then we can import
it into something like a calculator TS
file and then we can use that sum
function from the math file so with this
if you've got all these import
statements at the top of every every
file you know exactly what each file
needs but the problem with angular was
there were so many little bits that if
we had to put import statements only at
the top of the page we might end up with
20 inputs in every page for every
angular ng e for ng 4 and all these
little bits for angular for this reason
and other reasons then came up with
their own module system which at first I
went up this is not good we've got
modules in JavaScript but it does allow
us to do some advanced things so now
between this module system which
basically says for a section of code
here is kind of like some more glow
or dependencies and these JavaScript
imports then we can make a dependency
graph so we can say like I've got this
JavaScript file in this type scripts
file and some other typescript files in
a sass file and this file needs that
file we end up knowing everything every
file needs before we go to the browser
we can pass that to a module bundle or
like web pack and web pack has the
smarts to go through and read this all
and know everything you need
many are great make me just one bundle
the main bundle of all my code but you
get much smarter than this and you guys
are making a vendor bundle for all the
third-party JavaScript and then you get
to matter again and you can say okay
let's lazy load some bundles let's
separate out like our to do feature from
before into its own JavaScript bundle
before we go to the browser so this is
great and we can start doing a bunch of
stuff but we've got another challenge in
angular besides having to have a build
system is that templates are currently
compiled in the browser and in
particular in angularjs that's all you
can do and this is not so good because
it's a little slow yeah you have to
download this tiny compiler you have to
do some work in the browser to get your
templates from being HTML templates with
angular on it to something the browser
can run and this is what would call JIT
or just-in-time compilation in the
browser but now we've got this äôt
thing that angular and it's a pretty
cool thing or ahead of time compilation
so rather than what we did in angularjs
or version 1 we would get this template
in the browser or the HTML and would
parse it in the browser you couldn't do
it elsewhere and then we'll make some
Dom and then would have executable
JavaScript what we do is we can now grab
that offline this HTML template we can
pass it with node on your machine or in
your CI process and then we can make an
ast tree or an ABS abstract syntax tree
and then we can make executable java
scripts before we even think about going
to the browser so this is great for
performance and we can just hand that
source code to the browser and then run
it so this is one of the big performance
improvements we've gotten and other
people have gotten using angular which
is great but there's more to it you know
you've got a ot and your inlining
modules and you got tree shaking and
minification and a few other things so
it's starting to get much more complex
to try and roll your own build system so
what does some saying is is that now
when we do our build we need to
compress images link up typescript
compiler since s compiler type script
demon if ocation do bundling run a unit
test and end M tests and now we've got
to run the alt compilation do tree
shaking and build separate bundles well
that's a lot of work so it's getting
really complicated and time-consuming to
roll your own build process now we used
to be built two warriors I was really
proud of the fact that when angular
first came out I wrote this awesome
seven hundred line gulp script that went
through and did all of those tasks ok it
was a lot of work but you know that's
that's that's what it took but then we
ran up against a problem and we realize
ah there's this node modules folder and
that's got 46,000 files in it and let's
find a copy across to that test set of
it obviously when we go to our build
survey a production server we can't do
that so what we ended up with was a file
that said go and take these files out of
node modules really push it to
production and use those but as the app
got more and more complex we found that
that just wasn't realistic and that led
us to our first epiphany you need to
understand module loading ok so you
can't just go and get angularjs and
stick it on the index to HTML page
anymore because that javascript style is
going to depend on 10 other files and
those 10 files are going to depend on
another 10 files ok so there's a lot of
complexity that you can't manage this by
yourself what we realize that you need
is your process really needs a module
bundler ok so what we do is we went and
got the system jeaious builder and put
that into our gulp file and what the
module bundler does is it understands
your whole complete your whole
dependency graph so it can traverse your
dependency graph work out what needs to
get bundled and bundled it down for you
so we fell included the system j/s
builder on my gulp script and that was
great that solved that problem for me
so gold is a great build system but I
still had this you know 700 to 1000 line
gulp file and I was maintaining and what
people were telling me I should check
out other things so we checked out word
pack which is a really powerful module
bundler but you're still going along and
like yourself and then we also check out
the angular CLI
which is a command line tool from the
angular team that lets you do
cogeneration and is also a production
build tool so there used to be a lot of
discussion when we started doing angular
about which of these was the right
choice and as I've said you know gulps a
lot more work and it's not really the
right chest to pack the right choice for
packaging up your web application now
where packs really powerful and it's got
advanced module bundling it's the most
popular most popular module bundle
because tree shaking and it's got really
expensive plugin support okay
the but it's really a bit of a specialty
so what we find on teams are using
webpack is there tends to be one going
on the team and here's the guy who goes
and learned all about web pack and is in
charge of the build and here's a guy
whom that it goes and manage all of that
to the team are there any red pack guys
in the audience a few okay cool look
it's not the most glorious job in the
world but you guys are still heaps
cooler than the Crystal Reports guys
the downside of web pack is that you've
got to have a web pack by now the
angular CLI is a command-line interface
that does cogeneration and as a
production build tool so it uses web
pack under the covers you can use it to
create your application it does
cogeneration it's the production build
tool which is a really big deal I went
from having to write in a couple of days
to write a 700 800 line gold file to now
a single command line that does
everything I was doing before and much
more and better than I was doing it it
also follows the style guys so the
angular style guide is the best
practices style guide and it's developed
in lockstep with the CLI so the CLI
always reflects those best practices and
it also rise up out of the box unit test
and ending testing a bit of a downside
of the angular CLI is it doesn't have
web plug-in support so if you need
custom web plug-ins what you do is is
you actually eject it has a great
feature where you can object out of the
end of the CLI and then you've got the
full web pack build that you can lean
fully on customize and yeah this is kind
of one of the cool things about being at
conferences like this I was sitting at
the angular Oslo user group
represented sitting next to this guy
he's all quiet and then he's like kind
of going I use the closure compiler and
someone else was talking and stuff and
but what was really cool about it I got
talking to him and he's using this
closure compiler knees using webpack
he's got his own web pack config for
doing that and I was asking how he did
it he goes oh you know what I do is I
still use the angular CLI to build
everything and I still do my whole dev
environment but in my CI process my
continuous integration
I just eject every time so every time he
goes into his pipeline ehx gets the web
pack config annotates it a little bit
and puts on this like a hundred lines of
extra code to do closure compiler on top
of it which will crush it even tinier
again and he's getting these crazy 50
kilobyte you know package sizes to start
his application in the browser which is
really cool so yeah I thought that was a
really cool thing to be able to go stay
with the CLI but still be able to eject
every time and be able to do some work
without having to lose all the dev
benefits of being in the CLI to have
this tool that just works across your
team so pretty cool that's also it's
like the best of both worlds but either
the cell line in your dev environment
and then on your build server rejecting
and doing the crazy type content elation
it's very cool
so let's have a look let's just quickly
run through and have a look at you know
how we could create a project using the
angular CLI
actually run the application do a little
bit of code generation and then actually
build the production output so mg is
obviously the angular CLI command so
we're gonna go ng new to create a new
project and give it a name of CLI demo
that's going to run through and create
all the files that I need if you worked
in angel in the early days you'll know
that it could you know could take a day
or two to create a proper big angular
project where you're actually creating
all the files yourself in the early days
but now literally takes a few seconds it
goes off then it restores our NPM
packages I can jump into visual studio
code and there's my full application all
set up ready to go
including unit testing and in doing
testing which is great I could jump back
out to the command prompt and all I need
to do to run the application is type ng
serve and that's going to spin out a
little lightweight web server compiler
application and then I can actually go
and navigate to the application that's
running in the browser pretty easy
what's even cooler is the toad
generation now I've seen a lot of
cogeneration demos and then you go back
to the office and you go to do it
yourself you're like well I can't use
that day-to-day then but the angular CLI
is cogeneration is awesome we literally
generate every component with it we
actually use the cogeneration all day
every day because it's really super
helpful so we go energy generate we
specify the type of class we're going to
create early creating a a component or
an interface or a module and then we
give it a name it runs through the
correct the stylesheet it creates the
HTML template creates the unit test file
then it creates the components type
script file itself and then it even goes
and updates the module includes that
component into the module that it needs
to be in I could open that up in Visual
Studio code and you can see that it's
created it nicely is forming in there so
that's really helpful and it treats
takes a lot of that work of scaffolding
out your application away now this is
really the big deal when you want to go
through instead of having that great big
dot file or having to go and configure
webpack which I should just jump back to
the command line and go ng build and
pass it the prod parameter and then it's
going to go in through that do that all
of those build tasks and compress it all
down including lazy loading of the of
the application so as you navigate
around you're only getting the code that
you need all with one command so it's
super super powerful now when I jump
back into Visual Studio code you can see
it in the disk file der that's actually
all I need to deploy that to my real web
server I can even go and just stick it
on a CDN there's about ten files there's
the favicon there's a hate there's the
index.html and then there's a bunch of
JavaScript may even notice that none of
the components HTML files are in there
that's because they've all been
compressed and compiled down into highly
optimized JavaScript as well at all I
need to deploy now interestingly when I
open it up in the browser and then I go
and have a look at that compiled code
you can see here it's actually only
needs to download 120 Kay so just with
the out-of-the-box compiler that's still
pretty tight especially when you
consider that jQuery just by itself is
256
okay and as Duncan said you can go to
the closure compiler which will compress
it down again that goes crazy like 250
or 60 K so we used to get this question
all the time is the angular CLI ready
and it's not really a question anymore
it used to be a bit of a debate about
which one to use and we tell everyone
now in the angular CLI is the right
place to start to you 95% of our
projects are on the angular CLI and then
if you go down the track and we find you
need you know advanced web capabilities
then you can eject from the angular CLI
and then start using webpack so in
summary we think everyone should get
started using the angular CLI and then
go and get a web pack guy and start
using webpack builds if you really need
it so it's sort of in terms of war
stories you wouldn't think some of these
things would be a pain like ideas and
typescript but some of these things have
been a pain over the last year or so for
us so one of the problems obviously with
JavaScript is that it has no type so if
you have a very large code base it can
be hard to refactor if you have to
rename a variable across 100 files based
off string that's the day you want to
miss work and let someone else pick up
that task and the JavaScript doesn't
have any checking so this is where
typescript can really help us and being
able to change that variable across 100
files becomes trivial so it becomes a
lot less risky to refactor our
JavaScript so where I'm getting at here
is you've got a choice on what you use
you could use typescript which is the
default language if you're going to
write any angular applications but there
are choices you could be also using es6
or the latest version of javascript or
you could use that but I haven't still
haven't met anybody to this day who uses
Dart unless they work at Google so let's
just stick to the first two here and I
think it's really interesting to have a
look at what's happening with typescript
this is Stack Overflow kind of interest
the typescript like questions and
traffic around it and you can see really
2013 to 2016 it's kind of stagnant and
then forum in the last year so so much
bigger thing than angular is currently
4.8 million downloads from npm every
month for typescript so type scripts
getting a lot of traction so we really
feel even you can see here from lots of
greens and no real
we like is not really very much of a
choice here between typescript or not
but still people come to us asking for
you know can we do not typescript so
some of the benefits you get strong
typing and really that strong typing
leads to my favorite benefit refactoring
the code and navigating a code base with
typescript that's just outrageously
better for me there are teams as well
angular itself written in typescript so
you're going to be working up hills
straightaway because the way they think
is based on having type scripts and
typescript decorators and so forth and
everything's in typescript all the
third-party libraries all the docs any
of the stack overflow questions
everything's there so really if you
don't want to do typescript
theoretically you can I've only ever
heard one third party story of somebody
doing it I've never met anybody yet and
you probably can but the thing will be
you're going to have to allocate more
resources for resources for it you're
probably going to have it's probably
going to cost you longer time so it's
doable but it's you just got to take
that into account so why would you not
want to use it well I guess maybe you
know there's if you've got a team that's
really strong in JavaScript you've also
got other frameworks like reacting you
want to keep everything in JavaScript
that might be a reason you want to do
that okay
so let's talk about editors because this
has been a pain for us we're a dotnet
shop we use a lot of Visual Studio
currently we're using 2017 and it's been
a pain and some of our customers as well
so there's a there's really four choices
Adams one choice very popular very nice
lightweight it's got good typescript
support then you got Visual Studio
proper like I said we're currently at
2017 with that and it's arguably the
best IDE for c-sharp but what we've
found for it is that there's a bunch of
extra config to get angular working in
there and you end up fighting you know
all the latest features for the
typescript compiler and Visual Studio
not being up to date with it and then
the next hurdle you have with it is that
you're running what is really just a
folder with files in it which is your
angular code inside of what is like a
something that's designed to really have
more like a project or a solution in
there and I'm not saying you can't I'm
just saying there's all this extra
overhead and we've had team bus their
head against the wall for a fair bit
being mandated to use Visual Studio and
now we're in this place we're definitely
in Australia and other play
as I've visited it almost all the dotnet
shops we've seen they use Visual Studio
for their back-end and they use Visual
Studio code to write their angular and
we just see that everywhere because
Visual Studio code which is a
lightweight editor from Microsoft that
has incredible typescript support and it
has incredible tooling for angular and
it's fast and lightweight so you can get
HTML intellisense in your templates for
angular with extensions that mean you
get code completion in the HTML which is
pretty hectic it's great to have that
coming to HTML you can navigate from the
implementation the HTML to the
components there's all these extensions
that help that you don't yet get in
Visual Studio but I should mention there
is a asp.net core spar templates which
are popular as well so Microsoft have
some open source community projects
where they will set up and scaffold out
an angular project like the CLI will for
you in Visual Studio bound to a speed on
their core and it's got some advanced
server-side rendering and a bunch of
other stuff and really for me they're
the only two things that I would
probably consider in the market at the
moment for making an angular project
from scratches these spar templates or
the CLI but we tend to still stay with
the CLI because it's made by Google and
also unless we need server-side
rendering we usually don't want to tie
our back ends and front ends together
and that might be a case where we would
use the asp.net course our templates but
really what I'm saying here is you've
got a choice between these two guys
webstorm also has amazing support for
angular and all of this code completion
and refactoring stuff and HTML template
intellisense is in there as well so if
you're going to do angular more than a
day a week we find almost everybody ends
up in one of these two ideas for their
angular code you can do it in the other
ones I'm not saying it doesn't work it's
still great but these ones have some
extra features so in summary we really
feel it is kind of a dominant typescript
of being if you're going to do angular
and you should keep your back-end
IDE like visual studio but if you're
going to do angular we recommend you
something that's great friend you like
Visual Studio code CSS frameworks and
widgets who would have thought this
would be a pain as well
angular ships almost a year ago and we
only got a date picker like two weeks
ago for angular material and some of
these other libraries and this has been
our joke in the office for us is like
our date pickers is our benchmark
angular will be
Fisher when we have date pickers across
all the component members so it's an
interesting point here and it's
important because you know once you
choose one of these frameworks like
bootstrap or angular material you know
you need good UX and you need these
things to help you along you can roll
your own but a lot of people have a
dependency on one of these and once
you've done six months of development
down the road with a team of people it's
like you is going to turn around and
switch so you want to make a good choice
up front with this and it's been hard
for us to make that choice because
normally we use something like bootstrap
or material and then have maybe one
other vendor like to help us out with
components but it's really been this
mismatch for ages now and it's kind of
improving in the last little while but
we see it's a really between these two
people are the most popular ones so
material a material two is a ground-up
rewrite of material one for angular so
it's material design specification for
Google implemented in angular components
so it's super fast optimized for angular
written by the Google team and then
there's bootstrap which I think is in
the top three most downloaded or cloned
repositories on github and is making the
web look the same on all websites at the
moment but it's great so there's a
couple of other libraries that I'll
point out here so ng prime we're
starting to see a lot of people if they
go down the material 2 path it doesn't
have everything they need
it got a date picker very recently but
that was one of the common problems the
other things like a data table every one
unit tends to have data tables so we've
been seeing a lot of people use ng prime
for data table and other pieces and then
use material for everything and then as
material and the Google team released
more components than they start using
those more than ng prime now if you're
going to go down to bootstrap path we
see a lot of people use ng bootstrap
which is an angular eyes version of
bootstrap and these guys were the
dominant ones for angularjs the first
version and they're pretty much the
dominant ones for the next version so
these are kind of the main libraries
we're seeing a lot of people use and
we're using but there's a bunch of
others in here lots of other ones
everyone's invested quite heavily I'm
probably missing another half dozen
because a lot of these vendors got a lot
of good traction in angularjs and
they've invested heavily so it's a bit
less of a pain but you're still it's a
pretty big choice which way you'll go
between
- because materials which I really like
material because you know it's it I
think it's going to probably become a
default for a lot of people if it suits
your business needs and it looks you
know because it's a certain style of
look a lot of people will get great
components from doing that there's
full-time angular core team members I
think they're up to like five full-time
people working on at Google which is
kind of crazy for a free project and it
keeps pace with angular and it's built
for angular it's very performant that
the one big downside is it's kind of a
one-way street you know it's not going
to work very well with CSS clashes
between bootstrap and angular material
so you tend to be going one or the other
and they're still in beta they move so
slowly if you've been excited about them
then they make really awesome components
but they're kind of like it'll be ready
when we're finished because each of
their components are really high quality
but they're not in any rush which is why
people are in patching it with other
things
bootstrap awesome well proven lots of
people use it
there's a truck ton of third-party
providers who have angular versions and
bootstrap and there's even a whole bunch
of libraries that aren't angular
versions that have a dependency on
jQuery which can be quite good like date
pickers and other sorts of things but it
doesn't work with material and you might
end up with a dependency on jQuery and
some people think oh my god jQuery is
the devil if you program with jQuery
these days you don't know how to program
on the front end and I think that used
to be a problem for angularjs but really
you know at this stage most people don't
select the Dom with their jQuery it's
more for third-party libraries and
really comes down to whether or not you
want to pay the cost to put that jQuery
in the browser and if you don't have to
pay for it then don't use jQuery which
is the best outcome but some there's
some great tools that still use it okay
so in summary we think you should be
using material - and we think if it's
the look you want
and you should patch it the things that
are missing from it that are coming like
a data table with third-party vendors
cool observables the fun part
observables rxjs and redux so this is
the area where the steepest learning
curve this is where teams coming to
angular kind of hit a little bit of a
stumbling block and they start finding
things a little bit difficult
so programmed into the web can sometimes
feel a little like this you know the web
is inherently asynchronous you might
have a button on your user interface
that calls of service and the user comes
along and they bash the button a heap of
times sends up a whole heap of HTTP
requests asynchronously you don't know
how long each of those HTTP requests is
going to take to return you don't even
know what order they're going to return
it so one where that's a composed of
asynchronous requests but your async
code can often seem hard to write hard
to refactor and hard to reach hard to
debug now we have something to help it's
called rxjs and so what are excesses is
the JavaScript implementation of
reactive extensions and now there's
reactive extensions for nearly 20
languages
there's reactive extensions for c-sharp
for Java for Python for Ruby and the
whole point of the reactive extensions
is to simplify writing async code now
it's really important to get your head
around rx tress because it's baked right
into angular if you're going to do it
call a HTTP endpoint and return some
data back you're going to get back our
accessible if you're going to work with
reactive forms the reactive in the name
actually comes from reactive extensions
even the router exposes it observable so
it's really important that your team
understands our success and we find that
it's probably the area of angular that
people don't invest enough in in
learning and they come unstuck later on
so what if she is rxjs it's an API for
asynchronous programming so what it does
is it works with observable streams so
it happens is it's really it's all about
observables so what we can do is we can
create an observable that contains a
certain piece of information and what we
want to do is is we want to know when
that data changes okay we want to be
notified when that data changes so what
we can do is we can go in create an
observer and that observer is going to
subscribe to the observable and when the
data changes the observable is going to
remit the data and then it's going to be
received by the observer and there we
can even we can
multiple observers for our observable so
when the bladder and the observable
changes and the values for comes through
this could be like a calculator the
calculator input and now that usually
hit the number one they've got published
they've gotta make sure we've got
received by the observer the user hits
the number four the observable emits it
it's received by both of the observers
observer user hits number seven admitted
by the observable and received by the
observers okay so what we can also do is
that we can apply filter operators so
that when the data is emitted by the
observable it could be the observer can
actually apply this filter operator so
in this case when the observable emits
the value of one it's not going to pass
through the filter operator so that got
it even actually going to be received by
the observable by the observer the
observable emits the value of four that
does pass through the filter and then
makes it to the observable and so does
the number seven that comes through now
there's a whole lot of operators there
so as you can see there are a lot of
operators for our XS and the operators
are really what make it super powerful
and you'll get really good and actually
going into the docs and finding the
operator that you asked because that's
where the real time of our exchange
comes from the canonical example of how
great our excessive is the type of head
who didn't type ahead in angular 1 yeah
non-trivial isn't it so in Ankara 2 it
gets easier so what we can do is we can
actually get the search text field and
it exposes a value changes observable
and now as you hit each letter in that
text field it's going to emit that value
through the value changes observable
doing it type ahead is this easy I can
actually use the debounce operator to
say only emitting your value after 500
milliseconds of activity inactivity use
the distinct until changed operator so
dynamic the same value twice in a row
and then I'm going to do a switch map
and the switch map is just going to
switch me from one observable to another
observable so I can go from the
observable of value that's being emitted
and I can put that into an observable
to be returned from my album service
search so then that's going to return me
the results now the really cool thing
about switch map is it's going to cancel
the previous requests if there's other
HTTP requests in flight so it shows the
power of our Xterra yeah
a journey for sure huh yes so I've been
doing observables probably every day for
the last year and a half and it's
totally a journey you start off with
angular and you just do HTTP GET or
something like ah this is pretty easy I
got this
and then like is not too bad and then
you okay now I've got like two
observable streams and I need to join
them together and all of a sudden like I
don't I don't think I got it and you're
off to the docks and you're looking it
up and looking up and I cool I can use
this operator called combine latest and
then things are good and then you'll go
further down the track anything like
right now I've got an observable of
observables then like I got this I got
this I got this and you're back off to
the docks in looking for something else
so it definitely is a journey and the
more you invest in it the better better
things are you start to learn about more
operators to deal with all these common
scenarios so it's definitely something
you want to be investing in quite a bit
so in summary with our Astraeus the
modern web development is asynchronous
and our Astraeus is going to take a
little bit of work to fully get your
head around but it's really valuable we
think everyone should go out and really
do it because it's really going to make
a difference to simplify your async code
and it's essential to learn because it's
baked right into angular you know I
don't think we've seen anybody waste
time learning rxjs
ever never heard song i wish i spent
less time learning it so let's talk
about state management because this is
kind of where most of the front-end
world is kind of added them and we've
got this kind of big revolution
happening with how people are managing
state and a lot of people actually say
i've used to react i've used angular
I've used view and they're all these
components in text now they're all
dealing with component trees they're
getting similar and similar slightly
different syntax but what's really
different between one of these and the
other is whether they implement a state
management container like Redux and
we're going to talk about that now so
this is kind of where most developers
are at this point a lot of if you've
done a lot of rxjs but you haven't yet
done any redux so you know a lot of us
are at this
point converging so state management is
complex it's always the code that I
wrote that was the most it sucks the
most it was the most time-consuming it
was the most buggy it was the stuff we
argued over the most and had to refactor
the most and you know I would write a
call back system with a colleague in a
project and it was great at work in
angularjs only to hear someone over the
shoulder say who at this callback system
and then they would rewrite it with the
broadcast system for angular which was
not really that much better but where
I'm going with this is there's no real
set way of doing it and everyone was
kind of doing different things with
state management and when angular 2 came
out I thought awesome everything else is
so shiny and you they'll have something
new for state management but really it's
still up to you the developer to decide
how you're going to manage your state
but there's some tools that help with it
so one of those tools that really helps
that's getting a lot of traction is
called ng rx so n jerax is a library
it's not another framework you don't get
to use of that but what n Gerak's is is
it's a way of getting Redux for angular
so Redux is a pattern as well as a
library so we can use the Redux pattern
in our angular applications using ng rx
but what's different about ng rx
versus other implementations of redux is
that it's supercharges that with our
exchange partner so let's have a look at
this Redux pattern and what's involved
let's do a lap around it and it all
revolves around this idea of having a
store or a single source of truth and
this store is read-only it's one of the
main principles and it's just a
JavaScript object like this so it's
super straightforward so here we've got
an object that has the state of the
application so here we might have say
company's array in a contacts array but
there could be lots of state in there
like this state of your UI where there
are menus open or closed the state of
your authenticated user whether they're
logged in or logged out but at the end
of the day it's pretty simple to
rationalize about because it's all in
one spot and you can actually visualize
it like this so if I wanted to get a
slice of state in my component and
people use that word slicing state I
could get a slice of the state the
company's state here which is just an
array but it could get more complicated
and then the job of this component now
has changed what I used to do with this
component
or would have been if it wanted to say
delete a company what it would have done
is it would have said okay there's a
button click to delete the company talk
with a company service it talks to your
back end comes back successful and then
right there in the component I'll do the
work
I would actually remove the company from
their array and then update the HTML but
in indirect that's not what you do or in
the reader patent you dispatch an action
to do that work and your component gets
much Dumber doesn't really know how to
do very much but ask the store for stuff
and dispatch actions so it would
dispatch an action that looks like this
it's just an object has two important
things a type and a payload so the type
would be delete company and the payload
would be the idea of the company I want
to delete so now the job of the
components not to do the delete and
who's listening for this delete well
this is the job of a reducer so the
reducers are special functions of the
only place you should be changing state
and the reducer takes this action and
the current piece of state that we're
interested in the company's States and
then it does the work it makes a new
company's array and then we have new
states and then we can update the store
with that and then we now have just a
single company in our a but I've kind of
lied to you here this is kind of what I
shouldn't have done because I'm breaking
one of the principles of redux because
these reducers are meant to be pure
functions so pure function being that
for the arguments you pass in you're
always expecting to be returned the same
value so if in the middle of this pure
function I do HTTP delete and delete I
don't know what the heck's going to come
back from that delete that could be
potentially a side-effect so I couldn't
say that it's a pure function I wouldn't
be following the pattern so there's
another library for this we're seeing
everybody use called effects so let's do
another lap here let's start again
so let's start with the store just the
JavaScript object we've got two
companies again I can get that state of
that in the component the component
dispatches in action same action delete
company with the ID but now there's two
people listening rather than just the
reducer listening here you've also got
an effect so you get that from a library
called ng rfn jerax effects i've got a
suite of different things in their
toolkit and this effect basically
handles the side effect of deleting the
company so that's what
or side effects so I can inject the
company service the effect will do the
delete if it's successful it dispatches
another action so that action would be
delete company's success now if it
failed then I'll dispatch an action that
would be delete company error or delete
company failure or something like that
but let's stick with the success for now
so now I'll close out the loop I will
take that action and the current state
I'll make new state and then update the
store so you end up with this one-way
data flow so things get much easier to
rationalize about and think there's a
bunch of benefits from it okay one of
the benefits is the tooling and the
ecosystem around it so this is the
application we write in our two-day
workshops here over the last couple of
days with our students and we write this
simple crn app and we've got an end
Gerak's implementation and we could open
the dev tools so this is a Chrome
extension it gives you dev tools this is
one of the benefits of following the
pattern and you can see here all of the
actions circled in red on the bottom
that have been dispatched since this
application started so he you've got you
know initialized the store and then even
routes we even put our routes as
dispatch action so we've got this event
log of everything that's happened and
then you've got this ad company's action
that's dispatched and then you actually
can see visually exactly the state of
your application we don't have companies
or contact we only have companies here
we don't have contacts and products and
other things because it's only this
piece at the moment but I can start to
do some cool stuff I could hit delete
here and delete a company that would
dispatch an action I can see all this
and I can debug it and then I can see
the updated state and what's really cool
I could hit the play button down here at
the bottom and it becomes trivial to
implement things like undo and redo
logic or offline storage sort of logic
because everything all the state is in
this history here so if I push that play
and we reset the state at the top here
to have a no company is just the initial
action and then we could step forward
and now add companies is called and
we've got our companies and delete
companies is called and now we have our
deleted company and you can just go back
and forth through the state anytime you
want so this has really changed the way
we do a bunch of stuff in particular
debugging I
but traditionally 100% of my debugging
strategy is console logging and
breakpoints and now probably 50% of my
debugging strategies to have this open
on the side and I still set breakpoints
in console log but about half the time
but you can do a bunch of cool things
with it so it's pretty good but we're
kind of painting a really rosy picture
here of ngrick so it definitely comes
with a parental warning it's not for
every project you know you really want
to be able to know the pros and cons and
know when it's right for which project
so what are the great things about it it
simplifies complex apps and I think
there's a really good kind of community
quote going around that says you know
njx is not good for making simple apps
fast what it's good for is making
complex apps more simple so that gives
you a big kind of hindsight there of
what why it's good but centralized state
makes everything easier better tooling
we saw some of the tooling better
ecosystem there's lots of just at the
moment we're starting to see a lot of
plugins come from the react community
and this njx library starting to get
better at being able to share some of
these things so these dev tools you saw
actually come from the raster community
so hopefully we'll start see heaps more
better tooling but there's a lot of
tooling to be able to do things like
optimistic updates so if you do a delete
you can delete it in the UI then hit the
server if it stuffs up and just undo the
UI because it's trivial so you get some
really cool features you get much better
performance so this encourages a pattern
of that container presentation or
component pattern and you can turn on
something called change detection on
push so in your metadata for your
component you say change detection on
push and what that says the angular it
says don't mark all the child components
of this component to change detection
unless something goes through its inputs
and outputs so in that sense you might
have big chunks of your component Ori
that angular won't check every time
change detection run so change section
starts at the top because dump dump dump
dump dump so down the componentry and if
it hits that component it might say well
it's not Mark's that's being checked I
won't check it so things can get more
performant and this has been one of the
drivers for some of our projects - to
take on njx and better patterns is to
get this performance when they're
bloated say you know 150 components on a
34 inch monitor much easier to test pure
functions only place you change place
stuff I love this one
favorites running tests in angular's
annoying because the first thing you do
is you mock the router then you mock all
the services you're injecting into your
component and you mock some other stuff
and you end up with at least 100 lines
just to start your tests but these pure
functions are the things you really want
to test because that's the only place
you change things and all you need to do
is go I have a function that takes two
arguments and I have a value that comes
out of it and not much to mock so these
tests become trivial to write and
developers also go I see the value in
this test because this functions really
important it's performing these really
critical things like updates and deletes
and so forth when's our bad okay it's
super unnecessary complexity for smaller
apps if you if you only have ten pin
routes or views and there's just basic
crud operations to show me the list show
me the delete not so valuable a lot of
boilerplate learning curve new devs come
onto your team there's a cost they've
got to get up to speed and understand
this new pattern and it's not so much
understanding and it's more just the
fact that it's such a different way of
programming you know it takes a bit of
time to sink in and the boilerplate oh
my god there's so much blood up late so
it's like you start your project and
you're like oh my god I'm just fighting
boilerplate fighting boilerplate and
then as your app gets more complex you
know you start to see some benefit but
at first you just every single little
thing make an action creator and make a
reducer and then you make another test
and then you've got to update all these
pieces all the time but that benefit
really starts the power cause you're out
to get more complex
so in summary LearningRx just and
observables we really think that you
should spend the time to learn them not
just so that you can get the benefits of
type-ahead and so forth but so you can
understand you know the benefits of also
ngrick switch uses it super heavily
you're all-in with rxjs with ng RX and
if you're like me you accidentally make
mistakes and say rxjs when I said ngrick
slight indirect front of our XJS because
they sound similar but you guys won't do
that ok and we think we think Redux is
great we think Ange erics is amazeballs
and we think you should use it for your
complex apps but not for your simple
apps so where to from here we think
everyone should get started going to
Australia right now because it's about
20-something hours on the plane
and and you should come join us in
endlessly Sydney it's having a really
fun time here in Oslo we are very
excited as it's our home turf
we run lots of workshops we ran some in
Copenhagen for NDC in London and also
Sydney this year we'll run some we just
ran some here so we reckon you should
get started now and we should all be
back in Australia in a month if we start
now well what's that it's my favorite
color did you say green I think great no
he didn't say green or elephants rain no
just all jokes aside don't forget to
vote on your way out so what have we had
a look at today we talked about what is
angular and we we said you looked at why
we like using angular we talked about
the fact that rxjs and modules do have a
bit of a learning curve we talked about
the fact that angular 1 is technical
Denton some strategies for upgrading we
looked at module loaders and build
systems and really recommended using the
angular CLI unless you need a word pad
guy we've talked about has great
typescript is and the choices around
ideas we looked at CSS frameworks and
widgets and we looked at how our
extraneous is going to help you with
your async code and recommended using
read acts on our larger applications
guys thank you very much for coming
along say hi to us on Twitter and enjoy
