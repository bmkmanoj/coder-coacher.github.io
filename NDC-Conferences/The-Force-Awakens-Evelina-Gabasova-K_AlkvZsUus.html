welcome to the force awakens with
f-sharp I don't even know how to like
pronounce this correctly so I'm a very
Naga Bakura and I work as a postdoc
researcher at Cambridge University in
cancer research so I deal a lot with DNA
mutations things like that and that's an
incredibly complex type of data and when
you look at it it's really hard to
understand what you are doing and even
if you fit some kind of statistical
machine learning model it's really hard
to see what's actually happening there
so this is an example of metabolic on
networks and you really can't see
anything
I can't see anything because I'm not a
biologist so in my free time I like to
play with other data
I suspect they won't be using this title
for the actual episode eight so let's
talk about star wars who like Star Wars
yeah thanks for coming you are in the
right stalk right now so some time ago I
decided well let's analyze Star Wars I
actually started doing this right before
the premiere of Episode seven so there
was a lot of hype around Star Wars so I
was thinking so what kind of data can I
actually analyze and well there are
obviously the movies but it's kind of
hard to analyze movies right so the next
data sets available Star Wars are
actually the screenplays or scripts and
there are multiple different
repositories online where you can go and
download script of almost any movie you
are interested in and they publish it
very quickly so for example the script
for Episode seven was there I think in
January I'm not really sure what the
legal status of that but if you want to
look at it you can so I looked at the
script and this is an example of a
script from Episode four the original
Star Wars and the great thing about this
is that they have a very standard type
of format so you can see that there is
some title of a scene and they always
start with end or axed meaning interior
or exterior then there is some
description of a scene and there is a
name of people speaking and what they
are saying and because we are
programmers we know that this is
actually quite easy to parse or if it
has this type of structure we can parse
it so I decided well let's look at
interactions in Star Wars and maybe I
can even extract social network by
looking at who speaks with whom in the
scenes so I went on and downloaded all
the script files of all the seven movies
right now I don't know if I will
continue with this in the future but I
have shown of them now and I looked at
them and because they are published
online they are usually in HTML and this
is how it looks and that's also pretty
nice right
like a pre-formatted HTML block with the
scene name in bold and then there is a
description and again name in bold and
in capitals oh that's easy to farce
well usually so when I first started
doing this I ended up with a bunch of
rejects s because I wanted to match all
the different types of how name can
appear in a script but because I'm
working in a chart I would like to show
you another way how to parse these
things and if you have been to Scott
washing stocks before me he was talking
about parsers I'm not doing anything
that fancy but when I looked at the
structure of the script it's actually
quite simple but I wow this is just an
example of the standard format of the
script how it looked but I want to
really write something that I can read I
don't want to deal with how it looks
underneath so what I used something
that's called active patterns in F sharp
and there you can write something like
this you just parse a screen like you
split the script into elements and then
you can just match each element here
with a scene title or a name and that's
very readable and you don't even have to
know what's happening underneath but
I'll show you what's happening
underneath this is something called the
active pattern in F sharp so when you
want to match something against some
regex you don't have to put the rejects
into a function that's actually doing
the matching you can just look at you
can define something like this this is
called the banana cleats operators so
you can say that a piece of text is
either a scene title or a name or
something that I'm not interested in and
you can hide all the ugly rejecters in
here and by the name the by the way the
rejects for names is very complex
because in Star Wars like characters are
named
you don't get people named c-3po in real
life so this had to be quite complex
because it had to match all sorts of
dashes slashes everything and I don't
care about this for me it exists are
something that it's right only I don't
want to look at it again so I can hide
it in this kind of thing so what this
does is it takes the string as an input
and then it matches it against each of
the rejects s and returns this kind of
thing like scene title and text or the
name text or word and then when I do
pattern matching over it I don't have to
care about what it does underneath and
this is readable when I went back to my
original implementation with all the
rejects is all over the place I had no
idea what's happening there so for me
this is the way to write parsers in F
sharp or at least four very simple cases
and if you want to play with a sharp
definitely look at active patterns
because they allow you to hide the
implementation details and then you
don't have to care about it in the more
high level functions so I thought now
I'm sad it wasn't the case so I tried to
run it on all my seven different scripts
and screenplays and yeah it was a trap
because some of the files have
completely different structure for
example the names are not involved are
not centered they are at the beginning
of the line followed by colon etc so I
had to write another parser for this
type of screenplays and it was much more
work as usual and that's general case in
anything data related you spent 90% of
your time just cleaning up the data and
now oh this also still has some kind of
structure because all the names are in
capitals at least you would think so for
example this one by the way the Theon
Madan it's this scary guy
but if you look at second letter it's
not an eye
it's a lowercase L I don't know if it
came from some OCR system and it just
decided that eye is lowercase L but I
answer things like this I actually had
to put in like explicit modifications
because I didn't find a way how to deal
with this systemically and that's every
time you have to deal with data so I
went through this and I thought okay now
I'm all set I have all the characters
and all the scenes it's all nice and
easy from now on well no because some
characters don't even speak in Star Wars
screenplays they are mentioned there but
they don't speak at all for example r2d2
if you actually go into the script they
say things like these like are to
frantically beep something oh thanks -
Becca doesn't speak at all so this is
Chewbacca barks command and Han replies
boy you said it Chewie no you didn't
so actually peter mayhew who plays
chewbacca i think he did a very good job
playing him because with this type of
instruction in the script like what can
you do so I decide oh when I extracted
all the names in all the scenes I
decided well I actually have to include
these characters because they can't be
worked out right you can't just have
Star Wars social network or something
without r2d2 or Chewbacca so I went on
and actually extracted also all the
mentions of all the characters in
screenplays and try to estimate how many
times would they have spoken if they
have spoken there so I came up with very
very scientific equations well you don't
have to care about this really it's
basically just scaling the number of
times a character is mentioned by the
times they
actually speak so on average actually
every character is mentioned about two
times as much as they speak explicitly
in script so I just counted how many
times let's say Chewbacca is mentioned
and waited it by how many times han is
mentioned and tried to compute how many
times cubic I would have spoken in the
script so everything is good now right
well sorry I didn't include some of the
characters because there are actually so
many characters that don't say a word
that evokes didn't make it for example
so the only ones that I included
manually in this way were r2d2 the
Chewbacca and deviate from force awakens
and then when I look at the characters
that my algorithm extracted from all the
screenplays I found out actually some of
the other characters they appear there
but they don't say a word in some of the
episodes so they messed up my analysis
again and if you have seen episode 7 you
probably know who I'm talking about so
now I decided well I should somehow
check if all the characters because
there was such a mess actually appear in
the screen place and if there are actual
characters if it's not just some
artifact of my algorithm and I proposed
a theorem that there is an API for
everything and there is an API for Star
Wars you can go to swapping Star Wars
API code and you can find an API for
Star Wars so I looked at the website and
it's quite nice quite well documented
you have all sorts of example requests
and what it returns and you can get
information on characters on starships
on planets on vehicles I think as well
everything and they have a lot of retro
libraries so when I looked at them all
our C sharp fighter our anything Java go
Ruby
huh there was no F sharp but well maybe
I can just use one of the other ones but
then no no well I'm doing this in
f-sharp let's do it properly and then I
looked at for example this is the C
sharp one and you can see that the code
is not very difficult are all just yet
unset methods and things like that so
there is not actually much going on and
this is just an example of one of the
wrappers around I think people and you
can see that's 150 lines and most of
them don't actually do anything so I
wanted to show you how we can do
something like this in fer and if you
have seen any of the FF talk some of
them mention sites providers so this
talk is partly me saying I lost type
providers if you are doing anything with
data type providers are amazing so I
wanted to show you how I can use type
providers to write something like all
the records that were there in all the
different languages in like very small
amount of code so I'll just close the F
sharp data library which contains
tighten some of the type providers and
now this is actually just an example
request to the Star Wars API and what I
get from this is some document that
basically just answered the request and
what I will do is I will just I don't
have to read the documentation I don't
have to do anything I can just take this
and create a type provider and it will
be a tie provider for a Star Wars person
and it will be a JSON provider and I
will give it the URL
evaluate this and I have basically
everything I need right now so now I can
write a function to get me information
about any person in Star Wars
so get person and I will take an ID as a
parameter and now I will just call
person load and I will give it the
request that I want and I will give it
the ID and normal brackets here
and that's it basically now I can have a
look at the first person I need to
change this into string and now I get
the information on the first person and
again it returns a JSON which is not
very readable so I can just type V dot
and get all the information here in my
intellisense including the types of all
the elements so for example I can look
at who the first person actually is so I
will look at name I know that it's a
string and it's Luke Skywalker do you
know what's the Wow let's say his mass
how much he waits
did you ever wanted to know something
like this well he weights 77 kilos a lot
of very important information but what I
wanted to show you particularly is that
basically in these three lines I have
everything that was there in the full
big wrapper and I don't have to care
about it at all I don't have to read any
documentation write any methods this is
all I need so I actually went on and
wrote a full wrapper around the API and
you can see it's not very imaginative
code either
it's just defining the type providers
and defining some of the functions and
that's it that's everything and on the
same day that I discovered the Star Wars
API I actually just went back and sent a
pro request and now there is an F sharp
wrapper thank you and in case you were
wondering other random things about
about Star Wars you can show you some
more information for example do you know
what's the most common eye color in Star
Wars characters
you always wanted to know this right so
the first most common eye color is brown
so for example Yoda has brown eyes mmm
we knew the second most color is blue
and the third most common color is
yellow so Darth Vader has yellow eyes
all the info important information and
you can also see for example in Episode
four the original Star Wars Luke
Skywalker once walked into a prison cell
and Princess Leia says aren't you bit
short for a stormtrooper so we can see
so it's actually Luke Skywalker a bit
shorter than average Star Wars character
or not it's very easy I just get his
height which is 172 centimeters and I
also downloaded information on all the
other characters and it's 174
centimeters on average so yes Luke
Skywalker is shorter than average so she
was right so all the important
information that you always wondered
about right so well let's move on so if
you want to look at it it's on my github
and you can get to it from the suavely
website as well and they have play with
it it's a lot of fun information so now
what I had right now when I ran all the
code that I was describing I had
characters I had the scenes and I knew
that all the characters are actually
appearing in the films and then you know
a Star Wars Bros bought by Disney and
then I came across this analysis and
they actually analyzed two thousand
screenplays and they were looking at how
much women characters speak and how much
male characters speak so I and they were
just comparing scenes and how much
screen times they get and they
specifically looked at Disney and it was
sort of depressing because in almost all
the Disney movies men speak much more
than women etc even if it's about
princesses and things
like that and because I had almost the
exact same data I thought well maybe I
can replicate this using my Star Wars
data set and again type providers
because what they did in this analysis
is that they went onto IMDB extracted
the list of actors playing in the
individual films and then they looked at
them if they are male or female and I
can do exactly the same thing with my
tie providers because there is not only
type provider for Jason there is a type
provider for HTML as well so and I am
DBA HTML tie provider now so let's just
open everything again and as you can see
I'm also giving it just the URL of some
page describing a film and this is
actually from episode 7 so I will load
it now and let's I don't even have to
look at the website now I can do episode
7 dot and I know that there are some
lists and some tables so I will look at
the tables and the tables are these I
don't have to go through the website at
all
I see everything here in F sharp and
this is all the code I really need to
access it so I can look at the cast and
they have the cast in credits order
verified as complete and here I have a
nice printing function to actually look
at it properly so these are all the
people that play something in Episode
seven and for example that you know that
Daniel Craig plays a storm trooper he is
somewhere here yeah Daniel Craig plays a
storm trooper and he's uncredited so
this gives me quite a lot of information
and again it's in my rifle I don't
actually have to look at the website and
group go through it so with a bit more
code
I put together this graph so this is
comparing episode 1 to 7 based on what's
the percentage of scenes where what's
the percentage of dialogues with men and
what's the percentage of dialogues with
women and actually sorry I put women and
robots together because they are like
other genders because otherwise so it
would be even worse
so episode 7 indeed has more women
speaking but still almost 70% of the
dialogue is man so better the worst one
is actually episode four but enough of
this I had right now as I said all the
characters and their relationships and
where they speak so I decided to put
together a social network by putting
together like characters that speak in
the same scene if they do they are
connected by a link and I can visualize
this and because well what do you do if
you want to visualize something nice and
put it on the web you use JavaScript so
I went for d3.js which is an amazingly
powerful library in JavaScript for a
visualization you can write anything
there the downside is that you can write
anything there because it's so powerful
that you can't really learn it you have
to go online and look at various
examples of what people did with it
before so that you can copy it and put
your own data into it
anyway I don't really want to use
JavaScript and as I said I want to do
something everything in F sharp here so
there is this new project called fable
so it's using Bebo so this is the
current logo and that allows you to
write code in F sharp and translate it
into JavaScript
I think it's called transpiling is that
the correct term so it's a transpiler
and it's actually really neat it's a
very new project
I think it started about six months ago
and yeah here on the right-hand side you
can see the code in JavaScript from an
example on d3.js that I just downloaded
from the web and you can see that most
of the code on the left-hand side it's
the code in F sharp that's actually
calling the d3.js library and you can
see that it's very similar actually
right well instead of wire you have
light but otherwise all the function
calls are very similar and sometimes you
have to do a bit with types but it's not
very painful and it allows you to
basically just translate your JavaScript
code into f-sharp and you can call any
functions from F sharp and have all the
type safety and everything and I just
wanted to show you also D translated
code so this is how it translates the
code into JavaScript and you can see it
for example this is calling something
called the first layout of networks and
it's actually very readable like there
are no like thousands of underscores
everywhere and you can go there and see
what's happening and that makes any
debugging so much easier so Ivan
actually went on and there's all the
things in Fable and if you want to play
with it there are many examples online
by playing games from f-sharp
translating it into JavaScript
there are also some examples with nodejs
and it's really nice really so let's go
to the actual social networks that I
promised so this is the social network
of all the Star Wars movies puts
together and because I promised
JavaScript here it is so this is an
interactive visualization of the Star
Wars movies let's make it a bit bigger
so you can see that the big black node
is actually Darth Vader
and I guess you can already see some
patterns emerging whenever you are
working with data try to visualize them
because that gives you so much
information so I guess right now you can
probably guess that on the left hand
side are the new prequel episode and you
can see that the social network is a
mess you can see that there are so many
nodes and it's very dense then in the
center are the original episodes and on
the right hand side is the episode 7 we
can even look at the episodes
individually so this is the first
episodes of the prequels and now you can
see it's quite densely connected it has
several main characters I try to color
them so this is for example qui-gon this
is Anakin this is Jar Jar and when we
compare it with the episode for the
original Star Wars you can premedia to
see some difference right the network is
much sparser it has quite a few like
only a few major characters and they are
connected to each other and if we
compare it with force awakens the social
network is bigger but there are not that
many characters as in the prequels so
that already tells us something about
the structure of the story and how
understandable it is probably and we go
and go even further we can quantify
quantitatively compare the different
episodes so for the first thing that you
can think of is how large networks are
so this is just a graph showing number
of characters and these are only the
characters that speak at least in two
scenes and only the characters that are
explicitly named so if someone is just a
stormtrooper I didn't include them there
and yeah episode 7 has the most
characters and then the original
episodes have fewer about 20 main
and then in Episode seven in jumps up
again up to 27 so let's hope they don't
continue with this trend otherwise they
will get to the episode one territory
and if we don't want to go there and
then there are various scientific
scientific methods to compare networks
and the first one though it's called
density which is it sounds like fancy
like a density of a network but what it
really does just tries to compare the
number of connections that are in the
network with the number of connections
that could be potentially there so if
you want an equation this is it just
divide the number of existing
connections in the network by the number
of total connections that could be there
and when we look at this actually the
episode 1 and 2 have the lowest density
because they have a lot of characters
that are only vaguely connected and they
have all these debates in the Galactic
Senate that are not very interesting and
actually interesting that episode 6 has
quite a high density and that's maybe
because I didn't include the e rocks in
there and episode 7 actually has about
the same density as the original
episodes and so does episode 3 and
actually if you look at IMDB you will
see that episode 3 has the highest
rating out of the prequels
so maybe density has something to do
with the quality of the story as well
and you can look at other measures one
of them is the clustering coefficient
which tells us how like how locally
connected the network is and how much
the characters actually speak to each
other so if you look at this green guy
he has three neighbors and you can see
if the three neighbors are all connected
to each other as well or not so for this
one there are two of them connected for
example for this one all his friends are
connected so that tells you how
connected your networks are and in terms
of the story this basically means
if the story is following one character
that just interacts with other people
and the other people don't talk to each
other then that will have a very small
clustering coefficient and if the story
follows a group of people that talk
together and interact with each other a
lot then it will have a large westering
coefficient and this is the equation we
don't actually have to care about it
very much I don't want to go into
details but if I plot it for all the
different episodes again episode 1 has
the lowest clustering coefficient
because there are all these weird
characters that are not really like
talked very much and what's nice is that
episode 7 has about the same clustering
coefficient as the original episodes and
actually episode 3 here has quite a
small clustering coefficient as well
just interesting it tells us something
about the story and I'm not claiming
that small clustering coefficient means
a bad story I think it may make sense in
something for example if the main hero
is going through some obstacles and
meeting other characters that are
helping him on the way but don't
interact with each other that can be a
good story but I think in Star Wars it
actually tells us something about maybe
how the network is structured and
actually I think in this case it roughly
correlates with the quality as well and
then we can look at local
characteristics in the network so a
first one the most basic one is degree
and that's just by looking at how many
connections a character has in the
network so for example this guy he's
very important because he has six
connections in this network quite small
one but this guy is less important
because he has just three connections
and that tells us something about
centrality of characters in the social
network so this just represents how many
characters each one of them speaks to
and yeah it's just basically number of
links that are outgoing or incoming into
an Earthman
to a note and now I want to compare it
with another measure of centrality in a
network which is called betweenness
because there are many measures of
seeing who's the most central in a
network and the degree just tells us if
someone talks to a lot of other
characters but betweenness tells us how
important a note is for communication in
the network so I will explain again so
if we look at this guy and these two
other guys the only way they can
communicate with each other is through
the green guy because they don't know
each other directly and and these guys
on the other hand if they want to talk
to each other only one half of the
communication would go through the green
guy because they know each other through
some other person as well so I can for
example ask
so if Princess Leia wanted to talk to
Jar Jar Binks who would she have to go
through to pass a message to him so that
tells me how important a character is
within the story like because some
characters may be important just one in
one part of the network but if character
speaks to a lot of different characters
across the whole episode and that means
he's probably more important to the
story so again this is the equation and
now it's a bit more complicated because
for each pair of nodes we look at the
number of shortest paths between them
and then look at how many of these
shortest paths go through specific node
and we sum it over all different pairs
of nodes in the network and it's already
quite hard to compute right because you
have to compute all the shortest paths
between all the nodes in your network
and then look at how many of them pass
through to note that you are interested
in and if you are doing anything with
data there is always package for it in R
so there is library in our code I graph
and
yeah if you are interested in between us
there is a function called between us
and now if you are as I was working in F
sharp you can do something like this
just go i provider our provider dot i
graph and call the betweenness function
from r and again you get intelligence
and everything and this makes anything
like this very easy because you do all
the heavy pre-processing in language
that you are more comfortable with or
that's a bit more safe than our and call
the algorithms that are already
implemented there and i actually do this
quite a lot because r is a nice
programming language but just for data
science if you want to do any general
programming then it can get really
really painful and in F sharp you get
all the safety of type inference so it
will help me when I was writing my
parser for example and I just knew all
the heavy data science in R and I can
pass data to it directly from F sharp so
let's look at the centrality so who is
the most central in Episode seven let's
say so actually the person who's having
the most connections is Paul he's one of
the resistance pilots and that's because
he talks to a lot of people across the
whole network and he talks to all the
other resistance files as well and there
are quite a lot of them and the most
10-second central is Finn because he
also Nick talks to a lot of other people
and then hundra Beca
and v v8 and for VBA this is just an
estimated number because I didn't find
him in the screen place as I was
explaining so does this tell you about
something about who's actually important
in the story sort of but you might be
missing some of the main characters in
this so this is actually a bit Venus and
now you can see that suddenly kylo Ren
and Tre jumped up a lot and that's
because they are more important to the
actual code
they are more important by connecting
different communities within the network
so for example kylo Ren is very
important because he is one of the few
people that talked to let say han and
chewbacca and Tre but he also talked to
smoke which puts him into the center of
the network a bit more but also Paul
talked to him which already gave him
quite boost in between us as well so
this tells you a bit more about who's
important in the actual network and if
now you might be asking so who's the
most important in across the whole Star
Wars right so before the new episode
this is just post operating that he's
the most central so who is the most
central overall across the whole Star
Wars universe before episode 7 it was
this guy because he was talking to quite
a lot of people in the prequels as well
as in the original trilogy little
although he appeared physically in only
the first one of them and also what I
did in this analysis when I got this guy
it was because well I just looked at the
names in the script screenplays and
actually there is they're making a very
big distinction between Anakin and Darth
Vader because they never appear in the
same scene so they appear like two
completely different characters and when
I added a new episode and also merged
Anakin and Darth Vader still Darth Vader
is ruling the galaxy he is the most
important one everyone else is just
lying there dead so also I made a quick
sample with neo4j so if you want to
learn something about neo4j you can I
have a link at the end you can go there
and play with it because it's a very
nice data set and you can just extract
connections between people
what's important here is that you
actually understand what's going on
because all the people have names that
you recognize and that makes any
learning so much easier than if you have
just some anonymous customers or
something like that you can understand
what's happening so this is for example
just looking at characters that play in
the same movie and how they are
connected to each other and computing
the degree degree just within a single
movie and you can see that neo4j is
actually quite readable because here I'm
just looking at names of characters that
appear in yeah I'm looking at a pistol
for the new hope and I'm looking at
characters let's talk to other
characters that appear also in new hope
and looking at number of scenes they
spoke together with in so this is how
you would do it in neo4j and you can
play with it and it's not just
completely a toy example I did something
similar by analyzing Twitter and I
actually analyzed the social network
around F sharp D F sharp Software
Foundation which is the home of open
source F sharp and it has the Twitter
handle F sharp org and I looked at all
the other Twitter handles that are
connected to it and then I was looking
for the most central people there and
actually this is the order based on
degree you can see that the first one is
don't sign who is actually the author of
F sharp so if you are an alien and come
to Twitter and you say also who is the
most important in C sharp you can do
something similar I don't know you'll
get but it tells you something about the
actual network and some meaning about it
and the second one it's I think it's the
official Microsoft side of F sharp the
fifth one is the official side of a
community of F sharp and the first one
is Tomas who's speaking tomorrow if I if
I'm correct in the morning so if you
want to see
some important people in FF Twitter says
you should go see him and these are
information from November 2014 so it
might have changed but the problem with
analyzing data from Twitter is that it
takes an awful long time to download
because there's all the rate-limiting so
I didn't replicate it afterwards but I
might do that because it tells you
something about how people communicate
with each other and what's happening so
if there are any changes I can see it
probably and also another example oh
this is quite a famous example in
network science and it was a company in
Hungary where they had two factories and
some headquarters and they were having
problems because there are always these
rumors spreading in the factories and
they had no idea why and what's
happening because the headquarters they
were just issuing orders and issuing
messages but there are always rumors and
they were not true so they actually
called in these olden days they called
social scientists who talked to people
and said so who do you talk to if you
want to get more information about
anything and they named a few people and
this is the social network that they
constructed from it and what's
interesting is that well you can
probably see that I think the pink one
is to headquarters the other one are the
the factories and the most important
note is here it's not in headquarters
and that was because there was this guy
who was doing health and safety and he
was actually traveling around the
factories and talking to everyone so he
was the most important person in the
company for communication so now they
knew that if they want to spread some
kind of information they have to talk to
him because he will spread the correct
information to the others and what you
would do now you wouldn't get a social
scientist to talk to people you would
just explore the email
that are sent within your company or
slack messages like who replies to whom
things like that and because you have
access to all this information you can
actually do that and then you can look
at these simple measures like sand
between nests and degree centrality
things like that and you immediately get
some information that might be actually
useful for you so as I mentioned you can
do social network analysis and it's
actually a lot of fun and yeah you can
look at how you communicate with slide
on slide who sends emails to whom and
you can also analyze supply grades like
if there is a blackout in some part of
your network
what parts will get affected as well so
network science is actually very
important and at the end here I have
biological networks and that's actually
the area where I work because I look at
how genes interact with each other like
what protein binds to what regions of
DNA and then I can see what's happening
how they are interacting with each other
and this is not really not just a toy
example because I was reading a paper
the other day and they were actually
looking at the betweenness
and I was like ah I know what
betweenness is I did it in Star Wars and
here they were claiming that genes that
are important in cancer that are tumor
suppressors or oncogenes that they have
higher betweenness in the biological
networks and because I was analyzing the
Star Wars networks before I knew almost
exactly what it means
in terms of the actual network because I
got a feeling for it by looking at
various on dataset so I want to
encourage you to actually play with data
and because you get more of it than just
like some fun facts about Star Wars and
right now I went through quite a lot of
things I went through script parsing in
a functional way you saw the active
patterns
I was calling R and Java scripts from F
sharp it's I think that's actually the
future of data science just call
everything from everything because there
are different tools in different
languages
I was showing tight providers I showed
you the HTML tie provider and Jason type
provider and there are many more there
is one for sequel there is one for I
can't even think of all of them well I
use the CSV one because CSV is the
format for data science and I would
really like to encourage you if you are
interested in data science if you have
seen some of the talks on our for
example then you might be thinking well
maybe I should go into data science or
start with fun data sets because by
analyzing them you know what's happening
there and you get insights when you
actually see some of these algorithms
applied in real world and this is I
think a great way to learn data science
and if you want to know more about a
sheriff I've put some links there I have
the slides online already and these are
just some of the Star Wars resources
that I put together so yeah you can read
all the scripts even if you are not
interested in any quantitative analysis
you can play with the Star Wars API you
get all sorts of very important
information and all the information that
I was showing you is actually on my
github and you can even play with the
social networks and I saw some people
doing actual social network data science
playing with it and trying to for
example overlay the different episodes
against each other to see who
corresponds to whom in the social
network in episode 7 etc and I have some
blog posts about this and as I mentioned
I have a neo4j demo and play with data
this is actually the website where I put
the slide so go to every neji comm slash
Star Wars talk and they are all there
and thank you are there any questions
so any questions I can actually see you
properly I can't see anything
well if there are no questions then it's
time for lunch I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
