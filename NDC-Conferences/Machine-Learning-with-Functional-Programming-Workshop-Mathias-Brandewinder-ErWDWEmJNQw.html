I'm doing a workshop on folks all
programming and machine learning the
gist of the workshop is that we spent
two days taking hands on data set and
extract the data sets from scratch and
building predictive models on a variety
of things going from can we predict if
the wine is going to be any good to how
many people are going to ride a bicycle
so this is very applied very hands-on
it's a fun occasion to learn a language
the gift shop which is not obvious to
everyone and it's also a great way to
explore machine learning that by talking
about it goodbye doing it hands-on
workshops are great because you have the
decatur time one day two days with
somebody who's been doing it before you
can take specific questions and you can
explore together go more in depth when
you have a specific question and it's
completely a next way to also learn
together like you're by being all
together in the room you can see what
other questions of other people might
have and it's simply a very fun
experience to have as a group hope to
see you at the workshop tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
