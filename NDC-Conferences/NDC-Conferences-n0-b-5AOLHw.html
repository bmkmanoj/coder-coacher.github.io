ever spoken at I mean come on
which conference has a hundred 50
speakers in one place it's just amazing
and the facility is awesome the speakers
are great the audience are wonderful
thing I love everything about MDC it's
my 60 here it's my favorite conferences
of everything I get to go every year so
I love the people I love the food I love
the venue it's just a fantastic place to
go I think it's the general flow of
people and conversation
within the breadth of all the topic so
it's not focused on one language or one
vendor you have everything from
JavaScript and functional programming we
need to be stuff to testing and agile
and process related stuff is just
honestly I've been to a lot of
conferences in the last decade and DC is
by far my favorite Commerce
there are several things that I like
about NDC it's a great conference of
course all the great speakers that are
coming is a really big brain trust if
you you don't want to mean
but I like how its organized with the
food all laid out really good food as
well and that's that's a cue that I
guess many conferences can take from NDC
it's the fact that when you're stuffing
your brain all day you need to actually
also get some really good intake of food
the conference that helped launch my
speaking career they gave me a chance
and I've been no trouble you girls
presenting because of it it is just for
me is just the funnest conference in the
world because the caliber of speakers
some good Aussie results here I think is
very good it's just a great conference I
would say an earlier today me a night
this is like a developer playground here
there's just smart people and great food
and awesome things to see and so much to
learn and yeah they have great sessions
really good speakers and a really fun
party
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
