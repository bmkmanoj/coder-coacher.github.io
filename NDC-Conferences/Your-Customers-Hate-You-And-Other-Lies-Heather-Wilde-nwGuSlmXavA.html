your customers hate you and other lies
so this is my bag slide hate doing it
but if you don't talk about yourself
then no one else will so here I am a
double CTO of a company called twit and
Rocketeer I've been doing customer
experience design for about 20 years now
professionally and I am currently the
only female Advisory Board Chair to an
engineering school in the United States
which is pretty darn cool I think and I
was a founding employee of a company
called Evernote that some of you may
have heard of in an early employee at a
company called Spirit Airlines which is
a small airline in the United States
which is actually the number one most
profitable airline in the u.s. right now
I was voted 2015 female executive and
mentor coach of the year and I received
an award from the US government for my
work in helping schools helping STEM
education within the schools so I really
am passionate about teaching and
education and helping more engineers
come into the pipeline because as you
know there's a big shortage of that
right now so we're working on that and I
also write for Inc and Forbes and tech
deco so you've probably seen some of my
articles as clickbait sorry about that
but somebody's got a right um it might
as well be a CT alright so so yeah so
thank you for coming to my talk this is
my first time at NDC and I'm really
excited to be here so starting off with
one of my favorite people of all time
Bill Gates
it's like he actually when people think
of customer experience they really don't
think of Bill Gates they think of Steve
Jobs right but Bill Gates is really
amazing and this quote really says it
all like because your unhappiest
customers are your greatest source of
learning and because they will tell you
what you are doing wrong you know
what you're doing right because you are
the designer you are the engineer you
are the person that has the vision of
your company but when you are not paying
attention to the the customer feedback
that you're getting then things are
going to go terribly wrong so if your
customers are telling you over and over
and over again that one thing is just
not working out for them then your
customers are going to go away so if
anyone here remembers Microsoft Bob yeah
there's a reason that that product only
lasted three months out in the open even
though they spent multiple years working
on the project so you have to listen to
the market once it's there so we're
gonna go right into our lies and truths
here so products exist to make designers
happy right we all make our products
because we want them we think of our
products as our babies and we work
really hard for them wrong products
exist to solve customer needs we our
customers in the first place I mean we
are making products for ourselves as
customers but we're not our only
customers and a lot of times we forget
that as we're sitting and making
products we're examining things and
we're forgetting to actually ask other
people what they think of this beautiful
thing that we're making and that is a
huge point of failure so if we are never
taking into account what anyone else
thinks about the things that we design
that's a big problem
so here's a nice little example in the
non tech world of where product failures
happen so this is a original kind of
John Deere tractor now and this is New
Zealand when John Deere tractors came to
New Zealand
a lot of people started to get into
accidents some actually died because the
tractors when they went up the hills
they would fall over and the reason for
that is there was a high center of
gravity
in a narrow front wheel base and the
hills were unsurfaced rough and Hills
and John Deere had never taken into
account that humans actually used these
tractors and land isn't always flat but
they designed it because they're like oh
well where we are in Iowa where the John
Deere Factory is it's flat so of course
our tractors are going to be working for
that so once they've gotten feedback
from a whole bunch of people trying to
sue the company because they were dying
and getting maimed in things they
designed an entirely new tractor that
had a roll cage and a low center of
gravity and wider wheel bases so it
doesn't look that much different than
the original tractor but it actually
took into account the customer feedback
and guess what people stopped dying
people stopped getting hurt this is
actually a really extreme example of
something because as designers as
product designers were generally not
creating products when we're designing
software that people are going to die
from but some of us actually create
hardware that can cause problems
for example if you're creating a
technical product like a life alert
thing that goes to Alexa if that fails
then you have a big problem on your
hands because people are depending on
you for literally their lives so if you
don't listen to the customer feedback
then you could end up with a big lawsuit
so good design always accounts for human
capabilities in other words good design
counts for the lowest common denominator
and as engineers we hate that we always
want to think about the best the person
that's doing the best the the the best
person on the team the smartest person
the person that thinks like us well in
general when we create something goes
out into the world and we don't know
who's going to use it so we have to
assume that
the person that's going to use it is
going to be in the least worst scenario
at any given time and that means that
you have to assume that your thing is
going to break because somebody is going
to be pushing the wrong buttons in the
wrong sequence all of the time so you
better have some good QA testers for
everything yeah that are good at pushing
the wrong buttons all the time line
number do your customers hate you I hear
this all the time from my engineers
because they must hate us why else would
they be barage in us with such terrible
feedback all the time one time I got an
email from somebody that was every other
word was a curse word and it was just
like so berating to my company and when
I replied back within five minutes of
receiving this I got an immediate
apology saying oh I thought I was
writing to a computer I had no idea it
was a person so people don't hate you
they wouldn't be using your product if
they hated you they actually like you
and the fact that they're taking the
time to write feedback about it to write
in and that means they like you even
more so think about it if you're using
something like Yelp what makes you write
a review you either really really love
the thing or you really really don't
like the thing but you always are trying
to help improve it you have to be
incentivized one way or the other to
make it to incentivize you to write so
these people that are writing in are
your best source of information now I
know this is small writing but here's a
great example of customer feedback so
when somebody wrote in saying that they
were out that their sneakers were of the
wrong they had a defect Zappos which is
a u.s. shoe company sent this wonderful
email back the
if I got that I would be freaked out but
it basically said oh my gosh we've given
you a credit and we've given you a UPS
label to send it back and we've given
you a coupon for a new thing and
unfortunately we couldn't give you new
shoes because we don't have those
anymore so this person anticipated every
possible scenario that that the customer
would have needed and handled it in one
email right there if the customer is
upset because of something that's
happened what do you think is gonna
happen when they get that they're not
gonna be upset anymore I mean they may
be upset that they didn't get their
shoes but how could what else could they
do
now they've got 15 dollars to spend on
Zappos on something else which they may
use now or they may never use but at
least they got their money back and they
can go buy their shoes somewhere else
customers buy based on how you treat
them what do you think about this one
now this seems like it's a the seems
like something that would be true right
but like if you treat someone well then
they're gonna want to come back it's how
the customer feels they're being treated
that's the key so if you think you're
doing everything right but the customer
doesn't then you've lost them
so what you have to do here is very
interesting you actually have to pay
attention to something called
empathy and situational awareness which
as engineers we are very bad at we have
to read between the lines of what
they're actually asking for of what
they're telling us what they want and
then we give them that back they're
gonna pay more to get a better
experience and that's key because
if you don't have customers you don't
have anything your business doesn't
exist
now I know a lot of us work for startups
and technically startups don't need to
make money right but eventually we do
and we better have customers for that so
all of these things are to say that
customer experience is something that
you need to start thinking about from
day one and that's how we actually
started to scale Evernote it's it's so
important that from the very beginning
of the eight of us that founded the
company my role was to make sure that we
had a very strong QA program a very
strong customer support program and
community engineering to make sure that
we were paying attention to all the
analytics of what people were doing what
they wanted what they said they wanted
and test the feedback from that customer
service is a waste of time
oh because customer retention just 2% is
actually the same as decreasing costs by
10% so if you spend money on a customer
support team even just one person that
can actually raise the value of your
company 10% so and this is from a Forbes
study of the Forbes 5,000 this is
companies that are in the top ranked
companies in the world they found that
just this small focus on customer
attention decreases their overall costs
so because if you don't have to spend
money on customer acquisition costs
because you now have loyal users then
they are going to actually sell your
product for you they become something
called raving fans has anyone heard that
term before
yeah and raving fans are things that you
really need if you want to grow your
business now something like Microsoft
you have product evangelists we have
many of them here like Jennifer Marvin
this morning wasn't it wasn't her talk
great
amazing and she's she helps to make
people raving fans for the company she
is one herself but without a backbone of
those people around the world you have
to develop them yourself and that can be
difficult when you're starting from
ground one we all have heard the
problems with airlines around the world
if you're not doing it right then you
have a little bit of a problem for
example here's the original thing that
this guy rode through the worst airline
ever they lost my luggage and can't
track it down now that was when it was
sent and then
sorry for the delay in responding eight
hours later our Twitter feed is open
please DM your baggage ref and we'll
look into this well they they don't
actually refer to what he said there's
they're not trying to solve the problem
and then they say this DM me or suppose
is what he says and they say you can't
if they're not falling but he said he
has been following them the whole time
so they didn't check so what's the point
of having a customer support channel
that's not actually available to people
when they need them because an airline
is a 24-hour thing and if they're only
open 9:00 to 5:00 GMT when it's a global
airline how is that a useful channel and
I've actually called Airlines where
their customer service line was not 24
hours on the phone either and or not
open weekends so how is that useful if
you have a customer service channel if
you decide to open one you better man it
or else your customers are going to get
very upset and if you do decide to do
support over a public channel like
Facebook or Twitter
you better man it or else you end up
with a very public thing like this
because 76% of customers again from the
Forbes study look at customer service as
a test of value to their brand so if
they are constantly testing you they're
constantly
to say how are you doing is this a
company that I want to stay with because
there's so many choices out there
there's so many people that could
possibly be there and that you can use
because I mean just like for British
Airways how many other airlines are
there that you could possibly use tons
lots of competition a bet for your
company there's a ton of competition as
well so what you need to do is make sure
that you're giving them just a little
bit more than the other person and what
could British Airways have done there
they could have checked to DM the guy
and taking that right offline right away
or they could have a channel that they
actually are Manning 24 hours a day
here's one that people really don't
understand as well customers need
support to help them what do you think
about this one guys
do you need support to help you
seventy-five percent of customers these
days solve their issues on their own
especially us I mean we are very smart
people right we we use Wikipedia for
stuff we look things up we we create our
own wikipedia pages once we find the
answer and we're like hey and here's
what to do so we're will write blog
articles about things we find the
answers to stuff we're smart
we're happy we're good at this thing 69%
of Millennials say they feel good about
a company when they can solve it
themselves so what do you think you need
to do to make people happy what could be
just a little bit better than what most
of us are doing something that a lot of
people don't think about is actually
putting out good release notes I know I
know
that means you actually have to comment
stuff in your code when you're checking
it in and have a technical writer that's
paying attention and actually talk to
that technical writer and tell them what
your code meant but if you put out good
release
if you actually put out a blog or some
kind of thing that allows the customers
to look up what has changed what's
available and what they can do to fix
things and if you put in even though
this seems ancient a community forum
where people can actually talk to each
other about the product in one place
then amazingly people will find they
feel that your brand is better than
other brands one of the things that we
did it Evernote was when we started the
company we started a community forum for
it and it's now one of the when you
search for Evernote it actually like all
the answers for Evernote questions come
from our forum people along the way had
asked questions and things but it you
our forum actually ranked higher than
our knowledgebase so we actually let our
customers start answering each other's
questions and that actually pushed a lot
of people away from having to write into
support so it was very helpful to us
because it was a very little low
monitored thing we even had evangelists
moderate the forum's so employees didn't
even have to take the time to do that
because you build raving fans and you
have them do that kind of thing and
Microsoft does the same thing so if you
are a company that you start to think
about that you start to pay attention to
customer success it doesn't even take
much effort on your part it doesn't take
much resources and the customers will be
happier for it
so if you're doing this wrong though if
you're not paying attention you end up a
little bit of a pickle for example this
is from a an ISP in the United States
they were sending out a well-meaning
service announcement to people during a
hurricane they sent this to people who
had no internet access or power to tell
them how to deal with the fact that they
had no internet access or power and it
gave them a nice webpage that they'd set
up so nobody got this until after their
power came back home
it was well-meaning but they hadn't
thought it through and they got made fun
of for a bit about that so when you're
when you're trying to do a support
channel make sure that you're actually
paying attention to what your customers
need so they thought this was great and
they actually tried but another ISP what
they had done was they went onto the
television channels and the radio
channels and they let people know that
they were out in the areas fixing things
and getting things ready here is another
kind of thing that you don't want to
happen this is somebody on Virgin Media
which we're all familiar with the person
says ok I can't get through because my
phone is dead so the person has no foam
and he only has chat so the person says
I can't assist you with that online
please call our customer care team my
line doesn't work that's my issue
ok but I'm part of the sales team I
don't have it please call our customers
care team over and over again so rather
than transferring him in chat or trying
or being incentivized somehow or
empowered to help what they did was just
keep telling them over and over again
that they need to call this number and
they can't so that is poor customer
service so even though they actually had
a channel set up and probably even had a
chat for support and he was in the sales
chat they had no way to transfer him to
the other and this person wasn't
empowered to help them so you have to
make sure that you're your agents are
empowered to do things I love this one
so when I'm setting up things I always
have a naming scheme for email addresses
and apparently this one did as well and
and they're their agent as you can tell
oh sorry as you can tell this one
in another language this because he this
is actually real it doesn't seem like it
is but it is you can email this and this
person is there so but it's a completely
different language and it doesn't mean
what this means to us there but this
definitely does and that guy wanted to
change but because it was their naming
scheme at a core hotel the guy couldn't
get it changed so so when you're doing
when you're and that's actually an
example of internal customer service as
well you have to remember that you're
supporting internal customers as well as
your external customers especially those
of us in IT we we have to pay attention
to the fact that we have to be good to
our people so remember that the way that
you're checking is by constantly
surveying by paying attention by reading
between the lines to what people are
asking for and understanding why they're
asking for these things and it's there's
such a cost that's associated with this
because I mean if it's an internal
customer a lot of people aren't engaged
in their work and that is absolutely
going to fall back on your external
customers because if you're not
incentivized to do well then you're
going to just kind of not you're going
to a little bit half-ass it
and then make the people that you're
working on not pay attention to anything
and they're and they're going to feel it
so if you're just going to be spouting
out your snippets of whatever to
somebody over and over again without
actually reading what they're saying
then the customer is going to feel that
and they're not going to feel valued and
it actually costs a lot more to acquire
a new customer than to keep an existing
one so why not spend the time the little
bit of effort to keep your existing ones
rather than send them on there
because when they're gone they're gone
they're really gone so there is a news
reporter in the United States his name
is Dan Rather and I met him a couple
years ago and he told me this story he
was on an airplane and he was asked to
get up and move he was in first class
and it was on an airline where he had a
the elite status and he's dan Rather
which he's a news legend in America and
so but the person didn't recognize him
and not that it should matter he's an 80
year old man he's asked to get up and
move to the very back of the plane in
the back row because they wanted to make
room for some crew that was getting on
board that needed to move well if I were
the gate agent I would have put the crew
in the back not in the first-class and I
certainly wouldn't have moved an 80 year
old man but he being a very nice man he
got up and moved and didn't make a fuss
out of it but he asked them he's like
why are you moving me I've paid for
first-class I I was sitting down already
and now it's kind of embarrassing that I
have to get my bags and moved to the
back of the plane and they and they
wouldn't give him an explanation
they just made him move and said that
was that so the fact that he was then
telling this to me a stranger a week
later after it happened for no apparent
reason to speak it was just an anecdote
that he was telling me is proof that
when you have a bad experience you tell
people about it all the people about it
and he said that he was never going to
fly that airline again and the reason
that he was telling me this was because
we were now on a completely different
airline that he'd never flown before and
he said that he was now going to fly
this airline all the time because his
old airline had treated him so poorly so
so this is and somebody in here actually
knows Dan who Dan Rather iffen is like
yeah the fact that Dan Rather was
treated this poorly is like wow so if
you leave a company you're not gonna go
back how many of you have gotten food
poisoning from a restaurant yeah do you
go back there
yeah I won't go to Olive Garden ever and
I know this is being recorded sorry
Olive Garden but you poisoned me too
many times yeah so one of the ways that
we know how customers feel about us is
the NPS score is anybody using NPS in
their company yes so the Net Promoter
Score is a really great way to
understand how customers feel now we get
about the same amount of conversion in
this as we do from anything it's only
about one percent of customers that fill
it out but one percent is good enough to
do a t-test right if we're doing data
analysis so we can we can extrapolate
how our overall customer base is doing
based on the few people that are filling
this out
so we understand that if we've got if
we're in the green or in the yellow then
we're doing really good if we're in the
orange we're not doing great at Evernote
we were consistently 9.5 and higher and
that is amazing for a tech company in
Silicon Valley most of them are like 7
and 8 or lower but one of the reasons
that we were there is because and I like
I like to think it's because I had a
background in the airlines because I was
able to see what was able to be done
well and what was not done well so I
actually scaled the company of Evernote
as an airline even though it was a tech
company and it's still like it's still
done that way so you you don't actually
need to exceed people's expectations and
that's that's the biggest lie of all all
you need to do is give people what they
expect because nobody does that no one
at all is giving people consistently
what they expect so if you can deliver
consistency and when there's something
that goes wrong if you apologize for it
and you're consistent about your
apologies and what you'll follow up with
then you're doing better than 90% of the
people out there and people will
appreciate that
all they want is for you to be
consistent you don't have to give 110
percent you just have to give 80 percent
most of the time and then for that rest
of the time you have to give a hundred
percent because if you screw up then you
better fix it so here's a little bit of
a framework on how to make sure your
customers really won't hate you now
according to Graham Crosley who's from
brand reputation which is a big customer
experience company he says that a
customer that has a good experience will
typically tell three to five people but
a customer with a poor experience will
tell 20 or more so if you extrapolate
that to the web how many people do you
think are going to hear that bad
experience like how many of you don't
buy something on Amazon or actually
Amazon's not here on like how many of
you do not go to a business if it's got
one star reviews yeah if I generally
filter for 3 stars or more when I'm
doing things and just ignore anything
that's lower and that's how we do things
that's just how the world works now so
if we're if we're paying attention to
people that we don't even know telling
us about their poor experiences then
we're actually like this is 100% true so
if you're doing something just one thing
wrong then it's gonna be on the web for
ever and you can't get rid of it you
can't no matter how many times people
will tell you they can pay to get your
Yelp reviews removed you can't they're
lying
it's there's nobody that can get your
your things scrubbed from the web so
it's out there the better thing to do is
just never get them up there but even if
you do everything right customers may
still leave because you
just not be the product they want
anymore something may happen and you
could release something and it's just
not the same just last night I was
talking to somebody and he's like oh
evernote doesn't have two factor
authentication so I'm not using it and I
was like we released two-factor
authentication in 2012 he's like oh I
didn't know that because I stopped using
you in 2011 so it's it's a thing that
people will leave and then never come
back because of one thing that they have
and even if you add all the features
that they want even if you are exactly
what they need then they don't care
because you've lost them and poor
experiences as I said are shared with at
least 20 different people so if you just
thinking to yourself when was the last
bad experience you had how many people
did you tell how many reviews did you
put did you put it on Instagram that you
had like the worst beer ever or
something did you I'm so I'm the person
that makes everybody taste the thing
that's really bad and I'm like oh you
have to try how horrible this is and and
then we all have the shared experience
of how awful something is and then we
all tell a million people about it and
it becomes a fun thing but then it's
actually pretty damaging to wherever we
came from so it's it's a it is
absolutely true that we are social
creatures and we are going to tell
people about the negative things now
there's one thing that's interesting
about this the value of a positive
review is actually more sticky than a
negative review because we forget
quickly about the negative things people
have already forgotten about half the
things that United Airlines did at the
beginning of the year and they're flying
them again but they remember if like an
airline saved a cat ten years ago and
they're like oh my gosh remember that
airline that like brought the dogs over
from the from Iraq yes because we we
like to remember the positive stories
and they stick in our minds better
be aware of both your verbal and your
nonverbal so when you are here here's a
quick question and I'm gonna I want you
to raise your hands for this one how
many of you think that the most
important thing in communication are the
words that you use okay how about your
body language okay how about tone of
voice all right so you're mostly right
yeah it's so the words that you use are
only about 7% of of communication body
language is 50% of that and if you
aren't actually looking at a person then
how do you get to body language across
well that's a very difficult thing if
you're on the phone you can actually
kind of sense if somebody's standing if
somebody's breathing heavy or something
but if it's just an email then you're
stuck with just tone and how many of us
have gotten in trouble without trying to
decipher tone over an email or a text or
something yeah so what you have to learn
to do is train yourself again with that
thing called emotional intelligence that
all of us are kind of terrible at right
so it's it's a very important thing to
learn to read the words behind the words
the what somebody's actually asking for
and the way that you start to do that is
you pay more attention to yourself so
you pay more attention to the way that
you are communicating for example I am a
very handsy communicator I make sure
that I speak slowly I use my hands for
things and I am always trying to use the
clearest easiest most succinct word for
the things that I'm trying to use so
even though I may not sound as erudite
I'll always as I actually am I make sure
that more people understand what I mean
because I'm using the most concise word
possible
and that comes to the next one
communicate clearly and concisely with
your customers who here really loves to
read long emails exactly so why would
you write them to your customers they
take forever to write they take forever
to read and by the time and if you're
trying to send somebody troubleshooting
instructions for example they're lost
halfway so send something in plain
English in bullet points and in the
clearest thing possible even if it's
going to take multiple back and forth
for something then it's better to do
that to make sure that they're going to
actually pay attention and be able to
follow the steps one way that I like to
help with this is to send videos of
things if I'm trying to make sure that
things get across with screenshots if
I'm trying to troubleshoot with somebody
so I can show them here's what you need
to do and this if I'm in front of
somebody I will actually walk them
through stuff and if it's a product like
the John Deere tractor in the beginning
then what they actually did was they
were getting all these reports they
didn't understand it and then they
finally went out to New Zealand and saw
the the people with the tractors and
that's when they finally understood so
you cannot haven't how many of you have
said to themselves but it's not a bug
until you can reproduce it yeah that's I
say that all the time
well it's on you to reproduce their
problem it's not on them so you need to
figure out what their experience is and
the way you can do that is by helping to
walk them through it in the clearest
concise way possible now this is one of
the favorites practice the 30-second
roll yeah yes the 30-second role is and
this is good not just for customer
experience but for every part of your
life wait 30 seconds at least before you
respond so when you see something come
in read it
assimilate it and then then start to
formulate what your response will be
because if you start typing right away
to the person that's cursing at you or
if you start answering right away that
that person that's upset in front of you
then you may have a little bit of an
emotional response there but if you wait
and you start thinking logically about
what it should be then you'll be able to
respond in the proper way you'll be able
to empathize with the person and you'll
be able to see their their side because
if you don't then see the part about
things ending up on the web and people
telling at least twenty people and be
considerate of other people's needs it's
it's kind of like the Golden Rule right
we want to be treated well so why don't
we treat our customers well too like we
want them to stick around and even
though they're telling us that
everything that we're doing sucks right
now that it's not working
that we developed it in a poor way why
don't we actually see through the
feedback and figure out how to make it
work because there again they're taking
the time out of their life and that's so
immensely valuable their time why don't
we actually take the time to listen to
what they're saying and that leads to
building genuine caring relationships so
one of the best things that came out of
me working at Evernote was the
relationships that I got with my
customers they would correspond with me
all the time sometimes they would
actually start to write feedback emails
even though there was nothing wrong or
they didn't have anything to say just
because they wanted a person to talk to
and I became I started to get to know
them really well there was one person
that I found who was a homeless person
and he was using the product because it
was the only place that he could store
his things
because it was an online repository and
he had no place to store anything so he
started he was doing research and he was
storing all of his pictures all of his
online searches and everything and then
I started to notice that there were
other homeless people that were using
Evernote as well from libraries and by
getting to know this one person I
started to get to know the entire
homeless community of a town and now in
the town where I live I help with the
homeless shelters there and help them
understand how to get university degrees
even though they're still homeless
because there's programs that exist for
them and I bet every single one of you
has some kind of a story like this where
they've met somebody through your job
that has just taken it to another level
and if you haven't then you will if you
open yourself up to the possibility of
that kind of thing
I know that companies like Microsoft
actually have volunteer days that they
use for their employees so that they can
go out into the community and and start
to get to know not only who the
Microsoft and users are but just just go
out to volunteer because it's something
that makes you a more complete person so
if you build that caring relationship
then it'll actually make your job more
enjoyable and the products better and if
your customers are valued then that
information that they give you becomes
more valuable because it goes from
somebody telling you everything sucks
you better fix it to this thing your
product is awesome it could be better
here here here and here and here's
screenshots and here's exactly what it
is and they they start to do more of the
work for you and the conversation
changes because when you're talking to a
friend about your product they don't
want to tell you things are terrible
they'll couch it in a compliment
so if you if you have a genuine caring
relationship with people that value you
then they will give you honest feedback
in a nice way that you can accept and
that's actually one of the most valuable
things of all because you want that
feedback to come you want more feedback
to come from people because if you don't
have it you don't have customers you
want people talking about your product
and the more people that talk about your
product the more successful you're going
to be and like that's actually their
real secret behind this if you have no
customers if you have no one sending you
any feedback then your products doomed
to failure so if you have people telling
them that you telling you that you suck
then you're on the right track so with
that I'm going to open this up to some
Q&amp;amp;A and anyone that has seen you before
knows that if you ask a question you get
a rubber ducky so if you would like a
driver ducky then please ask a question
and if not then you're welcome to not
get a ducky or to go but I thank you for
coming today and does anyone have any
questions we also have a microphone if
you do or ask a question so just wait
for the microphone to come to you if
you're asking anything anyone don't get
the duck if you don't ask her anything
they're super cute all right my question
is in the intro notes to the talk you
mentioned pilots of products based on
customer feedback so one specific issue
we are dealing with in my company where
we have an Android app and we receive
review from our users is that we don't
know whether this is an outlier or
should we give it or not so we have any
stories related to that yes so one of
the things that I like to do is for
every you generally because you're an
Android product you know how many
downloads you have so you know how many
installs you have for every person that
you get feedback from make it a
multiplier of x2 how many people are out
there actually reporting something so
for example it Evernote we had a hundred
million users so I would assume that for
every one person reporting something it
was about ten thousand people with the
same problem so figure out what that
multiplier is for you and and then
determine how much effort you should
spend on that problem I think I would
always spend more time on the people
that are saying something is wrong if
for example if you release something and
suddenly you notice that your app
downloads are way down you've screwed up
a lot so figure out what the people that
care enough to tell you are telling you
and then fix that right away for example
one time we released at Evernote we
released an iOS version where we'd
completely changed the color scheme to
green on green on green and it was super
pretty it was a beautiful flat design it
was really pretty and and it passed all
the accessibility tests if that's what
you're thinking was the problem it was
not what was the problem was color
blindness red-green color blindness
people couldn't see so even though it
was within the right frame for
accessibility we didn't realize that
there were that many people over a
certain it was a combination of that and
also the light gray text that everybody
uses that light gray font with the green
was almost illegible if you have reading
glasses and we had a lot of people in
our demographic that were over the age
of 50 and had reading glasses so they
couldn't on their screens read their
text anymore so they just gave up and
started using the computer version of
Evernote and that lowered our metrics so
but they couldn't tell us what was wrong
we just had to notice from the metrics
that like the app installs were way down
and the app usage was way down
and then finally one person was like
dudes I don't know what you did but I
can't seem my stuff anymore can you put
in like a magnifier or something
well the magnifier wasn't right but what
we did was we allowed people to change
the color schemes and that fixed it so
it was it's understanding your what your
metrics are who your demographics are
and paying attention to outliers like if
if one only one person is telling you
they have a problem again it's not a bug
unless you can reproduce it if like four
people are telling you you have a
problem then it's something you really
need to look at sure you don't want that
all right anyone all right
a software developer most of the time
I'm always struggling how to explain to
the users thank you for the feedback
that's not currently on the roadmap we
appreciate your input
it's but I mean it always start with a
thank you and and like letting them know
that I mean and and like saying it's not
currently on the roadmap it leaves it
open to the fact that you would be
considering it in the future so even
though like you're giggling it at that
it's I mean I I swear that my hands
still automatically can type we
apologize for the inconvenience faster
than anything else and again I'm a CTO
I'm an engineer but like I can still no
matter what we apologize for the
inconvenience so thank you for the
feedback look all of these things should
be so commonplace and that's another key
thing I refuse to let any of my agents
use snippets for customer service texts
even though we had pre-written things I
made them type every single one of them
out because I wanted them to feel it
inside every time they were sending
things so that of course made us a
little bit slower sending things out but
that wasn't a metric I cared about I
cared about our NPS score to make sure
if people were actually happy with what
we sent and sometimes we had typos and
actually that people found that to be
more human because they knew that it was
a real person typing a real response to
them so again making sure that you
acknowledge that they've sent you
feedback let them know that you're not
gonna do anything about it right now but
it may be something that you could
consider in the future could be probably
not but like giving them the hope that
if they stick with you their ideas may
actually get in there is something that
that could be and realistically most
ideas that people suggest always end up
in the product somehow anyway sometime
at Evernote I think 90% of the customer
feedback ended up in some way in the
product by the time I mean over 10 years
it took a while but I mean if it's a
good idea it's gonna get in there if
it's not a good idea then thank you for
the feedback it's not currently on the
roadmap no one else so you know obvious
right you talk about Amazon
so actually correction is the Amazonia
is actually here I'm curious about what
you want to talk about Oh so Amazon has
a really good customer service in in
that they they have 24-hour so they have
they have chat that you can access all
the time they do automatic refunds for
people even if there's nothing wrong
they always side with the customer they
they send you return shipping labels
it's very similar to Zappos they're in
fact Zappos is an Amazon company now but
Amazon is is is a company that even if
you're not buying something directly
from Amazon but from an Amazon partner
they will make everything right so say
you get a shipment of something from
Amazon and out of out of the the whole
thing something broke and it stained the
the rest of the the things in your
shipment they won't they don't need you
to send it back they'll give you a
complete refund and they'll ship out
another thing for free and they just do
that or they'll notice that something is
going to be delayed so they will before
without you even having to call them up
they will order another one for you
through a different distribution center
that it'll get there faster and then
they'll redirect the original package
back to them
they they have an amazing amount of of
customer service stuff built in but it's
just part of their whole ecosystem to do
that and when you guys fully get the
full Amazon experience you will see like
in in Vegas for example we have we have
a big distribution center for Amazon
right there so we get delivery within an
hour for most things and yeah yeah so I
don't even need to leave my house most
of the time which is great as an
engineer I can just okay I would like
some coffee and some yogurt and some
strawberries all right great thank you
Amazon it's awesome hey anyone good all
right well thank you guys for coming
this was my first ever talk at NBC and I
really am excited to be here as I said
before I do love feedback there are
feedback cards outside I hope you all
picked green like the NPS score but you
don't have to if you know if you didn't
feel it except I understand you can
reach me and if you want to add any of
these methods I am very active on
Twitter as well and I am here for the
another I'm gonna be doing the
spectacular failures talk tomorrow night
and I'm doing a talk on anticipatory
design tomorrow and I am really looking
forward to both of those so thank you
guys for coming and have a great
conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
