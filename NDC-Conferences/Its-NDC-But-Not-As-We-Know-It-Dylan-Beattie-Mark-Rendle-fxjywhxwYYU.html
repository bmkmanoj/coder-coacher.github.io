two days of solid technical head Pro
content some you probably learn
something a little bit later so welcome
to monads in depth in a short Haskell
and closure now we've we kind of said we
do a thing and then we didn't write it
and this so we panicked and when I this
get some topical slides and get some
people who think we've organized
something and we'll put them all on
stage and we'll get them to talk about
stuff and we'll probably get away with
that and let's face it we didn't put any
description or anything on the talk in
the in the program so no one's going to
come anyway so I'm curious all of you
who've come here to watch a talk with no
description and they're like what are
you expecting to see what what are you
hoping to get out of this okay well
you're happy we've done that already
so yes everyone welcome relevant to be
doing for the next hour we've picked a
series of you know stories of bad
technology things that are in the news
innovations that have hit the headlines
recently software hardware technology
culture all these kinds of things and
we're just going to talk about it or
joke about it explore some of the ideas
we've got some contributions from the
people on the panel here and anyone has
any questions at any point anything you
want to ask us anything you think we've
fun to talk about
just shout we'll do it and then the
other thing we got another talk and then
we have the party this evening so first
thing we are going to talk about do you
know maybe be a bit less rude and
introduce our special guests the first
thing we're going to look at is our
special guests mark would you like to
introduce our special guest so on my
side over here I have Jimmy Bogart
creator of Auto mapper for which he is
very sorry which is so good that
Microsoft and are trying to reinvent it
on they that's the mark of success for
any open source project is when they go
now we need a shitty half-baked
implementation of this built into Visual
Studio so congratulation sorry oh
lightly hey you've made it and L I'm
waters sorry L water's at the end and -
oh no introduce yourselves and say what
you do
hi guys this is my second time at NDC
clearly the best conference circuit
anywhere it really is fantastic I am
this is a very fancy title the director
of strategy it's simply accessible which
means I get to dream up total
and then the rest of the team has to
figure it out so that's my role and we
want to have an inclusive and awesome
world for everybody thank you on my side
of the panel filling that would you like
to tell us who you are what you do sure
my name is Lina I'm a professor at Delft
University of Technology where I
research programming for kids also do
anything right government racket tackle
project
not yet and beyond Cooper coop tell us
who you're on what you boo overwhelmed
and next to a professor and director
strategy I know right exactly so yes I
mean people I'm an architect for a
company called huddle might think I'll
tell you about even though it's not my
time the same as I work an open source
library called brighter for all of your
secrets and tasks you needs you can
check us out and you donate call reach
out to that certainly yeah person okay
so first thing that we're going to talk
about is the the biggest technology
event that is happening anywhere in the
world at the moment which is peplum
whose turn the pad come right you're
wrong I want you all to put your hands
up and then sort yourself out with
tickets immediately after this talk so
who's going to happy to be
awesome so he's coming yeah there we go
so popgun is the official NBC after
party after party it's at the scotsman
down in town tomorrow night tickets are
still available online it's lightning
talks from some of the speakers here
it's a kind of irreverent hilarious
funny take on technology and what it's
like working in tech there is free food
there is free beer it's a really awesome
party get tickets come down join us
tomorrow evening
basically the speakers have created a
slide deck there's 20 slides in the deck
the slides go for 15 seconds each they
don't get to control what's happening
with the slide so they have to try and
keep up it's actually it's the most
complicated kind of talk to write
because you have to plan everything out
or you just make
very long pauses because you've worked
out the next slides not there but there
it is and then you can carry on but no
it's enough some time and you just drink
beer and laugh for people getting it
wrong yeah come to pepper clumps so this
happened and anyone recognize this but
they don't get this on their own screen
okay good
learn was that a hand at 9-under nobody
from the British National Health Service
in then so yeah this was the ER one a
crypt which was a ransomware worm that
last month basically spread throughout
computer networks in Europe and it took
what phone telephone occurred got
completely knocked out it took out a
massive chunk of the British Health
Service and it didn't effect British
Airways they managed to go down all by
themselves for an entire extended
weekend
yeah British Airways had an upgraded to
Windows XP so they weren't vulnerable
but you know this made headlines and it
got a lot of press and there are a lot
of people saying you know why was the
the NHS still running on these old
outdated machines and it generally I
think you know raped a lot of
interesting questions about you know
computer security and vulnerability now
one of the things I think is interesting
here the the message that pops up here
says and you know sure we guarantee you
can recover all your files but you have
not so enough time you can decrypt some
of your files for free thank you for
that and it says we have free events for
users who are so poor they couldn't pay
in six months
now if the National Health Service is
not the most impoverished user you know
thinking oh really
we've got 800 thousand hospitals and no
money can you please decrypt our files
so where any of you on the panel we
affected by this
did it affect any of your work systems
when are you having you know hospital
appointments or trying to make a phone
call in Spain when this was going on
tumor you gorilla with with big
enterprises its weren't you yeah so most
critical infrastructure is built on
really rock-solid hardware and software
like Windows XP of course so there yeah
there were a few there were a few
manufacturing facilities in the states
that did go down because they smartly
connected their critical infrastructure
to the internet on Windows XP unpatched
since
last millennium perhaps so that happened
we have we also have a lot of large
clients but I think they're all
wrestling America has its own kind of
virus which is not really populated here
that's a different thing that you see in
the news a different kind of virus much
harder to get rid of but exist at would
be it but I think it's I think it's true
I think of all the industries that we
work with airline industries actually
have the most legacy software and when
you consider the impact of that given
that there's actual physical safety
involved in some of their
decision-making it's a pretty
frightening aspect it actually did
trigger conversations we don't really
provide any kind of service or help in
that area but it did trigger
conversations with a lot of our airline
clients
yeah then amuse me most about this story
was that it was the tent was stopped by
some 20 year old Cerf Batman korma
wasn't essentially you they were looking
through the code and so there's a domain
there and so it hadn't been registered
I'll have that then and then stop the
attack by accident so we are dependent
now on national infrastructure on
twenty-year-old surface in Cornwall
which is which is a plan I guess because
the other thing with this is that the
actual payload that or the method of
distribution was dumped as part of a set
of files that were stolen from the NSA
which the NSA had discovered this
vulnerability in Windows and rather than
do the responsible thing and say to
Microsoft hey there's a vulnerability in
Windows that you might want to patch in
case we get attacked by some of our
cyber enemies they decided they would
hang on to it in case they needed it and
then someone like leaked a whole bunch
of things from the NSA and so America's
national security compromised America's
national security which is an
interesting approach to national
security so the rest of the world we
call that irony but I don't think they
have a name for it in America and you
know it so that when you're old guys I
think ladies call it government clipping
the guy from Cornell who actually
stopped the attack you know how the the
British media rewarded
they dug him punished his real name they
published this photo they sent reporters
who were like in and nothing on his
ex-girlfriend's door and all this kind
of stuff it was actually pretty
sickening you know to see the way this
guy's been doing you know undercover
security research as Twitter account
doesn't his real name because you know
you do security you potentially upset
some people with questionable motives
and and you have the British tabloid
press may you know that in date their
souls like yeah let's tell everyone
where he lives
that'll be a really good way of saying
saying thank you for this so the little
be fair he's lucky he wasn't a woman
because otherwise they would have been
looking for dodgy pictures and yes the
British tabloid press is not something
repairable anything like I can
understand about these ransom demands
that they demand that you paid them in
Bitcoin and it seems like the average
user is really going to struggle to
actually pay anybody in Bitcoin Ryan all
right yeah I mean yes in 300 dollars
worth sorry what was the question so the
question is it subjective any one of us
have both coins well the place internet
money no I don't have any shell coins I
saw something recently that said if I'd
bought like a thousand dollars worth of
Bitcoin in 2010 I would be a millionaire
now which is kind of depressing yeah but
if you bought a thousand dollars worth
of dollars you'd still have a thousand
dollars oh yeah and actually that would
be worth more than the equivalent pounds
now so why should upon the four thousand
dollars worth of arrows yeah I don't
have bitcoins I have the pound which is
a very hard stable currency feminize I
have no need for that so to frequent it
my husband's a really big fan of
cryptocurrencies so we have a myriad of
unusual kind of start-up currencies
crypto
Bitcoin is one but that's like old news
to him and there's a few others but
recently I've been reading about instead
of IPOs ICS do you guys are you guys
familiar with that where people buy into
it using by creating their own currency
and they even have of course you know
wherever there's an idea there's an
attorney nearby to help you make that
work right so there's a law firm that
will help you set up an IC o----
and it's the way a lot of people are
thinking about instead of venture
capital it's a much more sort of
egalitarian way for people to kind of
opt in to being almost a shareholder and
they're helping fund software apps
before they actually you know have to go
and do rounds of funding and I kind of
like that idea because it's sort of for
the people in a way until of course that
law firm gets involved but otherwise
it's really interesting
and speaking of law firms getting
involved areas represent funding let's
talk about uber yeah so yes uber the
ongoing pinfire and how much are they
having is it three billion they've had
in funding and yeah so who has anything
they wanted to hear about uber actually
I got one thing to say you know we're
talking about vulnerability and Airlines
and I was talking about uber and and if
any sort of the keynote yesterday I was
talking about GPS and researching that I
did a lot of reading about how GPS works
and Newark Airport in New Jersey they
put in a GPS landing system so you know
big passenger airliners and it just kept
breaking like a plane would be on final
approach and suddenly all the
instruments of your haywire and they'd
have to land it using in a visual
recognition and it turned out that this
was a guy who it was a delivery driver
and his company had put GPS in his truck
and he didn't want them to know that he
was going to this bar and he's supposed
to be working so he brought a
hundred-dollar GPS jammer from Radio
Shack and when he went in Captains bar
off the Jersey Turnpike was knocked out
air traffic control but the GPS signal
that we get from the satellite is as
weak as if you're trying to read a book
in London by candle light and the candle
is in Rome that's how much energy
actually makes it through so it's
actually trivial to jam these kind of
things so every time you know something
like like uber or traffic control you
know these systems they rely on on GPS
and it's interesting to realize you know
the faintest whisper of signal is enough
for you to get your phone out your
packet and go yeah in order a cab and
hope that they don't then track my
location for the next 10
for how they know exactly where I'm
going after I get there so I think of my
favorite part of this ruber story is how
much the uber company talks about how
much he's matured over the past year for
a 40 year old man oh my god I don't have
much to say I don't have a leather
jacket and I don't need to worry about
any of this I think it's really really
interesting however many companies but
especially uber is presented as
disruption where it's almost fake news
what they're doing because they're
driving down the price because they
because they got three billion in
investment and then the plan is just to
bankrupt all competitors and then you
monopoly it's not disruption at all as
far as I can tell that is the the
Silicon Valley BT model is get somebody
to pay you money until all your
competitors have gone bankrupt because
nobody was giving them money and then
you can Jack your prices up assuming but
with three billion dollars you can make
your company last long enough to
actually do that you idiot
exactly the only thing you have to do is
not be a complete fool and turn everyone
against you and they can't even do that
exactly and I mean the guy who they've
actually fired over this Michael
whatever his name is no I wanted to say
elphic but that was a guy called booming
in including you and this is the one
that said if you have more ladies on the
board then that will lead to more
talking yes yeah ladies they be talking
and shopping but you know I mean quite
apart from the fact that this guy has
been a sexual predator around the whole
of Silicon Valley for the last 20 years
he's the guy who went let's go into
China and that completely tanked I mean
everything this guy has touched has
turned to absolute crap and yet it takes
this to finally get the guy fired and
he's just going to walk off and get
another position at some other Silicon
Valley company the whole thing just
needs to we need Lex Luthor
we need Lex Luthor to come along with
his nuclear warheads and just blow up
the the San Andreas Fault and the whole
thing
fall into the sea and and then we'll
have Arizona Bay like Bill Hicks used to
talk about oh yeah what's also
interesting I think an uber story is
that the role of social media and there
was one female engineer that said these
are all the things that happened to me
and at least one of the things that's
positive about this story is that a
similar thing happened at github
maybe three years ago where there wasn't
also humanly saying well it's all
here and then nothing really happens in
the public view of github but now in
uber because it's an accumulation of
things at least people are taking her
story seriously and there's some damage
done to this company which i think is
it's good compared to a few years ago
when these stories also happen and this
is happening for decades of course the
upside is people are taking it seriously
and probably you will also be fired we
do want to do a little bet on how long
you will still be the CEO of you where
I'm taking some money for that so we're
actually going to do it's going to be
one against one who do you think's going
to last longer
Travis canonical Trump go front
accumulator that both come by Christmas
and we've cancelled Brett said that
would be lovely
well that would be the best okay a
little video for you now you to watch a
short film about health and safety it is
terrifying as our world becomes
increasingly digitized so does our
ability to connect with it imagine if
you could search your surroundings the
same way you search the web using
existing cameras and advances in AI we
can now find things and people in the
real world in real time and take action
to improve safety and well-being
when a dangerous spill occurs in a
chemical plant cameras recognize the
incident information about the spill is
instantly shared with the people who
need it the most
enabling them to protect other employees
from coming in contact the hazard and
clean it up
this technology can also help keep
people safer in hospitals patients
recovering from heart surgery are
limited to how much they should observe
themselves when someone exceeds the
prescribed level of activity a nurse is
alerted
what's more the location of the closest
wheelchair is identified so that the
nurse can quickly get the patient seated
and face this technology is also useful
in an environment like a construction
site where people who need specialized
tools are spread out sometimes across
multiple floors using cameras already in
place this technology can identify a
specific tool as well as the closest
authorized person who can deliver it
saving everyone time and keeping the
workflow moving the digital and physical
worlds are coming together to help make
everyone more safe secure and productive
and we're bringing the edge of Microsoft
cloud to any device because you really
run our whole soul is connected to the
Internet I don't know about you but I
for one you know bow to our new
Microsoft corporate computer vision
overlords I mean that technology is just
so not open to abuse what could possibly
go wrong with computers monitoring
everything what disturbs me is that as
far as I'm aware many accidents come
from people walking along looking at
their phones but but now it says if I
work in industrial park I must walk a
lot looking at my phone the whole time
or all deserve void accidents that
doesn't seem that's going to work very
well there's really only two problems
two failures that this would have right
people and software other than that it's
fantastic I think about the fact that
the people who would be that they put in
this video are the people least likely
to adopt new technology and new ways of
working and you think we're talking
about security risks and everything
hospitals
construction zones I can't imagine that
they would be say upgrading straight
from Windows XP to something that's
practically like they are in the use of
the
yes you're being too negative I see lots
of opportunities here you think of all
those power plants that will run on XP
still we cannot hijack their computers
well their song and their wheelchairs
like the NHS is apparently very open to
decide to stuff but another hijacked all
the computer with our computers but they
really can do without wheelchair that's
why they've started patching Windows XP
again they're pre loading this and to
all those machines
it's Fanta and did anyone here ever in
the 80s he said showing his age play a
role playing game called paranoia yeah
where the the dungeon master equivalent
was like the computer and the computer
wanted you to be happy
and you just had to be happy all the
time and even just this is the thin end
of the wedge that ends up with someone
saying to a computer make humans happy
all the time and the cookie raisins are
very southern
the machine has detected you are
depressed report to the processing area
for a mandatory fun that's that is where
this ends also good barrel recognition
rhythm so there are two things I notice
in this one when did you notice to look
in the faces when they saw the
notification for the barrel that they
all knew exactly who spilled it drag ah
Darrel spilt barrel again and anyone
eyes I noticed there is not one single
Windows Phone and any of those devices
they like that so they know to yeah this
is the feature they're under stones yeah
no I have to be realistic so yeh at a
greatly less woman yeah and so yes
please may as a list of election and is
still Prime Minister so freeze may has
left an election by winning Jeremy
Corbyn won an election by losing we
still got the same government although
we don't actually have them anymore to
reason a who has repeatedly denied she
does you terms has gone on record as
saying I got us into this thing and get
us out of it if that doesn't sound like
the textbook definition over you turn I
honestly don't know what is and and yeah
we live in interesting times and none of
the things that's interesting is how
government think they
and stop terrorism by banning end-to-end
encryption does anyone have anything to
say about that I did the other day that
apparently the chief conspirators in the
Tory party looking through a place to
resume Boris Johnson others so the
journalist keeps saying I got a look at
his whatsapp messaging and I could see
what was going on
so I'm suspicious that Teresa Mays real
objective is actually to prevent people
in the Tory Party you want to stab her
in the back communicating secretly about
about their chances and he didn't tear
up the terrorists at all I think my
other favorite thing about about Teresa
is that because she's doing a bad job
it's going to set women in politics back
decades because it's pretty bad men in
politics before it's good times before
or now or men in politics is doing a
smashing job this is this is complete I
mean it this is a typical case basically
David Cameron a man made a complete and
total mess of things and then left it
alone and expect to the woman to clean
up for it there's a name this is called
this is a thing it's called the glass
cliff that if there's a situation that's
almost in rescue Abul that they put a
female leader there say I'm having a TED
Yahoo where any young wasn't doing very
well on mower Samara went there so it's
a job that no one really wants to take
and then it's celebrated as an
achievement for not we had a female CEO
or we have a female prime minister but
the situation is so dire that they're
not going to do it well anyway it's the
same but the thing that I mean we also
have a Home Secretary amber Rudd who
said that we need to get people looking
at this end-to-end encryption problem
people who understand the necessary
hashtags and and I'm thinking amber rods
doesn't know what hashtags are and
doesn't understand anything about
encryption but yeah and they seem to
think that if they can get whatsapp to
put backdoors in so that they can read
whatsapp messages that they will then be
able to track terrorists because
terrorists will continue to use whatsapp
whereas of course if terrorists know
that they put a backdoor into whatsapp
then they're not going to use it they
can use signal or
telegram or one of these other services
and if it comes down to it they'll just
write their own because it's really not
difficult to pull an off-the-shelf
encryption library and you know signal
our and write your own encrypted
messaging application that the
government doesn't have a backdoor to
and that then made me think
I reckon they've already put a backdoor
into whatsapp and all this kerfuffle
about whatsapp saying no we're not
putting in a backdoor we're taking a
moral and principled stand is just a
smokescreen so that the terrorists do
carry on using whatsapp which there is a
backdoor in so that Teresa can read
Boris's messages about stepping over in
the back well there's actually a
situation where we could where we could
do something I mean what Microsoft is
doing with crazy AI in the workplace but
we can educate all our friends and
family about what end-to-end encryption
is it's not that difficult to explain to
people that we know so this is something
at least a situation where that we could
resolve slightly by making sure that
more people understand what encryption
is and isn't so maybe that's a takeaway
that we know what it means we can help
people understand I try to explain it to
my mother-in-law I don't I don't know
the necessary hashtags you just know
that resume is one of those people that
has the password written on the
whiteboard didn't you say something
about instead of banning and in
encryption it was about banning lorries
and then I would actually I solve the
problems for this you know so slightly
more serious note we've had these tuned
terrorist incidents in London where I
live in the last month where somebody
has driven a you know tire truck into a
load of people on a crowded street and
you know this last thing people they
drove a van into a group of pedestrians
and then jumped out and started stabbing
people and I'm thinking how did people
by vans and knives before we invented
encryption you know clearly this is the
the problem here but you know you could
ban vehicles in crowded areas a lot more
easily than you could ban crypto so we
already licensed vehicles
you know you have to have a certain you
need to prove your identity to a choir
one the government keep track of where
they are if you have a vehicle that's
unregistered you're already
breaking the law we have cameras in
London that will track the movement of
vehicles and say whose car was it where
did it go who did it belong to was it
supposed to be there you know and there
are millions and millions of people in
London who don't even have a driving
license let alone a car it isn't already
in the Magna Carta though you have a
right to lorry now you're thinking of
the Texas edition of the Magna Carta -
yes that's right - a truck you have the
right to a pair of those those what do
you call them truck nuts oh you have a
right to barbecue you have the right to
bear arms you have the right to arm
bears you know but now seriously if you
want to prevent incidents where people
are using vehicles as weapons have a
serious conversation about not letting
anyone who wants to drive a truck into
the middle of London you know why do
they need to do that if you could solve
the problem by getting uber they just
take over all the trucks in London yeah
how do you radicalize a self-driving
truck you know maybe that's a big
question for the next generation so it's
always the case though with public
figures especially those are kind of
behind the time is to recognize they
look at the problem the wrong way right
it's not a technological problem it's a
human problem and ultimately no amount
of the encryption or encryption or
anything technological that people do to
stop any kind of radicalized terrorist
behavior is going to work because
ultimately it starts back way before
then when it comes to people and people
that's hard right and that's messy and
that involves more investment on
people's time and that's why you know
look for the easy fix and we'll fix the
next problem after that you have to
remember this is people who think that
banning end-to-end encryption is the
easy fix it shows you how much they
understand of that and it certainly
can't be we just keep dropping bombs on
them that can't be what's going on now
of course not all right maybe if we can
get Microsoft to do the make sure people
a happy thing and then they'll be able
to a sort of solution I do I think that
a solution the average put a computer in
charge this one Windows XP yes I'd like
to run innovations if we actually as we
went on ms-dos 6 5 was better six or so
hipsters
let's say that you have an opinion on
ms-dos fibers prepare okay so let's move
on let's move on think about happier
something happy and positive which I
thought was awesome so did anyone see
this which did the rounds a kindergarten
teacher in the United States sent a
thank-you note to the producers of the
new Wonder Woman movie and it's list of
things she says on Monday a boy was
obsessed with iron man told me he'd
asked his parents for a Wonder Woman
lunch box this girl had her parents
revamp her beauty and the beast'
birthday party in three days because she
had to have a Wonder Woman party there's
a girl refuses to listen to you unless
you address her as Wonder Woman as the
boy who threw his candy wrapper on the
floor and a five-year-old girl screamed
don't pollute you idiot that's why there
are no men into mascara just because you
know the Wonder Woman movie is out it's
done incredibly well spoken box office
records and you know DC finally seemed
to have worked out how to make a
superhero movie that isn't a flop you
know what do they have they had green
lanten did anyway actually watch green
lanten yeah I watched that movie twice I
watched it on a plane and it was so bad
that my memory erased any recollection
and then I watched it again halfway
through I was like no I did see this
it's really that bad I mean the
Christopher Nolan Batman films are okay
especially Dark Knight because that was
that was awesome but they were also very
pretty and everything but yeah and then
Batman vs Superman how can you make that
bad how can you take Batman because how
can that be a bad movie but you did it
they played with me he did it yeah what
I obviously obviously Batman is going to
win I'm getting angry I'm at the
slightly serious point so as the parent
of stepparent two couple mixed-race
children when a boy want to go there is
something incredibly powerful about them
seeing representations people look like
them so when in Star Wars The Force
awakens came out Tyra is the oldest you
know he finally saw a hero that looked
like him on the screen and it has a
powerful effect and nd the youngest
loves right wandered around being raised
by days
and you know you when you are the
beneficiary like I am of white male
privilege it's very easy not to
understand how powerful that can be to
see people isn't like you and so you
know that I don't know whether one
woman's good movie or not but actually
for people to get representation in a
heroic role the women is you know
there's obviously 50 percent of the
world that can appeal to right and and
it's ready genuinely good that people
are actually trying to take this issue
on seriously because you know people
need representation so there's a there
is a related story to where a movie
theater in the states had a female only
screening of wonderful women only yes
women only screening those courts
stirred up all the men's right activists
out there which is just hilarious by
itself who who were like we didn't have
a men's only screening of you know Iron
Man Singh things like that but it wasn't
the first time that said the drafts have
done this they actually had one a few
years earlier didn't rimmel stripper
movie with its mighty Mike Magic Mike
they had one with Magic Mike and littler
complains because I think it's really
interesting because I think I think this
is a fantastic character I think it's
fantastic for being able to show and
represent strong women I look forward to
the day when people aren't having that
discussion and where it's because it's a
good movie and and maybe because the
character is really good I do think
though that looking at Marvel characters
I think that they've shied away from
some things and they're still kind of
chickenshits because there's some
fantastic gay superheroes I don't see in
movies are Quicksilver and I think that
would be awesome and I think that
there's opportunity to go ahead and just
you know blast that diversity into that
space because it exists in comic books
now and it used to not so much and so if
it does and people are really on the
hook for it what I really love is the
idea of unsuspecting especially in the
United States unsuspecting children in
these Midwestern you know areas where
they have absolutely
no exposure to anything except for very
quote unquote traditional quote unquote
family values and they could go and see
something in a very powerful depiction I
think that's what I'd like to see next
is the Quicksilver movie
I just got visions of some kid you know
forget to apply they're from outer space
okay they have magical powers okay they
can stop time and they can run through
rules and they and then they're like
what do you mean they like drives I
can't believe I can't cope with this
this is stretching my you know
suspension of disbelief too far but you
know I think you're right you know did
you get people to engage in relate with
a character and then you throw in
something that makes them question their
own their own perspective on it that's
that's how you get people to think that
was in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
they killed Quicksilver maybe because he
was the guy who got shot of rescuing
hurricane at the end of age of Ultron
but there is still Quicksilver in the
Fox x-men thing so maybe maybe they
could do it with him yeah we're laughing
about that suspension of disbelief thing
but did you know that there was a doctor
who producer that actually opposed black
people in one of their history stories
because they said no there were no black
people in England and then in that age
period so this is a producer of Doctor
Who to make that same argument that we
were all laughing about so it's
something that still happens exactly you
can time travel and and also doctor who
can like shapeshifter every so and so
many years but nothing to female body
because you know off or is that more
volatile the good thing about the new
one the one movie though is that she no
longer changes from like her alter ego
into Wonder Woman by doing a twirl
because if you remember the render women
series from the 1970s he used to come do
a spin and then she was Wonder Woman we
also had a lot of interesting trends
from the restricted special effects do
you remember there was a show called
Manimal because if you could turn into
animals and basically like the first six
episodes every episode you tuned into
the one animal to get eternity this week
and it turned into like a panther and a
hawk and a horse of a snake and I only
had enough budget to film six
transformations like they'd spent 80
to that budget on these incredible
animated effects and the other 20% on
you know acting and screenplays on
historian and the seventh episode it's
like there was no new animal and it got
one more episode in our knowledge as
people who only tuned in to see you know
and the effects were so prohibitive they
realized no one was actually tuning in
because they didn't care about the story
they just wanted to see these amazing
transformation sequences anyway speaking
of aliens with superpowers even masks
young mothers talk about him so we we
have another short film for you this is
the promotional film for Iran's new
thing which is the boring company so
this started just because he was stuck
in traffic
and he's actually doing this he's
brought a tunneling machine and he
started digging a tunnel underneath of
SpaceX and it's just when did he have
the idea it was a round Christmas wasn't
it
somewhere around this if I ever had that
idea around Christmas I wouldn't have
had that video finish by now I would
still be kind of trying to model the
color or something it's just so so I
mean an Elon Musk generally whether we
what do we think about Elon Musk
I think Elon Musk is a mother of two
theories as the Elon Musk Avella he is
an alien who is trapped here and the
only way he can get home is to kind of
bootstrap human technology to the point
where we have warp drives so Thirsty's
like okay I need to make enough money to
do this so he invented PayPal and then
he's like right off the back of PayPal I
need a way kind of bootstrapping that
business developing battery technology
so I'm going to invent Tesla I think
it's absolute here plugs along the way
as well he did great you get hair plugs
along the way as well but an alien
cyberbrain antenna Jimmy pay attention
you know off the back of that he's like
now I have enough money to start my own
rocket company and they started SpaceX
so we're doing stuff that you're looking
at again like why did NASA never do this
you know I love NASA I love space fly
watching SpaceX and thinking he's
actually doing stuff from like comic
books from the 1950s you know the rocket
the ghost straight up and then it lands
just straight down again like that play
in the film and reverse every time I see
that it blows my mind so I think Elon
Musk is is an alien who is trying to
fund his way back to Alpha Centauri by
bootstrapping human technology now it's
either one that tries to get the blood
of younger people into him to help him
live life Dracula Gavin Belson from from
Silicon Valley yeah I think he's
supposed to be Larry Page more than more
than anybody else or Sergey Brin or Eric
Schmidt or someone like that what's the
second theory
the other theory is that he's from the
future and he in the future he invented
time travel but there's not a lot of
money to be made from time travel and so
you when I have my make money from I
know I'll go back and invent all these
things that other people invented and
I'll get the credit for them just by
doing it a year really
human evolution and progress has been
accelerated by one year because he came
back and started PayPal a year before
whoever was really supposed to start
PayPal and then Tesla and then SpaceX
and whatever else he's going to do along
the way really like email mas did you
remember the e that mean go around a few
years ago which was kinda like all these
billionaires and no one's chosen to be
Batman
right yeah I'm really always listening
to that and he thought you know well you
know I'm a billionaire
I'm going to be Ironman right I'm going
to be Tony Stark right and and brilliant
right because you know it's a
billionaire I'd start International
Rescue for those of you runner in the UK
basically the other TV show Abu Tracy I
learned about having my veins right I'm
a rocket that launches from under the
swimming pool we have noticed that
Richard Branson has his own Island has
own helicopter his own rocket as I'm
trained ya mean a bit some of our
billionaires have genuinely taken on the
mantle of becoming our favorite
childhood science fiction show
characters could be true other
billionaires around we can figure out
what gurus Bill Gates trying to be
wealthy because you don't hear an awful
lot about Bill Gates I reckon he must be
doing the evil billionaire and he's got
a volcano lair somewhere in the South
Pacific and a mother rail or maybe he's
into ransomware right yeah that could be
it he's just too busy curing malaria
that's all just for saving millions they
did actually
I run the gates foundation so that
eradicate malaria they tend to a bunch
of you know that climatologists and for
the people who insect analogous to
entomologists entomologist biggest bug
technologists but back to religious yeah
and a certain award be the environmental
impact of rendering mosquitoes extinct
and they run away and they came back you
know bill we can't actually see one
we're not sure what they do they
certainly don't help and we would you
know get rid of them if you can
and then I don't know no no they based
all blood and DNA in amber for the
future so that you can create so that in
the in the future when humans have
become extinct people will be able to
dig up fertilized mosquitoes and create
human park and then will escape and run
amok in in the
cockroach city of the future stamping on
the ball like hey I like to think at one
point all the billionaires got together
and they decided you know I'm going to
be Iron Man and someone else is saying
you know I'm going to build
International Rescue and then turned
around and said Larry we can need a
super villain you know although one of
my favorite Twitter accounts was bored
Elon Musk you should look at us other
absurd ideas that are probably not that
absurd in about a year - like you
probably come up with those things I
said yeah one of my favorite Twitter
accounts over there was an account
called Peter Malita he was peter mullan
here from beau frog but it was like
these weird games he's like what about a
driving simulator like you play the road
so just propose everyone I don't think I
understand someone on my team at work
suggested recently which is what if it
was sent back in time to teach people's
minds to cope with the idea of nonlinear
history so that when we get time travel
we're all psychologically prepared for
it okay so let's move on so uh let's
talk about pub grunts yeah who's going
to pub comp so he's got a pub clock
they're actually less and fewer hands
now than there were before we're driving
people away from pubchem it's backfiring
stop stop immediately
okay but come it's going to be great so
3d printing and prosthetics and so
people can now design their own
prosthetics so by show of hands how many
cyborgs are there in the room who's
who's augmented in any way I mean
anybody would any other you know sick we
can't you've had yourself lasered to
twelve laser eye surgery and anyone if I
marry a contact lens they say yeah
they're removable but you know I wanted
something that's not reversible or
removable yeah just pins in your leg
from a skiing accident come on this is
Norway they must be loads of skiing
accidents here the way they learn to ski
in Oh at the age of six they start ski
jumping and they go bigger and bigger if
you got to the sky bar in the Radisson
you look at there's this thing on the
horizon and people go what the hell is
that and you say it's a ski jump and
they go don't be ridiculous and you're
like no that's actually a ski jump they
learn to ski nice ski jump a ski jump no
no 16 and
you know I get that whole kind of macho
teenage adolescent thing yeah and they
die horribly in the biggest ski jumping
accident you've ever seen and the rest
of them stop skin ah that makes perfect
sense though I thought it so Norwegian
whereas chav because one they don't do
it down hills they do it on the flat
which is just I can't even imagine and
they do and some around the town hall
with rollerblade we event of the skis
anyway yes this is these this increasing
trend which i think is awesome at that
using 3d printing to custom produce
prosthesis and prosthetic limbs and you
know general the whole theme of
biological augmentation and using
technology that make humans better you
know to recover from injuries and
illnesses and also just to enhance what
people can do what do you think about
that panel yeah well this is the thing
that we work with a lot I am one of the
few people who absolutely embraces the
singularity and so I have like a whole
talk a couple of years ago about bring
it on absolutely because the the
benefits for people for human beings I
am all for it and you know it has
absolutely no track record for failure
of involving machines and what we do so
why not absolutely but I have I have
friends who are blind and they were
looking for robot eyes any day at this
point and you know ten years ago that
seemed like sort of crazy science
fiction but every single day when you
look in the news you find other kinds of
technology and other kinds of advances
and so I think we're only limited by our
own imagination and by our own sort of
antiquated idea about ethics morality in
personhood and so you know I'm all for
it so did you see yeah this was a story
in the news last week this is a guy who
is had a video camera made but can he
got a prosthetic eye so he already has a
glass eye and he's had a prosthetic
camera made that will fit inside his his
eye so basically he can walk around
filming all the time just filming
whatever he's looking at and you know
has to then go and replay the footage
later and watch it using his other eye
obviously but you know this is this is
kind of the first step because you know
it's not Google glass there's some
spectacles this is like completely
invisible
I think this is awesome I think this is
really really interesting direction to
be going in I'm pretty sure this is a
black mirror episode - yeah sure yeah
there's an interesting question how on
earth are we ever going to make that
safe I totally agree with you that there
are so many possibilities and and
changing what we think is still a person
it's totally good and if it helps people
we should embrace it but how on earth
are we going to make it safe I mean the
other thing is so at the moment we've
got a lot of research being done to
create prosthetics for people who've
lost limbs or were born without limbs in
some cases or who have lost their their
eyesight or whatever but when we get to
the point where that sort of camera that
you can put in to replace an eye has
better resolution and a zoom function
and things that noble eyes just don't do
then you're going to get healthy people
going to the doctor and saying you know
I I have RSI I've been typing for a
living and using a mouse for a living
for the last 25 years and my wrists hurt
I can't play the piano anymore I mean I
couldn't play the piano before but now
when I try and play the piano it hurts
so I you know at what point do I get to
go you know what you've got a prosthetic
and that and and like forearm and
everything and and it gives sensation
and it's got the full dexterity so I
could play piano with it cut off my
mainly healthy just a little bit so arm
and replace it with a prosthetic but at
some point you're going to get this this
elective prosthesis I rent both my
healthy eyes ripped out and replaced
with new eyes but have can see in the
infrared spectrum and have a zoom
function and a record function so that I
can watch stuff later and yeah and they
run on Windows XP
identity your question there about
security games Mickens did a great
keynote here two years ago about
security and there's an essay of his
that I love he's talking about
information security and he says you
know the problem with you know digital
security and those kind of stuff is it's
like riding a motorcycle the things that
are safe and not exciting and the things
that are exciting are never going to be
safe and you know you have to make the
decision you have to decide are you
going to write by the time the stuff is
is safe is secure it
not going to be innovative anymore it's
not going to be cool it's just going to
be you know everyday you know like I
dunno the doctrine getting injections
for flu vaccinations or something that
used to be cutting-edge medical research
that people published and now it's it's
routine and so you know I think it will
get safe and secure just by the time it
does no one will be asking the question
anymore because it's it's routine it's
every day
I think our definition of safe is a very
interesting one I think about that every
time I fly and go through the theater
that is known as security customs and
things like that TSA because I think
safety is a as a presentation of low
level hurdles for the obvious things and
then it's largely perception after that
so taking off shoes and oh now it's
laptops and and this kind of stuff it's
such a reactionary limited viewpoint
about the master mind criminality of the
human race I mean we are so devious by
nature but I really don't think that
there's any way that you can completely
secure anything and so I think it's
inevitable that this will be adopted and
it will have security flaws and
something will happen and people will
respond to it and then at some point you
know we may feel the need to go analog
and will rebel against those things but
I really do look at it as you know it's
perception and so really make it a
little less easy to hack is usually the
the goal I think these days so maybe
show of hands who would put stuff in
there all the electronics that isn't
open-source where you couldn't read the
source code movie would be comfortable
with that because it and this is not a
thing from your future because we
already have pacemakers and there are
people that that refuse to have a
pacemaker if they don't they can't see
the source I I would only want to have
open sores in my body nobody else I just
for once in my life I want to be able to
slam dunk a basketball and whatever
technology allowed me to do that I'm all
for you know they make lower nets now
gentlemen shooting so the corollary to
that yeah you know everyone's like yes I
want open-source I don't about to
control the software running in my body
would you want to share a street with
people who had hacked the firmware on
their own cars
you know self-driving cars and people
out there have overridden the controls
to say kill the pedestrians save me any
cost I don't care
it's a really really difficult trade-off
because it's a trade-off between your
safety versus the bitter Society at
safety versus security you know one
possibly go run and having your eyes
rebooted so that Microsoft can apply an
update yes just as you're trying to land
an aeroplane Microsoft yeah and there's
a guy off the Jersey Turnpike who's got
his GPS switched on so you can't land
using instruments so he's come to pub
gun yeah sorry it's working leeward
we're we're getting green shoots in 4k
area showing so Pirate Bay this this is
today the European Court of Justice as
opposed to the European Court of
anything else has ruled that Pirate Bay
are liable and responsible for the
copyright infringement that happens
through the Pirate Bay Service and see I
think Pirate Bay obviously most of the
stuff that's on there is movies you
don't see it so much with music now
because the people making the music have
made it a lot easier to just get the
music you just pay a little bit of money
to specify or whether surfing this
morning and specify is now worth more
than the entire music industry in the
United States the RIAA last year music
in America turn in the United States
turned over about six point nine seven
billion dollars which is you know
recordings vinyl CD streaming everything
and specifying now has eight point nine
billion and you know profit gap their
market cap so specify the company is
worth more than the entire United States
recording industry yeah there's
something that right I haven't bought a
CD since I started using to prophesy
yeah I buy vinyl because I'm a hipster
do make some plus purchases but
basically spread if I stop me paying for
music I pay for it and I got a lot more
concerts but I don't buy CDs anymore
it's just it's kind of solve the problem
of how do I listen to stuff I wanna
listen to I like the way that Pirate
Bay's logo has got the cassette tape in
it and most of the people who use Pirate
Bay have no idea what that is
does anyone in the room remember home
taping is killing music oh yes yeah yeah
because so in the UK we had a program on
TV every week called Top of the Pops
it was probably equivalent around the
world and when you were a kid you step
one of those rectangular tape recorders
with a built-in microphone and we would
sit there with top of the pops on
without with our one tape that we had in
every week just hold it up to the
television to record the latest films
notable results over the radio as well
was it you could actually record
straight to tape well I didn't have a
tape recorder with a radio built-in this
was 1976 this was like a long time ago I
wasn't even born then it was a amazing
coincidence that the person that built
the Pirate Bay is named Kim comm Meg I
don't think he who else was going to do
with his life going to farming now so
yeah this is the news come through today
the Pirate Bay has been found those
whole thing another thing we don't share
anything any any copyright infringing
material we just hope people find each
other and what they do after that it is
their own business and the court has
said no you do things like you delete
parents that have been proved not to
work you're actually curating this so
you're not just a carrier you're a
publisher and therefore you're going to
get a jail for the rest of your lives
but giving away ones and zeros in
special waters so but it's interesting
seven years has taken since they first
have their equipment impounded for this
to go through the court there are always
people abandoning green lantern and
watching it I think a lot of the problem
though with a lot of reason why piracy
first sparked is because the the owners
of the copyrighted content made it so
difficult for people to actually access
or to get in formats other than the one
that originally paid for and I think
unless that relationship changes there
always is always going to be piracy in
part the problem is you know that
something can come out effectively on of
which you can't access because you don't
have that you know exiting your country
Australia asked you two problems for
example where say only one television
channel carrying some of the shows you
people want to watch and the quality is
very poor so people are obviously going
to turn to piracy at that point because
you want distributed information to them
and so I think the some of the blame for
this falls upon deeded publishers and
distributors for the mess they've made
of actually coping with the real world
and saying people yes
you know you want to get access to the
content we'll make it easy for you yes
we recognize you've already purchased
this in another format no we're not
going to charge you again basically
getting in a different format I have
actually torrent 'add staff now that I
have on DVD so that I can watch it on my
laptop because my laptop no longer has a
DVD player in it and so and I want to
rip it but I can't rip it because it's
copy protected or I just don't have
access to that or I'd left it left the
DVD at home but I don't see why I should
pay for it again so if you couldn't
access the hotel Wi-Fi last night is
because I was Taryn ting green lantern
it's a very interesting distinction I
really I'm really a cherry right you
said like obviously people are going to
like Forrest's off because they feel
there that the cue it's okay because the
content is there but it's not accessible
to them I think it's a really
interesting distinction that we can you
know and ethics we all think it's sort
of okay to pirate stuff especially for
example if a show is already released in
u.s. was not released in Europe and I'm
like yeah sure you know it's only like
you make me do it I would pay money but
you make it implants mean is it was very
interesting because basically you're
saying about something that's
technically illegal yeah sure I know
we're all going to do it so it's just I
joined this point out that that super
interesting that we all share our ethics
that isn't represented by the law and it
has been the case for like sins master
that was a very long time ago so it's
also there's a difference between what
what we all see was okay and what's
still in the Lord isn't it and I think
that's why this is I mean I was sad but
I was fed like watching history pass
right because am I worried I mean I'll
go and say this I'm in another country
right now we torrent happily and without
regard and I taught my son who's 19 now
but there's really a gray area and a
responsibility to to the creators of the
things that you want you own a
responsibility to them but that there's
a whole lot of middlemen who are just
trying to pad their wallets and make it
hard for you and so he has a completely
different set of ethics and and we
talked about he's like is it illegal and
I'm like um well we'll talk about that
he's six years old at the
and I'm like well we'll talk about that
a little more as we go into it so he's
lived his whole life being unplugged
from television from cable we've been
Plex TV users and torrent errs for a
long time and it always goes in the
succession of if I can easily purchase
it we will if we can't purchase it but
can find it to purchase we will and then
I'm sorry but you've made it too hard
for me to be able to purchase it so I'm
going to tour it that shows and that's
what we do all the time and so I
realized the strangest reaction that I'm
surprised at my reaction when I heard
about this because I don't think it's
going to risk that because I think it's
the cats out of the bag so to speak
right I don't think there's anything
that you that I think is going to dance
on anything they were pioneers in some
sense in some rebellious kind of way I
guess the one feature you know we talked
about spread to film industry and stuff
the one feature I really want and
Spotify and I'm a heavy heavy Spotify
user and I would like to pay more and I
would like the extra money I pay to go
directly to the musicians who created
the music that I'm listening to you know
those only the music industry is
basically terrific for working musicians
you know you record a CD and the record
company will advance you the cost of
recording which is maybe a hundred a
hundred thousand pounds of dollars or
Euros and out of that you hire a studio
time you know you pay all the expenses
of recording the band members have to
eat and pay rent and when you start
selling CDs the record company gets like
$9 50 out of 10 and you get 50 cents and
out of that 50 cents you have to repay
your hundred thousand dollar advance
before you get to actually take any
money home I know it's crazy and so you
know if you if those musicians you are
suppose they make money from touring
so see you had a support band the best
way to do this together shows and buy
t-shirts buy stickers buy merchandise
because they get almost all of that but
if anyone from Spotify is here or
listening let me pay you know 30 40 50
pounds a month and take you over ten
quid that you need to pay to the record
companies for the licensing and did the
rest of the people I'm actually
listening to yeah and make it worth
their while as musicians you know is
planting for
es-tu use that platform because it's the
best way of doing what they do right
there's a question now just mister as a
question mr. skeet so how how easy and
cheap does it have to be before it is
unethical and you would support it being
illegal to pirate things so as an
example anyone can get hold of C sharp
in depth I don't know whether the fourth
edition is available freely at the
moment but you can find C sharp and they
are pretty damn easily a content creator
speaks right well I'm lucky my wife
writes children's books they're living
um huge numbers of them they're
relatively you know that hardcopy only
not a lot of piracy there as far as I'm
aware but as far as I'm concerned
Manning is pretty good you can get hold
of C sharp in depth in PDF epub whatever
whatever format there's no excuse in
terms of that there will be people who
say oh but I can't afford however many
dollars it is I can't can't remember is
that reasonable at what point do you
basically say no if you produce content
you need to accept that it will be
pirated and we won't say that anyone is
unethical for doing that I'm not opposed
well I have no sense of
self-preservation so I'll tell you my
point of view on it I think that I can't
speak for everyone and that's one of the
biggest issues I have with it is the
fact that these laws are created and
they're created like in god mode where
they apply to everyone and different
people have different circumstances and
different needs if it's the one thing
stopping someone from getting gainful
employment in order to change their
lives and get outside of their own
situation then that to me is a different
circumstance and you know my neighbor
who probably spends way too much money
you know on his weekend trips or
whatever and can't and decides he can't
afford it right and so I think
ultimately I think I love Dylan's idea
and I think that it's always one of my
favorite musicians James Seabury was one
of the first people to offer her music
on her own website she broke away from a
major label and she offered mp3s with a
pay what you can kind of model and you
know how they show Humble Bundle does
this to you where they'll show like pay
what you think it's worth and invariably
people's good nature
you know we're entirely dollop
diabolical but we're also really good
natured when it's directly to that
content creator there's a tendency for
that to rise above the average cost and
then it goes directly to the content
creator and I think we're capable of
doing that technologically so I don't
know why we need any kind of middleman
service yeah I think I mean I agree with
you I think that one of the issues we've
had historically is that the publisher
eventually people in control of
distribution of the product have been
the ones that effectively make their
money not the content creators and I
think we're radically all agreeing and
essentially not we actually content
creators should be rewarded for their
work what we are more concerned about I
think and I'm speaking for the group is
that so the the monopoly over
distribution platforms and publishing
has not kept pace with technology and
the less of the slice of the pie you
should probably earned by the
distributors and more by the content
creators yeah I would just out say for
the record that I have brought
legitimate digital copies of both bill
Wagner's books so I figure we will talk
about you know digital rights of just
reading content all day but we're out of
time we are out of time where we have we
have one more slide yes so how did this
happen so the reason I draw this in is I
have been talking with my people in the
intelligence services and I have figured
out the true meaning of preface so what
happened there was a special operations
division behind enemy lines in Iran
trying to sabotage a nuclear fuel
refinery and they got in and they found
out these two buttons and this dashboard
and you know one of them says Mahalo the
other word says car thief and they
didn't know it from the press so they
called a mathematician who did some
calculus and they came out you know he
had to integrate all of the mission
parameters and what happens when you do
integrals in calculus you get a constant
emerges from the term and this constant
came out negative and that wasn't in
their mission plan so they radioed
headquarters and they said we've got
these two buttons we don't know what to
do and we've integrated the constant is
negative and then of communications cut
off and so you know the right house in
the kobra room they're like we need to
get a message out to these people what
can we do and current comes in and he
says you know right I've got this and he
taps that display
the constant negative press trophy is
probably not what actually happened but
I don't know anyway we are out of time
