you guys been enjoying the conference so
far I think it's probably being a bit of
an an overload in terms of technical
content for three days so nothing like
easing into a talk that doesn't have any
anything to do with code no c-sharp no
JavaScript nothing say in a way you know
it's you can relax a little bit over
here in this talk before I get started
quick show of hands
are there any non developers in this
room all right
I was gonna say if you are a non
developer and if you're not a developer
I was gonna ask you to leave the room
because as you can clearly see it's a
software developer talk but I don't have
to do that anyway but you know jokes
aside very soft skills soft skills
whether you're a developer or non
developer I think you're all going to
find this relevant over here
so the question my name is Mahesh
Krishnan I work for Telstra held was a
CTO but I've started my career as a
developer like anyone else and rose up
the ranks I think I do have a bit of a
unique perspective on what it takes to
develop soft skills and that's what I'm
going to talk about today so so what is
what are the soft skills to actually
explain what soft skills I want to start
with a bit of a story when I started my
career many many years ago I went into
work and that was this developer that
that worked with me really brilliant guy
those days we used to code in C++ and I
looked at the and the code and it was
you know very very good I looked at it
and I thought this guy was my role model
this is exactly how I need to start
writing code and and everything else and
then I go away for a few days and then
they come back and this guy is gone he'd
lost his job he would made redundant
Victor he was fired right however you
put it he was gone and so being a young
developer you know I was a little
apprehensive which you know took my time
and then eventually took up the courage
to go asks one of senior colleagues what
had happened and I told him you know our
argument this guy was really brilliant I
mean technical he was very very strong
what happened I mean there are so many
other P
in the company who aren't half as good
as this guy but you know why did we end
up laying off this guy
and there's something that the the
senior person actually told me and he
said well there are skills other than
your technical skills that really matter
at work and I went like what do you mean
I mean you're fresh out of university
and you think that you know you get good
grades and you're really good at your
coding skill and fitly that's all you
need right to succeed in your job as it
turns out that itself is not enough and
so so began my journey trying to figure
out what are what are the skills that
you need to actually get better at at
your work and so that's what this talk
is all about I mean there are certain
skills that I look for when I hire
people there are things like how you
portray confidence how are your
communication interpersonal skills there
are things like how you go about
managing time how do you go about
setting your goals and how how do you go
about managing the tasks that are given
to you how do you doll a deal with
problems how do you deal with conflict
what about leadership skills so these
are some of the things that people look
for in a job and if you're finding you
know if you want to progress in your
career these are the things that you
need to focus on so let's get started
looking at conference itself now I spend
many years as a consultant and one of
the key things about being a consultant
is that as you step into the customers
office straightaway you're expected to
know all the answers and you're supposed
to to portray that confidence that they
expect out of you
you know you go and you shake the hands
and you may not know all the answers but
the customer actually thinks that you
know all the answers you don't have a
lot of time to basically prove yourself
and then say hey you know trust me you
know this is the right way of doing it
straight away your body language needs
to show that you're in control and
that's where this this concept of of
nonverbals comes through now there is a
famous American psychologist her name is
Amy Cuddy and if you go look at a TED
Talks and you'll find a video of her and
she talks about confidence and
everything else and I highly recommend
looking at it and she's done a lot of
research on nonverbals now you look at
worldly
come you know people
world leaders heads of companies CEOs
managing to recreation things like that
a lot of them naturally exhibit this
quality even before they open their
mouth and say a single word people think
they know what they're saying what
they're going to be doing it's all in
the body language these are the things
that they actually talk about as non
verbals even before you open your mouth
people think and trust these people so
so how does it happen I go how do people
you know even before they open their
mouth how is it that they actually
portray confidence it's it's like I said
in body language people take different
postures you know when you're really
confident you know you put your hand up
on your hip and you know you've got your
hand folded and you suddenly look like
you know what you're doing you know and
that's that's really important and it
turns out a lot of politicians naturally
have this this kind of quality and they
did a lot of research and they found
it's all on those hormones effectively
well leaders and so on they have two
kinds of hormones I mean like the day
everybody has this but what happens is
there is the adrenaline and the cortisol
the cortisol is known as a stress
hormone what happens is under pressure
under stress they have lower levels of
cortisol that are being produced in
their body at the same time they have
higher levels of adrenaline that
actually gets generated in the body and
that so this is the you know your bodily
because of these hormones suddenly you
exhibit these qualities of confidence so
what she argues is she's done a lot of
research things he argues about it's
like hey you know when you are confident
your body language basically your your
body exhibits those qualities now what
if the reverse can actually be done what
if you kind of you know fake it you
basically come in and you know you stand
take a like a more dominant posture of
your body would it actually have an
effect on your bond on your on your mind
and how the hormones actually gets
produced so they did research of course
right so they basically called a whole
bunch of people and then
they asked them to take what is known as
power poses right now you look at the
top these are all the power poses you
come in you know you you you got your
hands on your hips and you know you seem
to be you're in control right this
basically exhibits qualities of how
being in control of the situation and
this is the opposite of a low power pose
here you effectively expand your body
and you know make yourself appear bigger
whatever it is and here you contract and
you know you shrink down your body and
like you know it feels like you're not
in control of the situation itself now
she had during a research she had people
take up that posture the high power pose
and then the low power pose what she
actually found was that and they
measured so they effectively call these
people and ask them to spit on a test
tube and then they measured their
hormone levels and guess what people who
actually took these things they had
lower levels of cortisol and higher
levels of higher levels of adrenaline in
their body as opposed to the people who
took low-power poses and they had the
exact opposite result in fact what I
want you to do is I want to you to humor
me I know it's late in the day but why
don't you guys get off and spend 30
seconds taking about all these high
power forces all right come on get up 30
seconds all right I'm not gonna keep you
here for longer
you know y'all don't have to look like
Wonder Woman or Superman you know all
right that's enough all right you guys
can sit down now now what this actually
does is it actually increases the
adrenaline your body and it does lower
your cortisol level as well now imagine
this thing right so you go into an
interview and I'm not gonna ask you to
go and sit like better than interview
but before you go into the interview
right you could just go into the
bathroom maybe take a high-power pose
for about three minutes and suddenly you
go walk into the interview and suddenly
you know you've got a spring in your
step
you got a film a handshake and and
suddenly you know the person was
actually doing this interview is
basically saying well here's a really
confident person he must be knowing what
he's actually talking about so if if you
kind of like faked the confidence right
but it's okay right you mean you started
thinking well you know I'm kind of like
faked at once and I've got this job now
I mean what am I going to do like I'm
still not under control and this is what
is profound right if you continue to
keep faking it you can actually make it
let's assume that you actually do this
every day
you kind of like go in and you know you
take your high-power poses and things
like that and suddenly or you get a
little bit more confident and that is
profound so key takeaways for this is of
course you know you can actually improve
your improve your conference by
improving your posture itself and of
course you can fake it till you make it
and the third thing is to get over that
imposter syndrome a lot of people have
this impostor syndrome where you know
you've done your you know you probably
don't really well at school you've
really done well at university you know
what your stuff you get into quite into
into work and suddenly you've got this
confusion and it's like hey maybe I'm
not good enough I'm strong but it's
really really smart people and I'm not
sure of myself and I'm really an
impostor I'm gonna be found out any time
I'm gonna be sacked right people do have
the kind of feeling in fact I was
feeling alright I come in and stand here
in front of you and I speak and I think
hey maybe I'm just a fake over here I'm
not I'm not good enough you know I look
at some of the other speakers and say
I'm just an imposter I'm gonna be found
out anything at any point in time but
you need to get over that feeling you
don't have been in the position unless
you know you're good and that's the
thing that you need to keep telling
yourself and confidence builds over a
period of time yeah you need to keep
working on it the second soft skill that
a lot of people look for is
communication now we as developers are
pretty poor at communication and we
allow you know chatting with people on
an email we'd love to do that on slack
or in any other I am but when it when it
comes to one-on-one conversation
sometimes we're just not good enough
and we need to constantly keep working
on it the thing that I will actually
talk about is first first lesson of
communication is to add to loosen
effectively become an engaged listener
so when you go into a meeting it doesn't
have to be a one-on-one maybe like
whether it's in one-on-one meeting or
whether it's like a meeting with lots of
people one of the key things that you
need to do is to pay attention to what
the other person is saying when I'm
saying pay attention
look at the person make the eye contact
how many times we go into meeting room
with our laptops on our mobile phones
and then other person is talking and you
going mm-hmm on your phones or you're
tapping away on your keyboard you're not
making that eye contact you know we're
talking about these nonverbals you're
not recognizing any of those things
because you're focused on something else
and I think that's a really good thing
to do it's like shut off your your
laptop or your phones put it down or
told the person hey I'm talking taking
notes you listen to what the person is
saying and then you tap away on your
keyboard but try and pay attention to
what this person is saying avoid
interrupting while other people are
talking and this is you know I find this
all the time where you don't give other
people enough time you interrupt them
you judge them with wade through the
conversations they haven't completed
what they've said and then you suddenly
interrupted them and oh you know I know
I know what you're saying you know we
should we should be be doing you someone
so hang on a second I haven't completed
what I was trying to say see
hold back just that extra minute so that
the other person can finish what they're
trying to say I think that's really
really important so first we need to
stop jumping into conclusion and the
other thing that we do when you
interrupt other people is to hijack the
conversation
I mean developers we do it all the time
we are there sitting in a room and we're
talking about a really important
production issue that that's popped up
and we're trying to troubleshoot it and
suddenly we said hey you know what the
problem with this is logging and we need
to be thinking about what logging frame
break we're going to be using in the
next project now that'sthat's
effectively hijacking the project it's
kind of relevant but it's not we're
trying to fix the production issue over
here you've got a it's also good idea to
provide feedback as simple not of the
head sometimes does does wonders right
you can also listen to what the person
is saying and sometimes they have a
really long conversation they've said a
lot of things you could basically
summarize what they've said paraphrase
what they've said just you know repeat
what they've said so that everybody in
the room and yourself have actually
understood what they've said that goes a
long way of course it's not enough to
listen now you've got to talk back and
clearly articulate what you've actually
said a lot of developers I mean we have
this habit of rambling on for a long
time on some you know you'd start on
some topic and then you know you keep
rambling on it not trying to make any
sense like I'm doing now I suppose a
little bit of rambling you've got to be
concise on what you're saying keep it
short and keep it simple the second
thing is you got to tell you tailor your
message to the audience you go into a
room and you have a CEO sitting over
there or the or you know someone from
marketing and then you can go on talking
about our dependency injection or you
know Kafka or you know you throw all
kinds of buzzwords into the conversation
and like who are you trying to impress
you know you've lost them completely and
they're not impressed at all so try and
try and figure out
what the target audience is and say
accordingly the other thing that I find
with developers particularly is they
sometimes tend to be very condescending
to the people that they're talking to
particularly when they're non-technical
they basically say yeah you know let me
try and explain this to you so you can
understand you know all this that stuff
out now it's really important even when
you're talking to to you know give the
right bosses at the right place control
the tone of your voice you give bosses
at the right time so you get people a
chance to you know to ask questions and
things like that I've been in meetings
where people continuously talk without
stopping just in case someone else gets
a burden right that's something that we
need to avoid but a lot of communication
that we do these days is via email and
rule and we talk about email etiquette
all the time and I find that we still
need to keep repeating these messages
over and over again
so what's that a bunch of of things as
far as email etiquette goes the same
message that I said when you're talking
and conveying a message right you got to
try and be concise and keep it short
sometimes we put in a lot of stuff in
our emails right to three-page emails
like you know I get lots and lots of
emails and sometimes when I see an email
that runs two three or four pages it's
kind of like lose interest the first
paragraph is effective what I go through
and then I quickly browse through and
see what's in the end and that's about
it
so what purpose does it say you know a
simple TLDR too long didn't read and
this is the summary of it at the very
top does wonders to to me you know look
at it and go like okay I know what it is
and then I can go on if you want some
some something action if you want
someone to take action out of the email
say it was just one person an extension
of this right is if you don't want any
work then send it to two people the two
people are going to look at this and say
oh well I think the other person is
going to action this thing I'll just
keep going happens all the time so if
you want something done just send it to
one person but of course it's important
you know you can see see
somebody important in it so that they
know that this person is God looking at
it I you know my boss is looking at it
maybe I should get this thing done
but apart from it just send it to one
person be careful with your reply all -
as well when you're sending a reply we
do it all the time we hit a reply all
and we talk about things that we
shouldn't be saying even about people
who are in the in the mail list as well
so be very careful of that a couple of
other things the tone of the email is
very very important it gets lost in
translation sometimes and that's why
things like emoticons
you know like smiley faces and that help
but I hate emails where they put in like
a six or seven smiley faces right next
to each of that that just drives me nuts
Roomba right it's it's okay to be you
know explore so express a little bit of
emotion on it but it's it's not it's not
a text message right it's a very formal
way of communicating with your
colleagues just keep that in mind and
two other things never say anything that
you wouldn't say face to face this is
really important also don't send an
email when you're upset or angry
sometimes when a conversation goes on
for too long or someone appears in the
email to be angry just pick up the phone
and talk to them it's it's much easier
conversation and you can resolve
differences rather than you know going
over this or nor again cool the next
thing I want to talk about inside in
terms of soft skill is time management
even within time management I want I've
got four things to discuss one is how do
you go about planning things I want to
talk about how you can how to say no
because that's really important you know
we have this habit of taking more and
more work and we need to know when to
say no I want to talk a little bit about
delegation of work and then I also want
to talk about how we stay focused so
let's start with planning itself now I
think that everything everything that
you need everything you do needs to be
needs to be planned no matter how small
the task is even if you're going into a
meeting it makes really
good sense to maybe write three blood
points I'm not asking for people to
become you know prepare a Gantt chart
and you know with with everything on it
right just bullet points is good enough
you just need to have a bit of a
direction on what you wanted then
direction on and how do you want to get
it done or what you want to do it's okay
to change the plan but to start what you
just do need to have a plan and that's
the key thing and it's good to plan or a
long period of time you could actually
set yourself a plans for a year
effectively goals and if you're doing
goals you know you've got to use the
smart acronym to your advantage
little things like you know if you're
setting a goal you got to be specific
it's got to be measurable you may say
something like oh I want to learn
angular 2 this year that could be your
goal and you said well it's very
specific in this case how do you measure
it how do you know that you actually
done a good job of learning it so when I
work with my own team I basically tell
them you know what I want you to go do a
presentation in in a user group or a
meet-up just do two this year on the
topic that you actually learn it kind of
like gives you an indication on how well
you've learned maybe public person thing
is not the thing for this person you
know talk about maybe writing a blog
blog post or something it could be an
internal brown-bag within the company
doesn't have to be a user group or a
little pet project something that you
can actually measure it by again it's
got to be attainable you know you don't
set yourself some some goal that you're
not going to reach it's okay to have a
little bit of stretch goals but you know
you gotta be it's got to be attainable
it's also got to be relevant and
time-bound as well so you set yourself
six months five months or whatever so
once you said these these goals I mean
goals for a year is okay but I think
when you are doing your day to day work
it's good to plan for a week I said
things that I want to do for a week I
just write in a piece of paper and it
just sits in right in front of my desk
and I as I go through them I actually
physically scratch them out and you know
of course I don't get through all of
them during the week and so so it's you
know it gets carried over for the
weekend that's perfectly okay same thing
is planned for a day planned for a week
and so on
it's important to set up checkpoints and
milestones to track progress you set
yourself a goal alors I've got to learn
angular as an example in three months
time and it'll be good to have a
checkpoint at every three weeks to see
how far you've gone or not gone so that
you can take some corrective actions I
think that's really important last but
not the least don't procrastinate so if
you want if you think about doing
something just go ahead and do it so
certain tips and techniques first thing
I want to talk about is using Kanban
boards I mean developers would be kind
of like get it you know you have you
planned things and you move it from I
suppose one swim lane to another things
that you want to be done things that are
in progress and once you've done it you
can actually move it to the getting done
board you can use there are plenty of
tools available apps that are available
that you can actually download to help
you manage your tasks to-do lists and
boards one of the good really good
examples is Trello any of you how many
of you used to alo here a few people
yeah so Trello is really good because
you can set up your swim lanes you can
basically say it can be anything this
example that I actually picked up from
the Trello webpage is around redesigning
a kitchen and they're tracking
everything on it but you know you can
actually go ahead and say you know you
can create your own Trello and you can
say what are the tasks that you want to
manage and start putting things on it
there's a methodology called getting
things done by David Allen and if you
haven't seen it it's a really good
source it's a it's a model that he
actually took metrology that he actually
uses he calls it GTD method and it's all
about how to get things done right so
talks about how you capture the
information and once you capture the
information you start filtering it you
know you kind of like seek clarification
there are certain things that you don't
want to do you know chuck it in the bin
and then if something needs to be done
straight away you do it or you start
planning it start organizing it and and
so on and so forth and you can use that
the key thing is to prioritize
everything as well so how do you
prioritize Stephen Covey's got this
wonderful quadrant and this was written
many many years ago and it's still
relevant to us
it's all about splitting the your tasks
into important and urgent and important
and non urgent and and similarly not
important but urgent and not important
and not urgent obviously you look at it
and go well that's the the one that you
probably is the least important to you
and you try and limit as much as that
and you try and manage this as well like
you know every diff everything is
important to urgent that's not a good
thing either so it's a good way of
prioritizing your tasks and getting
things done now one thing that I want to
point out at this point in time is that
there is no one-size-fits-all there are
plenty of tools tips and techniques that
you can actually use but there's no
one-size-fits-all and it's up to you on
which technique that you want to use I
personally like writing some of these
things down in a piece of paper I used
Trello as well and I you write this down
and the physical act of scratching
things out also feels gives me a sense
of accomplishment that I've actually
gone through and done these tasks learn
to say no how many of you find it hard
to say no when someone actually asks you
know quite a few people right I still
find it hard
I mean why I mean like you know your
boss may come over and say hey get this
done and how can you say no to your boss
right so you pick on this additional
task sometimes you want to do it just
because you like doing this stuff it's
ok you know I love doing this stuff you
know I love firing upwind debug and and
doing this stuff yeah just let me know I
just want to do it and or sometimes you
know a teammate comes over and says hey
can you help with it and you feel sorry
for this person they say okay you know
what I'll spend some time with you and
try and help you out but some what
happens is that it sometimes it can
affect your affect your own work so how
do you actually figure out whether to
pick up the tasks or not
so the qualifiers I have are basically
that right so first thing is when when
something pops up someone comes and ask
you to get something done you think
about is it part of your team's activity
your goal if it is then it's great so
you actually pick up and start doing it
you can add it to your list of things
you go ahead and prioritize that based
on the list artist I was talking about
earlier and get it done and then you
talk about well can someone else do it
maybe there are people who are better
equipped to perform this task and maybe
they can actually do it
at the same time well do we have the
time to do it and that's another
important qualification you just cannot
keep taking on more and more stuff and
then not good do a good job of it but
then here's a question how do you say no
well you know you gotta be you gotta
tell him down pull the book politely and
not seem like you know you'd like to
still like to be seen as a team player
right so how do you say politely you can
you can praise a sentence saying like
you know I love to help but I'm working
on on tasks you know so-and-so is it
okay to get this done next Monday and
sometimes I may say hell you know next
week is too late now it's okay I'll go
find someone else you can also say you
can you know and say you know I don't
this task will take about a full day to
do I don't have a day
why don't I quickly give you a 15 minute
introduction on how to get it done and
maybe you can get it done yourself or I
can you know maybe find someone to do it
it's another way of differing and the
tasks are helping someone do it well
what if your boss comes over and says
can you get this done how are you gonna
handle that you know you can be honest
with your boss and say hey boss you know
I've got I've got X Y and Zed can you
help me reprioritize this task and then
he may say well you already got X Y and
said you know what I'll go find someone
else or if it's really important he or
she is going to help you prioritize that
and so it's a win-win situation for
everyone staying focused and this can be
really really really distractive hard
for a lot of people the first thing that
you need to do is to shut down your
distractions we're saying focus these
days we've got everything we got or
today running we've got Facebook we've
got LinkedIn and then I had my phone you
know every night when I turn on whatsapp
notifications on it just goes crazy
because all these people have like
friends and family in India and seems
like they have nothing else to do then
post these messes on whatsapp so so
anyway so turn off all these things off
when you're when you're trying to get
into a bit of when you when you start
doing a bit of productive work get
headphones they're really good you
whether you're listening to music or not
you put them on and then people don't
bother you as much yeah they're great
there's always the tendency when you
about to start work and you've got your
mouth and you go and you go you know
maybe I should go get myself some water
or coffee or some snack and you need to
rate the kitchen get everything on in
your desk before you start work so you
make no excuses to get up and go all
right set your phone on silent as well
just before you beginning to do some
large piece of work set your phone to
silent you've turned off your email you
set yourself busy on on your chat and
everything else and now is the right
time to do your work okay so how do you
do it so have you guys heard of the
Pomodoro Technique anyone hear Pomodoro
yeah few people the power of our
technique is a really good one
so it's based on the the tomato trainer
tomato tre timer that you may have seen
in kitchens right so what you do is you
turn it twist it around and you said
your time to about 25 minutes or 30
minutes or whatever it is and then it
goes off when I mean the time of
finishes so in the Pomodoro Technique
you split out all the tasks that you
want to get done and then within the
Pomodoro which is effectively 25 minutes
without any distractions you basically
go through and get all the work that you
plan to get it done without any
distractions and because you actually
set yourself this block of 25 minutes
it's it's it's targeted focused time on
the tasks that you want to get done and
once you do that you have this physical
you've got the list and you tick them
off and gives you a sense of
satisfaction that you've actually gone
through and done all a lot of these
things and that's really effective and
you can see the sense of satisfaction
after 25 minutes the Pomodoro Technique
the recommendation is you take a five
minute break and then you go check your
email and now spam your friends whatever
you do do all those kind of things after
every four pompadours
they suggest that you take a much longer
break maybe it's like an hour go take a
break do whatever you want and that
keeps you fresh as well because you've
taken a bit of a break
decluttering your mind is really
important getting enough sleep and rest
how many of you think that you get
enough sleep right not a single well one
hand has gone up well done sir oh I
always have this problem III need to get
more sleep and but I end up working late
or doing something you know one thing
that's actually helped me is this device
that I wear on my hand I actually got
this device I turned it on and it
started recording my sleep patterns and
things like that and wasn't the first
week I had such shocking results that I
knew I had to do something about it just
going to an hour going an hour early to
sleep I think made a big difference
after that maybe we should just all try
and get that extra hour sleep or extra
two hours of sleep maybe even more than
that
sleeping Aras is really important just
going for that walk short walks long
walks whatever it may be I like I like
to go for runs but you know it depends
on the person whatever works for you
maybe you want to do a little bit of
yoga or go to the gym whatever it helps
you relax your mind we're talking about
decluttering your mind just decluttering
your physical environment does wonders
just take away everything else keep a
nice clean bench or desk I should say
and then work off it that that doesn't
want this above all one of the key
things that at one point there's just
have fun you know take breaks you go on
holidays and things like that just helps
you keep fresh in your workplace I think
that's really really important one last
thing about doing things effectively is
around not doing multi how many people
actually think multitasking is really
good well it's one placing clear
multitasking is really good if you're a
computer right as humans we are really
bad at it whether we acknowledge it or
not let's let me just play Pokemon go
while I'm driving and I'm not sure where
I'm I'm going as well right now that's
not good
delegation delegate is all about giving
letting someone else do the work for you
first thing is because you know you
don't
have all the time to finish stuff so
what better than to actually get someone
else to help to do it but we all have
this trouble of doing it you know first
thing is we need to trust the person
that we get delegating to and that
sometimes hard to come by and that's the
first thing that we need to learn to do
is to trust your colleagues and people
you work with so when you're delegating
one of the key things is to you define
the task that you wanted to do and the
level of delegation so you give someone
a task and say hey what if there is a
problem with it are you going to tell
this person to you I'm giving you full
delegation authority to go do it
yourself come whatever it is all I want
is to get the diet the tasks done or are
you gonna tell them come back to me and
I'll make the decision for you it's okay
either way but you need to make sure you
communicate it clearly how you want to
get it done of course you need to make
sure that who are you're delegating to
has enough sufficient skills to do it
you don't want to set them up for
failure can you please write this you
know a piece of code in react.js and I
have no idea what react.js is even it's
not gonna work right communicate what
communicate what when you're delegating
you communicate what why and when what
are the things what are the things that
needs to be done why does it need to be
done and what's the deadline three
really important things you don't
necessarily need to tell them how to get
it done it's a little simple case right
so it's like my wife will tell me how I
go you know you need to reload the
dishwasher or something like that
the minute I start putting this and
that's not how you need to do it it's
like a let's all relax this is all gonna
get washed anyway it's like I think it's
don't necessary tell them how just you
know what why and when is enough it's
also good to provide feedback when you
delegate it's tough and people get it
done to provide the feedback on how
they've done it compliment them and
here's one other tip when something
actually goes wrong it's your fault but
when they do a good job
the credit is all theirs keep that in
mind and there's also another thing
about delegation it is called the Talon
the tannenbaum Schmitt continuum it's
around management style around armed
delegation itself now
when you start a new team people chances
are people aren't skilled enough and
this tells you how to actually build up
a team over a period of time and start
delegating more and more across to them
so the initially you'll basically tell
them what needs to be done and then you
you know you you sell the concept and
why it needs to be done and things like
that
and then towards the end you give them
more and more authority on how to get it
done like in the end
you completely step away and you've
delegated the entire thing for them to
do so the key thing about is the more
freedom that you your manager actually
gives to the subordinates right the more
freedom that they give the the more
authority they actually lose which is
actually a good thing right you may
actually say hey you know I'm losing my
authority is that a bad thing you know
it's not now you can actually go away to
the next position you get there you got
the pro you get the promotion in you
move on
while someone within your team will get
promoted as well so it's a really good
good model talk about dealing with
conflict you know conflict is something
that happens between between two people
and they just can't agree on it and
that's just putting it mildly right I
mean you may all have disagreements but
this actually goes to another scale
altogether and conflict is really bad
for an organization and there are
effectively just two outcomes from from
from conflict one is flight you know you
want to completely avoid the situation
you know people go on leave they've
they'll do go to extremes they will quit
job I had a situation where there is
conflict between two people in my team
and I I haven't heard about it I was
away somewhere else and somebody
actually called and said hey there's a
little bit of a conflict between these
two people by the end of the evening
even before I could actually call and
talk to this place and this person had
quit he had left the job and I'm trying
to talk this place and I was hello come
over come in I'll have a chat with you
and this person went on sick leave and
he did everything to avoid coming into
the office
didn't want to have anything about it
and the sad part is the other person
also left after a while so if this
person had stayed you know the you know
there are still being working over there
but people go to extremes to just avoid
a situation when there's a conflict and
that's no good so the other one is is
fight you get angry and you get
emotional you have these angry outbursts
at people and things like that so either
way the verbal abuse shouting none of
these positions are good right but sadly
these are the two positions that people
take so how do you actually get over
conflict the first thing of course is
recognize is that the earlier the
conflict is resolved the better it is
for everyone involved for the for the
organization for the two people involved
so one of the things one way of
resolving conflict is more than one way
of resigning the conflict is something
as a technique known is leading out of
drama and this is all based out of work
by a person called Steven Kaufman and he
devised this thing called the drama
triangle so in the drama triangle people
generally take three positions one of
three positions in the triangle so you
end up being the persecutor you're the
person who basically thinks hey I am
okay but you are not okay so everything
I say I just don't understand why you're
not getting this just try and see it
from my point of view you are not
getting it just do the damn thing that I
actually tell you that's the post
position of a persecutor like everyone
here is a moron they're not getting what
I'm saying I don't know why right I'm
okay or not okay
the second person is that of the victim
the victim is the one who actually
thinks well I am NOT okay I know you're
okay and you know you seem to be a
really smart guy I'm not able to get
anything done like you know I'm such a
mess over here and that's not a good
position either and I guess there's a
third person who's the rescuer who will
come in and rescue the victim say oh you
know what I feel really sad for you let
me let me do this let me fix this for
you and this person does even without
the victim
before and they feel really good about
jumping and risking someone and
basically talking about other people you
know what I fix the situation you know
this person over here didn't know how to
do it when I come came and helped help
this person out now it turns out right
that people can depending on different
times in situations people can move in
from being a victim into a persecutor or
persecutor into a rescuer and all that
so people keep swapping roles it's not
that one person always play the places
the persecutor all the time it does
happen but typically even within a
conflict sometimes they will take
different positions so so how would he
get out of this you look at it right so
the car insults fear he attacks
you know it's very secretive blames
other people for stuff the rescuer is
like you know this leads to loss of
initiative resentment anger - other
people again it leads to low morale if
you're the victim you've got this loss
of confidence this isolation you try and
avoid people
it is a highly dysfunctional place to be
so the the way to fix this is something
known as the compassion triangle and in
the compassion triangle so if you notice
over there you've got the the PV and the
are over there and so you've actually
changed that to the this used to be so
the the P for persistence at first P for
persecutor its effect lis changed as
persistence and R for rescuer in this
has been changed to resourcefulness and
the V over here victim used to be
vulnerable and because vulnerable has
negative connotations to it they change
it to offer openness these are the
behaviors you need to exhibit to get out
of a situation of conflict so first
thing of course you need to recognize
that you're playing one of these these
roles and once you identify that you're
doing it so if you're the if you're the
persecutor you gotta basically say hey
hang on a second I am being this this
idiot there's more on this jerk being a
persecutor I need to move away from it
I've got to start being with persistence
so you give people more time and he
expresses that
you know what needs to be done and you
be a bit more persistent you tell them
what needs to be done and rather not
shouting at them if you're the victim
you need to express yourself you need to
be more open with your feelings you
basically say hey you know I actually
didn't understand anything that you're
saying can you please explain that to me
and you know you express your feeling
and that's the way moving forward I
rather than being jumping in and trying
to be the rescuer at all times you try
to be resourceful effectively you go and
tell the person that hey I know you got
a problem why don't these are the ways
in which you can actually fix it why
don't you try and do it so rather than
jumping and doing it for this person you
offer them the resources that needs to
be done and so in a situation of
conflict you could start from this
openness position and negotiate out of
it you basically say hey you know what I
want to I know you had you know I'm
feeling really disappointed that you say
this work cannot be done by tomorrow and
then you go into this position you
notice this little arrow here then you
basically say hey can I provide you with
an extra person to help you fix this
thing and then you go into the
persistence position and say why you
want to do it and you say because if we
don't finish this on time our customer
is going to sue us
and what do you think about it so you
kind of like push that back on that
person and this is a really good
negotiation technique as well and helps
you get out of conflict the last thing I
want to talk about is its leadership now
leadership has a lot of meaning to a lot
of people the first thing that people
think about as soon as we mention
leadership is about about management
people in in high positions where you
know you're part of the senior
leadership team and these are the people
that you look to it for things like
inspiration you look to see what kind of
decisions that they take and you know
those kind of things these are the
people who take all the decisions within
the company and so on the other kind of
leadership is
it's something that you do when you know
you're not even in the position of power
I mean it's easy to actually influence
and be a leader when you're you know the
managing director of a company or the
manager and things like that but you
could actually be a person in the
mailroom and still exhibit leadership
qualities the reason I picked up the
mailroom as an example is because in the
corporate world a lot of people see the
mailroom as the bottom of the food chain
you know it's a lot starting point for a
lot of people you know even if you don't
have a good education or something like
so you know you can actually start down
in the mailroom even in the mailroom so
you basically say you know this person
has no authority whatsoever what kind of
leadership are they gonna exhibit but
this person can actually go and say hey
you know I see that the whole mailing
system is broken I can help with how the
mail is sorted and how it can be
delivered and you can show some
leadership and fix those kind of things
and that's the leadership that I want to
talk about more than the leadership that
we talked about in the management so how
does it work for someone like software
developers well this is the thing I
wanted you can basically influence
change and show leadership without being
a manage that's the key takeaway right
but it's just how does leadership affect
developers I didn't want to talk about
things like taught leadership before I
started at Telstra health I used to work
for a consulting company called ratify
and one of the the things for me about
ratify was the the strong that the motor
that they had the ethos the work ethos
at the head it had like three words in
it that rang a bell for me like a rang a
bell which is around discover master and
influence just three simple words but
these words effectively talks about how
you could actually become a thought
leader how do you become a leader in a
certain area so how do you go about
doing it the first thing is is that it's
a stage of discovery itself right
sometimes you don't know what you want
to do and you go in and you look at you
know you you're read books you look in
the internet you know you follow other
people's blogs you look at the Twitter
accounts you identify some of the key
leaders that are there and then you you
you listen to what they're going to say
these are some really smart people
totally it is in their areas and you
start listening to to them you also
attend meetups and conferences now
here's the thing where you kind of like
have a shallow upper you try and learn a
little bit of everything
but at some point in time you know you
probably figure out what's the nice for
you when which area that you want to
focus on and then you actually go deep
into that area this is all this is the
area where you talk about you know you
go in and start attending kosis you
start attending workshops try and
understand more on that specific subject
you look at other people to work I mean
this is really useful for developers
right more than anyone else because when
you look at this there are so many
things on the you know the there are a
lot of geeks out there who write
technical people who say sorry technical
people who write a lot of technical
content than any other subject there's a
lot of technical subject available than
anything else in the internet and the
lots of podcasts so many things that you
can actually follow and when I say look
at other people's work you're going to
github and there are so many open-source
projects you go download that and can
even look at it and then say hey this is
how good code needs to be written so you
can actually learn from the Masters so
you learn you get better at it so the
first stage is effectively follow
thought leaders that are there and the
second stage is to become a thought
leader itself you start your own pet
projects you learn get get into it
deeper into it and you effectively
master the subject once you've got the
discover and the master the third thing
is to effectively influence people and
this is where you yourself become one of
the thought leaders you are recognized
as thought leader start writing a book
you know he doesn't have to be a book
you can start blogging about it start a
much smaller scale you can speak about
it it doesn't have to be a tab you know
you can start small by talking at your
own
do brown bags in your company started at
user groups meetups then move on to even
conference and then go start talking to
a much larger audience start
contributing to it you know open source
project start your own open source
project get better at what you're doing
and you know you get recognized as a
thought leader in that space now just to
summarize everything apart from apart
from hard skills which is effectively
what people call you know the technical
skills and things like that people call
as as hot skills soft skills are really
necessary in the workplace and one key
thing that I want to point out which I
didn't do through do throughout the talk
is that these skills are just not
relevant in the workplace and they help
you a lot at home as well just in your
personal life just knowing how to deal
with conflict it happens all the time in
your personal life that's really good
how do you communicate with person how
do you how do you speak how do you pay
attention and listen all that is
important as important as as it is in in
in your work life it's important in your
personal life as well the third point is
that there is no one-size-fits-all you
know I talked about a lot of tips and
techniques and tools and and all that
kind of stuff you need to figure out
what works for you some people find that
writing on a piece of paper it doesn't
work for them you know they need to put
it on their little iPhones or whatever
it is and there are apps and you know
for everything that you want to do you
know talking about the Pomodoro
Technique there's an app for it you go
download the app and you can set your
timer you don't have to get the kitchen
timer set it up on your next year
workstation you go to a webpage I think
is called Mirena timer com you can go
there and set up a timer it just shows
you know you can it shows the timer drop
down and will start buzzing once you're
25 minutes is up so fine what really
works for you and that's all I had I
just thought it'll be good to open it up
for questions
yes yeah yeah so the question is around
is there anything in the company that
helped you with your leadership now like
I said there are there are two things in
leadership right so most companies focus
on leadership that leads towards
management see they all say you know
what I want you to be a better manager
and so we're gonna give you a manager
and leadership training and those
training focus on some of the other soft
skills that I touched upon things like
how do you manage time how do you
communicate so those become the focus of
those leadership trainings right so the
other type of leadership that I talked
about is the one that you need to take a
bit of initiative you see a problem and
rather than leave it out as someone else
problem they need to fix it and they'll
get to it you take the initiative and
then start addressing that and companies
generally don't say hey you know what I
want you two to do this thing it's up to
you to take that initiative you know you
go into a mailroom as the example that I
gave you someone isn't going to tell you
like I wanted you to fix this you take
the initiative and start doing it
yourself and then other people will look
at it and go like you know and they'll
really appreciate that so some companies
do help you with things like you know
you know we're talking with the
leadership you know in the technical
part of master discover and influence
just helping you know the company
helping you to come to a conference and
be present is their way of actually
helping you as well so they do help out
in those areas as well but it's
generally not seen as much any other
question
yes yep yeah I see and that's where this
whole you know you look at this chart
over here around and the Tannenbaum
should continue it's a lot of people it
starts over there where you tell people
what to do and how to do it right and
you've got the complete authority the
manager has got that complete authority
and at this point in time they don't
have the skills so we need to help in
facilitating them develop those skills
as well so you don't want to set them up
for failure so you know don't give them
something that they don't know how to do
and this thing it can you do it and so
over a period of time you make sure that
they have the necessary skills it may
not happen right away so this this could
be like over a period of two to three
years when the team is completely
self-sufficient and then you you don't
even have to be there and they'll
they'll do everything themselves so some
of these things just can't don't happen
overnight it'll takes a period now and
the other thing is like this this thing
about trust that that I actually said
and you know the same thing with you you
said hey how do I actually trust this
person can do as good a job as I ask me
and you know I've been surprised a lot
of times when you you tell someone what
you need get what what needs to be done
and and they get it done rather than you
know telling them how to how to get it
done because they'll count some new and
innovative techniques I can think of one
example where you know I was in a team
where we automated everything that need
to be done when we use PowerShell for so
there is this one there's one job we
couldn't automate through partial
because it had a web interface and that
was the only thing there was no API or
anything you had to go into the web go
in search for this place and go click on
this button click on that button set
these flags so on and so the when an
intern joined the team that one of the
guys who was really good
partial that'll be really good idea to
actually get the internet to do this
hard grunt to work off of of going in
and clicking all these buttons and then
sitting it up so I was gonna be busy for
a few days but he said oh you know and
he said why he said like hey you know
what we automate everything and I can't
be bothered doing this myself I can't be
do you know clicking all these buttons
and he gave it to this person right this
person went in and he used he did some
web automation thing where they go and
wrote the scripts and got this whole
thing done and the end of the day comes
over and said I've got it done he goes
like what how do you get it done
you're pleasantly surprised right and
that's this good thing so sometimes we
need to kind of like let go of that
control it's sort of really hard to do
and trust someone tell them you know
what needs to be rather than how but
again you got to be careful of the task
that you're giving you know obviously
there are certain things you just cannot
give it to people highly important
things and you don't want to stop them
up like I said if something goes wrong
it's totally your fault
so you need to be prepared to take that
as well yeah cool
any other questions all right is there
are no other questions we'll call it a
wrap thanks for coming everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
