afternoon better I would say with this
talk is huh I think the thing that puts
people off this talk with and they don't
come to this talk is that the title
nowadays if you want people to come to
the talk your title like this
now that's a much better title right
because it's got all the right words for
people to come to a talk right got
microservices containers and darker
anyway thank you for showing up and this
talk is a where's my free lunch there
isn't I think after this you'll probably
have free drinks but it's probably going
to be some of the cheapest beer and wine
you get because when these free parties
they don't give you the good stuff you
know got to pay for that
and some some things I shouldn't say out
loud anyway let's start so we live in a
world of free right and probably in our
industry we're very accustomed to living
in a world of free we are surrounded by
many free things free services we have
free source hosting providers we have
binary hosting providers that are free
you know name it bin tray Mable Center
all of these things are free we have
continuous integration services that are
free we have email that is free who pays
for their email service here right there
you go you weirdo we have website
hosting that is free and we even have
SSL certificates that are free which
allows phishing attempts now to be
secure which is fantastic right and all
of these free services follow what's
called the upsell business model which
essentially means that you use something
for free you provide a paid version with
some more features and you pray that
people buy your better version sometimes
this works sometimes it does not now
that's a very traditional business model
there is of course the unicorn business
model how many of you are familiar with
this business model so the Unicorn
business model I can explain it in code
because that way you'll all understand
right you create a product or service
and you get users then you go through a
series of rounds you try and get VC
rounds you burn cash as fast as possible
if you try and do a valuation if it is
good you are
IPO if not you just get another round if
you run out of letters then you can do a
B and a C
and AD and so on and so forth and if the
shit hits the fan and you end up with
nothing no money nothing
there's always hacking used to write a
blog post about you setting up a VC and
here's what happened next okay but if
you think about it VCS are absolutely
beautifully awesome in fact there was a
letter by a lady called a selfish love
letter to venture capitalist in which
she was demonstrating how she saves
money every month because of venture
capitalists right she pays she probably
doesn't pay for a whole bunch of
services a whole other bunch of services
she's getting at a very discounted rate
and she can basically get anything she
wants without having to pay that much
money and if you think about it VCS are
awesome and nowadays you don't even have
to have a good idea to be backed by VC's
right I mean how do you know snapchat
like who would have thought that I can
take a picture and don't even have to
store it and there you go but I mean I
get money for it you can just come up
with ideas in fact you can just take
existing ideas and adapt them you know I
can do like it's like Airbnb for
hamsters you create something you say
it's like Airbnb for hamsters or we
should uber eyes cat shaving you don't
even have to come up with an idea
yourself there's a website that you can
go to and you can just randomly generate
ideas and website and teams and people
for your startup company and then go and
say there you go give me some VC funding
so you like stroke like never before or
meat magazine me you know manage your
organization's magazine online with our
cloud software it even generates the
tagline for you you don't even need
ideas so but I had an idea cuz I'm good
at that right and I said why don't I
come up with Fitbit for dogs people love
dogs
unfortunately that already exists it's
called fit Park and you can put a Fitbit
on a dog and you can go walking with
your dog and then you can share your
dog's accomplishment with other dogs and
they can unlock badges and you know say
I got the bark badge
and of course we build all of these
systems in this software on free
ecosystems right we have free libraries
that we don't have to pay for why should
we it's free if free frameworks that we
don't have to pay for why should we it's
free it doesn't matter that they change
versions every two days it's free and
it's all open source in fact how many of
you are familiar here with JavaScript
and how many of you have to work with
JavaScript my condolences there is a
website well I'm sure you all know are
familiar with NPM which is the node
package manager and the registry hit a
billion downloads a week and stop to
catch its breath then carried on growing
now you think about that for a moment
there is a registry somewhere out there
that has no SLA that has absolutely no
guarantees and is hitting a billion
downloads a week and it is providing
packages for people running mission
critical software right and nowadays
people don't even grab their
dependencies and putting it in their
version control so that they can have
the same build over and over again no
they just fetch the latest version every
time they do a new build and you are
most sure you're familiar with what
happened at some point where someone
basically took 11 lines of JavaScript
and deleted the package because that was
actually a package it looks something
like a left pad right and they got upset
at the NPM and they deleted the package
and it took down millions of other
packages because there's millions of
packages that depend on it and systems
were breaking and everyone was bitching
at the person saying how dare you do
this and there was a whole other group
of people bitching at NPM saying how
dare did you let them do this and there
was another one saying what are you
bitching about but how dare you anyway
right and nobody thought wait why was I
depending on this anyway to begin with
where was my SLA oh it wasn't there and
we build all of these systems on trust
right we just go to docker and we
download all of these containers and we
all how many of you actually analyze
everything that's installed in a darker
container before you build on top of
your own dock
container right you do because that's
your thing but generally we don't even
think about the software that's being
installed in Dockers just oh where is it
some registry that's bringing it down
it's awesome it is free it is fantastic
the reality though of course is that we
all know that we're paying right we're
paying because that is an OSS project
and we don't know who maintains it how
long it's going to be maintained for and
what happens if they get bored right we
don't think about this we say oh it's
open source if if someone abandons it I
will take over the project how many open
source projects have you taken over how
many times have you moaned and
complained that oh the latest version of
your open source project that I'm using
isn't compatible with the latest version
of.net core right how many of you do
pull requests that's pretty good that's
four people
that's fantastic what about the
infrastructure where's my SLA why I
haven't signed any essays with packaged
repositories I haven't I haven't signed
any essays with anything that I'm
basically maintaining for free but it's
ok it's fine right and that VC PAC
service that we're all using that we're
all loving at some point they are going
to want to cash out and when they do
cash out they want money right they're
not nice I mean that there can't be nice
people but they're not doing it for love
right if not asked Twitter and you know
at the end of the day you think about it
who is responsible for my availability
who is responsible for everything that I
am using and I am deploying to my
customers and my customers are relying
on who is responsible for it if you're
not sure there is a website you can go
to it and it tells you ok now you say
but it's ok things don't happen more or
less things are going ok things aren't
shutting down in fact there's like daily
a hundred companies in Silicon Valley
that are shutting down some of them we
hear of some of them we don't rethink DB
was shut down well it was brought up
again by someone else 35 millions in
three rounds I used to use this it was
the most all
something in the world it was an Android
Start menu thing it was called
everything me and it was revolving
everything around me for narcissist it
was fantastic and it had three rounds
thirty-five million dollars in funding
15 million users and it shot down why
well they didn't really think of a
business model right but truly if you
think about the majority of the services
that you're using today the majority of
systems that you're using today probably
many of them don't have a business model
and if they do some of them aren't very
working very well right because someone
at some point said get a lot of users
and you'll get a lot of revenue and then
they realized that's not actually
entirely true and of course this isn't
only about free software and free
services we also have a lot of free
information at our disposal so this is a
Spanish newspaper it's called El Mundo
it's the only one that thinks it's not
left-wing and it's not right-wing but it
wants to be left-wing and sometimes it's
right-wing it's in Spain now this is
what I usually see when I go to El Mundo
okay this is what my mother would see if
she went to al mundo right because she
kind of doesn't have an ad blocker right
there I've got a local newspaper which
is this right but that's not that's El
Mundo as well that's like when they have
a promotion where is the news it's right
behind that blocker thing okay so you
know you say that's not a big deal I use
ad blocker
that's my local newspaper like I don't
even know that that's a newspaper until
I get rid of everything now how many of
you use an ad blocker it's fantastic
right it's the best thing how many of
you pay for news okay one person so now
when you go to a site you get like quote
of the day and then it gives you a delay
in it says oh you've got an ad blocker
you go to Bloomberg and it says oh we've
detected that you have an ad blocker why
don't you please unblock this and you're
like this is ridiculous this is
disgusting you know what I will do I
will go
and open the chrome debugger and I will
find that div and I will disable that
div and I will show these bastards that
I know best and I will read their
information right and you're like how
long did that take you well it took me
an hour and a half first time but it was
so satisfying right and the Telegraph
The Telegraph is a British newspaper you
know if you read five articles which you
really can't read more than five
articles on the Telegraph it like says
okay you've had enough so what do you do
if you don't pay you're going incognito
mode you say hey here you go now I get
my other five articles and it's
fantastic then there's a more subtle
approach it's kind of like the Guardian
that says hey you know it's all over
here we're learning you read this and
we're really really nice people and for
what you could pay for us for a month is
probably what you're paying for a double
macchiato latte it's just five euros and
you're like yeah but that's a double
latte macchiato
you know you imagine if I pay this
that's one less a month yeah but you
drink that in ten minutes and you could
spend seven hours it's really it tastes
nice right so we end up in this
situation where like you know we're just
using ad blockers and we're just getting
the information and we're thinking
everything is OK in fact two out of
three young Millennials now use an ad
blocker now there's a twist that happens
here because adblock plus now is selling
ads now none of us saw that coming did
we right but the reality is that we are
praying we are praying and we are paying
we are paying because we are degrading
the quality of information that we are
receiving right everyone and their
mother is a journalist now right it's
all about click bait and we're blurring
the line between news content and
marketing so a lot of sites that you go
to they call it native advertising right
which is another form of I've just
pushed paid content into a website okay
so some places you see it very clearly
like yep this is advertising that's
advertising
some places you don't see it that
clearly right you see a little kind of
like oh yeah
sponsored features they don't call it
advertising they don't call it ads they
don't put flash they just put it like
sponsored features and you're kind of
thinking wait who's this sponsored by
what is it about is it actual factual
news or not whatever what is it that I'm
reading now ads are fantastic right and
there are companies like Facebook says
that they will force advertising on ad
blocking users it doesn't matter right
because that is their revenue model
that's how they make money
but you say it doesn't matter because I
don't even need this stuff anymore I
don't even need new sites anymore
because I live in a world of social
media where I get my news from Twitter
and other places because social media
has given us all a voice were all
reporters we can all do like videos and
pictures and blast that information out
without any context but we can blast it
out and we say we know everything
firsthand right
news is essentially crowd-sourced now it
depends what type of news you get is
where you are located what your world
garden is right if you're on snapchat
you're probably drunk and you don't care
anyway if you're on Twitter you're
getting the news that's relevant to your
circle of friends and those that you
want to criticize if you're on Facebook
I'm not on Facebook but if you were you
would get news from your family and blah
blah blah of course it's all tailored to
who you follow who you don't follow what
you read what you don't follow if you're
on Google+ probably the only person but
there's probably something there as well
and like so you've all seen advertising
and things around you know former
Facebook workers we routinely suppress
conservative news and you know Mark
Zuckerberg came on and said that is
absolutely false we do not suppress
anything we do not there are no people
working there surprising news right and
then it says oh no you know we allow for
a culture to foster and allow people to
talk about anything they want and we are
very open and blah blah blah and then
Facebook photo of man cradling six Sun
and shower repeatedly removed by
social network why it's pornography
apparently right or breastfeeding
removed why it's pornography
apparently so wait a minute who is to
decide what is valid and what is not
right and if you are removing some
things how do I know about the cases
that you're not removing how do I know
about what is actually coming into my
feet or not coming into my feet I'm sure
you're all aware of this one Mark
Zuckerberg accused of abusing power of
Facebook
after a Dilys named palm girl post what
it was a girl naked right little girl
naked we can't have the world see that
do you know why you heard about this
because some newspaper in Norway made a
big deal about it and they put it back
and they said we apologize right it was
artificial intelligence that did this
and then Facebook apparently fired the
trending team and algorithm when hue
without humans go crazy right now I'm
not picking on Facebook this is just an
example this happens everywhere all the
time and then they introduce these
things like timelines and moments you
know give you the information that
matters the most to you it's about your
needs showing what you care about first
who is deciding what I care about first
you with these platforms are succumbing
to their walled garden and you are
creating we are creating our own world
garden where we are getting the
information that we believe matters to
us and never seen opposing facts never
seeing the other side of the story never
seeing the back story never seen the
context we don't think about all of that
do we we don't think when we see a tweet
that says person did something really
awful and what do we do we retweet and
say oh my god did you see this and then
someone else and so this is disgusting
and then the next thing we know
something's growing up and you know some
some company has to apologize for
something without even understanding the
underlying context we just see what we
want to see and we share and who it
really is in control and then of course
there's all this thing around the fake
right you know the rise on rise of fake
news now we know that fake news is fake
or is it fake or is it really not fake
we don't know if it's fake but
apparently Google is introducing
fact-checking feature intended to help
people see where the news is actually
true now this is not bad this is
actually good this could be a good thing
but then again it goes back to who
behind this is deciding what is true and
what is wrong because even if it is an
algorithm it's being written by someone
and we'll see that that actually is a
big problem and where is our balance of
judgement right we have this compromise
a confirmation bias
it is real when we see some news even
when we want to do a fact check what do
we do we tend to go towards what we
believe will give us what we want to
hear right we don't look at a tweet how
many of you when you see a tweet that
says something awful actually click on
it read through the entire thread see if
there is someone that is saying the
opposite or saying that what you're
claiming is absolutely false
before retweeting before sharing yeah
very few of us why because we share and
we forget and there is actually papers
that says that reducing controversy by
connecting opposing views yes if we read
opposing views the problem is that often
we do not end up reading of opposing
views
why don't we because we have information
overload do you honestly want me every
time I see a tweet to sit there and
analyze everything before I share it
with my social network to say whether
it's true or not it's impossible I've
got a job but I need to get the news out
there so that everyone is aware of the
bad things or the good things that are
happening whether it's true or not I
need to get it out there but don't
expect me to contrast it now how many of
you are familiar with Orwell right
obviously you all familiar with this
book 1984 which he talks about a Big
Brother er that you know that
something's watching you and there's
control and there censorship and
fortunately we all know that that was a
lie it's a myth it's not happening it
hasn't happened how many of you have
heard of Hawkes
so Huxley wrote another book right and
in it he talked about something
different he talked about a controlled
population right and he talked at the
book was called the brave new world
so he wrote this book in 1932 where he
was talking about a controlled
population where he would control birth
right so you would say oh I want people
that are very smart and I want people
that aren't very smart that will go into
another lot and you know genetically
modifying human being well we know
that's not possible thankfully oh wait
it is and then he talked about a world
in which there was a lot of amusement
people were constantly amused they were
taking drugs and just constantly you
know high and having intercourse and
just having a lot of fun right and not
really caring about the big issues in
life well we know that's not true
thankfully and of course he was also
talking about artificial procreation
which we know that's not true thankfully
also and this was a book he wrote in
1932 right and there's another book
which is by Neil postman that's called
amusing ourselves to death how many of
you have read that right definitely read
that book right and he Neil postman is
talking about the era of television
primarily for the time he wrote this and
in it this is a an extract from the book
which is the only thing I read he says
what fear all well feared were those who
would ban books what Huxley feared was
that there would be no reason to ban a
book for there would be no one who would
want to read one all well feared those
who would deprive of us of information
Huxley feared those who would give us so
much information that we will be reduced
to passivity and egoism oh yeah all
right that's true overall feared that
the truth would be concealed from us
Huxley feared that the truth would be
drowned in a sea of irrelevance Orwell
feared we would become a captive culture
Huxley feared we would become a trivial
culture preoccupied with some equivalent
of the Feelies the orgy Porgy and the
centrifugal bumble-puppy in short all
were feared that what we hate will ruin
us Huxley feared that what we love will
ruin us this book is about the
possibility that Hux well not all he was
right unfortunately for us they were
both right yes we're getting the best
of all and we're paying because we're
sacrificing our time right we've got so
much information we've got so much news
we don't even know what to do anymore
and we're creating an unhealthy
environment where trolls are fostering
and lives are being destroyed because we
have this culture of share and forget
right I have seen numerous I'm sure you
are all aware of the situation of that
lady that was getting on a plane in
South heading to South Africa and she
was in Heathrow Airport and she tweeted
and said I'm getting on a plane to South
Africa hope I don't catch aids I'm just
kidding I'm white now in any context
that could be taken as sarcasm it really
could be who knows whether it was
sarcasm or not she claims it was but
what happened that lady's life was
absolutely completely destroyed it was
completely destroyed she was fired she
was targeted she was dogs
she was not allowed another job anymore
and she hid away for two years on
people's sofas until she managed to
slowly get her life back together again
and for us what was it a retweet oh my
god and move on tomorrow something else
comes along right and we're seeing this
over and over again whether it's in our
industry whether it's not in our
industry we are continuously judging
people without properly looking at facts
and making decisions and forming
opinions without properly looking at all
sides and understanding the context and
why well we just don't have time so if
we don't why share because they're
relevant is becoming now relevant and
that is in information and we've got
free services we've got free information
and we've got free application anything
you can think of there's an app for that
what do I eat there's an app for it
when do I do exercise and when do I sit
on my ass there's an app for it when do
I do work and where do I procrastinate
there's an app for it there's an app for
it there's an app for it
that sits in my taskbar and every five
minutes I kid you not I use it it says
sit up straight because I crouched I sit
up straight right there's an app for it
yes there's actually a device you can
buy that you hook into your back and if
it sees you crouch it gives you electric
shock right now that that is awesome
but imagine where that information might
end up where do I go and who else is
going to be there there's an app for it
anything you can think of there's an app
for it that is Google Rights right
scroll on my phone right it's ok Google
whatever I use it it's awesome it tells
me absolutely everything I need to know
for my day right it tells me where I am
how do I translate based on the language
I'm going to things that I'm interested
in and please don't judge me things that
I'm not interested in this is Google
trips it's also right I installed it I
said it said do you want to connect this
to your Google account
I said yes instantly I had everything
like literally instantly I had all my
past trips dating back 12 years I had my
upcoming trips I had my ticket
information I had my hotel reservations
I had everything it's not that it took
time to process it's that it had all of
this information process this was just a
beautiful UI on everything that it
already had and all of these other
applications have this information and
you wonder with what what and what
they're doing with it and of course you
know that your assistant like everyone
has an assistant whether it's Google
whatever right
your assistant knows you now they want
to know your family as well right we've
all got an Amazon I call we've got you
know whether you say ok Google you say
hey Siri oh say yo Alexa everyone has an
assistant now that does anything and
they know absolutely everything about us
which is fantastic in fact Mattel
thought this is such a fantastic idea
that they wanted to build an Alexa for
kids yes because putting an Alexa inside
and ten-year-olds room is exactly what
we need for the future
right wrong keeper apparently was
secretly tracking you around the clock
and sending your data to advertisers
what do I eat I don't know what it's
doing Facebook is using smartphones to
listen to what people say professor
suggests is it true is it fake I don't
know they'll say no facial recognition
will soon end your anonymity right there
is actually an application in Russia
that is built by a couple of Russian
folks they have in Russia they've got
their own Facebook which is called VK
contact here and you I've tried it you
go around you take a picture of someone
in the street and it tells you who that
person is right what does it do it
contacts VK looks up the pictures
matches the person and gives you the
information there's no ill intent in
that but hey it's there the technology
is there already you heard about this
case know that Amazon echo witnessed the
murder and the police said we want to
talk to your Amazon echo right like and
it makes you wonder like you know I just
said something at home is anybody
actually listening to what I said now
this is going even further because we've
got the Internet of Things absolutely
everything now is connected everything
right there's a smart tampon because the
Internet of every single thing must be
stopped and LG threatens to go why fire
in every appliance it introduces in 2017
look read that headline it threatens
like you've seen that picture of you
know you walk into your kitchen and
you've been held ransom by your toaster
your fridge your telephone because
they're all asking for ransom wearing
bitcoins right I'm not gonna let you
open your fridge coz hey and we're
paying right because we're basically
sacrificing our privacy and I say we
because I'm doing it myself we're
sacrificing our privacy for convenience
that is it it is
way more convenient for me to say ok
Google or ok Amazon oh ok what where can
I get a good beer oh I know where you
are I'll tell you where to go bla bla
bla bla bla bla right and all of these
car providers all of these companies
were also you know everyone's saying
you've got artificial intelligence now
it's amazing and you get all of this
power and just let us process it of
course we all know that if we're not
paying for the product we are the
product we're helping shape it and it's
fine it's a conscious decision you want
to make make it but I just often feel
like maybe even I'm forgetting that and
we hope we hope that our data will never
be used against us sold or hacked that
is our hope that is not the reality
though data has been stolen data can be
hacked david has been sold and who knows
if data is going to be used against us
you're all familiar with the safe harbor
right there was a was a thingy between
EU and the u.s. that said that you know
the data of EU citizens should be can be
transferred back and forth and some
person took Facebook to court and safe
harbor collapsed right and then they
came out with another thing called
privacy shield which is a
self-certifying system which is absolute
nonsense because the government's aren't
agreeing on this I can get my data back
and forth everywhere there is no
protection no protection whatsoever so
who knows what you say now can or cannot
be used against you tomorrow
now Bruce now said the server incident
is the business model of the internet we
build systems that spy on people in
exchange for services corporations call
it marketing essentially that is it I
mean the web experience today is a
fantastic I search for product on Amazon
I buy it and then I spent six months
like saying Oh would you like to buy a
fridge no I already bought one what
would you like to buy a fridge no I
already bought one at this point you're
like why don't you just all talk to each
other so you know I bought that damn
fridge and you stopped harassing me and
I could you know offer me a coffeemaker
or something
instead but that is our experience this
is like walking into a shop right and
then walking out and then the shop
that's a person constantly chasing you
down the street every day and then
calling you say you walked into sure we
used to call themselves car salespeople
right now we've got them all over the
internet now
whatsapp said that the user is going to
receive adverse when they bought
whatsapp they said that they said no
we're gonna keep everything separate and
so gonna be okay and blah blah blah
why because ads sell apparently so they
sell and then we find out that well some
of the numbers are overestimated blah
blah blah but who cares like it's
fantastic since you can't really measure
it you just put this amazing all you
know estimations and say oh yeah you
spent $1 and you generated $600,000 in
revenue like who's telling me this the
same person that's selling you the ads
oh maybe what if I put $2 yes you're
gonna generate one me point two million
dollars in revenue what is that money
doesn't matter just put $2 in it's great
so the same people that are selling us
ads are providing us with the statistics
of how much money we're making based on
the ads they're selling us kind of thing
wait a minute here maybe I should get a
third-party opinion on this now you said
it doesn't matter I don't care like I
don't care if they bombard me with a
phrase like I have nothing absolutely to
hide and to respond to that the only
thing that I can say is what Edward
Snowden said that its head arguing that
you don't care about the right to
privacy because you have nothing to hide
it's no different than saying you don't
care about freedom of speech because you
have nothing to say that's essentially
it I've got nothing to hide you don't
know if you have anything to hide or not
what you thought was innocent can be
used against you and I'm not talking
about legally used against you I'm
talking about that thing you said about
your colleague or your boss or they said
about you or what have you we all have
secrets they're just different scales of
Secrets I asked recently on a Twitter
poll I got like 500 responses which they
say that's enough for accuracy right
privacy but no actually there is an
estimation that says over 500 the margin
of error is so minimal that it's it's
enough so don't have time to read
privacy policies don't understand them
don't care about privacy how many of you
read privacy policies in detail
every time you download an app or we use
a website or use a service how many
times do you up when they say we've
updated our privacy policy you're like
okay let me do it if even if you do
there is so many ways to work things
that it looks innocent but it really
isn't one of the companies that does
freedom I'm sure you've heard of this
story where they offered free Wi-Fi in
London for a period of a week and in it
they said under the terms and conditions
you use free Wi-Fi in exchange you will
give us your first born your firstborn
child belongs to us everyone accepted it
only one person called and said what is
this about the kid right nobody reads
privacy policies nobody and with things
like GDP are coming into effect even
less people will read privacy policies
hopefully the intention with that is to
fix it and you say well they won't use
it at 1 against us they won't sell it
NHS shares medical records of 1.6
million patients with Google as part of
data sharing agreement it's anonymous I
don't care ok it's anonymous great it
really was anonymous fine what happens
when it's not anonymous what happens
when the run keepers and apps that
control your what you eat and the apps
that control what you how you sit
connect to companies that make money
such as insurance companies and they say
well actually you know your back looks
like it's gonna go to health so we're
not gonna insure you there is no way for
us to know this there is no way for us
to know this and say what we'll sue no
you can't even sue an insurance company
nowadays even if they blatantly say we
don't like you they don't have to insure
you
the US government starts asking foreign
travelers to disclose their social media
accounts yes if you've ever been to the
US you fill out if you're under the visa
waiver program you're under a thingy
called the es esta right which is a
another way of charging $14 for
something that before was free and under
there now there's like Twitter account
in
Pinterest account at least they've taken
it up a notch and they ask for github
account as well you're gonna look at my
source code
really now you're gonna judge whether I
can go on out to the US because I do a
proper implementation of something I use
JavaScript but don't hold that against
me right and you start someone there
like it really does question should I
say what I was gonna freely say the
other day on the Internet should I maybe
that might be misinterpreted maybe I
shouldn't even if it's the most innocent
thing in the world this is a reality
China plans to organize its society
relies society relies on big data to
rate everyone I'm sure you've all seen
that episode of black mirror right yeah
which is where everyone was wearing an
implant chip and you would run into
someone and you would rate them and then
once you've dropped below like 2.5 you
were dead to society this isn't that
this is along those lines right Roomba
the thing that cleans your room is now
wants to map your house and potentially
sell that to advertising I see you don't
have a carpet big enough
would you like a carpet right you need
to polish your marble floors and but
fortunately we do have people in power
that understand the needs and they'll
help us solve these problems right as
the UK Home Secretary amber rod says
real people don't need end-to-end
decryption so in summary and you might
be wondering like what is my point with
this I have a single concise point we
are screwed
Frank and the bad news is that this is
not an episode of Black Mirror right in
fact though author of black mirrors one
time to each it said that shit's too
dark even for me to make an episode and
this is being led by many things but one
of the things that is being led by is
this culture of just free we are in this
society in which we are come to expect
that everything should be free and this
sense of entitlement that you know like
is it free no then why do I care and we
need to start thinking about sustainable
models right we need to start thinking
about sustainable models for our privacy
and I'm not just talking about paying to
not give privacy but thinking about how
we can continue to innovate how we can
continue to use and leverage artificial
intelligence how we can continue to use
the power of technology but not
sacrifice our privacy when we do it we
need to start thinking about these
things we need to start thinking about
it for our well-being because it can
lead us down a dark road both
emotionally and financially because as
much as we want to duck our head in the
sand and say oh yeah well I saw a gif of
this robot that tipped over and I'm not
worried about my future and everything's
gonna be okay it's not right this is not
about scare mongering but artificial
intelligence is real it is here and it's
happening and it's not only about jobs
like do you remember the story of
Foxconn Foxconn was a company that was
in China that was manufacturing parts
for I believe it was iPhone and there
was a lot of suicides right what did
they do they address the problem in many
ways one of them was to put large nets
in the hole in the
where people would jump from right
that's sad but that's what they did do
you know what they've done now they've
replaced the majority of workforce
workforce with robots right they don't
have to worry about the emotion or
overworking and you start to wonder ok
where did all those people go are they
the ones designing the robots don't
think so but the bigger problem with
artificial intelligence is the influence
it can have right there's a good article
that you should read it's called the
rise of the weaponized AI propaganda
machine there's a new automated
propaganda machine driving global
politics how it works and what it will
mean for the future of democracy and if
you think about it right if we see a
tweet about something in our circle in
our industry in our area and we don't
even take the time to analyze that how
are we going to be aware of the reality
of global politics and who's driving
this and how they're using it or not
using it against us the other day I came
across this video which you can watch
which essentially an AI can take a video
of someone like Barack Obama and lip
sync it and say completely different
message to what originally it was saying
how many we might question this right we
might question this but many other
people won't right in fact I even made
them a slight mistake the other day
someone that I kind of respect in the
world of privacy blah blah blah that
this person tweeted something where they
were showing that a certain tweet by a
certain person someone clicked on the
like and it stayed and then another
tweet they clicked on the like which on
a controversial like and the like went
on and it went off right and then they
went and clicked on the Twitter like on
the next message it stayed and then they
went back and they clicked again on the
like of that tweet and it went on and it
went off and the message was why are you
not letting me show support for XYZ
why are you you know removing the likes
on a certain tweet why are to it why are
you doing this and this person that
supposedly is a authorities in this area
you know retweeted this and I made the
immediate mistake of retweeting and then
I said wait a minute this can't be the
case and open two browser windows you
can simulate this exact behavior right
or use your phone and a browser and you
can simulate this exact behavior it's
not even hacking it's simple but you put
that in front of people that are not
tech savvy and what will they say oh my
god look what they're doing right and
this is really dangerous and the other
issue is that artificial intelligence is
biased and there's studies demonstrating
that it is biased if we as society are
biased we are creating machines that are
biased if we as society are biased we
are giving data that is biased right you
this picture was identifying the
gentleman on the left as a criminal and
the one on the right as a non criminal
and in fact it was the opposite because
we're feeding data that is already
biased right we're taking the criminal
population now and saying here you go
there you go and the Machine is like
well yeah but based on the criminal
population you're feeding me there you
go now you imagine systems in place that
are going to judge us and you know
sentence us based on AI biases that
we've created ourselves so you wonder
what can I do nothing we're screwed
but what we can do is think that we are
not only the consumers here we are not
only playing the role of the consumer we
actually have a possibility because we
are also creators of this and we cannot
just brush this off and say well given
that I can't really do anything about
this I'm not gonna give it much more
thought you know someone else will come
along and solve this problem because if
we're so active and we care so much
about some of the smaller things in life
this is one of them because this is
really not only our future for our kids
futures everyone's future and as I
always say to my kids as well like don't
put things on Instagram don't put things
on the internet don't because you don't
know what's gonna happen in ten years
and you don't know what they're gonna do
with that data in ten years and I'll
finish off with a quote from Jurassic
Park where he says your scientists were
so preoccupied with whether or not they
could they never stopped to think if
they should thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
