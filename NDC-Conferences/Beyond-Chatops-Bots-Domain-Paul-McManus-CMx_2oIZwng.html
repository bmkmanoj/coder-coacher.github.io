I'm going to talk about ten bots that we
use a domain or rather 10 techniques for
using BOTS which we see implemented
quite a bit bots have become really
popular mainly because they're useful
and yeah you can get a little utility
atom out of them I my intention for this
talk is for you to go away with a couple
of ideas for BOTS you want to install
yourself or what you want to build
yourself and so I hope to inspire you
during this so what I'm not going to do
is what I'm not going to talk about
these types of BOTS which you often see
built for things like facebook Messenger
where you build BOTS for consumers to
come and use we've got one of these the
domain facebook messenger bot no one
uses it because the AI is stupid there's
no good anyway it's they're difficult to
use and so let's just skip over that but
where bots are really useful for
developers because bots are kind of like
a glorified command-line tool where we
can all come together collaborate on in
the tool where you slack but many tools
work and yet do things collaboratively
so let's start with number 10 first and
simplest by use case that you'll come
across is the classic chat ops where
you're getting information post it
pushed into your chat tool examples that
we use are things like ops Jania new
relic kingdom the nice thing about it is
you can stay in the flow stay in your
are chat tool you don't need to be going
out checking different systems
information comes to you you can also
use it for things like application
monitoring so Raygun is an error
monitoring tool use and whenever new
areas come up no applications they get
pushed straight to our dev teams which
is useful mobile teams I mean so they
say that they can also get their reviews
from ios and android coming straight
into their channels and they can act on
them very quickly and so that's good but
soon you're going to start wanting to
build your own things and so one things
that we see is you know we all these
offline task processes are they're
constantly running and doing things on
our behalf you might be triggering
emails or load files rather than doing
that one thing that we started doing is
pushing that information straight into
our slack channels so for example we
sponsor the block we have things that
listings or features and our listings
that can go live at certain times when
they when they shown on the site so
often our marketing team want to know
exactly when these new features or
listings have gone live so rather than
try to write scripts that spam emails we
push it straight into slack channels
everyone who's interested can just watch
and be alerted when that's happened when
new accounts are created on one of our
applications such as my desktop it comes
straight into our into our team's
channels and when feedback is received
through the website it also quickly
notifies our teams one of the cool
things about this one is there's a link
right down the bottom there it says
click to create a support ticket and so
if that feedback is you know reporting a
legitimate bug it's really easy to go
ahead create the ticket and here and in
this case it will then get notified yet
but it's been created to anyone else who
sees that can go and subscribe to it
listen to that ticket listen to that
issue so something else we do quite a
bit is query in our API so if you're
like domain you have many many micro
services your your data stored in many
databases all over the place one of the
one of the tools I built a little while
back is something I called domain bot
and it's used to actually query those
micro services and pull information into
your chat tool that you might be
interested in looking up so on domain we
search for properties in this example
I'm going to say domain bytes search for
search postcode two zero eight eight and
it's going to give me back the first few
examples of results you can grab a
listing ID from there and you can say
hey domain buck give me information
about that listing and it will also pull
me back the information about that
listing this could be useful for like
your your support team so they're not
having to jump out and find different
information through admin tools or
portals at all it's all in the one place
lastly one last example you can do an
agency search for a particular suburb
and it will bring you back some
information one of the if you've ever
worked in a classified site like domain
you know there's a lot of logic that
goes into where certain results are
ranked in the list and so this is a nice
easy way to test the ranking algorithm
and see what score a particular suburb
or results it gets so the product
manager in this case can understand why
one listing appears above another in
search results
one thing when other places been useful
is when you start building a new API so
a little while back we were playing with
Google vision and so rather than having
to go and build a full-on interface we
can let our product team or marketing
team understand how you might use this
tool we just hooked up we built the
market service hooked up a little API to
talk to it and so you could say a vision
for this listing give me a shot of the
bathroom and it will give you the
results from that micro service or about
if that's what you're interested in that
the point being that it's it's useful
little way to demonstrate functionality
without having to build a whole
application or interface around it
something else you do we do and I'm sure
you do regularly you you you write
reports you need to pull information
from third-party services and collect
them in one place for us for me
something sometimes what we need to do
is write up time reports we use Pingdom
to give us our uptime reports rather
than having to go out to the website
collect the information we read a little
but which will pull you back the
relevant information very quickly say
for our desktop side or for our search
funnel return-path is where we keep
track of our email score send a
reputation we rather than having to go
out to that site we can quickly look up
the data get a pulled straight to us in
slack and this is our CTO he's
interested in the Fairfax share price so
he'd build a way to quickly pull that in
absorb who is lookups whatever you want
something it's not really talked related
but is being popular as well is social
BOTS so this one you can go and install
in your own slack it's like a team if if
you're interested in it's called donut
basically we've got a channel called
coffee buddies everyone jumps into the
coffee buddy Channel once every two
weeks you get paired up with someone
else in the coffee buddy Channel and you
go out and have a doughnut or have
coffee similarly last year we introduced
Secret Santa bot your throw ever anymore
in Channel and it would hook you up with
other people who would be your Secret
Santa recipient one of the nice things
about BOTS that you know isn't obvious
initially is that you can use it to
enrich conversation so domain but for
example will listen to any channel that
it's in looking for that DW one three
eight five eight they've got that reject
pattern and it will go off to JIRA and
pull out a summary and post it into the
channel that the person has just
mentioned it so Luke valve an can go
ahead and just say buh-bye about this
about this ticket it will give you a bit
of information so now people know what
it's about
I built this before Atlassian released
there but which does exactly the same
thing so you don't need my one you can
go and install a license one now which
will do that as well there's like what's
useful this as well this is something
you know a little hack you can put in
place you can get slack bot to listen
for particular strings and return back
with information so if anyone says
address of Melbourne office it will just
post it back into the channel you're in
you can do that with things like
intranet links or I don't know whatever
else you regularly see people ask for
just grab the text to make it an
automated reply and I'll last taketh on
our our sales someone for our sales team
got together with a with the data team
and put together what they call the
sales insight point now this is it's
pretty cool so imagine Rogers I had to
hide the agents name here you'll see why
in a minute they're not doing so well
but but the imagine your sales guy is
out on the road they're about to go in
and meet with the they're one of the cut
clients a real estate agent they want to
get a bit of information around that
about that agent Roger can now jump into
slack and say give me insight on this
agent and the direct inbox please please
wait we do a magical data thingamajig
ease and then we return back things like
their relative market share over the
last month or two and so very quickly
you can start getting information about
the agent and then it kind of looks at
what has been sold what products are
available in that agents area and it
will say consider selling available top
spot student double Bay to gain more
exposure so it gives them very quick
tools they can use without you know just
on their on their mobile phone deploy
BOTS so something that is now pretty
standard or become instant in our teams
is that we do our deployments via slack
and what's cool about that is that
anyone in the team can see when anyone
else is deploying it's all transparent
there's no or what just happened in
production it's all right there in front
of you so as soon as someone commits to
a particular branch master for example
our Jenkins will pick it up will push it
into staging and
you say you then have the option to
promote it to production so there's a
little drop-down box down the bottom
that says choose a method of which you
can choose blue green deployments or
just replace all the containers in one
hip you do that it will go ahead and all
say eventually will come back and say
deployment has succeeded and at that
point you can either press a button to
rollback or to leave it in prod so we've
kind of moved all of our control of our
production environment right back into
our chat tools and just lastly
table-tennis availability availability
Cal this came out of our hack day as
well it's a problem which I'm sure
you've got just like us this big tech
team there's only one ping-pong table
how do you know when the ping-pong table
is available you're right a byte so what
about one of our developers built this
bar called ping pong peak there's this
little camera that sits in our office
and it looks at the ping pong table from
behind it takes pictures when you ask it
to if the table tennis table is
available kind of does some image
recognition to see if there's movement
or not and it will come back and tell
you whether the tables free or the
tables busy and so rather than having to
get a couple of people together to play
a game and walk over there and just be
disappointed after work you can now say
ping pong big something another and it
will come back and say tables busy and
see you or try again later that's all if
you want to start I recommend bot kit
that's the one I use Microsoft bought
framework also is a great tool to get
started writing BOTS thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
