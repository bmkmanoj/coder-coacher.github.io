by domain.com so as you guys know
cross-site scripting has been a big deal
for a long time but finally seeing some
really interesting new things with a
here join me at Derby con 2011 cause how
are you man I'm great thank you so what
is the the new cross-site scripting
stuff that you're showing off here so
generally cross-site scripting is a
browser-based attack it's it's specific
to the website that you're attacking and
sometimes even specific to that browser
it doesn't really give you much more
access than that either that website or
maybe a browser attack but nowadays with
such dynamic applications a lot of
developers are kind of taking the easy
way out and embedding JavaScript engines
and HTML engines inside of applications
desktop applications I mean isn't that
like the future that it's like oh just
develop it for the web you no html5 it's
the future you just integrate that into
your application I can see how it's
easier for a developer to get something
out rapidly oh yeah it's a great I mean
it HTML and JavaScript were meant for
user interfaces that's that was the
whole thing behind them like they're
meant to be facing you know a user and
make it easy for that user and there are
also meant to be you know damn cheap to
develop and easy to roll out the
unfortunate thing though is that there's
not a whole lot of all the security
stuff is mostly server-side we haven't
really gotten to a point where
developers are being taught client-side
filtering of content so what are some of
the applications that are actually not
filtering properly locally and getting
owned so in my talk I actually demoed
five different applications I demoed to
on OS X skype a later version of skype
which was found vulnerable a few months
back and then ATM which was very
recently just found vulnerable or about
a month ago and neither this have been
patched skype was patched and after
about a month or two of the discovery
ATM was patched three weeks after the
discovery but neither of them had been
made aware of the actual security
implications because the original
Finders salt XSS and they kind of just
posted oh hey look xss I can you know
put a phishing page inside of your ad
emerge app or just just pop up the the
alert hello world exactly I wasn't
really too happy with that I thought I
would make it a lot more fun so the way
you've got like an advanced payload or
something so my payload is actually it's
not too bad advanced actually everybody
uses it nowadays it's a simple XML HTTP
request which is basically the
fundamentals of Ajax queries and you
know asynchronous website so you don't
have to change pages or reload the only
thing I'm doing differently here is
instead of making a request for web page
I'm making a request for a file on your
local file system Oh in your local file
system because you are an application so
you like file colon slash flat exactly
because you're an application and in
some cases you're running in the file
colon slash slash user space you're
totally the application is totally
allowed to access whatever it wants so
like on a mac with that version of skype
you do the credit side scripting what
kind of files on the hard drive would
you particularly be looking for so with
any sort of post exploitation we always
go after kind of a really juicy
sensitive files first so I usually I
actually wrote a tool for this to
automate this and in the list I have
such files as ssh keys as they chose
your cookie files your key ring so I can
brute force it offline anything that has
any sort of credential information or
any sort of logs that'll point me to you
know something a little bit more
sensitive or juicy nice and since you
know that where those are so so those
are the two applications on OS 10 what
are some of the other applications so i
actually from OS 10 i went and ahead at
looked at skype on iOS it was actually a
funny story we were testing out the the
skype bug on OSX me and my coworker and
he looks down at his phone and he goes
oh I just got a message on skype it was
himself because we were testing and he
opens it up and he suddenly got an alert
box on his iphone and and we discovered
that the iphone was also vulnerable to
almost the same XSS
and so along with the iphone but with
the iphone though it's not like the same
kind of port where you can just be like
file colon slash slash etsy password
it's like you know Skype on the iphone
can't see those directories right so the
way the mobile applications are
developed is quite a bit different than
desktop actually a little bit more sane
really yeah having havering multiple
users per application and having
permission levels set per application on
folders and files is a much better way
of you know preventing rogue
applications from accessing stuff like
like they would be able to on the
desktop right because there is no reason
that your skype application on your
smartphone that needs any of the data
from your email exactly exactly so so in
that case we are limited to skype you
know specific things or as my coworker
put in his blog post on he actually
pulled down the address book of the user
so yeah because they do we say oh well
you don't need your email account but a
lot of times you will find that they are
you know integrating with the the
contact list absolutely but but a lot of
we i mean i would i would assume that
there'd be some sort of api for them to
interact with and not interact directly
with the file itself but you know makes
it easier for us that we can just you
know zip up a sequel light file send it
off to my server and then i have your
sequel i address book so how about
anything for android yeah so android I
actually recently discovered this
there's a bug in the Gmail application
which will actually allow an attacker to
inject code in the from header of the
email so basically you as an attack you
would inject your payload in the from
header of an email the user would
receive that email you would click show
more details on the application and it
would render all the HTML okay so but
you need to be able to malformed your
from field so it's not like you're going
to be able to start sending this attack
from a gmail account or something or at
least from the Gmail interface right you
need some sort of you know roll your own
script or in the case of what I was
doing actually I took maps google com
and
I started sending myself links to
different locations using the same
functionality and it didn't verify the
sanity of the email address or the name
that is going to it doesn't it come from
like some weird string at maps google
com right but it often times it'll it
does that but it also say your friend
shared you a location Yosemite and then
you can go ahead and open up the email
and hit the the show details and it'll
pop well sounds a little easier than
like telling it and deport 25 and doing
it that way yeah you could definitely do
through an open relay but uh I kind of
thought it was a little fun to take
advantage of an exploit using an app
like maps using a google service to take
advantage of a google app so what now do
you have access to you've gotten some
javascript to run in the in the gmail
application so what now so because i'm
running in the gmail application i don't
have access to too much on the file
system that other sensitive apps have
but i do however have access to
everything that the gmail app has access
to which the juiciest part of that is
your local offline storage in gmail it's
all stored locally in a databases file
for each gmail account that you have and
I can just go ahead and make a request
for that and pull that down without it
you know without complaint now is there
a way to like pivot from bad luck
applications like other applications so
I'm actually working on a secondary more
complex attack which includes sending
the user in HTML file as an attachment
and then from that from the interface in
gmail because I can inject JavaScript I
can just have JavaScript automatically
download that HTML file and then I can
spawn a browser session using javascript
again to navigate directly to that HTML
file oh oh now you're in a browser now
I'm in the browser so because I'm in the
browser now I have access to all your
cookies I have access to your web
history yeah so the only human
interaction at this point though is that
you got to get the user to click more
details so maybe some sort of fishing
thing where you didn't I some yeah I
mean it might be easy
I just have a list of people or you know
say that there's a list of people i
click show more details you know and
contact this person their emails right
there or something along the lines of
that I mean as as unlikely as it sounds
i'm sure many of us have done phishing
attacks and we know how you know a
percentage of that gets through and if
even a small percentage of it gets
through i mean i still have all their
emails and potentially all their browser
information yeah work your way up the
chain casa is really fascinating I know
that you're also talking about this at a
torque on so people will be able to go
and bug you there is there a place where
they can go find blog post details stuff
like that yeah I actually have the
domain cause I 0 Kos do and you'll find
a link there to my blog and I try to
keep it updated with my to work out or
my convention talks and all that I
should have a blog post up pretty soon
about the attacks that I've been talking
about and i'll have my slides up and
available right great thank you so much
it's been a pleasure
alright guys we are going to be back
next week with even more from der beek
on until then we still have some of your
emails I know that I have like a
thousand on red but no we comb through
the feedback at hak5 org to find your
best questions and we go ahead and like
to answer them here on this show so
let's go ahead and start it off Janet
the first one comes from tech drudge he
says I'm the de facto network admin for
four households don't know but also
wireless yeah me too all of the wireless
routers use wpa2 encryption but
unfortunately some of the passwords are
very simple even though I am the admin
and deal with all of the network issues
I have a hard time convincing the heads
of households aka my father-in-law to
use more complicated passwords he told
me nobody will be able to guess his
password but half of his password is his
SSID I was hoping you could direct me to
a brute force password crackers so that
I can show him why he needs to change it
we should talk about reports password
cracking wpa keys i can probably link in
the show notes to some previous episodes
on hak5 it was like season 7 when we did
that otherwise another easy thing to do
is show them like a brute force
calculator there's one over at last bits
calm is pretty easy we just say okay
password length 8 characters are
standard on a 50,000 passwords per
second sure why not says it would take
up to five days and that's just with
lowercase and then as you get more
complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
