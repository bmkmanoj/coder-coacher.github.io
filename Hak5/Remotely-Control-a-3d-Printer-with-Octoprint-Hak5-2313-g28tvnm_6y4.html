access a 3d printer all day and more
this time on hack 5 hello everyone
welcome to your weekly dose of
technology at 5 and my name is Shannon
Morse and I'm David Randolph I was
waiting for the intro I'm David Randolph
he's from printed solid comm he's
joining me again for another episode
about 3d printing so today we are going
to be getting into the software and the
firmware and all the good things that
happen behind all the physical
components that you see here exactly
now one thing you may not a noticed yet
about 3d printers but there actually
have our dwee nose in them yeah so you
mentioned that when we were building the
Taz 6 and I was interested in that
because I've done a lot of builds with
Arduinos so I kind of understand the
background of like the Arduino IDE and
working inside of that does this work
similar late to that is that the same
IDE and all that we're using the same
IDE for aid we know across the board in
fact a vast majority of printers out
there are arduino based so it's a big
part of the original RepRap and how they
kind of use them to start with and it's
a little bit of a catch because you know
Arduino typically are 8-bit processors
and that's perfectly fine for most
printers out there you get the standard
you know cartas and style or the core XY
style those types of printers
the math is easy enough for an Arduino
to handle it you get into Delta style
printers and yes they do have some that
run on eight bits but in my opinion I
find that that's really the very
stressing point of 8-bit technology so
what we have here this this is the
lulzbot mini christ lowe's bought mini
this is not a delta printer this is not
this is more this is a traditional
carton style okay meaning there's one
kind of one motor for each axis to move
on okay so the Arduino is totally fine
working inside of this it can run
everything just fine it's not gonna like
overpower it exactly and there's even on
the mini there's a little extra power
and they're still so we got some room
ooh so I can totally like hack into it
or something you can hack into it and
that's a big thing is the many
facts words when I send out their
printers I kind of send it out with safe
normal settings and they go this is good
enough for your average person to know
what they're doing okay
but since the firmware has been so
developed and matured over the years
there's lots of little hacks and mods
and little secret features hiding in
there that you can activate for it so
let's say for example like I want to
change how far the motor goes from one
side to another like I want to go over
the limit that the printer tells me that
I can do well after we get past the
mechanical but you know limitations of
it I mean this printer you know ten
times wider and longer I can go into the
firmware and tell it that it's actually
ten times wider and longer and deeper
and taller that's awesome and it's got
that configuration okay the other thing
is is that you know manufacturers they
set kind of max speed limits for all of
this stuff so you can like overclock it
I can overclock it the prints won't look
as good but I can overclock it of course
but there's also a lot of hidden
features and examples that lulzbot by
default doesn't have filament detectors
on all their printers so it can't tell
if it's run out of filament oh not too
big of a deal if you know what you're
doing but sometimes people want to use
the lasts a little bit of filamentous
poles and stuff like that yeah we can
get in hack the firmware and plug a
little extra switch into this and put a
little detector on here that when the
filament runs out it'll automatically
pause the print with a nozzle all the
way
let me put more filament in and then
restart the print well honestly I mean
if you're a budget er like me in a
couponer and you want to get the most
out of your money with your filament it
makes sense to add that on so that you
you can use up all of your filament
before using something else so you're
not just throwing it away exactly happy
a waste of money exactly so so how do
you actually access the Arduino
information so it's the Marlin firmware
and actually at Marlin FW org that's
where these guys have everything and I
have to give a shout out to them because
I have to admit they are probably the
best documented Arduino sketch I've ever
seen out there in the world okay so they
have every single documentation they
have every feature I mean it's really
amazing will actually talk about some of
these g code commands i don't know
I love how they set up their website to
look like the Arduino IDE it's really
well done it's so cute so but after you
come in here and you download their
firmware and you open up the sketch like
you would with any other Arduino sketch
just on your Windows PC you'll find that
there's a tab all right at the top for
it then configuration not H is probably
the number one file you're gonna edit
for anything okay this is at the most
basic parameters and that's what most of
it is okay and if you look through here
you'll notice a ton of comments whoa I
mean that's good though and they are not
you know programmer comments they're
actually very plain English comments
that's good they actually tell you stuff
like hey this baud rate works most the
time and why you might wanted to bring
it down this is very human readable I
really like that especially because you
know you're starting to see a lot of 3d
printers at schools and stuff just like
what you're installing through your
company so it's I think it's important
to make it very easy to understand
especially if you're an educator yes so
that you can introduce your students to
this and they won't go like oh my god
I've never heard this terminology before
like I don't even want to mess with this
III don't understand programming yeah
I'll tell you I there's a lot of people
out there that are modifying Marlin
firmware that are not programmers yeah
and I mean I've done some code in my day
but I'm Way happier with like the
Arduino code so and I put it in here for
that
now all those little hacks and mods and
stuff like that I've talked about that's
been in the news you might want to do
your printer yeah odds are somebody's
already thought about that
and Marlin odds are it's probably
already in here yes and they've just
commented it out and you just go find it
and turn it on so what's the easiest way
to go find this stuff literally like
with any other windows sketch I can go
use the fine tool and you know unless I
do a filament sensor
can start to find the filament sensors
as I relate to it and let's see find the
next one the distance from the film is
sensor to the melting chamber so okay
you can start finding all the little
values throughout the whole thing and I
can even search all of it it's basic
Marlin knowledge to go find out where
everything is and it searches through
all of the different the different
scripts well the different two pages
because there's a lot of C++ in here
there's a lot of you know Arduino code
in here yeah and it's all embedded in
all working together is there a resource
online where I can find information on
that would help me you know edit this
document well what if I'm scared and
I've like never done it before well
there's a lot of manufacturers that
they've all posted different stuff my
favorite little one that or my favorite
little story about that is that there
was one manufacturer that they didn't
post the changes they did the Marlin for
everything yeah exactly they didn't post
the changes they made to it okay so I
didn't like that so even over on our
little blog page here I did a nice
little long article where I kind of
start off with if you really don't care
and you just want to download these
changes for this particular print or
just go in here and download it and
mount it okay but then I actually went
through every set in and exactly where
to find it in Marlin so it's you can
change it yourself
that's hilarious so I kind of went
overboard most people just like I'll
just post the source and let people have
at it so you made it really easy I try I
tried to make it so if people want to
understand why I changed what I changed
they can do it here yeah and then I put
all my little hacks in there that I like
like the filament sensors the baby
stepping I like to set some different
temperatures I like to use different hot
ends and stuff like that so I put all
those tacks in here and then I also put
some extra notes and for people that you
know other packs that other people use
that I'm not fond of so there's a lot
going on there so it sounds like most of
what I can get out of my 3d printer I
can just already get because Marlin
comes pre-configured already installed
from the company that you buy the 3d
printer from it's when you want to get
deep and dirty into the the code on the
Arduino is that's when you want to get
deep into Marlin you deep into Marlin
but the other thing is remaining
whereas I spent a long time coming up
with every setting in Marlin for the
printer which means that when a new
version of Marlin comes out they're not
exactly ambitious to integrate it so you
might want to go grab their source yeah
I know all the settings they changed in
theirs and then go get the new version
of Marlin and move those settings over
because you want those improvements and
upgrades that's good to know that's a
good point so and that's great I mean
lulzbot does a lot of companies you know
a poster source some don't and there's
usually some guy like me out there that
says screw them I'm gonna go ahead and
make all those changes for everybody
you're the one they all love yeah
exactly
and the article I did one on I have to
say is that there was actually like
three or four of us out there that we
were all doing it at the same time and
like within the same week there's like
three you know three or four different
people published their own version of
firmware for that's gonna happen so I I
found that was kind of funny that we all
did it at the same time so is there
anything else about Marlin that somebody
should know before they start going out
and delving into it themselves well the
big thing is is know what board is in
your printer okay the reason why is
because most of them are based off the
Arduino you know 25 60 mega board yeah
most everybody saw that they just move
pins around a little bit when they make
a different board or stuff like that
right and Marlin actually has all those
boards to find for you so you don't have
to worry about that you have to know the
rough board you're dealing with and they
actually have a file in here called
board H and you go in there and you can
see all the boards that they support
it's really well documented but some
boards require different drivers so
because since Arduino is open-source
there's a lot of people that have made
their own versions of our dwee no boards
and stuff like that and they made you
know either because they're cracks or
hacks or whatever you want to call it
they might have made some bad changes to
it so they require their own specialty
drivers and to figure out which board
you're running in your machine what just
plug it in via USB to your computer and
see if it recognizes it not always I
like to say is that that's a good way to
start and the other thing is is that you
might actually have to either know the
manufacturer and find out what's going
on example is that the lulzbot uses all
rambo boards by utility machines so
that's really easy to track down yeah
but there's other boards like the mil Z
boards which is a lot of cheap Chinese
printers
that perusal loves the rainbow boards as
well robo 3d uses primarily all 25 60
base board sets so they're pretty easy
but every manufacturer has got a
different you know a slightly different
variation and most of the time you can
open it up and most of these boards they
really like doing their graphics on the
board so you'll see a nice big name and
that's the name before
that's what Arduino it does with all of
their boards of course okay awesome so
from there once you get everything
pre-configured I don't want to
necessarily like sit in front of my 3d
printer and watch it print all day
exactly so we're gonna find out how to
remotely get into it so that we can like
pause our print and do everything with
it even set up a webcam right exactly
okay cool so we're gonna take a break
real quick for our sponsor and we'll be
right back to talk about remotely
accessing your 3d printer if you have a
great idea bring it to the web the way
Shannon and I do and head over to domain
comm with an awesome domain discovery
service and a quick and easy checkout
process you'll have the perfect site up
and running in no time oh my guys over
at domain.com are huge hak5 fans which
is why hak5 will save you an extra 20%
at domain.com or just send my tweet and
say thanks to support and heck by all
these years so when you think domain
names think domain.com we're back with
more 3d printing and now I am going to
learn about remotely accessing a 3d
printer because honestly I'm lazy and I
don't want to get up every five minutes
to make sure that my printer is still
doing its thing I would much rather be
able to access it from like a smart
phone or my laptop over the Internet's
or my local network or something like
that
so you've told me that there is a way to
do that there's a very simple way to do
that yeah so you know the printer the
Marlin firmware is on Arduino yeah and
since we're in that realm we might as
well throw a Raspberry Pi into the mix
oh of course
might as well exactly so there's a great
little package out there called octo
print okay and there's actually a
distribution called octo pie okay which
is a whole raspbian distribution that
has this uh district ready to go for a
standard raspberry pie I like the three
since it's already pre-configured so you
all you have to do to download that is
go over to octoprint org click on
download
it looks like it's just ya SD current
image for the Raspberry Pi so all you
have to do is download the image just
like you would any raspbian iso or image
file and then you're good to go right
exactly and it's it's got most of the
features built in there they even have a
plug-in repository on it so if you want
to add more features so it's very
friendly for some way that just doesn't
even care about Linux or knows Linux
that's good there's plenty of people out
there who want to use these 3d printers
that don't know Linux necessarily it's
awesome if you do totally support it
it's probably the best use case scenario
but if I don't understand Linux like how
am I going to access this over the web I
got to know the the information the web
interface well the IP address you guys
know a basic IP address ID if it's on
Wi-Fi or whatever it might be I also
need to get it if you want to get on
Wi-Fi or anything like that on most
raspbian distributions you're sitting
there and you have to you know find it
and ssh to it plug in Ethernet yeah they
actually own their little distribution
they have a separate boot partition with
a text file called the octo print
network and it's just a plain text file
that you put the SSID and the password
into okay so after I've put everything
on my SD card just leave it in my
computer edit the text file exactly okay
and then save it and we boot it up it'll
log into that network now just remember
you know this is an InfoSec show you are
storing your SSID and password in a
plain text file on a network accessible
storage location it's a very good point
good point to mention so you should
probably hide this behind what a
firewall put it under a VPN something
like that right yeah there's people out
there that say they clamor about how oh
I've gone ahead I poke the holes in the
firewall for it no and I'm sure you know
it's perfectly fine I put a password on
it it's fine so if you want to learn
about how to do your own VPN watch hack
5 we've done a previous episode on it
please so make sure you have this behind
some kind of private access point that's
a really good point to make ok so once I
have it booted up on my Raspberry Pi
like the one that you have set up back
here we'll get a close-up shot of this
for you guys how do I go ahead and
access it it's just web interface right
it's web interface you just look
straight into the web page whatever your
IP address is for
okay depend on how are your own applying
the IP address cuz after you don't not
working I go find it right if you're on
Windows I like getting great IP that's a
good one to use for that type of stuff
but you find the IP address and you can
bring up the interface and there's the
interface cool so we have it all booted
up and it looks like I'm accessing it I
see some movement over here since we
already started the printer and you'll
notice that you can control every aspect
with it and you'll see this there's
actually several tabs there there's a
temperature control algae could you turn
all that stuff the temperature page you
can actually just set the nozzle
temperature in the bed temperature if
you're gonna load filament and stuff
like that you've got those controls
ready to go there that's nice and so
have some defaults for abs and PLA and
your and the bed as well as got some
defaults there for you as well whatever
temperature works best for you okay but
then you can go to the control tab at
the top there and if you click on that
you'll notice that there is a webcam
streaming load if I plugged in a
raspbian you know a Raspberry Pi camera
or even a USB camera it would go ahead
and automatically stream so I could see
what's printing oh that's so cool now
another key another episode yes now
there's no cool thing is that on that
same page at the very end of that page
there's a time-lapse tab so avol i'm at
the top at the top there click on the
time-lapse tab I can actually set it up
to do time-lapse captures of all my 3d
prints of that camera and save it to the
PI for me to grab later oh my gosh
that'd be great for like a youtuber hmm
hmm I wonder how most those 3d printing
guys on YouTube do it that's why I so
the other thing is you get stuff like
terminals so you can actually see every
command that's being sent to it on
another episode we're going to talk
about G code and what some of these
commands mean and some of the basics for
that and you can start to see that we
have all this control over the printer
okay but I can actually just upload a
g-code file to this and after I've
sliced the file and whatever way I want
to and it'll store okay there's an easy
interface upload button greet and then
you just upload it there and then you'll
just hit the print button next to the
file and I'll automatically start
printing dude so and the distribution is
really well done that there's lots of
hacks in it if you want to make it even
and better and stuff like that but right
out of the box you don't even have to do
a single sudo command or SSH command or
get putty installed or anything that's
so much easier than when I was doing it
so we actually at our facility we
actually teach a class and we use this
as motivation for it but we try to want
to teach a few things to get people
basically IP you know home networking a
little bit about VPNs and security yeah
and then a few linux commands just to
get people a little bit wet in it yeah
and let them understand that the
Raspberry Pi is not just for controlling
your printer it's also a full-blown
Linux system they play with absolutely
now just in case I don't have a computer
let's say that I want to access this
over of a smartphone I know we're not
going to show it here but there's also
like a touch version of this correct
correct when I say there isn't a touch
person through their plug-in repository
you can actually install this plug-in
called touch UI and it actually makes a
mobile-friendly site to it and when I'm
at home I got you know I got nine
printers sitting there in my house and
I'm extremely lazy so I will sit on the
couch I'll sit on my couch and I'll turn
on the printer remotely and then I will
start heating it up so that I walk in
there throw my filament in go back out
to the couch hit print oh that's so cool
watch a movie and then the prints done
for me okay cool
so but we runs on my phone and I find
that even reaching over to the screen
it's too far for me on the printer I
just I have my phone there and I'm using
it yeah I mean if I'm in the middle of
watching stranger things I don't want to
leave yes I just want to be able to hit
pause or print or whatever I'm fretting
the rent Morty Rick and Morty portal gun
that's a good point
III need a watch Rick and Morty I don't
want to get distracted yes I totally
understand that reference now it took me
a long time but I'm finally in the rick
and morty scene sorry guys it took a
while okay so i want to start a print so
we can do that we can start a print here
and what we'll do is we'll actually do
this a little ninjaflex test here that I
had going okay
and it's the g-code slice on it this
would be marks have to do it a separate
show on just cura and slicing and all
that fun stuff holy but that's the code
file after I'm ready to go for it
and I can
hit the print button I like how it's a
little loading loading a paper into a
printer very good oh there it goes and
now it's off and running and it'll do
all the normal settings and everything
you expect that's so cool
now anybody that was overly looking at
that screen poll I saw a hack five
keyboard g-code file yes you're just
gonna have to wait to see what that
one's about what could it be I think
we're gonna check out that episode next
week so I'm just a Phii because I'm very
interested in this one this is uh this
is the coffee filament this is a coffee
filament it's a very interesting film it
says it's a nice brown color but you
know there's a feature to it while it's
printing it like coffee
that's reticulum it doesn't stay
smelling like coffee after it's printed
it's only while it's printing just
because you can just because you can
because they do have some other scents
and stuff like that but it's kind of why
I like this company they make
interesting filaments okay and that's
one of their secrets they they they make
a conductive filament they actually make
a magnetic filament a glitter filament
it's all glittery so I want the glitter
filament oh that was that that print
actually looks really good not gonna lie
kind of a fan of glittery filament oh
yeah so now it's getting up to
temperatures and it's running everything
and easy to start a print but you notice
you you don't have your computer
involved now no it's just plugged into
HDMI that's it and you can take and you
can put that out turn off your computer
off or when it's just a little Raspberry
Pi running it and if you do a little bit
of hacking or something like that you
can actually get the seven inch
touchscreen to work with it and get
webcams to work with it you can get
multiple webcams to work with it
there's plugins for like tp-link makes
those Wi-Fi plugs that everyone likes to
use for their house yes there's a
plug-in for those just to turn the
printer on or off when it's done
printing which I'm sure are super
vulnerable yes so once again keep it
outside your firewall and yes that's why
we like to that's why I really wanted to
introduce this concept to you guys
because I
back to a lot more InfoSec problems with
raspberry PI's and another thing stuff
like that I'm glad you brought this onto
an InfoSec hacker show because I'm sure
there's some people out there that can
introduce some vulnerabilities and be
like okay we need to fix these things
this will be the next thing that happens
in 3d printing world and yes please do
that because I know waiting me people
that come in and tell me oh I just open
up that port on my firewall and actually
just not only will open up port 80 and
they'll open up oh yeah and you go
really okay cool really all right well
while that gets set up and starts
printing our ninja what is it called
ninja flex ninjaflex well that starts
printing our ninja flex I'm gonna just
go ahead and thank you for showing me
how all of this works so I can get
started printing my own things as
opposed to just printing from an SD card
which I'm super excited about where can
people find you pretty solid comm we're
on all the social media sites under
strain of solid as well awesome so thank
you so much for joining me again
my pleasure and like I said you know if
you guys just for the hak5 guys if they
want they go to our website and they
want to buy something you know premium
fellow nuts or anything like that we
have the super secret behind the
firewall code of hak5 nobody can figure
that no one can figure that one out is
super secret yeah you can use that for
your checkup don't check out get 10% off
all your filaments thanks for doing that
again and of course if you want to
support hack 5 directly you can check
out hack shop calm and make sure to hit
up hack 5 org to find out all the things
that we are doing during the holidays
because we're probably gonna have some
sales to thank you so much for joining
us and if you have any questions email
feedback at hack 5 org or you can get in
touch with him at printed solid dot-com
I'm Shannon Morse again I'm David
Randolph trust your techno list
I just want to sniff it
I can't smell anything yet not yeah give
it a little time to build it up I don't
want to wait I just want the coffee I
want my coffee now I feel really awkward
sitting here like sniffing at the
printer it's I loved one like I said I
love going to the shows and when people
walk by me with like oh no my printer oh
I can smell it it smells like black
coffee yes not peppermint mocha which is
my fave it's my favorite black coffee oh
my god that's so weird that is so weird
that's all this company does is kind of
weird
oh alright that's great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
