bitbucket by Atlassian welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas my name is
Shannon Morse and before I get started
don't forget to hit the subscribe button
if you are watching this on YouTube
so you get to see all of our new hack
tip episodes today we are talking about
the difference between apt-get and at
about 2 weeks ago I did an episode on
package management in Linux via the
terminal there is a ton that you can do
with just a few keystrokes and often
times I find that updating a package or
downloading a package or grabbing
dependencies which happens a lot is a
lot faster via the terminal then fishing
around on the web for everything that
you need especially if Google is
throwing up really weird stuff so the
main part of my discussion was on
apt-get but did you know back in 2014 a
new package manager from canonical was
also introduced called apt for advanced
package manager apps told apt is
supposed to be more friendly for users
it's more secure and efficient but it's
never really been available as its own
command
so apt-get app cache and the like were
subsets with apt you are introduced to
more information on the output of your
commands so a lot of what we just
learned in apt-get can also be used in
app so I think it's very crucial to
understand how and when you use apps get
compared to apt so while Sun commands in
the terminal end up calling each other
much longer commands app doesn't require
the use of apt-get at all it is his own
standalone thing now you can use app all
on its own it doesn't depend on any of
the abilities of apt-get because it's
different so I'm going to check out some
examples of how apt works on an updated
machine and for starters this is a Linux
Ubuntu machine that I am running over
here so for starters I have my terminal
pulled up here with my fancy-schmancy
new colors check out that hack tip if
you want to know how to customize your
own first starters one example that I
wanted to use with sudo and yes I do run
through
I don't run enroute I know I could use
sudo su or sweet Oh bang bang I just
choose not to and then I'll type an apt
cache search and I'm going to search for
the terminology for Firefox I'll put in
my password and hit enter okay so we saw
this from last time I did in episode
this allows you to basically just find a
specific package what you see is all the
packages related to Firefox including
themes there's language support
dependencies etc if I run app to search
Firefox and that looks a little bit
different apt search Firefox it's going
to sort everything look at how nice that
looks it's much easier to read and it
includes additional information so you
can see all the same kind of packages
but you have that nice green color code
and you also get a little bit of
additional info for example zenny 0.39 -
- and etcetera etc now that's all cool
and fancy but check out installations by
app they look really good so first off
I'm going to uninstall Firefox because
it's already installed so I'll type in
sudo apt remove Firefox hit enter yes I
do want to continue look at that
progress bar did you see it okay so now
I'll type in sudo apt install Firefox
and then we get another progress bar and
this time it's some yellow so it looks
super shiny and fancy again you get
updated information a new progress bar
you get color codes and so on and so
forth and it also gives you a much more
detailed information on the page than
what you would normally get with apps
yet so I think it's pretty cool after
the break I'm going to show you the rest
of the new commands that you can use and
why apt-get is still in use today let's
be honest your code is your world you
create it you tweak it it is your baby
and you lovingly obsess over it every
single day at least I know some people
here in the hak5 warehouse who
definitely treat their code that way so
picking the right repository management
tool is super important I mean you want
only the best for your code right right
that's why the team at Atlassian created
bitbucket
the get solution for professional teams
helping over 5 million developers build
with a purpose the bucket gives teams of
all sizes free yes that's right I said
free private repositories with
state-of-the-art features like the
world's best pool request algorithm
built in continuous delivery and
integrations with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and usher plus plus you
get JIRA integration obviously since
it's from Atlassian giving your team
everything you need to take your code
from concept all the way to customer the
 is for the code that takes us to
Mars it decodes the human genome or it
drives your next car or maybe it's for
your next InfoSec tool visit bitbucket
org slash for the code to start your
free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try bitbucket today what will your code
do alright we're now back with some more
fun times with app so I'm going to show
you a really easy one now all you have
to do is type in apt tactic help to see
the rest of the commands that you can
use in the terminal yeah so simple
luckily it's a pretty short list
developers have taken a lot of at the
apt-get list and they combine them to
make it faster for usage not to mention
easier to memorize the commands also you
can type in man apt because there is a
man page it's actually quite short so
it's really easy to read through this
and you will find a bunch more
information in there detailing the most
commonly used commands now I will
mention this man page does not list all
of the commands available keep that in
mind in case you're running through
there and you're like where's this
command since apt is a Debian based
command it obviously works on my boon to
machine here with no problems I don't
have a red hat or Fedora system to test
app on so I'm not sure if it works with
the RPM package manager
apparently it's being made compatible
but if you can confirm for that please
let me know down in the comments I would
love to find out if it's cross
compatible with those other systems as
well for more reading on apt as well you
can check out the Debian administrator's
handbook series over here and I'll just
put this link in the show notes so you
can check it out and read it on your own
time because this one is a little
and longer than the man page so do you
still use apt-get for the same commands
I know I do mostly out of habit but it
is still useful for things like cron
jobs which can throw errors with apps
sometimes I know I haven't mentioned
cron jobs on hacked tip quite yet
that's going to be another segment for
another day there will be a lot of
information when that time comes thank
you so much to bitbucket we got a bunch
of hack tips heading your way so be sure
to subscribe to our YouTube channel it's
youtube.com slash hack 5 until then I
want to hear your feedback comment below
make sure to check out our sister show
as well hack 5 for more stuff just like
this and I will be there reminding you
to trust your tech molest this apt has
super cow powers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
