go further for hak5 I'm Darrin kitchen
here at CES 2013 checking out some
really cool prescence technologies from
beam how are you I'm here with Deborah
and Palo Alto Deborah the the latency on
this seems really low yeah it's pretty
much real-time it's pretty cool and can
you show our viewers at home that you're
not just a static webcam and screen
and I can go backwards and forwards beat
up pretty much you could totally just
run down the hall right now couldn't you
and so how fast does this go and how
long does it run for with someone you
can continue a conversation and keep up
with them using this all day you could
you could get about eight hours and you
so basically you know I'm good for the
entire convention and still have like an
hour or so lot battery life and tell me
about mics also here to kind of help
with some of the techy stuff as far as
the connectivity is concerned say like I
wanted to deploy this in a scenario for
training what would I need connectivity
wise so what do you need is 802 11 and
preferred so we having two radios in
there and one radio is basically connect
constantly and the second radio is
scanning so we avoid that the one radio
the major radio it's leaving their
connection and scans so you actually
have a second radio looking for
potential problems better connection it
connects to it gets an IP address and a
checks a latency and when it is better
then it will switch to the other network
card and Deborah how do you actually use
this technology do you just log into
like a web page and connect your webcam
or what you do wsad like a gamer what
about the what do you see on the other
end as far as audio and video so I can
show you on the pilot station when you
want to see it there great let's just
walk over to the pilot station yeah
actually let's put
I'd be actually really interesting if
Deborah as as a beam person here could
stand in front of another client and
then become kind of a recursive beam if
you will that must be interesting I said
can you just hop from beam to beam all
right let's see how this work Mike can
you walk me through this someone in Palo
Alto who is taking over and gives you a
quick overview on how to beam into it
and how to use it I'm just going to show
you in addition to see everyone there's
a camera right here that shows you the
furniture my feet all the things that
you don't I can see there's my docking
station over there yep this is so
seamless yeah so really it's the next
best thing to be in here because you
control what you see you control where
you go you could go into an office to
have a meeting with a colleague you
could go into a conference room to have
a group meeting or you could just follow
me down the hall okay pull right up you
can see there you are on the beam here
in Palo Alto I know you also the beam is
at the perfect height so you can
interact effectively with people who are
standing up you could also pull up to a
conference room table and you can
interact effectively what people sit in
them well tell me what is this cost who
is this for what's the market how do I
get one yeah but the whole system is
sixteen thousand dollars it's for
enterprise as an enterprise system but
we have a beautiful office to office or
CEO wants to go at different places
under
like our field scott hassan so he has
multiple companies and he's switching
between the companies on the same in the
same ten within ten minutes would have
been some of the challenges in bringing
this to market and how close are you
guys to you know the full deployment
that you envision i think i think the
biggest challenge for us engineering
wise has been a lot of the the
microphone acoustics and stuff like that
that's been a big challenge another big
challenge is just its really trying to
define the sales models for these things
this device can be used in multiple kind
of applications and so that's really the
hard thing for us right now because what
application we want to go after to start
out with and so this being is this the
first generation of the unit to come to
market this is our first version right
now III just have to say that i'm really
impressed with the technology i'm a huge
fan of things like you know william
gibson books and this just seems like
it's right out of that so i can't wait
until this kind of presence technology
becomes ubiquitous so thank you this is
one of the coolest things i've seen at
the show oh great well thank you so much
well that is beam and you can find them
on the web at suitable techcom alright
and for continued coverage of all things
CES 2013 be sure to head over to
revision three.com I'm here at the Ford
booth at CES 2013 with Edie
how're you doing ad nauseum and we're
checking out the TDK what is a TD cab
just do an SDK we're ready to be cash
GDK is a technology development kit that
developers can get for you know app link
enabling their abs instead of you know
buying a vehicle or if they already have
an existing one so this is a TDK you
basically have all the same interfaces
as you would a normal vehicle you got
the screen you got a center stack with
all the different buttons pre-sub on
stored bag as well as some Moss car
simulation toggles so you can turn the
car off open doors set it to go forward
and reverse
a bit part or not part so what kind of
partners have you guys teamed up with to
enable apps to come to port right so I
mean everybody knows you know a lot of
the music streaming apps like Pandora
our radio slacker and PR we also did
some navigation base F scout from
TeleNav we have our own sink
destinations and won't be at bat I'm a
whole slew of more coming out you know
every every few months awesome working
our hackers find a developer network to
start coding up some awesome stuff is
pretty easy just like everything else
developer 4.com there we go alright and
with all of that I want to thank once
again Ford for powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
