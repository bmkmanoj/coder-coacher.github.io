threat wire greetings I am Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for August 24th
2017 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
I'm officially back after a really quick
trip to Oregon for the Eclipse I am two
days late I know this I realize this but
I have got your weekly security news if
you have not checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have tons that we want
to do for this show but we can't do it
without your support patreon.com slash
threat wire is the place to support the
show and now onto the news so first off
crypto currency big thanks to deci
matrix for studying in two stories for
today's show remember patrons you can
post your favorite stories on the
community tab on our patreon page to be
featured we tell time and time again
using two-factor authentication for your
online accounts specifically calling on
users to use applications wherever
possible instead of phone numbers due to
not only two-factor authentication but
also account recovery tools commonly
using SMS and phone calls to verify your
identity it's probably worth noting that
a phone number is not necessarily secure
in 2013 1038 incidents occurred and were
reported where an attacker was able to
gain control of a person's online
accounts by calling their users cell
phone carrier and transferring control
of the phone number to a new phone and
since then this is increased in 2016 to
two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight
and will probably continue to climb
recently attackers have started using
this technique to steal money from
virtual currency wallets the New York
Times reported on a virtual currency
customer named mr. bernis who had the
equivalent of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars stolen from his online
virtual currency account attackers can
call Verizon AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile whoever and
use social engineering plus a little bit
of personal information on the customer
to get the carrier to transfer the phone
number on an account to a new device in
sim
and by doing so the attacker can then
use account recovery tools online on
some websites to get verification code
sent to their new device instead of the
customers and the customer would no
longer have access to any verification
codes they would normally receive via
text or phone call cell phone providers
need to train employees on better
security protocols to verify users and
add stricter implementations on accounts
such as pin codes or phone passwords and
make sure that they train their
employees to make sure they have those
phone passwords any time they call in
some virtual currency sites such as
coinbase has recommended that users
delete their phone number from their
account virtual currencies unfortunately
do not have the same insurance or
coverage that banks do and your once
your money is stolen from an account it
cannot be reversed about 10 days ago
dreamhost which is an la-based website
hosting provider posted a blog regarding
a search warrant that they had received
from the Department of Justice
requesting information about visitors to
disrupt j-20 org which is a website
created to organize political protests
against the current US government
administration the search warrant
requests information on the website the
owner the visitors information includes
messages records files logs database
records subscriber information such as
names and addresses and telephone
numbers and email addresses any kind of
business information any kind of payment
information session information and any
other information dreamhost may have on
hand about individuals that were part of
a July 20th protest and orb riots the
search warrants vague requests amounts
to over 1.3 million visitors to the site
in question Dreamhouse ended up
challenging the request and they were
first turned down with the DOJ filing
motion in Washington DC to compel the
company to comply Dreamhouse work
closely with the e FF to keep
individuals privacy just that private
about a week later DreamHost worked in
Washington with the DOJ to narrow the
scope of information requested to
exclude any kind of HTTP excess like
visitor IPS and any unpublished media
from the site Dreamhouse biggest concern
with the case was that the government
would be
data on thousands of users who simply
visited the site using the fourth and
first amendment rights as backing judge
Morin of the Superior Court of
Washington DC is enforcing the DOJ
motion to compel DreamHost to comply
with turning over data but that also
amended the request to the much narrower
scope of information per DreamHost
demand
now while dream house does have to give
up some information the court is also
forcing the DOJ to comply with including
names of government officials who will
have access to data the data must be
overseen by the court it must be
justifiable as a part of the warrant and
the DOJ cannot share info with any other
agency and any extra information that is
deemed unnecessary to the warrant will
also be sealed now of course the
government could still issue a warrant
on the sealed data as well according to
a legal brief by the US Attorney 4dc
Channing Phillips the government had no
interest in the IP addresses of 1.3
million visitors according to the
document as well the government didn't
even know when it got the warrant what
it was asking for how did they not know
after being alerted by researchers at
lookout Google pulled over 500
applications from its Google Play Store
for potentially having spyware installed
via a backdoor in total the apps were
downloaded over 100 million times and
all of them used the same software
development kit I'm probably going to
pronounce this wrong but I'm going to
call it ejects in' the apps would
connect to an ad network that would
serve up targeted ads to individual
users based on their interests it's
pretty common and it's great revenue for
applications
unfortunately the Chinese firm ejects
ins SDK could also upload spyware
through a backdoor at any time without
notifying the user spyware installed
could steal call information GPS
locations Wi-Fi network information and
even more applications included games
weather apps internet radio photo
editing tools and camera applications
now look out does believe that
publishers at the application did not
know of the SDK problems and as such is
not publishing a list not all of the 500
applications had installed spyware but
they did have the potential to do so via
the SDK
while application developers may not
know of the issue any application using
the ejection advertising development kit
as part of their code could be
susceptible as spyware was loaded from
any Jackson controlled server this is
not the first savvy spyware that we have
seen on Android and it is not going to
be the last Google is working to protect
customers better via Google Play protect
and users can also consider using a
mobile antivirus application to detect
issues thank you again to all the fine
