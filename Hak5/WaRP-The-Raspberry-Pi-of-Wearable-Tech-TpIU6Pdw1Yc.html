by Toyota for hack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 and i have in my hands
probably the smallest computer i've ever
seen and this is so far the coolest
thing i have seen at the show we'll see
if it can live up the test of the rest
of the week but i must say this is
really fantastic what I'm holding in my
hand right now is called the warp it is
a wearable reference platform so I'm not
actually holding a product much like I'm
you know wearing a product on my head
which I guess is or is not a product I
think it's kind of more like a I don't
know Google glass is like a beta right
but in order to develop things like that
developers need cool hardware to work on
top of and if you guys are familiar with
the Raspberry Pi or the Arduino or the
BeagleBoard this should be very familiar
to you a reference platform on this tiny
little chip not only do we have a free
scale one gigahertz CPU capable of
running the latest version of Android we
also have the RAM we've got bluetooth
4.0 we've got Wi-Fi and we've got our
microUSB for charging so this right here
is the brains of your dreams to come
true if you are that hardware a hacker
tinkerer that wants to start and begin
you know building on top of the
shoulders of giants because what's
awesome here about a reference design or
a reference platform if you've never
done any kind of hardware dev before is
that these guys have done all the heavy
lifting they've already figured out how
to miniaturize all of this and how to
put it into a package where you can
start making a watch or a wristband or
whatever have you with this as the guts
and then you don't need to worry about
the hardware you can just start coding
it's open hardware it's open source and
it's modular so this right here is the
brains of the unit but there's also a
daughter board here that adds I am use
you know instruments that allow you to
detect motion gyroscopes accelerometers
magnetometers things like that on the
back here we actually have induction
charging so maybe you want to build a
wristwatch where you can lay it
on your nightstand at night and have it
charged this is already done for you we
even have e-ink displays all ready to go
so really I'm not actually showing you a
product I'm showing you the potential
for our product and that is probably one
of the most exciting things that have
seen come about in my years of covering
CES is the idea that the democratization
of hardware and the fact that anyone can
now fabricate these things and free
skills gone a long way to get this
really accessible to put it into your
hands I mean they they have you know a
version here with a battery they've got
verses here with LCD screens and I'm
just really excited because it means
that if you're a tinkerer and you liked
the Arduino you liked the the the
Raspberry Pi or the BeagleBone well the
same folks that actually did the
BeagleBone are bringing this reference
design to market at warp board
waa RP like engage right warp board org
where you can download the open source
stack to start building on top of to
start getting the open hardware to start
making all of your accessories for I
think you just start 3d printing a case
around it and be on Kickstarter tomorrow
a millionaire because these got this is
just fantastic I love the world we're
living in today I haven't seen a whole
lot of the show but I'm putting out in
my top three already
anyway warp borg for continued coverage
of all things CES 2014 revision 3.com
