you by gazelle the fastest and easiest
way to sell and recycle your gadgets /
hak5 i'm darren kitchen at CES 2011
checking out the coolest I our stuff you
guys know I'm a huge fan of controlling
all your gadgets with your cell phone
and it looks like that finally became a
commercial app Tom how are ya carry much
yeah really good to see so tell me about
this this app this Hardware combo how
does this all work what does this do ok
so we talked about unity remote it's a
brand-new put it from us it comes in two
pieces first what's the hardware which
is effectively an infrared blaster and
then the application gets downloaded to
your iPod or iPod Touch and very soon so
iphone or ipod touch and very soon the
ipad as well and that communicates and
links with the the hardware vibe looting
ok so it's an IR blaster so i'm assuming
that means you're going to have to spend
a couple hours with you all your remotes
pointing it at the device and learning
the codes for play and rewind and
password those the old days so we are
device comes with ninety-nine percent of
the codes and the devices that you would
possibly want to work with pre-installed
on the hardware so is that something you
have to license or the publicly
available codes i'm always curious about
that though that's those cases we've
ailable to us so they they're on the
open market really ok so what about that
like really specific function that you
only that onkyo stereo does that isn't
in the book what if you need to program
that can it going to learn it can learn
and that's the classic way of pointing
the your remote control with the device
and it can learn but it's the supposed
does it very simply so this is a great
kind of a set of assistant there to help
you do that now can i use this to
control my TV like over the internet not
over the internet it needs to control or
it communicates by bluetooth so you
effectively need to be in the same room
or same environment to control the
device that you want to control and i
got to know do you guys have an android
app coming that would be telling
Apple is our focus at the moment Beth
Android may be on the cards students say
