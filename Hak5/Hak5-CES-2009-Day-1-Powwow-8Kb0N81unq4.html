CES we're kind of new to this what we do
wrong what we do right would you guys
learn let's start with Paul no no let's
talk over Paul the camera guy because
he's got the badass hat
they brought too much camera equipment
way too much camera equipment
it totally weighed us down and made us
tired and although we had some good
stuff at just I really hated care and
all that stuff well one thing I think we
did right was some of the ways that we
you know went through interviews you
know today specifically one thing we did
wrong was not being prepared for who was
actually here and what we actually
wanted to see so little prep goes a long
way baby
it did wrong should have slept going on
48 hours now it's just a just pure
adrenaline we learn a lot about you know
you're seeing an evolution in the way
that we're doing interviews and
gathering stuff here so I think this is
like a crash course in field videography
because it's so different than the way
that we were used to doing our hacker
cons but I'm enjoying it and hopefully I
just don't lose my voice yeah speaking
about hacker cons I thought it was
really funny when Chris over here was
like are we loved to film people or do
we have to not film people and I was
like dad it's not a hacker god it's
alright
and I gotta say I think I did pretty
well today because I didn't wear heels
like one of those chicks that we saw
walk it around the con this con is huge
how are you gonna walk around with heels
on come on girl you don't got to be
pretty today you got to go get your
interviews in do your job don't worry
high heels I learned a lot of things
today this is the first time that I was
actually given a camera to walk around
with it's like oh here you go I have a
camera alright what do I do it actually
yesterday progressed I actually learned
a lot about how to actually talk to
vendors and you know
things and ask some questions and get
all the stuff from them that you know
that I needed to do and you know this
actually really helps stuff oh yeah
sorry
and learning how to use the mic too yeah
this is the first time we've ever been
to a conference with more than like a
thousand people and it is intense
there are so many people here is
ridiculous
so yes this is definitely a learning
experience that we can all agree on our
mic head here a little flag used to say
the fail bus all around it it's slowly
turning into a hack five mic as we I
mean you could go to Jase Cole or we
could just you know get some technolo
stolen and figure it out right yeah yeah
all right well we're gonna crash we're
probably gonna pass out right here on
the floor and until they get up forklift
and take us to our hotel we will see you
guys tomorrow
live if we're still alive I want to go
drinking
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
