quantum computing gets a real-life
competitor from Google and Wendy's got
hacked all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for July 12 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security our privacy and Internet
freedom if you haven't checked out our
patreon yet please do so we have lots
that we want to do for the show but we
can't do it without your support
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support threat wire and the
link is in the show notes now first off
quantum computing for practical use
cases still seems to be in the distant
future and not quite yet a real-world
scenario where it could be used to break
encryption techniques currently used to
protect conversations and data online
but because smaller form factor quantum
computers do exist for other reasons and
the NSA sought quantum computing as a
part of an 80 million dollar project it
kind of seems like a good idea to start
researching new crypto in order to
thwart potential vulnerabilities so that
is Google's thinking with a blog post
published on Thursday regarding
experimenting with post quantum
cryptography the study that could in the
future find a cryptography technique
that will stand strong against quantum
computing hacking so in Google's
experiment they will be mixing both the
current elliptic curve key exchange
algorithm with a post quantum computing
one to see if the latter can hold
against hacks but today and in the
future now if they find that it is
breakable a user would still be safe
under the current elliptical curve
algorithm used on Google Chrome Google
plans to discontinue this experiment in
two years after which they hope many
findings will surface about their
cryptography technique which goes by the
name of ring learning with errors or
ring lwe for short according to Google
software engineer Matt Braith wise which
I'm so sorry if I've mispronounced your
name quote our aims with this experiment
are to highlight an area of research
that Google believes to be important and
to gain real-world experience with the
larger data structures that post quantum
algorithms will likely require so it'll
only be available through
from canary which is a testing platform
of Chrome and a user can tell by
checking their security panel for CEC
pq1 if they're one of the chosen few
Facebook just began rolling out its new
encryption option for Facebook messenger
to its 900 million users calling it
secret conversations but only a few can
currently access it until later this
year the setting offers end-to-end
encryption for its users using a
protocol called signal by open whisper
systems which is an open source
encryption technique most notable for
its use and other facebook-owned app
called whatsapp and open whispers own
signal text and calling app which we
very much love here in the hak5
warehouse the biggest drawback to
facebook Messenger and encryption is
that it's opted in yes yes everyone you
heard me right it is opted in you will
have to physically choose to enable this
secure feature instead of it
automatically being turned on another
bummer is that it can only work with one
device so you will have to choose what
device you want encryption to work on
other devices won't have encryption
turned on nor will you be able to read
encrypted conversations on them which
makes sense
Facebook also released a white paper on
the technology in which they state quote
Facebook will never have access to
plaintext messages unless one
participant in a secret conversation
voluntarily reports the conversation
yeah keep that in mind because you'll
have to put trust in the hands of
whomever you're talking to props to our
friend of this for pointing out that now
what the cons also comes a major Pro
people want encryption and companies are
valuing that by giving us encryption but
by making encryption just sort of kind
of available sometimes on applications
sometimes not sometimes on devices
sometimes not all devices it comes with
some drawbacks to messenger is it still
worth it or do would you stick with
another service like signal what are
your thoughts on this one I would really
like to know do you eat at Wendy's often
I don't but I know a lot of people that
do well you might end up getting a new
credit card sent to you at least 1,000
Wendy's locations fell prey to a malware
attack on their point-of-sale systems
that stole credit card data including
names numbers expiration dates
CVV and service codes
in late 2015 the breach was due to
remote access for cash registers that a
third-party vendor had available whose
credentials were compromised
so apparently somebody got usernames and
passwords yes social engineering folks
Wendy's is currently facing a
class-action lawsuit from at least one
bank because of the six months it took
for Wendy's to finally shut down the
malware you can find out if your
location was compromised by visiting the
link in our show notes before I go I did
want to mention yes we are very very
aware of Pokemon go and it's app
permissions we're following that story
very closely we'll put link in the show
notes as far as that information goes
but I'm definitely playing it on my
marshmallow 6.0 Android phone I can't
help myself it's Pokemon thanks again to
all the fine people who are contributing
to patreon.com slash threat wire
you brought this show back to life and
you are the reason that we can keep
bringing you news every single week any
little bit helps us grow the show and in
return we will build an RSS for you and
when we reach our next goal we will
bring on another episode per week we are
really looking forward to that we might
even feature your fur babies in an
upcoming episode we love seeing them so
of course if you are at that level on
the perks on patreon definitely send us
pictures we love seeing your furry
babies
now check out the perk levels on patreon
comm and thanks again for helping us
keep this coming completely independent
and completely ad free and if you can't
donate hit the subscribe button or share
this episode on your favorite social
networking media page and use the
hashtag threat wires that we can see it
and we will totally give you props and
with that I am Shannon Morse and I will
see you on the Internet
protip turn off your beeping mass before
trying to record an episode of threat
wire in your studio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
