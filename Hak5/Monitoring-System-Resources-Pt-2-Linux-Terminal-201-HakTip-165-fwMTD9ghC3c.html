system resources in linux and this hack
tip is brought to you by Eero welcome to
hack tip this show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and 19 inches I'm Shannon
Morrison today we are talking about
monitoring system resources part 2 so
last week we left off with LS o F which
stands for list open files today we are
going to dig deeper into LS o F along
with some bonus commands DF and EU
continuing with LS o F we have file pass
so for this example I'm going to type in
LS o F forward slash home and hit enter
ok so we get some kind of interesting
information in here we see the command
in my case I only have bash and L sof
running at the moment and then we see
the pit for each of these then the user
then file descriptor in this case it's
the current working directory so that's
pretty obvious the type which is
directory as well and then some more
generic information about the size so
this can actually be really useful if
say you have an SSH daemon running and
you think someone may be using it to
compromise the machine what you could
easily do is look for a username that
you don't recognize with that simple
command and there you have your proof
and then you could just get rid of
whoever the user is that shouldn't be on
that machine and then it's no longer
compromised although of course we would
probably recommend just burning the
thing to the ground at that point but
this will only show you the topmost
layer of information for running
software not all of the underlying files
associated with it so to view all of
those as well you can type in LS o F
taxi and then your programs so in this
case I'm just gonna use the program LS o
F F as an example because it makes for a
great example and then you just hit
enter so I don't see anything weird
going on here so I think that we're
pretty good ok so that's about it for LS
o F of course we do recommend checking
out the man page and everything else
with it I'll have more commands right
after the break when you're looking to
improve your wireless network making
sure
your entire home has a strong signal is
a must and that is where Iiro comes in
they are launching the very first
second-generation mesh Wi-Fi system that
comes with one euro and one to two of
these little guys these beacons
these are mesh access points they are
not extenders they are smaller they plug
into an outlet and they have an ambient
nightlight as well and they are also
more powerful than the originals but if
you already have the original euro has
you covered these little ones are
backwards compatible and they can be
purchased separately and of course your
system starts at 399 for all three
components together but if you want to
buy just one beacon to add on you
totally can and those are 149 each we've
gotten a chance to test these in the
warehouse where our wireless usually
does not reach from one end to another
and the EO mesh does a really great job
of fixing the headache and giving me the
speeds that I expect from my isp plus it
was very easy to set up and it's also
reliable euro is also announcing the ero
plus subscription which includes
advanced network security monitoring
supplementing those features that are
already built in that you get for free
with the device they also include
content filtering which is great for
houses with kids now with any system you
get automatic updates two-factor
authentication for admin access and eros
backing with a bug bounty program and
third party audits as well and we have a
coupon code for you for free overnight
shipping to the US or Canada visit
eurocom and at checkout select overnight
shipping then enter hack tip and make it
free check it out and learn more at ero
calm a little PS I am going to include a
link to the online QuickStart guide for
LSO a free all to look over since there
is a whole bunch more commands that you
can learn I just went over a few of them
but onto the next one for monitoring
system resources this one's easy
I'll just show you you type free and
that's it this will show you free memory
of RAM and kilobytes now to see it in
gig form you can also type in free tech
G or I could type in free tech m and
obviously this would mean gigabytes and
megabytes so that's very easy and that's
of course your RAM again now similarly I
can do this
thing for hard disk drive space so I
could type in DF and hit enter and this
is going to tell me
aka disk free it'll show me how much
space is available on my hard disk drive
or my solo state drive or all of the
drives that are compatible with this
Linux operating system now I can also
type in DF tak H and it's going to look
a little bit different from what I saw
previously but it's the same information
it's just human readable in this stance
okay so as you can see I haven't used
barely any of my drive but my boot drive
is full so that is very useful
information and no stuff in those
temporary tmpfs file storage areas those
are all going to disappear after I
reboot so I'm not too worried about
those and most of my user generated file
storage happens on that Ubuntu root
storage area which of course has most of
the storage available go figure
now moving on from here if I want to see
how much storage a specific directory is
using up I can type in D you tack H aka
disk usage and you know what I did that
in my home directory so I'm actually
going to change directories over to
let's go in snub stuff test cuz that's
my test directory for pretty much
everything and I'll run that again there
you go something much smaller and easier
to read in this case
so do you tack H against that's human
readable disk usage and this is going to
show me the space used in kilobytes
megabytes or gigs for any specific
directory that I chose so in this case I
used tests and then under there is a
subdirectory called test2 now lastly D
you tack HS this is basically going to
show me the seam directory and the same
storage size but I am not including any
sub directories for this category now
lastly to clear up space on my boot
directory because I'm sure you're
wondering about that I can use another
command and I'll show you that one real
quick it is deep package Tech L Linux -
image star hit that ok so now we see a
huge line up of the Linux image files
installed
this machine so then I can type in you
name tak R and this will show me the
current running Linux image that I am
using and then all I have to do is use
these commands that are listed over a
task ubuntu.com to purge or remove all
the old images and dependencies from my
computer so I stopped getting the super
annoying pop-up every single time I
build up my computer about my boot
directory being full yes Linux thank you
I realize it's full I've been a little
busy lately to run through all these
different images and make sure that I
delete them well thank you very much but
if you of course have a better way to
manage a full boot directory let me know
in the comments below because it's
definitely something annoying and I feel
like everybody has run into this problem
at least once be sure to subscribe to

you got some good information out of
this episode until then I want to hear
your feedback you can comment below be
sure to check out our sister show hack 5
especially this week a couple of two
weeks ago maybe it was we said goodbye
to somebody who is very dear and special
to us so definitely check that out and
you know send her good wishes on her
Rainbow Bridge because we miss her a lot
and I think that's enough of that so I
will be over there as well reminding you
