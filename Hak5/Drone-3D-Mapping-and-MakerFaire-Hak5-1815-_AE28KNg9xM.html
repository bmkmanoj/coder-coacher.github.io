the Internet of Things at maker faire
all that and more this time on hak5 this
episode of hak5 is brought to you by
domain.com how stable this thing needs
to beat against the growth recovering
not by hand I catch in my hand oh yeah
okay Cheryl spotlights that's more like
we're nkosi with this kind of overcast
sure Harry is in extremely low tide this
morning which is perfect for the mission
at hand I'm tagging along with the folks
from the Richmond Yacht Club to inspect
what's left of the Southampton sholde
lighthouse and it is the perfect
opportunity to test out a new drone
photography technique
his sketchy I'll just throw out a life
jacket his landing pattern get somebody
to the lighthouse was built in 1905 in
the San Francisco Bay northeast of Angel
Island it housed a fifth-order Fornell
lens until nineteen sixty that since
been on display at Angel Island and the
main house was actually moved to tensley
island near stockton now what's left of
it is a deteriorating platform home to
birds bells and a flashing red
navigational aid it's a concern to
boaters who have been known to use it as
a racing marker so today we're taking
some photos of it at low tide and
hopefully we'll gather enough good shots
to stitch together a 3d rendering well I
have the issue where it's like where am
i and I'm like which me
yes great thank you that was just a fun
opportunity I can't wait to stitch it
all together yar mr. darren kitchen what
does this photogrammetry that do you
speak of photogrammetry is really just
the measurement of anything in the real
world using photographs and you know
it's a scientific way of making making
objects and other things from just
images and not just images but also like
anything that you consider a photography
when you get in some of the more
advanced like you know lasers and stuff
like that but you've probably already
done it today we take a look at Google
Earth this is actually where we just
word i'm just in google maps right here
Wow and i'm gonna right click and say
measuring distance and then i'm going to
click over there and it will tell me
that that was 22.8 two feet you can do
that yeah this is cool yeah you can just
Boop dragon you know measure whatever
you can change units and all of those
you know yeah it's a lot of fun and I've
used it plenty of times or I'm like oh
you know that house looks interesting
maybe I'm interested in renting the
house how big is that house and figure
out the square footage just from a
satellite map or things like that and
it's really cool this technique is used
in topographic mapping it's used in
architecture engineering manufacturing
geology I mean you name it and it's
pretty cool because the same kinds of
techniques can also be used to create 3d
models out of real world things which is
really kind of exciting so is that what
you were doing there basically I got the
opportunity from the guys at the
Richmond yacht club to go and check out
the structure I was falling apart and
there's some interesting rich history
about this lighthouse that I'll have
links in description for but essentially
is becoming an obstacle for these
beer-can races when people cut it a
little too close and I've heard of
incidents so since this was today this
morning was like the lowest the tide has
been in quite a long time as per some
farmers almanac or something like that I
don't know I'm not a sailor but the idea
is that we went out when it was super
low and you could actually
these pylons which when the tides higher
you can't see the smile on stick a
dangerous ruin your day yeah and I
thought that this would be a great
tie-in with some of the things that
you've been doing recently I know that
we're taking another look at some of the
other awesome stuff from Maker Faire yes
this is very maker in fact one of the
things I want to talk about was a suite
of tools out of our good friends over at
Autodesk you guys know that these guys
are the makers of AutoCAD and 3ds max
which are so near and dear to my heart
so many years in high school spent with
making NURBS surfaces and facets yeah
good stuff well they have a whole free
suite of tools free as in beer not as in
speech going by the name of 1 2 3 d and
these 12 3d apps are kind of awesome
they are super simple their consumer
focus there they're aimed at hobbyists
and tinkerers and some will probably
argue that they're not as advanced as a
lot they're not open source but they are
a great intro to some of the wonderful
facets of the whole maker world and it's
kind of brilliant because I'm going to
be looking at some of the alternative
some of the open source alternatives to
this today but as far as like diving
right in I think that 1 2 3 d catch is
an epic thing that you can already just
you can pull out your phone right now
android or iOS and start playing with 1
2 3 d catch you know I have to agree
this is this is a trend that I saw at
maker faire this year was just
introducing people to technology in a
really easy way so that they can do hard
stuff like 3d rendering for you or for
for me it was all about electronic
components and programming lots of like
drag-and-drop software like how imagine
that with programming yeah i mean that's
that i love just like more stem yes
please and this is done in like a super
simple fashion where anybody can
basically you take lots of photos and
then instantly you can create a 3d like
representation of it and you can export
this out into you know ways where you
can actually then 3d model it bring it
into a more advanced program or you can
even export it to an STL and then go
ahead and three
print it which is pretty ridiculous so
it sure beats modeling the old-fashioned
way which I know because I've done and
it's time consuming its much fun so this
was an epic opportunity to try it out in
a more grandiose scale because while you
can just go ahead and get this app and
you should on your Android or iOS or
whatever and literally all you have to
do is just take like a couple dozen
photos of an object so if I wanted to
you know do this mouse I would rotate my
camera around this mouse and then i
would get another higher vantage point
and do the same thing around the top of
it and what's pretty cool about this is
you can do this on a smartphone or even
any class pc it doesn't really matter if
it's like a high-end rig yeah because it
goes up to their servers again with the
whole it's freezin be or not as a stage
but yeah it is pretty cool that you
don't need the processing power all you
need is a set of photos like these so oh
wow these are right off the GoPro and
you can I mean you can see it's really
low tide you can see like all of them oh
my gosh all this stuff there and this
won't come out as well as like some in
like controlled environments because
we've got waves and such going on so if
you look at this pile on right here
you'll notice that when I go to the next
one gets little and zoomed by the wave
but then in the next one you can see
much more of it and this is really all I
need if I just keep hitting next here
you'll see I'd make a high pass yeah
trying to keep it wide and then a lower
pass and that's it that is so cool
that's something like what 48 like 58 a
photo is 57 photos and so all it takes
is opening up 1 2 3 D catch and then
uploading them to their servers and and
almost immediately after you get this so
check this out here this is what a 3d
representation now that is so
immediately of this so now the guys at
the at the Yacht Club can actually get a
really good understanding of what
they're up against here yeah with with
all these different pylons because
pylons that are usually under the
the water right it's so cool it's not
perfect right but if you're used to you
know putzing around in Google Earth yeah
this should look kind of familiar I mean
we can make out like here's the ladder
and here's some of the other stuff
underneath and you know you get a pretty
good aspect of it and you can actually
go ahead and click in here and and
select different elements of it and kind
of clean it up if if you felt so
inclined it's really cool and then yeah
the ability to export this out I mean
it's just kind of crazy as somebody who
has done 3d modeling the hard way it's
just so awesome to see how it
immediately did the texture mat thing
immediately how it like gothic geometry
and it did this just from photographs
wow so that's so impressive yeah i mean
lets you got to say something about
technology in 2015 nowadays we have
phones that can make a 3d render out of
you know 50 pictures yes upload them to
some dude server and there you go you
have a 3d print yo model yeah I know
this stuff is just scratching the
surface to yeah so you can click around
and actually see it overlaid on to say
some of the photographs so you kind of
get some reference of where that was
yeah in relationship to and you can
actually turn on different layers and
say edit the cameras you can display the
cameras here you can actually see like
from all of the different perspectives
of those cameras as they spin around and
around job with the drone there yes this
is actually also why it's you know why
automated flight paths yes stuff are
really cool i love when all of these
things kind of come together like we
talked to Peter before about using the
paparazzi open-source UAV i'm sorry i've
been saying drone this entire segment
but what you guys know that i mean in my
heart is a model aircraft right so a
small UAS yeah these guys so imagine
taking one of these guys and
pre-programming it to spin around you so
you stand perfectly still Shannon right
and then this thing just kind of like
gives you a little buzz cut comes all
the way around you and then you get like
a perfect haircut but every single time
the same that's really cool right I'm
impressed I think this is doing I think
it's really exciting that you're helping
out like a local
community club that's pretty awesome I
didn't mean I just good job there like
the opportunity to go out on a boat
that's a good karma points oh you just
wanted to go on the boat did they give
you candy afterwards to this no I had
that in the van no I'm you and even if
you aren't going to make any of these
you can actually just load up 1 2 3 d
catch and there's like an entire gallery
of other things that people have
submitted so you can just go ahead and
click any of these and like pull up
somebody else's work like check out this
guy's zebra or things of that nature I
can go to my projects and I've done a
few of these actually here's ferry Point
for example whoo and let me turn off
that camera layer there we go and this
is oh that's cool yes that's right here
is where the railroad would terminate
here in point richmond and you can
actually see this is basically where a
boat would part here and then you know
end off whatever shipment it had for the
train exactly you can even see the rails
right here and this entire rig right
here is essentially so that this rail
section could raise and lower to meet
where the boat is depending on the tide
and you know it's not perfect but it's
still just so much fun and it's only
getting better so i thought that i would
point this out for anybody that's
interested in getting into this kind of
stuff i mean even if you're just going
to you know do like a figurine and then
you can like immediately take it into
your 3d software cleaning it up some you
know get yourself an STL file out of
that you can pop over to your 3d printer
i know that i'm going to be doing that
with shannon later haha gonna make our
own 3d snubs STL's and you can you can
do make those action figures i don't
know make action figure you'll be fun
come on maybe we'll do one of you okay
maybe we'll do the whole cast and curly
can i mention by the way if you guys
haven't checked out threat wire yet you
can find that over at hak5 org or threat
wire net this week we have a lot of
really interesting stuff going on
there's a bunch of hearsay about what's
happening with this hacker on a plane oh
my gosh and everyone's freaking out and
then there's a whole bunch of
information about mobile encryption and
people are really fighting to keep
mobile encryption available to you know
users me and you it's a heineken freedom
we're like it's almost like we're admits
to another crypto Wars yes you know I'll
link to more amazing reading from the
90s because all of this has happened
before and all of it will happen again
so all right we gotta fight for a right
to party and agree with that we're gonna
take a quick break but when we get back
I am so excited to see all the awesome
stuff from the ground more MORE Maker
Faire we'll be back doesn't matter if
you're into photogrammetry or telegram a
tree when you've got that killer idea
you need to snag yourself a domain name
and web hosting fast and with domain
coms quick domain discovery system and
they're easy checkout process you can
have your website up and running in no
time I've told you before how much I
love dil mein kaam mainly because
they're affordable reliable and easy to
use but also because they're so active
on social media you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why it's just a
really fun place to do business and the
guys over at domain com Hugh trans vac
five so they want to hook you up so they
made this coupon codes really easy to
remember attack five hak5 use that at
checkout and get yourself an extra
fifteen percent off and when you think
domain names think domain.com i'm here
at maker faire 2015 this is Shannon
Morse reporting and i'm here with well
from proto pallet hi will how are you
doing good Shannon thanks so this looks
really cool it very much looks like an
art piece almost like one of the the
painting pieces that you generally see
with artists
yes we designed it we designed it
modeled on an artist's palette because
what what pro 2 palette is for is it's
meant to teach kids how to build amazing
things with electronics and to code and
particularly with Arduino so when kids
turn 11 12 13 and they start to move out
of experiencing themselves as artists
they either move into electronics or off
to something else and so we wanted to do
is we want it to connect with the
artists in kids because creativity with
electronics is art and we don't want to
separate those two things I absolutely
agree you have to have some kind of
creative control component to it or
people lose interest yeah absolutely and
and it also can be scary right and so
what we did what we didn't want to do
when we built pro 2 palette is we didn't
want to create something that was Square
and rigid and intimidating and scary we
wanted it to be organic we wanted it to
we wanted it to stay human because
that's who builds wonderful things as
humans so in your opinion how is proto
palette keeping it human what proto
palette does is there's there's this
thing in in the mind of the creative
person so if I was a creative person and
I'll leave that to others to decide but
if I was a creative person I get an idea
and then I want to make it come true
with mostly with microcontrollers and if
you go look around maker faire you'll
see that with microcontrollers you'll
get an idea and then you sort of have to
clean your room you've got it you've got
to dig through a box of components and
you've got to sort things out and get
them set up where they need to be you've
got to figure out the bits and pieces
you need and and and by the time you go
through that whatever creative idea
whatever spark whatever excitement there
was it's it's not what it was when you
started it's not that light bulb moment
anymore because you have to slog through
all of this crap to get going and and so
what we did was brought about it is we
took everything you could we thought we
might need to build a project and we
built it into pro 2 palette so like the
big pro 2 palette behind me it's got
toggle switches and momentary buttons
and three different kinds of
potentiometers and rocker switches and
36 different kinds of LEDs it's got
servo it's got a stepper motor it's got
RF and infrared sensors on it it's got
all sorts of things built in and they're
all in the same place every time you go
to start something so you don't have to
clean your room anymore you can just
start playing and then the other thing
that's really cool about pro 2 palette
is if there's something that that's not
there we've built in what we call module
swatches and those are the little dots
around the edge of the palette you can
take any kind of sensor you want and
stick it to the pro 2 palette wire it up
to either the breadboard that's built in
or your microcontroller or several
microcontrollers and then it stays where
you put it and so you can you can make
it infinitely expandable there isn't any
limit to the things that you could build
with pro 2 palette and it just gets you
from here to there instantly really so
there's no soldering required I don't
have to do I still have to deal with the
code whenever I install the Arduino with
it with Arduino the Arduino comes with
huge amounts of sample Arduino doesn't
publish the code you could go to
instructables or any old place or pro 2
palette com you can get you can get
anything you can think of to build one
or two or three people if you combine
the work of one or two or three people
to that is all going to be open source
you can cobble together whatever right
what's the joke Shakespeare is the last
person to write anything original and
all the rest of us are stealing from him
same thing in microcontrollers same
thing with Arduino I mean there's like I
think there's like six guys who wrote
stuff and then we're all stealing from
them right and so and no soldering you
don't for solder if you want to keep
things permanent you can you can use
like you know permanent I've got this
little syringe filled with epoxy
conductive epoxy so if I build something
beautiful with proto palette and I want
it to stay that way I can squirt
conductive epoxy into the breadboard and
then it stays right and so I'm I'm
building a building a knockoff of a nest
thermometer at my house because I
thermostat because I think 250 bucks is
too much for a thermostat and so yeah so
like come on so with with this little
with this protocol what we've done oops
is we've drilled little holes in the
bottom of it
so that you can hang it on the wall
right if you create something that's art
you can hang it on the wall and treat it
like art you don't have to so it's just
as happy it's just as happy on a dusty
workbench in the garage as it is hanging
on a wall as a piece of beautiful art or
hanging on the wall as a thermostat at
my house there's there's no limit to the
number of things that you can build
we're building we're making robot kits
we're making little science kits for
kids heads we just want to shorten that
distance I just wanted I don't want to
make kids clean their room before they
can do something awesome right I just
want them to go directly to the awesome
you want to get them excited so they
become like the geniuses of our next
generation yes and that's the thing is
they all get excited they all get really
really passionate about some idea and
then they have to sift through that box
of junk and then and and nobody can
survive that or at least I can't the
creative mind can't survive the idea
can't survive that kind of discipline
and if we can if we can short-circuit
that part of it i think i think the
number of ideas that come true the
number of things that get created is
going to explode well i'm totally down
so where can i find this you can find
here at maker faire you can get proto
pellets start which is our new one at
maker shed right here at the store you
can get it at maker shed calm you can
buy it at pro 2 palette calm all sorts
of places and and then there's like a
scad of them that are coming in the next
couple of months that's awesome and do
you have tutorials available for anybody
that wants to get started yes we've got
tutorials online I teach a bunch of I
teach a bunch of basic projects that
help get people started my 13 year old
daughter Ellie also does tutorials she's
a she's a girl who makes and a girl who
codes and so she's she's starting to to
teach people how to do stuff online she
made a she made a couple of things she
invented this thing called the brother
Buster which is a little infrared sensor
attached to an Arduino that is also
attached to a little Python script and
and it sits in her room and if her
brother goes in the room it sends her a
text and so she knows
yes awesome I need one of those yeah and
so we're so we're letting we're letting
kids not just my kids but we're letting
kids kind of drive the product roadmap
here we're not we're not we're not
trying to sell them what we think they
think is cool we're actually asking and
listening and building for them well
thank you so much it was such a pleasure
to chat with you about the proto palette
I'm really excited to check one of these
out and of course for any of our
listeners you can check out all of our
information over at hak5 org thank you
again thanks very much this is shanna
morris over at maker faire 2015 down in
san mateo california i'm here with bio
hi vaio how are you doing how you doing
I'm doing great thank you for asking so
you guys aren't here showing hardware
necessarily but you guys are showing a
way to connect everything to the cloud
correct that is correct so as you know
the Internet of Things is upon us right
so you're going to have a lot of devices
we know makers are for innovative
developers that are creating the next
generation of devices so we're showing
them how to actually make those devices
IOT compatible so the experience is if
you think about a cloud platform it
really makes it easy to connect devices
into it and then it opens up an API to
create applications so for any makers
out there you stop thinking about I want
to make this device idea where right how
do you do that you need a partner like
zoton that's going to give you the
drivers to embed into your physical
hardware and then when you do that it
goes into the cloud it opens up an API
so your application is only making
restful api calls into the cloud to
actually interact with that device so
I'm not just going to be stuck with one
hardware component as with your device
within your zatar I can actually use it
with say I have a Raspberry Pi device
and a bluetooth capable device I can use
it with anything I want absolutely you
can use it with any device so one of the
exciting things were also this event
actually is we announcing the very first
ever on embed IOT starter kits so I'll
show you what it looked like
it's really a simple IOT device if you
think about it this is what's going to
go into your next generation of devices
right it has an mm bed cortex m0 chipset
in it where a duel board that supports
both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so if this goes
into your device immediately starts
talking into this at our platform right
and what that enables you to do is
really start interacting through your
device through an API so we have two
demonstrations here that were just
showing exactly how easy it is to do
show me show me so the best one is
really if you look at that architecture
we're saying listen you need to create
experiences IH is going to be about
experiences the device is exciting but
it's going to be about the application
what is the end user going to experience
in this particular scenario we're
showing an example of how a connected
wine store is going to be able to detect
when a customer walks into the store and
then allow the customer to actually
interact with the wine bottle so in this
particular example I'm picking up a
white wine bottle it's a California wine
good choice and if I place it on my
announcement if I placed on my raspberry
NFC reader that's going to go into the
data cloud and allow that digital
display to just change right so now I
can see exactly what it looks like and
that's how we expect applications to
look like an AIT wall this is a standard
html5 application it knows nothing about
hardware or technology it's just making
API calls into the top platform and
we're interrogating whatever physical
device is out there this is really cool
I can imagine it being extremely helpful
for so many businesses just off the top
of my head yeah absolutely and we're
super excited about it as well and then
the second example we're showing it's
just taking a standard IOT Raspberry Pi
making it an IOT kit right so you see a
lot of Raspberry Pi use cases around you
know robots and everything but what
we've done is actually put I was at our
agent onto the Raspberry Pi and that is
connected into the cloud and just
interacting through a standard web based
application or mobile app you can
control the i/o boards on the Raspberry
Pi that's awesome oh so useful yeah
absolutely it down so yeah we're super
excited to be here we're looking for the
next generation of IHC makers
to help them make it easy to build
applications so can I find this in any
businesses as of yet so right now we do
have some pilots going on actually
fortunately I can talk about them yet
but you know we do have partners we're
fortunate enough to be a device
manufacturer we currently serve you know
ninety percent of Fortune 500 companies
so we're working with them to just try
and make sure that they're ready for the
next generation and where can I find
more information as a developer or
manufacture so for developers best place
to go is at are calm at z8 CA are calm
and we have a developer zone we actually
signed up developers now we make the
tools available to them so they can
start creating IOT devices by oh thank
you so much for speaking with me about
this it's really exciting i can't wait
to see this in every wine store that I
go to awesome thank you very much good
speaking with you that about wraps up
this amazing episode of hack 5 i'm a set
of Maker Faire and then I was like no no
Shannon you have to wait until next year
until you can go back wow the press they
really did a number on you man press day
was great it was so nice I want to go
back next year they better have prostate
again next year you know I am really
excited about all of the amazing things
that have been happening all of the
amazing feedback that we've been getting
so it turns out we're doing something
right thank you keep sending that in
feedback at hak5 or we really value
everything that you guys think what you
want to see next and ideas for the shows
so yes that is the best place leave a
comment we've got awesome discussions
going by the the threat wire discussions
on YouTube are a YouTube anomaly so I
have to hand it to everybody they're
amazing stuff amazing I always comments
on YouTube that I enjoyed have read well
I also want to point out if you guys
haven't noticed if maybe you're watching
this on the RSS feeds that there are
also a bunch of other shows over at hak5
org one of which is our good friend
muaks does metasploit minute and i have
had the awesome opportunity to in the
last few episodes host with him and i
have to say that the five ways to get
initial access is kind of epic so if
you've ever wonder like hot Moving's how
do you buy any girls peers oh we're
talking about that initial access
oh yeah if the secretary you can get
secretary drunk and she have to be a
girl then yes buy a girl a beer I don't
know that that's actually not in the
show I don't know what movies I can't
confirm nor deny of moba to the ever
used this technique to get initial
