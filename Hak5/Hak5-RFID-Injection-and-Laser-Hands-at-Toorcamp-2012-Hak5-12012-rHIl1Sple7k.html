by team today Mel what inspired you to
get yourself a hot injection well really
it was a you know 2005 and I was working
at a medical clinic doing consulting for
IT and I started getting other clinics
in the area and just started amassing
this giant jailers key ring and it was
pretty ridiculous so my office door was
a crash Bart door locked automatically
and I was always carrying heavy things
in and out oh my god it's got to be a
better way to I wish the door just knew
that was me and so I thought about it
real quick and I said okay well
biometrics is perfect right it could
just kind of see me coming or like some
easy way to know that's me but it was
then and still is kind of clunky it's
expensive difficult to implement and you
know kind of vulnerable to vandalism so
I thought well RFID that's cheap fast
reliable easy to implement in you know
pretty resilient so I'd still wanted to
have some way to not have to carry the
card and so I thought oh animals you
know pets have been getting these things
is there anything available so just do a
bunch of research and you know as long
story short I found found a vendor that
actually had a what's called an e/m 5410
to type tag and there's a lot of cheap
gear to read it and I saw 'some so I
ordered some tags or to some gear
already had the thing built when the
tags arrived and I had all these doctors
as clients so I'm like hey doctors let's
do this and they flip Jer so I had it in
and you know access control working and
then I thought about I'm like wow that's
kind of its kind of not normal right so
that I just sent some pictures to some
friends today you know here you know go
check this out and they were like whoa
what the hell what you do and some of
them put it on like Boing Boing and
slash dot and then it just exploded do
you get called like a cyborg I get
called a lot of things i do get called a
cyborg i kind of don't agree with that i
think somebody with a pacemaker is much
more cybernetic or cochlear implant way
more cybernetic than me which is i just
moved the rfid tag from a pants pocket
to ask in pocket so tell me about the
the bio side of it what is this what is
the
human do when you start injecting
technology and well uh you know because
it doesn't really interact with my body
I would love it there was some way to
like have a sensor on it where it could
like report my temperature or you know
hello Emily you've got a temp fever you
don't want to come home or like you know
glucose test or uric acid or whatever
some kind of interactive thing but right
now i mean the utility of it for me is
simple ask access control and that's all
I ever wanted it for and it works great
for that yeah you know log into the
computer start the car start the
motorcycle you know getting my door it's
awesome fire safe I have a fire safe
that I can get into pretty easily okay
as a fellow writer I have to know how do
I of the motorcycle that was actually
pretty easy I just you know I looked at
this schematic in the manual and I said
okay when i turn the key three pairs of
wires are you know connected and so i
just got three automotive relays and
then a fourth that kind of as a self
latching relay so and a cheap reader kit
that i have a bunch here today and you
know just you know read the tag says yep
that ID is in my authorized list kicks
out a 12 volt signal that the the relay
latches it latches all the other relays
and it's as if i turn the key and the
important thing about that is to note
that it's an additional authentication
method not a replacement for the key so
you can still use the key or you can use
RFID and i think so you say you have to
put the key into you know you get a turn
the the motorcycle on and then it just
basically turns it over for you no no
it's actually a it's not a two-factor
authentication it's an alternative to
the key so if i don't have the key i can
just scan and it'll act as if that i
turn the key and so then I can you know
crank over the engine it'll start up and
go if I don't present the tag and I
don't have a key it'll crank over but it
won't start so I could use the key or
the tag tell me that the actual tech of
it is it like public key encryption or
using like a symmetric key is there like
a is there a challenge in response to it
a lot of automotive keys use the texas
instrument that does have a challenge
response but my whole thing was like
cheap and easy so the the tag that i
have is IAM for 102 and the gear is
super cheap and there's no there's no
cryptology to it at all it's just
literally it'll respond with this ID to
any reader that inquiries you know about
it so
I I consider the privacy and security
issues around it and really came down to
for me anyway and for a lot of people
use case so in a private use case let's
say you're a attackers you typically
random right you don't really know
exactly who you're attacking you just
kind of attack whatever's available you
know people port scan and they you note
written them people are trying to RF
scan people's credit cards when they
want by but and those are random attacks
so for me the personal use case I've
built everything that I have it's not a
business use case or anything like that
so it's not widely known what this
number does so if you were to get the
number that I have and not know anything
about me it's a number it's useless to
you you don't know what it does or that
even that it's a key to anything so on
the inverse if you you know scan
somebody's credit card you know with RF
naval credit card you know immediately
what to do you don't have to know them
so that's the difference between
personally use in a business use case
and I'm not I'm not too scared of a
personal use security issue because
somebody knew me and wanted to get into
my house or something like that then
they're gonna do it right they're going
to break a window or whatever this is
you know scanning my RF tag and
emulating it be overkill for but you're
not worried about like the feds like
just shaking your hands and in the
process of like gripping your hand
cloning your yorkie that's possible I'm
not afraid that the feds are going to do
that I mean I'm not doing anything that
would you know invite their wrath but
and you know some people think that
there's some way to track the chip
around it really just has a 1 or 2 inch
read range it's theoretically possible
to build like a giant coil like maybe in
a doorway or something that you could
you know put so that when people walk
through or when I walked through would
read the tag and then they would know he
was here at this time and date but
that's really I mean it's a really
expensive and ridiculous thing
especially when a biometric solution
like a face rec camera it'd be much
easier and cheaper to deploy an out is
well can you show me the technology how
this works sure so in my left hand i
just have the IAM form 102 it's a low
frequency 1 25 kilohertz tag in my right
hand I had a Philips high tag which is
134 kilohertz and it had some crypto
security features like a 40-bit
challenge-response key and some data
storage but I found
my right hands can my project hand I
really didn't find much use for the PI
tag and the gear is more expensive and
everything so I had it removed and
actually contacted a company to custom
build a tag that's in the high frequency
range which is 13.5 six megahertz so I
had one of those tags made and it's
actually kind of cool because you can
interface it with NFC so this is your
phone here and I'm going to go ahead and
scan it if I can get it to the battery
that's built into this phone has NFC you
know antenna built into the battery
which is kind of at times depending on
the manufacturer it's not very reliable
it's great until you get third-party
batteries and then they don't have that
well actually I did by a third-party
battery and it has a better one so I'm
gonna use my phone okay so I've even got
a big ol you know case around it and it
works pretty well so I have an
application made by a company called nxp
it's just called tag info and it just it
does a really great job of just reading
the RF tag and then I can look at the
end F record on the tag and it's my
contact each other this is your so this
right here is just your vCard yeah it's
just v card data put into and f records
stored on the tag and you know if your
phone had a you know if i spend enough
time it would read and then you have my
contact details and as we learned from
black hat and DEF CON it's really you
could also open a browser page to a
exploit or ever thought about like maybe
there's a buffer overflow that you could
have in your hand yeah I mean there is a
there's a guy that I met at in Australia
to iee event and his name is dr. mark
Gasson he he was the guy that that kind
of proved that it was possible to
propagate a vulnerability through RFID
and really it was a simple like SQL
injection type attack but it Illustrated
that you could kind of carry a virus or
a vulnerability around on tags and if
you were advanced enough you could
program through that vulnerability
exploit you could program the system to
also carry forward that exploit on other
tags that were presented to the system
so you could you could use your your tag
to introduce the vulnerability and then
update the system so that every future
tag presented would then carry it on to
other systems so in a business use case
where the the deployment is a common you
know platform
if you find a vulnerability and it's
commonly deployed that you got a wide
open attack vector Wow have you were you
ever concerned doing this that like oh
it's like you know it's like hard coding
an application with DES you know or some
lame crypto like that are you able to
update the tags or are you stuck with
whatever you put in there you know in 40
years well you look back and be like
dang it I don't even have that phone
number why is my vcard wrong yeah so the
the utility hand left hand that tag is
just read only it can't be changed it's
just an ID number that's unique from the
factory and it really is kind of the tag
that I use almost for everything and
it's like a symmetric key yeah basically
although I mean it's really simple like
you know 40 bit number that's all it is
Sony's so on the right hand though like
with this new you know high frequency
tag it has 1 1 kilobyte of storage space
they make 4 kilobyte and 16 kilobyte
storage as well although you know the I
don't think the 16k will shrink the form
factor down enough I don't know I have
to investigate take that pdp-11 yeah
yeah so you know I can totally update it
there are some some security features so
I can lock down memory blocks and kind
of pass code it you know and for a
normal tag where it was like a card in
my wallet that might be a problem
because the those algorithms have been
cracked already they people work on them
as soon as they come out really and so
the the text algorithms have been
cracked but it does take a little bit of
time so in you know in the case of my
hand that that exposure time is very
limited because it's such a small read
range and I have to get right on you
know I have to present my hand to the
reader typically so if it's in a wallet
somebody can kind of put a bag next to
and then the cards antenna is huge so
the range can be you know manipulated
whereas in this case it's really a short
you know a period of time a short window
to try to attack the tag and then
there's other issues like I could have a
rotating one-time use key that's put in
there that you know I could also monitor
the reader so say oh well the last time
you were here it looks like you've used
it you know you've used it in between
and I don't have a record of that use
and so then in an alert and make up the
kinds of arrangements so all of that is
done without a battery or anything yeah
it's totally passive what
is kind of cool i mean i'll probably you
know turn to dust in the coffin and this
thing will still be there so it's no
yono battery you don't have to replace
it it's basically just an IC with a coil
you know copper antenna and it works
more or less like a air corps
transformer so i'm not familiar with
that technology is that like induction
charging yeah it's very similar so you
know the reader creates a magnetic field
you bring the tag within that field and
the coil antenna will induct power from
it and then the tag communicates with
the reader by pulling more or less power
modulating that field the reader can
sense those power fluctuations and it's
you know it's data so it says ok and the
data tag can communicate its ID or
whatever you started so it's only
powered when it's being read yeah
otherwise it's completely inert there's
nothing going on which is you know it's
great so people are concerned sometimes
about there's been concerns over you
know cancer issues and things like that
and you get way more exposure just
carrying a cell phone around you know
electron you know radiation type
exposure other issues you know people
being earned about you know cancer
because there was some reports that came
out there was people doing Studies on on
toxicology and some of their animals
were getting these tumors around the
implant site for the pet chips right
those animal tracking tags and those the
thing that people need to understand is
a couple things one those animals are
predisposed to get cancer they're
supposed to get cancer they're doing you
know carcinogen studies and toxicology
studies the other thing is that any chip
that's meant for implantation in the
body that's actually designed for
implantation is it has this bio bond
type porous coating so that coating your
body grows into that coating and locks
the the tag in place so it's kind of an
irritant to the body and and I would
think that the the body would try to
push it out like you expel it well it's
not it doesn't see it as necessarily
foreign invader type thing but it does
you know kind of cause the cellular
structure around the implant to kind of
mutate into these little pores and stuff
not mutate but you know kind of have to
work into this poorest you know
framework or structure so this is kind
of like if I get like a bolt in my knee
sort of yeah
only it's not reactive with the body
body doesn't try to reject it but this
coating really I mean there's no records
that i can see any way of you know
healthy animals getting any kind of
cancerous growth around any of the
implants that people people can get the
app verichip the fda approved it also
has this coating or animals you know
that our pets now there's some like old
pets like old dogs and things where they
do develop tumors in parts of the body
and around this implant site my whole
thing you know reeling it back is you
know the tags that I want to use are not
designed for implantation they use the
same glass as the implanted ones but
they don't have that coding so you know
I have no fear at all about that being a
you know complication in the future and
so what are you doing here at tor camp
well actually I want a ticket here
through geekwire which is great and then
you know I decided I was talking to you
know David organizer and I said well
what can I do to kind of help out and so
it's like you got anything you can talk
about anything I don't know I could do
some implantation Slyke we could set up
an implantation station right so he says
yeah great so I brought a bunch of you
know gauze and iodine and gloves and and
some tags so um for 102 tags 2
millimeter by 12 millimeter and have
some readers that people can use if they
want to buy them and kind of set up a
little access control thing is it easy
to implant it's pretty easy the two by
12 millimeter size goes right into the
pet injector type kits what's a syringe
with a needle and a blow plunger that
pushes the tag out so we just take that
injection kit push the plunger get rid
of the animal tag because it's kind of a
proprietary thing there's not a lot of
gear for it put the you know put the
other m for 102 in and then you know
hold your breath and chewy it so is like
getting your ears pierced or something
yeah maybe it may be a little bit slower
than that because we have to you know go
in carefully and push the thing out and
then pull it out but really it's the
it's the you know the the incision
really that the needle makes that's the
painful part and then you push the
plunger and then pull it out and you
know we can't use any kind of
anesthesiology or you know numbing
agents or anything like that so you know
I just do ice the ice it for a couple
minutes numb it out and then
Wow and these are like a standard place
to get injected um this there isn't
people want to get kind of injections
every implants in different weird places
but when I first got mine nobody really
done it so I really consider all the
options and I chose a place between the
index finger and the thumb that webbing
area there's a radial and median nerve
that go you know kind of split off at
the wrist and go around that area that
area is also great because it's in the
hand and the low read range you know an
answer to a most is it you really it's a
consensual process if I want to you know
have my tag read I have to present it to
a reader the FDA approved verichip time
thing they go in the bicep and the
tricep area but that application is a
reader to tag type scenario where as you
know anything that I built I'm going to
be putting the tag up to the reader so
the hand makes perfect sense for that
because it's easily manipulated and then
you know as far as like you know blunt
force protection I mean it's a it's a
really kind of a squishy for lack of a
better word squishy area in the in the
hands so people have done it in other
places and I you know I don't like it's
up against bone you could pinch it you
could crush the tag broken glass and you
it's not good so this I've had a since
2005 I've had this one you know or
something in the same sense of same you
know a couple months later so yeah I
haven't had any problems with and I've
smashed my hand pretty good so I thought
for sure I was like oh crap but not
still still going so that's awesome
where can people find your site and read
more about this anal it's a mon n i have
a blog a mal any tea and then i also
wrote a book while back and I set up a
user forum for people to ask questions
so RFID toys calm i recently got the
dot-com so I yeah so anyway that's even
asked questions there and I'll answer
dude thank you so much sure probably
appreciate it you guys are probably
heard me gushing about ting over the
last couple of months and I'm so happy
