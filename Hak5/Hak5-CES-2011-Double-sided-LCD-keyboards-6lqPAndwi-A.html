you by go to assist express support
smarter with go to assist express for
hak5 I'm Jen cutter here at CES 2011
we're here at the Gritti booth with
Jacob Jacob tell us what's new what's
new is group at the back typing after
160 years of the rule of the typewriter
machine they waited 20 kilos and let's
put it on a on a desk now we figured out
a way to use all ten fingers without the
need of the desk the idea is that we can
use back side of the input panel to
input text so I can use both my thumbs
from the front and then gradually after
30 minutes our one day to the depends on
my own pace I discover the use of my
fingers at the back and then I get 157
keys in the hand of the divider that you
can type with the 10 fingers which is
five times faster than just using my
thumb and then after using my trackball
on my navigation pad in a dissenter and
squirrel win all all the mouse triggers
I discover that there is also an
orientation sensor inside the device so
when I flip it it knows it will slip and
now I discover the secondary layer with
all the numeric keypad and the arrows
and now they asked want to have standing
all the kids everything I need to
control my pc from the couch with 10
fingers alright so just a question so
when you have it this way and you see
all the letters so you can type with
your fingers here so that's why here or
well it's like this it's also why on the
other side yeah oh I got it again but it
would be easy to
to understand from the back space for
example this is back space now now its
escape its back fish from both sides now
it's escaped on both sides yeah yeah
this is 114 key on the hand of the
device you don't need to get up to the
keyboard anymore that's what's you I
know this works PC Mac Linux well it
there isn't any device that we plug it
in and it didn't work we just have luck
that there is a protocol that's called
the hid the human interface device every
box knows hid so it just plug and play
wireless they used to be tall girl you
put in and that it works batteries in
here yeah to a dive in here pretty nice
now are these available already there
are variable to pre-order in our website
and we r star chick examine march i will
there be in any retail stores this is
why were you here for all right now so
we look at this now this one looks like
a game controller okay now thank you
about a year to the future CES 2012 and
what we want to do and this is the
prototype demoing the transparent LCD
i'm not sure that you will be able to
see it at all but this is the 15th and
present the transparency st-pierre
display so i can see my fingers on this
transparent display and then i can
change the language this is for example
he do we come from israel and if this
for example this is a gaming prototype
so here you big advantage is that we can
play with your thumbs and type at the
same time so I've got someone who's the
guitar guitar player so if got it we got
a very good coordination he manages to
play at the world of warcraft hit
someone and right doing well is easier
die die already died or something like
that so that's the great feature about
this gaming product and then navigate
feature that way
show is that for example you can have a
game keyboard so now I mean they may be
your action keys yeah so these are my
actions now these are spells if I get
into a fight and I have got here all
sorts of blows and whatever I can use
this display to have analog input like
that for example this is just example of
a volume or speed of running so this is
this is the future of gaming and we're
also trying to have transparent LCD for
the media center line of products and
then we'll be able to browse between
application and they have an open API
for people to program and then start to
really stealing them and understand what
they can do with it I was great to hear
that it's open now this you said next
year I know I'm keep going back to the
game thing so this is next you have a
projected price or quarter and this one
would be our estimate around the 150 to
200 it depends if you want color and if
you want multi-touch and if you want to
dwell started the match the price goes
on and on the problem is that we are
geeks and we like gadgets so it's a
problem when you define the
specifications of a product I want this
one yeah I want this one I want this one
in the price goes on and on so we'll
have to to find the right right pricing
and maybe we will have different
categories inning mega zombie low cost
products and entry into the world of
your pity and then more advanced
products the great thing about it is
that what we plan is to
if you preorder this product for example
you get a discount for the next product
next year so actually get it for free if
you enter into the world of backpacking
