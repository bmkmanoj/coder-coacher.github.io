by domain.com
it's time once again to check for 110 so
Corey from Tennessee says he's looking
back on some previous episodes and he
wanted to give us a call out for this
page kite set up which he loved by the
way good job Darren and he said remember
to set your ssh proxy to http 443 which
is required by putty so very interesting
that's just a little FYI for all you
guys thank you so much appreciate you
guys sending that in what about so Cory
um yes is not the only one that he know
that's actually we good no no couple of
ones this week so Martin from Louisville
asks I have backtracked and watched a
few episodes of hak5 concerning
multiboot USBs what ifs your current
favorite to date X boot or katana or is
there another one that you suggest so
what do you suggest Aaron do this all
three of these no I literally this is
what I do I just you just stick them all
and I just carry multiple you assess I
know it's not the hackers thank allah
bless you to have a different distro in
each one yeah you know what I'm saying I
kind of multiboot I just use a bunch of
the thing is we go to enough trade shows
that we just get so many USBs that I
never really but for somebody that
doesn't have a lot of USBs both are good
option listen to you know six I haven't
used I haven't used expert so maybe we
need to do a segment on that I did a
segment oh ok well then did you like it
cuz I know that you're a fan of both
well you and you also like hacking from
a cave yeah well yes so I guess it
really I guess what it did comes down to
is are the tools in katana going to
suffice or is there stuff that you want
that's outside of that day you could do
with experts oh yeah either way yeah I'm
a big fan of katana that's one of my one
of my definite favorites but um it is it
is very optional as to which one works
for you the best so all right let us
know what you want salem's getting his
android or not James from sales from
Salem so James from Salem says Darren
glad to see you're finally getting into
tasker it's a wonderful program where
your imagination is the limit when I
started getting into the pineapple I
discovered that Tasker could give me an
automated way of making sure I wasn't
the victim the profile that he is using
is it will put this in the show notes if
Wi-Fi is near Yas occur attack abc13 to
alarm will go off
alarm level 7 Wi-Fi set to OFF play
loudest most obnoxious alarm that he has
and pop up a notification that says
warning pineapple within range morning
morning i love that especially be like
couple it with them TTS engine get it to
speak that yeah I mean that's what I
mean commander morning you know I bet
that could be kind of ported over to a
linux cron job as I'm finished using IW
so I I know I love it it's basically
like crunchers it's like shell scripts
for Android and I don't know why it took
me so long to get over to it but man it
is so cool thank you if you guys have
