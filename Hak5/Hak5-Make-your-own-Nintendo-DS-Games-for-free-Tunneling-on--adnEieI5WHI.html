DS homebrew development SSH tunneling
the easy way with Mac Linux or Windows
and answers to your virtualization
questions all that and more on this
episode of hack 5
this episode of hat 5 is brought to you
by goto assist Express and domain.com
got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain lo
walk nack5 my name is darren kitchen i'm
at last dock and I'm Shannon Morse
and this is of course your weekly dose
of Technology it's hack five and we are
full of Turkey
very happy to be here mmm Turkey I hope
everybody had a great Thanksgiving and
for all the non-us people well happy
November yeah it's just an excuse time
to go to the pub and get hammered like
oh my us brethren didn't either you guys
go shopping on Black Friday yes we need
so drinking for Boxing Day and
everything now you went outside on Black
Friday I went outside on Black Friday
and let me tell you it is after working
it there's one side of the story but
after being involved in like lines we
moored up it like five more you know
okay but I caught crazy enough of the
aftermath to realize that Black Friday
is a day that I'll never go outside
again yes it's just like a line baby
it's almost as if like they were zombies
you know yeah you kind of feel like that
in the crowd no thank don't go out
without a shovel when you're standing
there in line to check out for 45
minutes when you're actually in the line
to check out longer than you've actually
been shopping yeah that's when you know
you've got a problem yeah wait so sighs
for Turkey would say what's everybody
been up to you um like a rock band
that's about it that's all I've been
doing is playing Lego rock band 24/7
then a ton of feedback on the Zipit
stuff oh yeah yeah so we're working on
some more fun stuff with that but we're
still just acquiring some feedback so we
usually only have like two days a
feedback between an episode release and
recording the next one so that's why
it's kind of like every other for a
follow-up
but this episode we do have some
follow-up stuff on SSH howling what we
did talk about two episodes ago and I'm
excited that Paul on the camera shown us
the Mac way and I've got some easy ways
to do it in Windows and Linux some
automation stuff from one of our awesome
viewers writing us some PHP code and
some Python code turns out I can read
Python oh really
I can speak slower and really
okay do you know what that no happy
holidays
oh that's so sweet there's another
programming language that was like model
you would like the thing was a horse
mm-hmm do you remember what it was no
clue
forgive me male bad my bad it's not
Slytherin its first okay
does that say I'm like Caston Patronus
crappity crap email me with whatever
that language was I forget what it is
but it had the horse as like its logo
alright it was this just a book I know
Riley book and you're just amazing
honest no I don't I don't think so
well it'd be kind of difficult to have
Python a horse mm-hmm as the logo yeah
unless the Python was eating the horse
oh that's a hell of a Python okay be
good I could do pretty hardcore you want
to get in some tech questions sure all
right we got an interesting one from Joe
switch an app to last name he writes him
to ask about he says what's up with
virtual switches and virtual routers he
wants to know you know what is the deal
with virtualization of the network and
honestly I got to see nah I was dude I
said everything to bridge so I'm going
to defer that one Matt what's
virtualization and networks how does
that go together well I mean you know
there's there's there's a couple
different in his email that he actually
sent us there were a couple different
terms virtual routers virtual switch you
know the virtualized environment of the
entire networking fabric taking it one
piece at a time virtual routers you can
have multiple unlike a Cisco or juniper
router you can actually have multiple
virtual routers that have different
parameters set for say a VLAN a
different IP subnet and that kind of
thing inside a VM where you're not
really doing any sort of like virtual
routing but with the Enterprise Plus
version of the vSphere software you can
actually have a plug-in and Cisco was
the first one to make it but using the
api's and the v shield zones and things
like that that come native with the
vSphere application you can basically
write a software based switch that is
complimentary to your existing
deployments so the nexus 1000 I want to
say V module
hooks up with Cisco switches there's a
certain level and I'm not a Cisco guy so
I don't remember them squeegees gonna
base me you know that's like I basically
Ricky this this last week but but I mean
there's there's advanced networking
applications inside a vSphere that you
know you can do P VLANs with community
isolated promiscuous modes you can do
you know your standard VLANs you know
your v shield zones and and there's a
whole aspect which if you're the
virtualization guy mm-hmm you really
need to bring your network security guy
into training with you to be like
alright yeah we're going to be deploying
this so follow along at home and make
sure you take notes because you know
your mindset has to change when it's not
a physical piece of hardware that you
touch any I mean you could potentially
if you add enough hardware NICs
but that's I guess the reason why there
is a virtual virtualized networking is
because you don't I mean on the back of
your your are 600 whatever it is are 900
we've got 12 Ethernet ports but I've got
45 virtual machines running on it
well that work yeah then again I get you
know dozen in VirtualBox and yeah I do
the same thing just bridge them all yeah
I mean and you know it
once want it's no longer down to the
host level everything is at the
distributed network switch at the data
center level which makes your life a lot
easier because you can say okay this and
this and this and this instead of having
to find it at each host so if you've got
you know 20 different hosts that's 20
less things that you have to do where do
you where do you actually start getting
into that level of virtualization
network fill mean you know you helped me
set up the ESXi but I pretty much to set
it all of my VMs up is bridged am I
going to get that level of stuff there
or in the VMware Workstation or what on
the workstation no I mean it really
comes into play once you actually deploy
these fear I think it's going to be beat
the the level that is standard which may
be advanced or something along those
lines but you start you know it's
basically based all I need it's either a
security need or it's a functionality
need where you know I needed to have
separate traffic flowing along the same
Ethernet port so Ivy land one out and
the other is our primary and in this an
Esso
it really comes down to need and if you
have you know sarbanes-oxley
requirements for traffic differentiation
where you know this can't talk to this
or you know somebody comes in your
office and blast you with a six sigma
you know idea Six Sigma is evil by the
way I'm sure you have to deal with all
that fun so I mean all these
requirements are really going to drive
the need to deploy this stuff and until
then you can basically just throw
everything on a box and be like alright
there you go Nate so I hope that answers
your question Joe and kind of gives you
an idea where that is and if you are
having fun with virtualized networks of
your own maybe you want to kick me some
open-source ideas I'd love to play with
some stuff I know that there's a Cisco
tool that I believe we can talk about
soon on now we can or can't I don't
remember what the deal with that is now
yeah anyway well I'll figure that one
out because it is one program but yeah
all right sweet well we've been rambling
in a block and we're also wearing all
white which is like cardinal sin of
podcast and all that stuff but then
again we have red walls so we don't care
anyway right throw it all out the window
it's HD it's HDMI let's do it
exactly we have Jason coming in today
yeah he's some of your favorite stuff
yes Nintendo DS homebrew development so
I'm pretty excited about that let's go
ahead and kick it over to him all right
Jason take it away but first let's go
ahead and thank our awesome sponsor
domain.com want to play all the latest
co-op video games but don't have any
friends contract a companion it's a
great idea that starts with a great
domain at domain.com domain.com has
sweet deals on domain names like player
two rentals calm
domain names for less than ten bucks a
year without pushy upsells no commitment
web hosting for under six bucks a month
private registration and even killer
Virtual Private servers are wide
domain.com is the place to get your next
domain best of all hack five fans get an
additional 15% off their orders when
they type the coupon code hak5 at
checkout got a great idea it all starts
with a great domain at domain.com so
this week on the show I'm going to be
covering des homebrew from start to
finish so what is des homebrew well the
idea is to be able to run unsigned code
on your DS whether that be you know the
aircrack application or or a wardriving
application or just a game that a
smaller studio is made it's a way that
you can get around Nintendo and and
publish your own things and it doesn't
require an official SDK or anything like
that it's actually pretty simple so I'm
gonna let's get into it so you're going
to need your your DS a ROM card of your
choice there's several of them I prefer
the ones that don't require the the GBA
slot just the one the single slot
version makes it a little bit simpler
and then you're also going to need your
micro SD reader and card so first thing
you need to do to set up your your ROM
card is to go ahead and download the
latest firmware from there from the
manufacturers website like I said I'm
using the r4 so go ahead download the
latest version and go to on here
go ahead unzip it and this is what you
get then what you're going to need to go
ahead and try this out you're going to
go ahead and need your need roms so one
of my favorite place to get homebrew and
unsigned applications is DS homebrew
comm it definitely reminds me of the
ti-83 archive site similar look and feel
so go ahead pick out an application or
game go ahead and download it and unzip
it it's going to give you an NDS file
that is the file we're looking for I
went ahead and download the fishtank app
or game I think it is
and just unzipped it left on the card so
go ahead and take out the microSD put it
in the top here are four straight into
the DS and
okay so once you get this the home
screen up a couple different options
you're going to have the the file
browser the music player and the games
well the games are applications it's
just selecting from NDS so I'm going to
head and load up the fish tank and
selecting the top and then I'm going to
go ahead and okay
and then go ahead and select e to load
and now we got the fish tank gap up and
I can in feed my fish I don't have any
fish right now let's get a fish anyway
now you get the idea so now let's take
this a step further we got roms
we got roms on the game you see where to
download them let's develop your own so
the first thing you're going to need is
the development or the SDK so the the
unsigned SDK is the dev kit Pro it is
the definitive development environment
for this go ahead and download the
latest version it's going to give you a
plethora of tools the IDE they give you
is the programmers notepad they also
give you cygwin for compiling which
they've go ahead and put in your pet
they already went ahead and put in your
path so you can run run the make file so
let's go ahead and open up an example
they give you a whole bunch of really
really good examples to open
you've got graphic applications you've
got your classic hello world because
nothing says programming like hello
world you've got some white some Wi-Fi
some of the motion stuff you can got
they give you some of the audio as well
let's go ahead and open the hello world
hello world is a very very simple
application they've got they went ahead
and laid it all out for you and it's
ready to go right on the box so you can
actually compile this and run this right
now but let's make a few modifications
so we've got hello nudies and then you
know evil server is coming just you know
evil server always there then we go
ahead we can make another change let's
so let's go ahead and add another line
homebrew is cool yeah that's going to
lame but you know go ahead and save that
out pop open the command window command
terminal and navigate over to it's going
to be installed in your root directory
so dev kit pro examples NDS HelloWorld
and quite simply type make you've just
built your first DS homebrew application
hop on over the directory and there's a
bunch of different files made the only
one we really care about is the
HelloWorld / or HelloWorld NDS file go
ahead and put in your SD card again
let's go ahead and take our NDS drag it
straight over and we're done let's go
ahead and start it up and see what we
got same procedures of 4-straight and
games and then this time we have a
HelloWorld option so we're going to go
ahead and hit hello world and hit go
so there we have it says I says exactly
what we typed in homebrew it's cool evil
servers coming and it this is from the
original application that I went ahead
and left in and it's gives you the frame
count and the touch X x and y and that's
I don't know if you can see that numbers
actually changing but anyway that's a
that will get you started in in homebrew
there's actually a lot more you can do
with this you can take this really far
with the examples they've given you you
can go ahead and compile all the
examples together so you can you know
have a graphic hello world if you want
or take it even further and start
creating sprites levels games and you
can take it to limit I know where me
starting a TS homebrew section of the
forum so definitely check head over the
forums check that out post games did you
end up developing post ideas that you
have get people going on this because
I'd like to be able to do more on this
if you have any comments questions or
you just want to see more about the
subject email me at Jason and hak5 org
and if you have any other questions
about this or any other segments you see
on the show check out our show notes at
hack 5 org
hi I'm Paul Tobias normally I'm sitting
behind the cameras running the show but
today I decided to come up front and
show you how to do SSH tunneling on a
Mac we've been seeing Darin doing a lot
of SSH tunneling with his Linux machines
when he's usually out and like the
coffee shop or where there's open Wi-Fi
and he wants to encrypt his traffic just
to be more secure and since max like any
other computer have the same problem
whenever you connect up to an open Wi-Fi
if anybody's sniffing or they want a man
in the middle they can actually get
access to anything you're pumping
through an open connection to server so
what you have to do is it's pretty easy
going on the Mac that you can go
download from Apple's website it is
called
SSH tunnel pretty straightforward it
gives you a nice little download link
here it's done by some French guy his
websites all in French so I can't read
but per dent a career Daedalus to
tunnels
SSH I don't know but so you go ahead and
download that and then it'll give you a
dmg you open that up and copy the file
over on to your Applications folder go
ahead and launch it it's a pretty
straightforward interface and it seems
pretty stable so it's not going to like
crash instantly on you or anything silly
as far as I can tell so we want to setup
the server that we need to connect to
we'll go ahead and press servers here I
can't select anything here because we
need to press this plus button and
you'll give you a no-name server with no
info in it let's change it so it looks a
little more familiar I'll type a double
type in there and then that's the name
and now we're going to set up the server
address and all that kind of stuff so
our IP address for the service six six
six one one one two two seven one two
for the port we're gonna use port 22 for
any SSH stuff of course
we're using the root account because
we're awesome and we're going to pump in
the password alright once you get that
information in there you just go ahead
and click apply I'll give you this
little are you sure you always say yes
because I've never been unsure about
doing anything on my computer so it's
always nice having a question just slow
you down alright so it will
automatically select the first available
one since we only have one it's kind of
in there you want to make sure that
we're providing service for the airport
since we are on the wireless here and
there's this redirect traffic through
pour the default for this program is
seven seven seven seven you can leave it
at that or you can change it something
else we're not running any UT servers
here so we're fine with that and we
should be good to go to click on here
alright and so session is started so
we'll go back to Firefox kind of bring
this up and we're going to go check out
the Preferences because under the
Advanced tab here is where we get the
configure your connection we'll click
settings they're minimal to a manual
proxy settings I'll looks like I left a
local host in there that's that 777 port
that we use before so all our traffic is
now going to go to our local host on
that port which is forward that to that
sober now and we'll go ahead and say ok
and we can go and close that and easy
way to check that we're on the server
now is to go to IP Qin and we'll do a
quick refresh just to make sure yep
definitely 6 6 6 1 1 1 2 2 7 so we're
out on the server now and we should be
able to browse the Internet securely out
in the open
Wi-Fi field just like Darrin's been
showing us on the other segments but if
you have any questions about this
segment or more shonas just go check out
hack 5 or the best way to provide
technical support is to do it online
we'd go to assist Express you can help

com /h ak5 for a free trial I've been
getting a lot of great feedback about
the whole SSH aspect of this encrypting
and tunneling series that I'm doing here
and you know as I've shown you there's
like a ton of ways to do this right now
we're focusing on SSH and I'm very
thankful that Paul has come on camera to
show us how to do it on a Mac and I
wanted to actually highlight an easy way
to do it on all platforms and this is
actually based on a script that was
actually sent in by one of our viewers
Yann Martinez from the Netherlands
really cool dude emailed me most of its
in Netherlandish but he also translated
it to english and I've been taking a
look at it here it's written in a you
know actually one of my favorite
languages PHP as well as a Python
version we're going to be taking a look
at the Python version of this script
here that basically makes it really
super simple to do what we've done so
far with creating socks5 proxies and
this will work on mac on windows on
linux whatever because all you need is
Python with the caveat that you would
need plink on Windows and that is we've
talked about putty before as an SSH
client or plink is basically the same
thing but a command line based version
that you can use in the console and
Windows so here we are in ubuntu new
910 and I'm taking a look at yonce site
here so this is the project private
tunnel and you can actually just go
ahead and grab it from his pastebin you
know come down here this is the Python
version for Linux and you know select
all that and you know pop it into your
editor of choice save that and I'll go
ahead and show you the program here in
the terminal and what we want to do is
Python that tunnel dot py script and it
makes it really simple like I said to go
through here and just walk through the
steps of configuring this is much like
the Apple you know software that Paul
was showing off it's just in the console
but you can choose hey okay Auto isn't
configured let's configure the auto one
so we go into two and we're like we're
going to call this our you know our test
server sure and we'll give it the
details for the test server and we just
hit enter for the default port and we
are going to say let's make it local
port 8080 because you know what it's
Linux maybe oh we are actually running
an Unreal Tournament 99 server I'm gonna
play some UT anyway so now we've gone
ahead and configured Auto and what that
means is we can actually run this again
and take a look at the the log we can
see all of our configuration here and we
can quit or we can run this again and I
believe the argument is right down here
yes we just run it with Auto so if I
were to come over here and run Auto
it would go ahead and create that
connection for me or I can go back in
here and set up advanced things like you
know a port forward I can specify you
know what the server is and you know
what host I want to so if I wanted to
make it like you know wherever I wanted
to end up going or you know you get the
idea and I can make it oh no I want to
do 6 6 6 9 and we can go ahead and just
walk through this awesome program I just
thought it would be really cool to
highlight some of your contributions to
the show he said that this program that
he wrote was inspired by the segments
that we've been doing so I thought I'd
show you guys here because I think it's
really cool that for anybody that wants
to put this all together you can go in
there and see the log and all the
details and you know just have fun with
that that Python
PHP cross-platform I love it now a
little later on in this series
in fact either next to the one after
we're going to be talking about SSH
tunnels and men in the middle attacks
and so we can be breaking what we've
talked about then we're going to be
fixing what we've talked about we'll
just go back and forth for a while much
like we've done with you know
point-to-point tunneling protocol and
you know cracking mschap hashes and you
know SSL sniffing and fun stuff like
that so if you have questions about this
go ahead and email me Darren at hak5 org
check out the show notes at - org and to
find yon Martines awesome program here
it is
John mancom it's at the lower third
you'll find it at our website so anyway
the rest of that just find the show
notes at hack five org
that just about wraps up this episode of
hack 5 but first wanted to let you guys
know that we have an awesome sale going
on at the egg shop yes yes everything's
on sale and everything's in stock
everything everything and we got a new
shirt it's the the switchblade yeah the
USP sweatshirt it's green yeah evil
start been asking about that for a while
yeah I know right since you wore at that
one time the prototype yeah like all
never know when I'm rocking a prototype
huh yeah yay we also have a new show on
revision3 called landline TV and we have
a sneak peek of it so let's check that
out real quick
- your Cheetos yeah I feel you writing
about them on the Internet all we're
doing is protecting people from posts
that no one wants to read you get an
eyeful
hi Barack Obama it sure is the Senate
since mr. Madoff was arrested we've been
bringing him around the country so
people can come by hit him in the
genitals whoo I just remembered
something terrible from my past but I
can't tell you what we all have secrets
don't but smoke indoors
guys hit each other so much like right
now Jerry you had an enormous mallet
make sure to check that out on revision
three.com slash landline TV on
Wednesdays
you mind if I bug them real quick no
okay I'm excited because I just got on
the Droid and you have to say it that
way and I have downloaded like you know
50 some applications I'm just wondering
kind alright and I'm just wondering
because I know that our audience is
probably big into the cool you know the
Google phone with the open source and
it's gone oh shit dude now is that but
not send me your app require your your
suggestions that hit me up on Twitter
speaking of which twitter.com slash hack
5 facebook.com slash Tecna lists and
feedback hack on over that's the other
one
yes ooh and IRC the hack by org was in
there the other night on my android
phone chatted up it was fun oh I need to
get that on my iPhone no oh my gosh I
see is a lot of fun especially for me to
get any work done
oh yeah to be a success I love it when
like I seem at middle of the day in IRC
and I'm like yeah you're giving off at
work - no I've got I've got like three
different monitors that are set up and
it's just like you know much like you
have in the editing Bay it's I've got
hardcore apps here I've got you know
something else here and just screw off
okay so you've got it virtual machines
ESPN 360 and IRC I understand it it
makes sense now it's good ever since he
is in 360 has been available on Cox it
has a special little place really I
didn't realize awesome it and speaking
of which um we're just gonna remind you
guys to trust your tech analyst
all right that one when I go so can you
hear Shannon it's up normally I'm
sitting behind the camera beauty salon
ring-ring ring-ring banana phone what
are we do
hi all the bias normally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
