average run-of-the-mill hacker
conference you know just little thing we
do on weekends to keep ourselves amuse
know we're coming up in really good time
because we're right smack dab in the
middle of our tenth year of doing this
we were at one point time the largest
independent hacker conference out there
we've been putting together something
that's been really unique for a long
time now and it's to the point now that
there are a lot of other cons that are
out there smaller cons but again we've
been at this for ten years where you
have three separate products that we're
putting together not only the San Diego
version we've got the Seattle version
we're also going to do America's first
hacking camp to our camp coming up in
spring of next year so we've got a lot
of really good things going on okay so
how did torque on come to be originally
a friend of mine and and I found out
about 2,600 magazine and so we decided
that we should start a 2600 meeting in
San Diego because we didn't have one so
we threw that together after a few years
we finally went to her first hacker
conference Def Con and we thought it was
cool you know we're like oh we started
our meeting we could start our own
conference and so we were about 16 year
olds of the 16 year old at the time and
we just threw together a conference in
we only had maybe about 45 people that
showed up at the first one but we had
contests you know like hack hacking into
machines we had some really good
speakers and then the next year when we
had some more time to develop it we you
know put a lot more into it got a lot
more people and it's just been growing
from there so who all is involved in
putting this thing together it's pretty
much myself George and also Tim and Phil
that's the four of us are the main
people that kind of do all the
pre-planning and then there's also you
know about a dozen to 20 people that
usually have just you know helping out
with the staffing and running the
registration booth and selling things
and ok then what sets to work on apart
from other hacker cons this guy right
here and I'd say that half joking but
that were really serious about that one
of the things that I think that people
deliberately said that make us very
unique it's the fact that we tend to be
a lot more academic
than a lot of the other cons and
particularly certain much larger cons
that are just mayhem and people running
around in chaos although we know how to
have fun here we've really been called
the fact that it's much more learning
oriented it's much more about the
information and a lot of that has to do
with this guy right here picking out the
talks and selecting the people they're
going to be presenting we get a lot of
compliments on our speakers and a lot of
compliments on the talks and that's one
of the things that really makes it stand
out from everyone else and add to that
um yeah pretty much a good percentage of
the people that come here to the
conference regularly speaking other
conferences and so usually the talks are
aimed more towards technical people and
we kind of foster that you know people
when people give talks they don't have
to dumb things down and you know as much
as maybe other conferences and so we
just kind of built that reputation where
where we we constantly invite new
speakers to come out and they invite
their friends and so just we try to keep
it a bit more technical than other
groups so what should people expect when
they come to work on for the first time
a lot of fun and a lot of information
sometimes actually I've heard the
complaint once or twice that we can be a
little information heavy there's so many
good talks there's not enough time to
see them all and putting one really good
talk up against another but definitely
we do have we do have the whole weekend
event if you're more of a corporate
oriented individual we do have the
workshops and the seminars seminars are
more geared towards the the corporate
client those are day-long two-hour-long
with sessions with instructors it's more
of a classroom style it's a lot more
intensive of a of a lecture of an event
and then we have the workshops where
it's your hands on get your hands dirty
building things or messing around two
things and so those are definitely
something to look forward to so what is
the future hold for torque on many many
more of them and more of them hopefully
we have the Seattle conference which is
something that we've just started up I
went through beta two years ago
is the beta two years ago in the first
official run this year that's different
than what we're doing here it's not your
traditional con but we've got the San
Diego and then I mentioned the tour camp
before we're going to be doing and then
hopefully and many other things on top
of that is the years roll by all right
tour camp it sounds like a geek lock in
maybe you can elaborate well it's
definitely something that I think a lot
of the American hacking scene is not
necessarily familiar with the Europeans
much more so but this is going to be the
first American hacking camp and we
basically get a bunch of hackers not
necessarily out in the deep woods
because we still have to have power and
internet but we get them outside into
kind of a different environment youyou
come in-you camp for the duration will
be providing things like food and other
necessary items but it's a chance to
kind of get out of the cities get out of
the hotels get out of the convention
centers and do your thing in an entirely
different environment I mean who hasn't
thought about late night sharing code
around a campfire will give you the
chance to actually do that sharing both
marshmallows and code and the other
great thing is this year our location
for for the conference is actually going
to be at a Titan one missile silo up in
Washington and really excited about it
it's a friend of ours actually owns this
missile silo and he's turning into a
data center so we'll have tons of
bandwidth people actually get to camp
out inside and outside of the missile
silo and there's just a lot of really
cool things we can do with the space and
we're hoping that people will come in
you know take charge of different things
start building things and you know just
putting the other workshops where they
can work with other people and and build
really cool projects and brainstorm
about you know new things that they can
work on so all right well thanks so much
for having us down here and given us a
opportunity to talk to you guys no not a
problem thanks for having us
