month's hack and basically what I'm
going to do is I'm going to fix all your
guitar problems that you may have we all
do if you have rock band you've got
guitar problems it's that simple
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you the only permanent way that I
know to fix your rock band guitar
I've already cracked it open here
basically you just take out all the
screws that you can possibly see lift
off the backplate and here we have the
inside of the rock band guitar now for
those of you that don't know and has
never actually seen inside of this
basically there's two parts that are the
problem there they are the pickups for
the up-and-down strum on the guitar when
you're actually playing it now the
reason that you have double hits you
have missed hits or you have actually no
pickups whatsoever is because the person
that designed this came up with the most
insane design for can you get a shot of
this they're the most insane design for
a pickup system ever okay now in the
Guitar Hero 3 and all the other guitar
hero series of guitars they actually use
a switch it's not like the ones that
we're going to use today
however it's close enough and this is
there's you've heard of the rubber band
tricks you've heard of the put scotch
tape on it
it eventually always fails okay so we're
going to do today is we're going to show
you how to fix your guitar with rock
band once and for all over here we've
got our list of tools we've got your
screwdrivers of different sizes on
either ends you're big and you're small
and there are certain screws that are
going to require the smaller one but for
the most part you can probably get away
with the larger screwdriver we've got
our solder our soldering iron in this
case a portable cold heat unit pair
pliers snips and an exacto knife okay if
you are scared too
strip the leads right here on the
pickup's you can use a nice little thing
but I don't need that so what we're
going to do is first I'm going to show
you where things should go should look
when you open up your guitar
now basically I've already got this side
done here and you can see kind of what
we're going to do the main issue that we
have with the way that this is right now
is when you hit this whatever reason I
cannot get it on there when you hit this
it's twisting this entire assembly and
that's not what we want so what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
remove the screw that's associated with
this part right here you're going to
take it off just like this and you're
going to be left with this what we're
going to do is we're just going to snip
this end right off okay there it goes
now before I actually get into cutting
the shielding off the wire I'm going to
show you what we actually bought for
four dollars okay this is a sub mini
lever switch that you can buy at your
local RadioShack store it cost about
three dollars and fifty cents okay
this switch is going to be the answer to
all of our problems buy two of them one
for the up and one for the down okay
once you get that essentially we're
pretty much good what we're going to do
now is we're going to actually take off
the strum bar there's four screws in the
corner of the strum bar and we're just
going to take that off right now because
we actually need to trim some of the
plastic now I didn't give you a warning
at the beginning of this segment because
I figured you probably would have
already understood this will void your
warranty you will not be able to return
this to EA but if you want a permanent
fix because there are complaints on the
rock band forums that even return
guitars that EA has shipped other people
are fail
yet again so this is going to be the
answer to all your problems basically
you can see here the difference in the
sides these two sides used to look
identical okay now this is the side that
how it comes from ei this is the side
that we've modified basically made it
almost entirely flat as possible as we
could and that's going to allow for
clearance of the new switch to go in
place okay so what I'm going to do right
now is I'm actually just going to take
these snips and I'm going to cut all of
this away alright well we're back
finally we were done cleaning up the
pickup the strum bar for the rock band
controller and in here you can see
exactly where we did the cleanup we
basically flattened it out as much as we
possibly could so it looks similar to
the other side that we've already proof
of concept it okay and basically the
entire reason that we're doing this is
to make room for the new switch that is
going to actually detect when you are
actually strumming the guitar so now
what we need to do is we need to do one
other modification to the guitar and
that's going to be on the holder for the
screw where the old item old pickup bar
used to be and basically what we're
going to do is we're going to eyeball
about 1/8 of an inch maybe a little less
we're just going to take our snips and
we're going to come in here as flat as
we possibly can and we're just going to
snip a little bit off try and clean it
up as best as you can all right
the new switch that we're actually
adding is a lot I shouldn't say a lot it
adds some height to the overall profile
of the unit so we need to to trim that
down a little bit here you can see the
one that we've already done and
basically this is the switch here okay
the screw that's in there does not come
with the screw with a switch it's a
simple wood screw that you can buy at
any Home Depot Lowe's or wherever your
local hardware store is and it simply
protrudes out a little bit just enough
so that we can actually anchor it into
the holding point for the screw on the
previous unit what we're going to do now
is we're actually going to put in the
strum bar once again and it only goes in
one way we're going to take our four
screws that came out of it we're going
to put these back in here
and there we go alright okay our lever
switch is a little wide so we're going
to take the component here and once
again we're going to trim it without
breaking the entire unit off as best as
we can
sorry for the bad camera work I do
apologize you're going to want to take
once again about an eighth of an inch
off of this entire unit here okay
you may sound like a lot I probably
should be taking this off right about
now but we can sweat through it
and just make it about as flat as you
possibly can
I think that's good so we're going to do
now is we're actually going to screw the
assembly down the last thing that you
need to do is once you've got it in and
you've got both pickups hitting just
where you want them we actually need to
solder the old connections on to the new
switch what we've got here is we've got
a continuity tester basically you can
find it on any of your standard
multimeters we're going to go ahead and
set it to when the circuit is closed
it's actually going to emit an audible
tone that lets me know that hey the
switch is working now I already know
that when depressed
these two should sound off when we let
go
nothing remember that this is a 3-way
switch even though it's not being
pressed the outer connection points
close the circuit we want the inner two
so use a tester to make sure that you're
actually soldering the right ones from
there
we're actually just going to take a
knife because that's the way I like to
do things and we're going to strip kids
please do not try this at home as far as
using a knife
okay now that we've got the bare metal
exposed it's as simple as soldering on
the connection points to our new
switch
okay make sure you guys leave yourself
enough thicken your your solder is
actually going to connect with the
switch here alright turn your soldering
iron on inside our way we're going to do
just make sure they're tight and they
are tuck them back in where they
supposed to go just like that actually
we'll type this one underneath now
remember this is the only time you will
have to do this mod right here we've got
a 100% will never break again rock band
guitar mod put the shell back on close
it up and you guys are good to go
item numbers my own thoughts and
comments and pictures of these different
steps will all be in the show notes for
you guys so if you have any questions
feel free to post on the forums visit
the show notes or I'm usually in the IRC
chat and you guys can ask me any
questions if you actually want to fix
your own rock band guitar
