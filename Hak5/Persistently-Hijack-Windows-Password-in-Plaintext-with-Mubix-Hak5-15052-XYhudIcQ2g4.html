by goto assist you guys know we love
passwords here at hack 5 the other week
that we talked about the USB rubber
ducky and kind of exfiltrating those
windows passwords quick and easy using
mimic cats and it was awesome to be able
to kind of incorporate some of the work
from Moo bik's over at room 362 and
guess who we have right here right now
pick wild one yeah that's right Oh Meg's
room 362 how are you man oh it's so
great to get you in here over the
GoToMeeting I am stoked because you've
been just like all over the place
recently right yeah it's been really
crazy
qc4 is always not serene yeah so I
noticed you posted up on carnal ownage
awesome blog peace on some nefarious
things that you liked it why are you
making college kids cry what what did
what exactly possesses you no thanks so
national CCDC or the national
competition that you did a piece on two
years back one of the things that we
have an issue with on the red team is
kind of staying persistent right so if
they give us out or they push a backup
or whatever and we're not in there we
have a hard time to stain into those
boxes and getting the password so they
changed too right so one of the ways
that I want to do that with what it's a
functionality that I've found called
password filters and so what does
password filters is this is this kind of
similar to what we did with you know
your your sysinternals kind of version
of the of the alsace dumping memory are
you are using Microsoft tools here or
this some other nefarious means yeah
actually it's just built in Microsoft
functionality right so Microsoft has in
the photo right now if you roll out a
new active directory tree or forcing
structure you have the ability to make
complexity requirements right but those
complexity requirements are really
simple complexity requirements you have
one character and one number and it has
to be 8 characters long or
however long right so you can't really
put much into that complexity other than
what is built into that requirement so
Microsoft since in 2000 days I'm not
exactly sure when but they put the
abilities for an enterprise to increase
that functionality by making these
custom passer filters right or remember
this says assisted men being able to say
like hey your password needs to be at
least 10 characters needs to have at
least two numbers at least 2 capital
letters things of that nature right and
so there's a tool for Active Directory
to audit these how does how does that
work so what happens is when you push
this DLL and this register changed to a
Windows machine anytime a password is
set or changed it checks it against this
DOL and it does this using well well it
has to the clear text version of the
password right so it can't cash it and
then say there's more than two care or
more than two numbers in there right so
when I heard about this I was like huh
it gets DLL that it created custom gets
the clear text password of these things
so how do you tap into this is the DLL
here this is actually Microsoft's MSDN
site showing password filter how do you
go ahead and tap into that and actually
get that clear text password out of it
all right so over on my Kali Linux I
have the C++ for the DLL and basically
this is all stolen from MSDN so I just
took their example code and tweaked it a
little bit so the example codes logs
everything to a file and it logs that
stuff whatever a username and password
to file every time a password changed
and I was like okay that's great
functionality but what if I'm not on the
box so what I did was I added a bit of
functionality where it makes a HTTP
request to my boss so I see this right
here you're doing you're doing internet
open and then you
be passing a header as Mozilla 4.0 and
then you're telling it the address that
you want to go to in this case one 92168
92169 and the new password it's being
tried to send that as authentication so
it's so instead of like sending in just
a random post request I'm making it
trying authenticate to me using those
new password so I just accept that and
so what happens is whenever the user now
changes their password in Windows not
only does it write it too and in your
case you had it F open C colon backslash
Windows backslash temp backslash but
ever the password log file is but you
also make an HTTP request to a server
that you're controlling and so what now
you just sit there with like do you even
set up a server do you just listen with
netcat so I set up a server because it's
it's a thinking with basic
authentication so I don't want to have
to deal with all the the base64 encoding
of that afterwards I just want
everything to come in and minutes what's
actually great with that because it has
a server that captures basic
authentication and just throws it into a
database so I just set up that server
and let it raise it and so every time
they change the bad so we're just like
it just pops up a notification to you
hey Rob new password hey Rob ok let's
exactly can you show us this is
fantastic let's see so look like just a
clarification this this only works for
local passwords on a Windows box however
if you put this on domain controller it
works for all of the domain so if you
put it on domain controller then every
single user that changes their password
across the whole domain make that domain
controller then makes requests out to
you oh my god and so as a social
engineering thing if you can bop that
domain control I mean if you've already
popped the domain
you're pretty much already good but I
can imagine a scenario where you start
making some phone calls and they're like
yeah this is the system and we've had a
breach we need you to change your
password immediately and then they all
do Bob's your uncle so if you're on a
domain controller you get a bunch of
patches right you don't hit clear text
passwords and if those those passwords
are somewhat complex you're not going to
get anything there on the engagement or
you're attacking someone for six months
you can pop it all the way to domain
dump this and just back off and then
allottee if you come in seven months
later with all the passwords being sent
to you every time if the password policy
is to change every 60 days or 90 days or
whatever you start getting yeah forget
making college kids cry at the National
Collegiate cyber defense competition
this is about maintaining persistence
and in such a nefarious way I love that
you're just using Microsoft source code
here - okay cool well let's walk through
it so first of all we have our our
session so obviously you have to you
have to have system level or
administrative access to do this and
love in the way so if I gave you a B you
can already see that I'm system right so
how this functions and it doesn't say on
this page but I said in the blog post
is that you you set a registry key and
I'm just going to copy these notes
that's that way it's easier for me
so as you can see here I'm creating the
HTM system currentcontrolset control LS
a key with the notification packages
that it's kind of cut off but the
notification packages value right there
and right now it says SEC CLI and ours
IRAs sfm so this is actually so it
doesn't show it tight but this is a
multi strain variable and then display
doesn't have a way for you to set multi
string variables so what I had to do too
is create a VM then added those specific
ones to the registry key export it and
and store that so I can show you that by
all right there and it stores it in text
so that it can do that that multi-line
file so I just exported that and now I
can upload and run it so I've already
compiled my gol oh and how do you go
about doing that I hadn't even thought
about that so you know unlike you know
the fun Linux world war you know GCC or
whatnot you're actually gonna need what
Visual Studio or something yeah business
video and visual studios free I mean
it's not too bad to file you you
literally slam the piece of code that I
put up there on the blog post or from
MSD end of making your own into a single
processing of project as a DLL and it
just works
I guess not that hard fantastic so I'm
already in system 32 as the present
working directory so I'm just going to
upload
our our game will pass or you passed
file that filter DLL right in there and
that's there then I'm going to also
upload our import me registry key so
that I can run and then I'm going to
execute that registry key so I'm just
going to copy my notes real quick so
this is running regedit with the slash s
that means it's going to import silently
without any pop-up to the to the user
and then and that's it
attack done some all you have to do is
wait for the reboot to happen so okay so
it doesn't require only bit it does so
domain controllers don't reroute that
often but luckily there's you know
that's Tuesday which normally requires
or even to you this week a month and now
you have the reboot happen and that
works and if this is a client machine
just execute reboot and they're like oh
wait that's right it's Windows of course
it's rebooting right for security all
right so your machines coming back here
now so I'm just gonna exit out let's
show it's gone anyways because if he
booted while that's rebooting then women
choose to use the module auxilary server
capture mississippi basic to show
options on there set the URI path to
slash make sure it's on the port 80 and
run now it's you know it's set to
capture any basic authentication that
comes over 40 login real quick
that's my administrator so I
I don't have any more shelves if you go
sessions over there I'm completely off
that machine at this point
I go into manage so I can change the
password
it comes up
users gonna change Joe's password see
this is a really long bastard and there
you go and there it is sit the password
set it happened really fast and even
over the internet it's gonna happen
really fast if anyone that were
connectivity between you and them and
that I mean there was very little vibe
between the happening so I'm not going
to notice anything happening and then if
I go into my seat oh and windows temp
directory yep yep I can locate that log
file oh it should have finished writing
I didn't for some reason so it buffers
the right and you know it'll get there
eventually
okay that is just complete kid so I just
wait there and so the next person who
comes along and changes the password I
think maybe did that oh man I love this
too because not only like the Kolob be
like hey have you changed the password
you know every six months you have to
change a password like that's so
fantastic
what a cool awesome trick I'm sure you
made lots of college kids cry at NCC DC
how do you prevent this attack don't let
them get to the administrator mode
because one I mean really okay just
don't get don't let them get there and
then you can actually set a group policy
setting to set registry keys and what
you can do is make sure that that since
there really isn't any other reason for
those to change you can set a registry
key because it's it's very possible you
know your complexity requirement DLL and
to others that really need to be in
there and if one isn't there on a system
that you're targeting oh that's that is
part of that group it's just not going
to work right the password change is
going to go off with just fine it's just
going to bypass it so you've never not
going to see any any downfall of that so
setting the registry setting for the
specifically tricky in your group policy
so it's always the same in force when
the system reboots it's going to reset
that registry key and my deal is not
gonna do anything that that's wicked
okay cool that's so good to know people
can find out more about this particular
hack right over at carnal own edge right
do we still have that up no we'll get
that up but yeah man that's great stuff
what else is happening in the world of
muak sign oh that we've got awesome
things happening in September we've got
Derby con coming up you've got new stuff
with deep magic what's new with that so
deep magic has been sort of offline
because my my Google appliance that I
thought off eBay is welded shut and
really there's no like the USB hard
drives are just not fast enough so I
have no way to add sorts of things so
what I did after a lot of coaching for
some friends of mine was full of
GoFundMe page for 60 minutes or 69 five
dollars which is exactly the amount of
money I needed for shipping a Synology
with a bunch of drives tuning so that I
could throw it the nast onto this thing
and get it running again which went
crazy because people have actually
funded me pass that down and if you're
willing to the go fund me is open until
October 30th or so so if you're willing
to throw some more dollars I'll just
keep on that and storage the thing the
cool thing about go funny is you
basically is like Kickstarter where you
have different levels and I've put
different levels on there for how much
people have funded over so you can get
advanced access or a complete copy if
you give a 500 dollar level Ayana can
get a complete copy of deep magic for
yourself so no curtain needed you get
the whole thing that's fantastic how big
are we talking now I mean it this thing
has just been growing and scanning the
internet for ages now right yeah since
2009 so I have a ton of data and it's
well over 500 gigs I've actually it's
been running but not live because I
can't grow
as fast since 2009 so I have close to
three terabytes now so tell me this for
those that are not familiar with deep
magic how you what's the back of the
book there so it's a basically a project
to store and catalog certainly tests on
stones for meeting an archive all of the
DNS across the internet so it does
reverse DNS or the entire ipv6 stove are
ipv4 still it does a cool little trick
for know a noindex where it tries to get
all of the DNS for a 19-6 work internet
so all of that it actually works really
well so you can actually scan jen86
world it does brute-forcing of different
TMS I used to do some some transferring
stuff I've read all that because of what
happens in recent year recent legal
battles for hackers and stuff so I don't
do it oh I mean if they allow zone
transfers how could that be an issue
intent I don't even want to broach that
comment sure no I understand I
understand but that yeah this can call
so now I just do some basic work for
Singh some some forward lookup so I take
all the reverse names before look it up
them and all of the looks with top of
million and also signed up to get
registry dated so I have all of the coms
and all of the dot nets in there and
it's been brute forcing those as well so
I have a ton of data and so anyone who
funds may gets early access to that
depending on the level and the 500 level
gets weak that's wicked dude oh my gosh
okay so where can people find deep magic
be sweet and then of course for all of
the stuff that you've been writing about
room 362 I can't wait to see a Derby con
I hear that is going to be a blast this
year there's there's cake involved is
the cake Ally ya know the cakes not Ohio
so there's only the third year and we
actually so we it's me
it's a black badge event this year so
the cool thing about the cake is that
it's starting up as a joke forever so
267 and people loved it more like I
gotta do it again next year and then are
you gonna make it more interesting next
year and then so now it's a bounce a
full-on scavenger hunt with for as close
to dying being different scavenger hunt
items and it's also a tech challenge so
if you're not as techie as some people
or if you're not as outgoing as others
it's it has something for everyone and
you get a black badge if you win so you
can continue to go to every con for the
rest of your life with that one that's
fantastic well thank you so much movies
it's awesome to see you I can't wait to
see you in person in Louisville and so
as always guys you can find all of the
show notes at hack 5 but really what you
want to do is go over to room 362 see
how I just did that Oh we'll be back in
just a bit

especially those moments when you they
really aren't convenient I mean
unexpected server problems Network
complications viruses not to mention the
user problems and you guys know exactly
what I'm talking about staying on top of
all totally challenging sometimes a bit
stressful I know that's why I'm super
excited that go to assist by Citrix is

hak5 let's go to a sitcom promo code
hak5 this week's tech molest photo of
the week comes from qu Malo
Kamala thank you so much for sending in
your picture and it was awesome to meet
you the other week up at twit he sends
this picture of his tech no less set up
everything from a skit Cisco 2600 to an
old server the one with the blue lights
a gateway i-5 under the piano a ps3 a
piano with MIDI interface and teddy bear
robots for protection which are
currently undergoing repairs and he also
says to invest in a desk yeah that's a
good note thank you so much caballo
again for sending that in and if you
want to send in your pictures you can
send those over to feedback at hak5 org
with the subject line Technol s just
about wraps up this week's episode of
hack 5 but before we get going we've got
fun you know hack across America
announcements we've got some cool stuff
happening within the community and we
have duckies we have duckies that's what
I'm talking about man
I like tacky I mean I got on a ducky
kick for the last three weeks I could
totally just like get on that stuff for
forever because it totally tickles my
Technol us going back to like you know
system men roots like windows crazy
commands you know powershell and das and
all that
I love automation it turns out you know
home automation computer of it anything
that makes life easy yes as long as it
doesn't break Automation so we wouldn't
have to so you want to be a Cylon oh no
I don't want that well anyway now I
wanted to bring some attention to let's
see we did this
ducky slurp script you know an exfil
training data to USB was really fun
using you know USB rubber ducky and a
thumb drive to be able to like hopefully
backup people's computers quick and
easily and so I thought this would be a
great opportunity to talk about some
cool obfuscation methods that were
brought up in the forums in response to
these and so the first one here is from
byte Wolff who shows that hey you know
what you could actually create this
ducky VBS file of a visual basic script
that would use the technique this is the
same kind of technique that we used to
basically hide the command prompt right
so using the script it would actually do
all the copying for you silently okay
that's not that was really cool and then
I also want to give props over to
accelerator who points out and I can't
believe this never occurred to me dude
start the screensaver so every window
system has the the ribbon screensaver so
get this all I'll do a quick copy Khan
obfuscation dot bat so I mean this
really is obfuscation at its truest form
we're not doing anything other than
hiding in plain sight so I'm gonna paste
this okay so that will start screensaver
and then I can do I don't know something
crazy like di r /s C colon backslash and
I'll do a pause after that okay
control Z files copy let's run
obfuscation so your duck you plug it in
and it would do this if I move the mouse
meanwhile in the background it's doing
all that which I just I love that cuts
awesome I love it
just cool stuff you know a couple that
with some of the other uh various
rerouting the output to know yeah anyway
we have a brilliant community we do and
you know what I hate to admit it but
sometimes getting bending DOS to your
will or boss is almost more rewarding
than bash or TCL really because it makes
less sense and so when it does do a cool
thing you're like the bar is so oh man
what's well I was exciting
yes yes we also have new toys don't we
we do yes we have tons of new toys so we
have these guys in the store these are
called the Motorola Atrix lap docks oh
you just talked about one of those and
we've got we have a couple of cables
well those lasts cuz you know it's
always fun when you can do sexy cable
time and then got totally ran one of
these into somebody's house yeah awesome
and then from the video signal I'm like
watching from the the remote with the HD
video blah blah blah and so like it was
a Labor Day weekend this thing you know
crash lands on - somebody's deck and
then I'm like not sure which house it is
I'm like looking out like uh and then I
see feet come over and they're like a
hand and look like boom and then I lost
a video signal
I don't even know what so if you live in
Richmond and you ended up with a flame
in your deck anyway now I know what
happened to it yes oh that stinks man
hmm well there's another one I know
right oh we should also mention what's
going on with us as well you can find
everything that we do over at hack $5
org slash follow that's where you know
my twitter is on there and I think your
Google+ all of the social networks that
you know if you'd like to know where we
are when we're doing like meetups and
stuff the van is still like it's in the
shop because it's a new vehicle and
turns out its chairman engineering which
means it's awesome but it's computers so
sophisticated and awesome that it needs
yeah flashing and laughter and a
mechanic try to explain to me what
flashing firmware means if it was like
and so I'm just like playing stupid I'm
like wait what the hardware run software
he's like right it's German engineering
I'm like you know I had to flash the
firmware on my Ford recently really yeah
I had to upgrade the firmware on my Ford
in the problem was because it left you
stranded didn't it they don't let you do
it wirelessly they don't let you do it
remotely or anything like should do
there they're like yeah you can go and
take it to the shop where you can do it
from home you plug in a USB into your
computer but you have to make sure that
it's this size and you have to make sure
that you're logged on on Internet
explorer because it doesn't work on
Chrome for me yeah it's playable and
then you sit there and sometimes it
works but I put the firmware into my
computer on my car and I froze oh my
gosh you crashed your car you crashed
your car I'm sorry too good oh man so I
had to run it twice oh like man really I
did like redownload the firmware and
reformat the USB it was such a pain in
the butt thing worse now well here's the
firmware flashing great Bluetooth works
yes you need to do that with a trench
coat
with all of that Mike I remind you that
you can feed back a hak5 dog let us know
what you think shop.com is art oh yeah
we're back shop that's how you can
support us directly and you know don't
forget as always as we remind you every
week that's Shannon Morse
I am Shannon Morse that's Darren thank
you and the kitchen we're reminding you
to trust your technology okay
Oh what's cooking making pancakes makin
bacon pancakes bacon pancakes with a
minute pancakes make the baby sticking
in the pancakes bacon that's how guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
