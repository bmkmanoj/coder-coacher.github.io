Hostgator welcome to hat tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus an IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm
getting into some terminal 101 now I've
been learning the Linux terminal and I
wanted to share what I figured out along
the way with you guys I got some really
good feedback about my previous hack tip
where I focused on some terminal
commands that get you started in Linux
so I decided to branch out a little bit
and check out some more so here are a
couple of really simple ones that'll get
you started you can type in date or cow
for calendar and these will just bring
up the current time in the current
calendar mines
big deal DF this one shows you a command
that will show you the free disk space
and free will show you the current free
memory amount so free there you go my
free memory mail ok yeah that's all cool
and good and everything but what if you
want to do more than just view things
well we've already learned how to show
the current directory with PWD print
working directory and how to change
directories with CD for change directory
but here are a few more shortcuts if
you're in your home user directory like
I am on mine you can type CD back slash
home or CD dot dot and they'll take you
to the parent directory X / hmm and it
takes me into home I can just type CD to
get back into the normal place and CD
space dot that and that'll also take me
into home also while you're in the home
user directory if you want to move to a
new folder inside the snubs folder for
myself
you can type in CD backslash home
backslash news backslash documents but
that takes a whole lot of typing so you
could also type in CD backslash
documents and that will take you into
the same fluff fuller or directory and
another kind of interesting part about
this is the dot slash it's generally
implied so if you're in that that snub
ster
three you can type in CD let me go back
to the director CD documents and it'll
automatically take you into the
Documents folder yeah
pretty cool huh another cool one that
you can do is a few other shortcuts that
have to do with changing the directory
CD space Tech will take you back into
your home snobs directory the previous
directory and CD tilde snubs will take
me back to my user directory and if I
type PWD
I'll see that I'm in home slash snubs
and after all of that you can also type
clear to clear out the terminal or exit
to close it out completely now I think
that's enough about changing directories
for now so onto a break and I'll be
right back looking for a place to launch
a blog or website frustrated with

discount all right we're back now let's
get to listing this LS command can be
used to list files or directories that
are found in any certain folder for
example if I type in LS documents it
lists all the folders or files and
directories that are found in My
Documents folder so you can see I only
have a couple of new folders in it I'm a
mess around with it much I can also type
in LS documents pictures which are two
different directories that are inside of
my folder and it'll show me all the
documents that are in both of those
folders at the same time I don't have to
do the LS command twice in a row it's
kind of cool
you can also add an option like LS tak L
documents and that will give you a
little bit more information about those
files or directories that are found
inside my documents directory and I can
also type in LS tak L T and this will
give it two options it will list in long
format by modification time the T's for
time there are a whole bunch of other
options that you can use with each
command and these are just a couple you
can always type LS tak tak help and that
will list out every single option that
you can add alright I think that's it
for today but I'll be back in my next
hack tip with some more useful tips for
the terminal because there are plenty
now what do you guys think make sure to
comment below or email me feedback at
hak5 org about how you guys learn the
terminal or if you're currently learning
it with me there are tons of handy
websites out there that go really into
detail about how to use it and be sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your Tecna
