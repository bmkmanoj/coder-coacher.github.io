you by domain.com hello walk back by my
name is jaron kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
she does that I'm broken we'll get it
we'll get a new one in the meantime we
are back from Def Con a little loopy a
little happy is the 19th season dude if
we've been home for a couple of weeks I
think took Emily we can't use that it as
an excuse in the hood right we're gonna
need a new excuse for why we're so loopy
we can't wait to see you this saturday
at the open house hjk house club to get
signed up so that you can come on out to
the hak5 warehouse and come on out get a
cage match bring your dogs and your
guinea pigs yeah bring it yes because we
have a cage quadcopter cage match
there's nothing to do with your guinea
pigs but yeah you see the acrylic cube
anyway it's not for book cube of death
anyway we have a couple of really
awesome interviews for you today from
both from Def Con from a couple of
speakers there the first one is from
Martha lojja and the second one is from
Terry gold yes and we're talking about
RFID hacking you're talking about some
android passwords who and how you can
figure them out by knowing somebody hmm
I know her password 000 anyway with that
said we're gonna just jump right over
its there and we'll see you on the other
side rfid access control systems you
probably have one at work it's a thing
where you hold the card up to the system
and it goes boot and the door unlocks
massacre are they to find out we've been
joined with Terry Gould founder of ID
analyst Terry thanks for joining us
thanks for having me so you just had a
workshop at Def Con 23 it's been a week
and a half are you are you saying are
you surviving I haven't been home since
so this is the first time back in the
office but it's good to be back rested
and reflecting back and getting feedback
so it's all good so tell me about the
workshop so you're talking about rfid
systems and we've seen a lot in the past
about like you know vulnerabilities in
our rfid cards but you're talking
maybe a different approach here yeah you
know um I've been in the secure identity
space for about 15 years and so I've
worked for manufacturers that have a lot
of the engineering patents so know how
but I've also been the guy in the middle
figuring out how enterprises make all
these proprietary systems work and not
necessarily a friend Dava all the
vendors because we've had such a
proprietary lock on all the systems so
I've had to really be in the boat of
deconstructing a lot of that to open it
up for enterprise so they can be more
flexible and use their systems and not
really be held you know hijacked by the
proprietary vendor so you learn a lot
having to go ahead and deconstruct a lot
of this that I I think you know when you
go to a lot of the conferences you'll
see something about a specific ID card
and some will go and clone that or show
you what the data looks inside of that
one but the reality is is that there's
hundreds of different types of binary
layouts and sequences to these things so
what we wanted to do myself my my co
workshop trainer Val Thomas is we work
together over the years in red team
situations and and help each other out
and we wanted to have a workshop
environment where people could get
hands-on on the tools understand the
different data take a red team
perspective and know what they were
looking at and help determine the steps
of of what type of methods it would need
to use what type of type of data they
were looking at because I think if you
take some things out of context from
some of the talks that you might see you
go to use that one method and then you
just be stumped because it doesn't apply
to an enterprise environment so that was
really the goal of the workshop to get
hands-on and and held the people
attending understanding what they look
at what might be the appropriate steps
to to really execute in that environment
so how does it work in that environment
in that enterprise deployment of an
rfid-based system specifically access
controls
what are the kind of implementations
that you see and and in that where may
the vulnerabilities lie yeah you know
it's it's kind of interesting so let me
take that in a couple of parts there are
many different types of RFID so we
talked about RFID it's radio frequency
identification so it comes down to what
frequency do you have what data is being
transmitted over that frequency is it
encrypted how is it encrypted and then
there are different ways of going about
it and so there are different
technologies even in play so we here
RFID the next question I always say is
well which RFID you're talking about
because some are very easy and some are
very difficult and they're all quite
different i would say about eighty
percent of the corporate enterprise
market is is about what you hear about
is prox 1 25 kilohertz it's there's no
protection so that's where you can get
into cloning and manipulating the data
very easily well because there's so many
different standards and frequencies that
RFID work under how was the penetration
tester or the security researcher to
analyze these systems yeah well I mean
the first thing is there aren't many
standards that's kind of the problem so
when you look at all what's out there
generally their specifications if you're
lucky but not many standards okay I see
what you're saying so while there are
standards as far as the frequencies are
concerned that's really your Phi layer
and it's the implementations of those
that differ no yeah yeah exactly so you
might have stuff like a new technology
that just came out and you can find the
specification but it's not a standard
its own is proprietary by a specific
vendor they may not publish all of it
and then how the different manufacturers
implement it can be entirely different
from one to the other so they're not
compatible at all you would make you
patent is it is it because of patents
and trade secrets and things of that
nature that the the underlying security
is pinned to no no it has nothing to do
with security it's all obscurity this
whole market for the past since it's
been going on it's been all about
obscurity and not security so what just
just to maintain a edge in the market
yeah it's been a lot about channel
exclusivity so that's how when you go in
have you ever seen have you gone to an
organization and you've seen that they
have you know five different access
cards that they're using in one
organization they have two different
access cards I know some organizations
that have some person has ten different
access cards because one will get into
one building the other won't get won't
get into the other well the thankfully
the sites that I've been on you know the
whole building was standardized on say
castle or something like that yeah so
you'll see that in larger organizations
that acquire other companies they have
different systems or they made regional
decisions and so you I mean one of my
clients had 55 different types of cards
across a thousand facilities nearly
impossible to manage and that's because
the way that the vendor lays out the
data the binary data inside the card is
different so it's like a little
scrambled riddle once you crack the
riddle you only organization it's not
really a security mechanism that was
really a mechanism so in this case is
the goal to clone a car door somehow
fabricate a card that's compatible that
lets gives you access to the system or
are you taking advantage of the way that
it's processing the cards by doing like
I don't know I'm imagining a card that
reads as quotation marks semicolon drop
tables or something no I mean the first
thing you have to understand is that all
the different ways to look at the data
is because the vendors had a loyalty to
their channels so they wanted to keep
the people that were selling the card
happy that they could only resell the
replacement widgets and nobody else
could so they give them a data layout
that was specific that only they could
sell and nobody else could sell to their
customer so that's where the obscurity
comes in that we think sometimes the way
too late the data is laid out is around
security but it's not the goal of break
being the card systems would be you put
them into different buckets one is where
it's clear text unencrypted and you have
that format riddle so you'd have X
number of bits in the card but you
really don't know where the
authentication code what what it's
really count for what ok so you have to
figure that out sometimes it takes me
five minutes sometimes it's pretty
instant sometimes I could I've worked on
it for a few days but once you figure
that out you can not only clone the card
sometimes you can clone the card without
figured that figuring that out but then
once you figure that out you can go
ahead and be almost anybody you want to
be inside the organization essentially
become my own issuance euro and I can
figure out it and start to use similar
methods like an IT where you're trying
to elevate privileges so try to go ahead
and figure out you know what what
numbers would have been valid if
somebody had been there for ten years
and had a lot of privileges I can start
to work that out and without having to
go back to a reference card or scan
anybody I could work that out and encode
it on my own mm-hmm and so in this case
you're saying is basically it's not as
as simple as ID number equals whatever
at the the header of the card but
there's layers of obfuscation and once
you've kind of figured out how that
riddle works you can then posed as the
janitor for instance yeah I and to give
you an idea we all refer to like you
know 26 bit you see like 26 bit in a
comment i think talk inside of a hacker
conference and they'll show you but the
reality is is that you have in any one
of those simple cards you have six
blocks of 32 bits each so it's way more
than 26 bits and you kind of have to
figure out what 26 bits really count
that's being authenticated against a
control system so what's actually
preventing just straight up cloning
nothing on on low frequency you can
straight-up clone but the problem is in
a red team straight up clone doesn't get
you much so if I go ahead and walk past
the person at the reception desk and
clone their card I might get access to
the door behind me it doesn't really get
me into the data center if it's a
large organization with multiple doors
multiple layers then you're going to
need a little bit more of you know
elevated privilege so being able to go
ahead and and figure out their their
their data formats being able to
manipulate themselves and elevate
privilege comes in pretty handy so when
we go ahead and do this work we may go
ahead make ourselves 50 valid cards that
are different people and then go ahead
and get different levels of privileges
all around the organization to get us
wherever we want to go so that would be
low frequency on high frequency you tend
to see additive encryption anywhere from
pretty easy to hack within a few minutes
that's symmetric key two things that I'm
not aware that have been hacked yet and
it can get pretty strong why is it that
there's encryption in the high frequency
but not the low frequency well the low
frequencies like 30 years old so it was
built without security even in the
design you have to remember that the the
low frequency corporate access cards
contact list and magnetic stripe or not
we're not their purpose was not to
improve security it was the whole point
was to replace keyed locks because when
somebody left with a key or got fired
didn't return the key you had to send
somebody out on site to replace that
lock which was pretty expensive and then
doing it on scale where you had multiple
locations and many employees was just it
wasn't scalable so now you know 30 years
ago when they started we're 25 years ago
when these contactless cards started
coming out the whole value proposition
was you can just go ahead and retire
that for dollar card and hand out new
card you not to replace the lock or
touch the lock so it wasn't trying to
solve a security problem okay so there
was no security built in okay and so for
the high-frequency cards that do have
encryption are we talking about
something where there's an actual key
exchange or there's actually a
negotiation or a handshake of some sort
or is it really only one way some of the
older technologies are one way some of
the newer ones are mutual but one of the
biggest problems in physical security
which is ID cards for corporate axis is
generally
they're built with a upon symmetric keys
and when you think about it if we were
paralleling to IT if we were going to go
ahead and do key management we probably
wouldn't do symmetric key we probably
wouldn't let the manufacturer and
establish our symmetric key and be the
custodian of it and we would make sure
that our symmetric key is different than
everybody else's and we probably
wouldn't put that symmetric key on the
outside of every door and so what do you
have in physical security right now is
you have symmetric keys on all these
building access control readers
literally hanging on the outside of the
door saying hackney yeah and if it's a
vendor that's known to use certain
defaults it may be the same across
multiple organizations when anyone
you've heard about the recent attacks on
stuff like I class it's because of that
that we custodian model that it could be
exploited and how it was stored the fact
it was the same key across multiple
customers you know very poor key
management the the markets learn from
that and they're evolving but the the
capitalization cycle of this technology
and organization is different than i TI
t if you get a five-year TCO you know
you're looking pretty good these systems
stay in place for ten to fifteen years
so you generally can't really go make a
decision and then in seven years you're
okay if it's broken you probably have to
negotiate with your your management as
to how you're going to deal with that an
accelerated capitalization schedule so a
lot more diligence needs to go at it but
the systems are generally 10 to 15 years
behind what we find 90 as well as the
security principles so it's similar to
SCADA and PLC's where you find you know
physical meets based big expensive gear
they don't like to replace those too
often yeah it's you know you're digging
you have a lot of locations I mean I
have clients that have they do business
in 100 countries they have 10,000 15,000
of these card readers and different
access points they have you know hundred
thousand card holders and it's a pretty
big long project to touch everything
recycle everything reinstall everything
and it's hard to justify to man
you know what do you mean we're
replacing these cards and these these
readers on doors we need to be building
any another manufacturing facility in
China you know not spending money on
this so it gets pretty interesting so as
a security researcher what would you say
is the first step I should go about in
the journey to start auditing RFID yeah
I think the first thing is every IT
organization should know what they have
because that's what protecting their
data center and typically it's managed
by somebody else but they should care
and not just give it the you know the
the invisible approval stamp just
because it looks like a card and not a
key the first thing I would do is make
sure that your authentication password
is not printed on the card you would not
believe it but by default most of the
manufacturers print your authentication
password on the card itself so there is
like a backup you know it's it's done
because that's how people love to be
able to take the card off the stack and
enter it into the system for convenience
but you know I say hey an IT would never
order a laptop from dell and h the
password but vendor default onto the lid
of the dell know you'd put it on the
sticky note under the keyboard obviously
well actually the sticky note you could
get it you could take it away if you
wanted to but when you print it on the
card it makes it kind of difficult so a
lot of times I'll go get a hold of a
card I'll social engineer somebody just
to show it to me and I pretty much can
figure it out just with that bit of
information to not clone but just go
ahead and start minting other numbers it
gives me a lot of information just by
doing that and the larger the
organization the bigger because yours
more people at target so if I'm curious
said I just want to you know get started
playing around are there any like
particular tools or like Android apps or
things of that nature that I might want
to look into yeah the android apps
really don't help because they don't
they don't omit one 25 kilohertz
frequency so you're not really going to
do what eighty percent of the corporate
enterprises have so there's a tool
called prox markets it's pretty simple
it's pretty common you buy it online
that will help you go ahead and read
cards get the raw data and
start playing with it it's once you
start playing with it there's really no
magic tivat you just figure out that
what they call the format a little
riddle and your kind of well on your way
it's pretty cool there some there's some
tricks to doing that which we went
through in the course of how to do that
more effectively how to maybe maybe
automate it and then from there the
proxmark also does high frequency that
has the encryption codes so then you can
break symmetric keys and and start
tackling that stuff as well that sounds
pretty cool I mean if you're the kind of
geek that's into you know cracking
DEFCON badges this seems like something
right up your alley thank you so much
Terry really appreciate you coming on
and telling us a little bit on this
where can people find out more about
your work um you can go to my website I
have papers we also have the deck
available for people out attended the
training but if you didn't attend and
you still want the deck we're glad to go
ahead and give you access to it the
other thing just one more point is the
vulnerability is also in the access
control system so we brought a whole
server we actually brought a whole mini
portable building access environment and
you can break into the control system so
when you use the combination of social
engineering breaking the cards and also
the control system there's a whole new
element sometimes you don't even have to
break the card sometimes you just break
into the control system itself entering
a whole new card scheme into the system
push it out to the door that you want to
get into and then make yourself the card
that matches is also just thinking about
what you're talking about these cards
being like in place for 15 years I'm
just scared to think of all of the you
know windows XP boxes running these
esoteric vendor lock-in car systems it
is and have to have the implementations
and I see the empty the integrator set
the server's up the systems up with
default passwords so once you get in
there you can actually implement
controls like this one system you can
time the doors opening and closing so
you Leah you can just go to the next
card yes they're walking through doors
doors one through five to open close on
the schedule and then I'm going to go in
and delete the audit logs after i get
back and I'd even need a card i could
just tree
the whole thing so the systems are also
week even if you get the RFID stronger
there are new standards that use a
symmetric keys and multiple you know
dual algorithms that are getting better
but it doesn't mean a solves all your
problems I think the whole physical
security program again is 10 to 15 years
behind IT there's really no effective
governance audit I'm working with large
organizations to bring that in scope so
their whole environment is is really
much more secure invisible and I think
that's the biggest advice is don't treat
your physical security environment any
different than you would I tea from a
security principle standpoint and you're
going to find a lot of holes over here
but you'll be a little plug in with the
current methodology that you employ on
the IP side yeah so it sounds like
really this the vendors are kind of like
an analytical mind set yeah is there a
particular vendor that actually does
this well there is but since I'm an
analyst I'd probably rather not either
rather not pick one over the other I'd
say that the majority don't do it well
and and there are a handful trying to be
with trying to do it better and and it's
it's getting there I think it'll take a
few years cool well I thanks so much
Terry really appreciate you coming on
thanks for the time domain com and doc
club came to hak5 with a great idea
build a club all about learning stuff
making things and having fun and so we
did just that and man what a brilliant
idea we recently hosted our very first
ever open house at the hak5 warehouse
and with the help of domain.com and da
club we put on a mini LAN party micro
drone obstacle course 3d print fest
quadcopter race and killer barbecue and
I must say these guys get it the
internet and hacker culture in
particular it's all about fostering
community from BBS's to fight o net to
IRC it's all about coming together and
having fun and what better domain to do
it than a doc club it's perfect because
the doc club is universally and globally
understood not just here in the United
States so if you're building a new
business or naming your startup consider
a da club as the ultimate social domain
join us in the san francisco bay area
for workshops and projects and crazy
indoor quadcopter races at our very own
da club
house club then head over to domain.com
/ club to register your dock club today
they're only 999 a year and there are
thousands of Awesome options still
available make sure to use the coupon
code hak5 to save fifteen percent and
let the guys over at domain.com know we
sent you so when you think domain names
think domain.com one of my favorite
talks at Def Con was won by Martha who
is happily here with us today hi Martha
how are you hello fine thank you so
you're tark was tiled titled tell me who
you are and I will tell you your lock
pattern and I found that so interesting
and intriguing so I believe my first
question was to you was my android lock
pattern how would you know yeah and
first I started analyzing we're looking
at a lot of passwords and predictability
of tech space passwords like how my mom
and dad n oh and some select passwords
and I was starting to think what about
the android lock pattern it's just a
couple of dots and it would be
interesting to kind of way to predict
people's patterns so you found out that
you can actually predict people's
patterns because humans are actually
predictable yeah basically that was the
start so how many luck patterns are
available in the world for somebody use
to use on an android phone and by when
you use a three-by-three grid that's
nine dots it's about 389 112 possible
combinations wow that's a lot so how in
the world could you take hundreds of
thousands of different patterns that a
person could use and figure out their
predictability so and because of the
schema this out we had to find other
ways to analyze the patterns as we
started to look at the kind of the
physical aspects how you can create new
patterns how
he'll be mobile home if you're a left
and right-handed I'll go start to create
patterns for instance and those with fun
stuff like how does gender age how does
that impact the way we create patterns
that's crazy so all of those different
scientific facts can actually predict a
person's pattern just like it can
predict a person's password as well yeah
correctly wow that's so weird is it
different way and to look at the pattern
or passwords okay and then I've been
before for because a lot of researchers
have a look at that just the password
themselves not exactly who created the
passwords because that that's kind of
very interesting to see when you're
gonna predict someone's password so did
you actually get a group of people
together to test this theory on and no
not actually a create a custom made
survey that only was available for
mobile devices and I just broadcasted it
out and use my network to for people to
purchase a day so people actually use
the mobile phone and them and to create
the pattern so it's a standard web
application simulating the scheme and
created the patterns and then with the
survey you also ask them things about
their profiles such as if they're right
or left-handed is such a row cetera as
well yeah exactly and then linked it a
lot of information about the response
and we only collected data that were not
traceable back to the person of course
but we would collide it a lot of
information and I unfortunately didn't
get the chance to present all of the
results so hopefully my master thesis
will be available also is so this for
school as well yeah the research have
done that's my master
uses so this was a one year with fun
completing my master's yeah so knowing
how predictable a person can be if I
walked up to one of my friends and I
noticed that they are right-handed they
know a lot about security there a male
there you know 40 years old and they
have two kids you're telling me that I
would be able to predict what kind of
passcode they're going to use on on
their lock screen for their Android
device hmm yeah and at first they're
there is 389 89,000 combinations and I
only collected four thousand and and
that doesn't match so in the future to
be able to do that precisely is to kind
of give estimate a likelihood for
selecting the pattern right and so with
my data for now it's possible to
eliminate a lot of combinations so the
number of possible the possible
combinations will be very low but to be
able to say just tell me who you are you
have to simulate it in a way right now
if let's say that you could probably
sell this data it would be worth a lot
of money I believe that do you think
that given that people are so
predictable and given that if you know
all this profile data about a person you
can definitely dwindle down three
hundred thousand different passcodes is
there a way that a person can secure
themselves even more knowing that they
are a predictable person yeah of course
that is that is one way to use it and I
got a lot of requests a couple of days
now and which said suggestions for how
to use the data and that is one of this
suggests some support for to use to kind
of create application for people to
tester patterns to see if they're
predictable but the problem with that is
if I tell what is predict
bowline knot and then the pattern
themselves will be predictable right you
end up in this domino effect of the same
predictability happening again and again
it's like we actually need we need
computers to do it for us for real
algorithms real random algorithms so
where do you see this data going from
here and for now I've been in touch with
the German and researcher that I've done
a lot of the research on the Android
panel log and and he did kind of
something of the same that I did but he
did not use have the same background
information about the users so by
combining the research it might be
possible to be able to predict more
precisely than before so what he has
done is build a statistical model called
the Marco model that will give kind of
an estimate based on information how
likely a pattern is to be selected so by
adding my data with a kind of the left
fried handed and gender age that will be
interesting to use that to to get that
predictability or to get that model to
be better more getting more precisely so
this is more on a personal note do you
find the android lock pattern to be the
most secure option or would you prefer a
different kind of lock for mobile phones
it's very interesting question because a
lot of people asked about that a
personal I don't think that it's safe
because I don't think people know how to
use it correct like right people don't
know how to set up for instance you
don't need to show the arrows in your
pattern you can turn that off and you
can also randomize the grid so
when you get smudges on the screen you
can kind of you create the pattern in
different eras on the screen but it's
the same pattern and would you give any
kind of opinions to companies that are
using this kind of lock pattern would
you recommend any kind of other options
for them it is hard to because whatever
you you ask your employees to do a maybe
a pink coat or pass code or whatever I
think people will be predictable in any
way but the best I think the best
security tape on coming to passwords is
