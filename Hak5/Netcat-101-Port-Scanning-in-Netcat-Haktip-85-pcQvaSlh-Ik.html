you by go to Asus welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and
today I'm checking out netcat for port
scanning but first off let's back it up
just a little bit I got a question at
tips at hack 5 org that said what
defines a banner so I wanted to go ahead
and clarify that a little bit last week
we discussed banner grabbing with netcat
which will give you a bit of information
about any server or port when talking
about networking this will basically
glean info about a system on a network
and services running on its open ports
admins can use this to take inventory of
networks and services on their network
alternatively an intruder on the other
hand can use banner grabbing to find
Network hosts that are running systems
with known exploits some service ports
used for banner grabbing clues include
those used by HTTP FTP and SMTP and
those are ports 80 21 and 25
respectively now to prevent exploits
network admins should restrict access to
servers and shut down unused or
unnecessary services running on Network
hosts a banner specifically is simply
the text that is embedded with a message
that is received from that host during a
banner grab so that's what we showed you
last week this week we are going to
check out port scanning and it kind of
builds on top of banner grabbing as well
so first off what is a port ports our
application specific or process specific
software constructs serving as
communication endpoints in a host
operating system the port is associated
with an IP address of the host and the
type of protocol used for communication
you can uniquely identify different
applications or processes running on a
single computer or server with the port
which will enable them to share a single
physical connection to a packet switch
network like the Internet's the report
numbers between 0 and 65535 with 0
reserved and typically anything under
port 1025 requires route or admin
privileges now I wanted to go ahead and
take a look at this website which lists
all the TCP
and UDP port numbers so let's say I want
to play some doom doom is unofficially
on port 666 go figure
but usually if you're running Apache on
port 80 or something like that you have
to have sudo to go ahead and set it up
so you'll find out that many folks will
actually use port 8080 or something like
that to set up a server which is
basically a quick and dirty way to get
around that rule about reserved ports
now the protocols that use ports are
called transport layer protocols
including TCP and UDP such as the
website both of the internet protocol
suite some widely used port numbers
include 20 and 21 for FTP 22 for SSH and
80 for HTTP and 25 for SMTP now let's go
ahead and take a quick break and do some
port scans right after NIT issues can
pop up at any moment
unexpected user problems Network and
server complications viruses and staying
on top of it all is really challenging
and it's kind of stressful too that's
why I'm excited about go to assist by
citrix all the services that you need
are integrated into one simple
cloud-based toolset
so you can take control of your
unpredictable IT world so this is how it
works go to assist monitoring helps you
quickly identify potential issues at
their source before they become big
problems it has built-in customizable
dashboards that display the performance
of all networks servers and desktops
it's proactive - it alerts you and
ensures that you are the first to know
about any issues before they can become
real problems and with go to assist
remote support you can provide live or
unattended support to any PC Mac or
mobile device from pretty much anywhere
and you can easily keep track of it all
from the go to assist service desk I
highly recommend go to assist with all
the traveling that I do I go to
conventions I'm visiting my family I try
to take vacations when I can I can't
always be in my office
so using go to assist lets me work from
home and connect on the go so I don't
have to deal with long commutes going
through San Francisco traffic because
that's no fun so you can sign up for
your special 30 day free trial today

Pierre and map do you actually think of
net cut well it's not as advanced as
some programs for port scanning net
can't can perform basic capabilities and
can even obfuscate the source of a port
scan today we'll go over a basic port
scan and explain the command now as
opposed to file transfers doing a port
scan requires only one computer which is
going to be your client so you can use
this seen syntax that I'll type in to my
computer to actually do a port scan with
netcat so we'll type in NC tak v-tach w1
and then the port IP address 10 dot 73
dot 31.9 this is a Wi-Fi pineapple
running in our office tak Z and then one
through 1,000 those are the ports I want
to scan and press Enter
takes a few seconds because port
scanning is a rather slow and once it's
done you can see which ports are open on
this Wi-Fi pineapple we have a pop3 and
an IMAP port open nine nine five and
nine nine three now let me go ahead and
run through the syntax real quick and
see actually opens netcat tak V is
verbose and in this case it indicates
the open ports that the scan uncovers
tak w1 tells netcat to wait one second
between scans to find out if they are
actually open or closed and then the IP
address is the target that you want to
scan in this case it's our Wi-Fi
pineapple taxi tells netcat to operate
in 0io mode that 0 input output mode in
this case speeds up the process of
executing the port scan by ignoring any
latency baked in by the program to
account for delays in the CPU and then
the last part one through 1,000 tells
netcat to scan the range of ports from 1
through 1,000 now I noticed that only
two things it stated are actually open
on this I'm going to try it again and
I'm going to change a couple of things
so instead of doing 1 through 1,000 I'm
going to choose 2
scan ports 19 through 25 and I'm going
to give it two seconds to scan those
instead of just one press ENTER again
and you'll wait a few seconds okay so
this time we see and adding a couple of
seconds helped me in this case I see
that I have SMTP and SSH open on 25 and
22 respectively now this is only going
to target TCP ports not UDP ports but if
you want to include UDP as well you can
you can add tack you switch to the
actual syntax you can also include tack
end which will bypass the name
resolution it reduces your footprint
print in the logs
now netcat uses dns to look up the IP
address of a host but you can also use
host names as well it's kind of
interesting now I want to see you guys
try it yourself try adding different
options to your port scan attempt scans
on several IP addresses to see what you
come up with we actually found a few
surprises when we were doing some
example scans earlier in our office it's
pretty fun now do you use netcat for
port scanning send me a comment below or
email us tips at hack 5 org and be sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your techno
list and Happy Holidays
it's a Kris ugly Christmas fest look you
can see through my Christmas tree
happy holidays of this beautiful girl
you can see the head look at the
Christmas tree today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
