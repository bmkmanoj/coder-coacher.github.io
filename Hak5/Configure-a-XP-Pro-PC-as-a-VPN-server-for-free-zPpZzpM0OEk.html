attack that we did last month right the
archives boys anything right we were at
the coffee shop and we're on the Wi-Fi
sniffing that guy's packets and we could
see all of it since message
communications in clear text written
passwords to right now I was thinking
there's some plugins for like game to
encrypt your stuff or Trillian yeah but
the problem with those is first of all
trillion is cracked and second of all
with game you have to have this this
both clients have to have the same
plugin installed right and that doesn't
encrypt all of your other traffic so I
figure just specific why don't we let
everybody now what we use here to
encrypt our traffic and stay secure
while we're on unencrypted wireless
communication okay well we use a VPN
this is a Virtual Private Network and
that's basically a tunnel between you
and the server that's encrypted
encapsulated if you were to sniff it you
obtaining the garbage just a bunch of
garbage now
we use Server 2003 here right but you
don't have to use Windows Server 2003
you can also do an XP right yeah that's
one of the most overlooked features of
Windows XP is there's actually a VPN
server built-in it's not as robust as
the Server 2003 but the only main
limitation is that you can only have one
concurrent user well for a home network
that's not too bad no it's not bad at
all I use it at work to come into the
home network and be able to get access
to my mp3s
stream music if I don't have my iPod on
me cool well sure it's really easy just
open up network connections and we
create a new connection and we're going
to create an advanced connection and
accept incoming connections then we're
gonna skip that and go to allow virtual
private connections we'll select a user
and then we'll click properties on
tcp/ip and this is where we specify the
IP range that we're going to assign to
the users that log into the system but
if you see XP that's not really
important because you only have one well
it's just important to have a range so
now there's only one IP address that's
going to be used because it's one
concurrent connection necked finish and
the only last step is to make sure that
your port forwarding in this case it's
1723 because it's point-to-point
tunneling protocol so just make sure you
port forward that to the router right to
the server and then we've got our
incoming connection all right well what
do we have to do on the client end now
the client end can be Mac Linux Windows
XP Windows 2000 there was even a
download for Windows 98 and blow really
yeah so what I've linked so that in the
show notes
and to do that in annex pages create new
connection again and we're going to do
this we're going to choose a network at
my workplace VPN and then give it a name
I'm gonna call it home and tell it not
to dial an initial connection because
we're not on tile up I'm gonna give it
the public IP address public IP address
or your dined DNS if I have service like
that and then after that you just
entering your credentials so I'm going
to give it my username password and save
that and connect and there we go
one network and if we go over to details
you can see that we've been assigned the
IP address at 192 168 to 108 ok and that
the server is on 2100 so all I have to
do is go to back since back slash the
server's IP address there you go there
we go sell the shared files right so now
I can access all of my stuff that I have
shared on my computer or you can also do
some pretty cool things as well like for
example you can access all of your
shared iTunes music and yeah and if
you've got an airport Express and you
can log into your network and blast here
oh yeah remain with music on the stereo
that's a lot of fun when West's home and
not expecting it yeah so this is a great
thing to do and we highly recommend it
for anybody who's planning on using
unsecured wireless networks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
