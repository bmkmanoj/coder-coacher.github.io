cameras were hacked days before the
inauguration and a new FCC boss could
mean bad news for net neutrality coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for Tuesday January 31st 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat wire
the video RSS is now live the link to
our RSS feed as well as the iTunes feed
are below in the show notes otherwise
you can also search for threat wire in
your favorite podcasting app to find the
show yeah it's so exciting thank you so
much again patrons you made this
possible going onto our first story for
those of you out there that still have a
Facebook account I still have a Facebook
account unfortunately I need one so that
I can manage your hack 5 page you can
now add a u2f device to your login
settings so what does this mean well you
to f stands for universal second factor
and it is a two-factor authentication
standard made by the Fido alliance
makers of authentication protocols for
companies lots of companies already
employ u2f as an option for logins
including Google Dropbox github LastPass
etc and now Facebook you to F requires a
physical key to be plugged into the
device whether that is your smartphone
your laptop or your desktop while you
are logging into your account in the
browser and it works in Chrome as well
as Firefox your browser authenticates
the device as the one that's tied to
your account and it lets you login you
to F devices are really cheap too there
are 10 to 18 dollars USD and they
require very little setup to work they
also are less likely to be stolen than a
smart phone because no thief is going to
be looking for a little device as
opposed to a smart phone so you to F
device might be a better option than
using your cell phone and an
Authenticator app like authy or Google
Authenticator to give you one time two
FA codes to login now while they are
convenient it's also pretty easy to lose
one of these little keys so Facebook
requires a backup to FA code such as a
text message or an S
cater app currently the feature doesn't
support the mobile app but two FA codes
can still be stolen via a smart phishing
attack so a u2 F key is not only
sophisticated but it is also more secure
if you want to get this setup on
Facebook go over to your Facebook
settings then click security then login
approvals and then click on security
keys and add your new u2 F key On
January 12th Washington DC's police
noticed four of their CCTV cameras
weren't working right and they notified
the DC office of the technology officer
or Oct Oh for short to begin an
investigation into the problem the
source was ransomware found on their
CCTV system that was also affecting the
DB RS in total about 70% of the
surveillance cameras in the DC area were
offline and inaccessible this accounts
for 123 of the 187 cameras currently in
use the attack appears to be localized
to that specific system so no other
servers on the DC police systems were
infected while this was ransomware no
money was transferred to solve the
attack in Oct Oh resolved it by taking
the cameras offline uninstalling the
software and then restarting the systems
in total the CCTVs were down from the
12th through the 15th which was days
before the inauguration and it happened
because the system was connected to a
publicly facing internet connection so
the cameras would be remotely accessible
now whether or not they were encrypted
is still up for debate also before the
YouTube comments roll in yes they are
calling it a CCTV system even though it
was publicly accessible I know just last
week President Trump chose Republican
Ajit pi/4 leader of the Federal
Communications Commission pi has been an
FCC Commissioner since 2012 and is an
avid critic of much of the FCC's
policies but why do we care about this
well it turns out he's also anti net
neutrality net neutrality is the idea
that the Internet should be open and
treated equally across systems ISPs
wouldn't be able to charge more for
faster access to a website for example
net neutrality one in a three-to-two
vote in the FCC in early 2015
meaning that the broadband internet
service would have to be reclassified as
a telecommunication service
that would entail stricter drools that
preserve the Internet's equality but as
the FCC leader PI may have the ability
to disable net neutrality PI and his GOP
affiliates now hold the majority of the
FCC and as such could overturn the
earlier ruling on that neutrality pi has
previously voted against similar
initiatives in the FCC made to protect
consumer rights and while his term at
the FCC allows him to serve through 2017
he can also be renown nated for a new
term and confirmed by the Senate those
past votes include pi opposing increased
competitions in Sept op box markets
opposing high speed internet rollout to
low-income markets
opposing the FCC trying to fix high
prison phone costs and of course net
neutrality now while no rulings have
begun under PI's watchful eye having to
do with net neutrality yet given his
close ties with cable companies his
previous employment as a lawyer for
Verizon and his recent speech where pi
stated quote we need to fire up the weed
whacker and remove those rules that are
holding back investment innovation and
job creation which so far has not been
proven as actual fact we can't expect to
see some major changes happening this
year at the FCC thank you again for
