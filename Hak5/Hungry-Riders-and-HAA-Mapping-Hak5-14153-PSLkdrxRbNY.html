overland expo 2013 this segment of hak5
is brought to you by po do so we sought
for lunch in columbia and the fingers
columbia there's usually like it's a
three-course meal it's usually like two
or three bucks soup salad entree drink
yeah and the soup was interesting and
they love their soup and Colombia they
put like everything in it tons of meat
and all kinds of stuff but this one it
happened to have piece of fat with some
skin on it with like the first still
attached and it was definitely like the
piece I got a cow or like a really
bristly pig or something like that I
couldn't tell yeah but that's when we
stopped were like oh we gotta film this
yeah and so I reach in my pocket where's
my phone yeah we don't have yeah but and
then I like look throw the rest of my
jacket which is only place i was 13
pocket so Jesus just wasn't in any of
them so we had to ride back the rest of
it yeah so it was a half a day return
trip but this is in Colombia they had my
cell phone at the hotel that we stayed
at no problem waiting at the counter no
big deal cost us a day but at least did
you see like people have iphones
everywhere altar yes yes that was like I
was still probably the status symbol
type of phone and most people would
still probably get them and like they
went to the US and like came back right
because most of the countries these like
huge taxes like this iphone would be
like a thousand or like 1,500 bucks to
buy it new down for the new one yeah so
it wasn't for s and he can still give
that you can study could have sold it
for like six hundred bucks yeah well we
met a revision 3 fan guy in Nicaragua
and he would fly up to the bay area just
to buy like gadget like electronics not
go to frys is the plane ticket to
California to go to frys and return is
cheaper than actually buying anything
locally
yeah so it's it and that's not a big
surprise i guess first two things are
cheap in the US like unless you're
talking about hotels or food everything
else yeah parts guess paper any kind if
you're gonna go buy a toaster camps or
some samples ya like like products are
cheap with services like you said motel
room yeah expensive no hotels are cheap
hotels and food are cheap yeah
everything else is expensive like an
actual product a good buy right you're
saying oh and owes us any you wet the
u.s. yes the exact opposite yeah yeah
more or less yeah but yeah the cheap
consumer goods is like very true for I
guess us we didn't realize quite how
good you have it here as far as I could
what else you gonna keep the economy
doing I guess keep buying stuff yeah I
make it affordable but I guess being lit
up like because of that down there what
they do is they fix things that's so
because it's cheap because labor is
super jeans when um so the only thing
that broke on the whole chip was the
power brick for my laptop um it just
stopped working one day and so we took
it into a repair shop yes we looked
about us there's this is in Cuzco Peru
so there's an entire buildings up like
mindset to okay yeah it's just like oh
my power brick is dead let's buy a new
one yeah so so we went there this is
there's this place in Cuzco Peru it's an
entire building with like 50 different
electronics floors it's like a mall with
only computer shops yeah and like each
computer shop is fairly small yeah and
it's still of room to your man yeah and
but we walked into every single one of
them and said do you have this krista
first of all the computer it's like a
gaming laptop so i could it's like a
high high amperage edit the video so it
was too big didn't nobody had one big
enough that would support it yeah come
in two places had it like someplace one
place could order it like the next week
or something which was an option or two
hundred dollars for the brick where you
can get a new one for like 40 bucks here
yeah but what they also had down on the
ground floor was repair places so we
gave it to the guy he's like hey I can
fix it so we left it to him for worked
on it for like five or six hours yeah he
took it apart
figured out which component was broken
found a new component soldered it back
in glued it back together it works yeah
12 12 12 bucks twelve bucks like six
hours where when I first got into IP in
the 90s my dad asked me what he's like
so what he doing like oh I'm you know we
care of computers he's like well you
know what do you do and you're you know
what all the components were but yours
video thinking what what do you do when
that dies was like well your video card
guys you buy a new one and replace it
she's popping in the AGP slot yeah all
today yeah it's like oh I thought you
were learning to like you know fix them
fixed yeah this big sad like you looking
at like aircraft carriers and look at
the radios on these things and the
boards pull out and they have
ridiculously huge solder traces because
they're made to be 0 this capacitor blew
Oh go to the door of capacitors yeah
yeah but be a couple thousand miles down
the road dirt rough dirt roads and that
kind of stuff it broke again and then
we're in Chile Chile we walk into the
same kind of shot which is more like the
first world country yeah like say can
you fix this nope spoken like though
it's not worth the time they're right
cuz like it would be probably a couple
hundred dollars their time like if it
takes some five hours to fix it and
they're making you know twenty bucks an
hour there it's chi my worth anyone even
if instr bucks yeah yeah so so we waited
you know an extra that's why there was a
gap at some point like a month where we
didn't have any videos cuz my laptop
how many more videos do you have to
upload we're probably just over halfway
done no no I think we have I did it five
or six wherever you guys left off right
now print for the next episode will be
Machu Picchu going to mine how to ride
your motorcycle all the way to Machu
Picchu almost all the way we walk the
last little bit okay yeah but you don't
have to do no more boats no the thing
they get the way you normally get too
much Picchu is on a train and it's like
a couple hundred bucks per person for
the train locals thirty cents what yeah
that's how it works in some places
what's a week that we just rode our
bikes I was like 150 miles or so we
think yeah yeah beyond any train tracks
no well a little bit part actually yeah
because yeah because the road a little
early bridges trained no no that's why
we that's why we had to walk the last
seven kilometers soon as you can there's
you know there's a gap in the road like
that baby that's bigger than your way to
go through like a train depot to park
our bikes across the train to train
tracks / they tried to yell at us not to
do it but really what's the worse that
can happen to get deported I don't know
yeah we're gonna weigh out anyway yeah
that's fantastic okay so um for those
that haven't been following along where
can I go and find hungry reuters com or
youtube.com slash i agree writers yeah
bring an appetite and facebook into the
answer
welcome to another a hike across America
behind the scenes that I want to show
you today one of the awesome ways the
citrix has enabled me to work the way I
want to work shift to pretty much be on
the road this entire time of course I
told you guys that they've hooked me up
with their entire product line and its
really been helping me run hack 5 from
the hack shop and basically this whole
trip so get this i want to show you
before and after because here we go this
right here this map is pack across
america 2010 in fact it has a hundred
and ten eleven thousand views on this
thing it just scrolls and scrolls and
scrolls and actually this only paid one
you know there are four more pages of
this when originally did this what i
asked what i said hey you know if you
can put me up if if we can get together
and geek out like to sign up and what I
had was a google doc and that I embedded
a form on and people could use that
google doc to like tell me about
themselves and where they are you know
what's up and it worked great i had
between that and the google map where
people could put a push pin and it was
really cool except man let me tell you
it was difficult to manage okay so um a
spreadsheet it nice but a spreadsheets
like like I a nail right and when all
you have this area where everything
looks like a nail right but you don't
want to work that way or at least I
don't want to work that way so when I
started figuring out how I'm gonna do
hack across America this time around I
wanted to make sure that I have like a
proper database and here's the thing
yeah I could probably build a web app
with my sequel database or all of that
stuff I don't have time to do that and I
want something simple and then suddenly
the guys over at citrix hooked me up
with Podio and check this out this right
here is my internal Podio this is
actually we use this for all of hack
across America you see here these are
actually the people that have registered
and then built this app this is so cool
in fact if you go to hack across America
com what you're going to find on the
right hand side is a sign up form where
you can go ahead
here it is and you can register and you
know you give your name and you know
there's something most the fields are
optional right but if you at least tell
me your name and your zip code and what
you're interested in doing you know this
is how I can find out where the
opportunities are it's really cool
because basically what I do with that
now is since I've got it in this
database in co do that whole thing was
built-in podium and so here's here's the
registration after basically what you do
is to build an app it's like a web form
all you do is start dragging and
dropping these different field so you
see here I've got a a name field right
it's a single line I've got a you know
we can feel then it's like a these are
all the different like kind of
categories of stuff whether it's like
Torah hackerspace or go clinking or get
a beer or whatever you know same thing
with like if it's date specific there's
like a date application here where they
can you know choose that in fact there's
all of these are the ones that I haven't
even scratched the surface of and all
you have to do like if I wanted people
to be able to give me a link I just drag
this over here I put it wherever I want
and this I name it and I don't have to
think about like oh what's the column or
what's the you know but what's the key
in the database or any of that stuff
here's a really ridiculously awesome
back-end on here but I'm not to think
about that what I think about is I have
a specific need for my business case I
just kind of you know throw this
together drag and drop real easy and
then it's got all of these automation
processes where I can like have it
basically kick me an email or assign a
task in this it's basically having like
my own corporate intranet we started
using and not just for hack across
America I fell in love with it on a
cross American then immediately started
using it for the hack shops and now when
we get support requests on the hack shop
everything goes into that and this way
it's so great I can create project teams
so like Shannon and Sarah and I can just
focus on hack shop stuff for like Paul
and I can focus on like video stuff and
and it just makes it easier it's like
having a social network within our
company it's really cool it's actually
been using it to manage a lot so many
other things within the hack
America ecosystem and so I wanted to
show you this because the old style was
just to do a spreadsheet this is so much
more powerful because now I can come in
here and I create these filters where I
can say like right now this is like just
show me everything but I can you know
sort alphabetically based on City I can
you know sort by the the you know state
but moreover i can create all of these
filters right i can say what is the
status right or not status but we can
write i'm going to choose one have a
beer show me all the people that want to
have a beer and this is the coolest
thing i can create all these different
widgets and reports where i can actually
see out of everybody that's signed up
having a beer turns out it's the month
number one most common thing and now i
can filter by whatever state i'm in two
of em in oregon and i want to get a beer
i can see all of the people in organ
that want to get a beer or if i'm in
texas and i want to go fly RC airplanes
I can find out who's in Texas that want
supplier RC airplanes it's the coolest
thing it's so much more powerful than
just a spreadsheet because of those
search functions and those filters that
it can like save an export and so here's
the thing that I tied it in with some
other web apps that make it even more
powerful for me so one of the things
about hack across married the first time
was i love that we had this wiki map and
it was really working because you know
people were submitting this stuff but it
won in an automated way because really
the whole purpose of this trip isn't
that like I'm going on this loop you
know I'm gonna go to Chicago and then
Atlanta and who's the people and it's
not it's not like that it's actually the
inverse of that I was just in Eugene
Oregon I never would have thought to go
to Eugene Oregon here's how i ended up
there right so i'm in my app and then
you know i just get my little wrenchy
guy and i can say export to excel right
this is going to give me an excel i
could also you know from this wrench i
can go into the web form and that's
where you can find the embed code to put
on your own website which we've done on
hack shop com hack across America com
but when i export that that file now I
was able to bring that into I don't
actually use Excel i just use google
docs but now i have and i don't want to
show like everybody's address and stuff
but now i have
I sorted it based on zip code so so
here's zip codes starting you know with
nine all the way down right which is
actually really important because
actually it turns out if you look at a
map of the United States and zip codes
all of them you know it starts on the
east coast with you know the 1000 one I
think is Manhattan right and then all
the way like on the west coast here we
are outside San Francisco and it's 9 4
10 4 right so they get higher as you get
further west which is a great way for me
to go ahead and plot things on the map
there's a reason why I sort this way
okay so there's one other service that
I'm gonna tie into this now that I've
exported it taking it into the google
google spreadsheet stuff it's kind of an
intermediary step i want to find a way
to streamline this and part of the
reason is because i have to truncate it
to just 100 entries there's hundreds of
entries on hack across America calm
right now but I actually need to limit
it to 100 because here's the thing dude
have you played with this oh my god I'm
so in love with the new Google Maps
engine you have to check it out this is
Maps engine light it's totally free and
what it allows you to do is much like I
did before this is the old-style google
maps where I'm able to like put a push
pin or as you can see there's like we
used the icon for beds and stuff so I
know that there's a bed and Boise and
you know there's a place of salt lake
city where I can totally crash and I can
you know go over here to bend or
wherever right and I can you know see
what people submitted here but it's not
really at streamlined and organized as
I'd like and since I already have people
signing up through Podio this allows me
to take that same data and then check
this out I've got this untitled map here
i just created a new map and you choose
import you import a layer and then it
says just drag a CSV or an excel sheet
right so I choose my file I import that
and then what i end up with is it asks
you hey which of the columns here or am
i going to use for the placemark and i
say use the zip code that's why i
require the zip code don't need your
street address but as long as I have
your zip code
I can go ahead and continue and then
it's going to ask me like okay well you
know what are we going to name these
things based on I'll say the name or the
call sign of the handle of the hacker
that that wants to get together it hit
finish it any ports all of that data so
here's like a finished one where I just
did the west coast right and you can see
all of these little dots here all around
like long beach and san diego and san
francisco and stuff up here in seattle
and portland and eugene medford i should
have stopped in Medford here's the thing
these are how I'm connecting the dots so
basically it's not about like I'm going
to Seattle and who's in Seattle it's I
don't know where I'm going right I'm
going where the dots are and now I made
a little pull that data out I can do all
these cool filters so you know it's
really about just enabling me to work
the way one and this is the way I want
to work I want to work in such a way
that are not trying to juggle all of the
emails and tweets and messages on other
social networks up for all of the odds
opportunities to hang out if I can just
kind of tunnel it into one workflow
that's going to work for me that's gonna
make my business so much easier it's
done so as I show you on hack across
America I can't begin to tell you on on
hack shop where instead of like managing
all of these different tweets and emails
and everything for like the support
requests we get we're now using it for
life you know quotes and other you know
boring business stuff but it
streamlining business it's all about
like I t I did I t for 10 years it's all
about automation and so I was able to do
all of that without any code without
ever touching a sequel database and now
I don't have to think about I just get
on the road and I'm like dude I'm going
I'm going there there's dots let's go
let's hit the road right and this is
just the west coast so I'm really
excited about taking podio merging it
with the other workflows that I like to
use I feel like this might be a great
solution for you guys and of course i
want to thank Podio because those guys
