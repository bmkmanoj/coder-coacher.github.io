overland expo 2013 this segment of pack
5 is brought to you by domain.com well
welcome back about my name is darren
kitchen this is your weekly dose of
technology have a fantastic show for you
this week because here I am in Flagstaff
Arizona at the Overland x-phone we're
gonna be checking out the latest and
outdoor tech and really just those who
experience life in such a free and
visceral way that the just value true
freedom above all others and I really I
find something really beautiful about
that so I want to share it with you guys
so that's what's coming up on this
episode pack 5
so what is the primary difference with
the technology of our film versus some
of the other stuff that I see out there
okay well we use amorphous silicon as
our base technology and that differs
from the other stuff that you see out
there in terms of its form and function
the other solar technologies consist of
glass panels which is crystal and
technology it could be there mono or
polycrystalline largest thin film based
so it's very thin it's very flexible
very durable and what that gives you is
a portability factor that you may not
have with a glass panel we have great
advantages in terms of weight durability
durability that i mentioned flexibility
and footprint okay so you mentioned
footprint but for what i understand
about the differences in technology is
the amorphous well flexible doesn't have
the same kind of efficiency that you'd
expect from a poly hermano it's like
crystalline cell is that the case that
is true that is true an efficiency is a
measurement at a point in time under
perfect conditions and what we design
our technology our technology what we
designed to do is make solar panels that
are optimized for the real world
conditions so while our efficiency may
only be five to six percent which is
what amorphous is versus the fourteen to
twenty percent of glass panels the
advantage that we have in terms of low
light performance and shadow tolerance
actually allows us to make a panel that
produces more pain more power over the
course of a day than a panel that may be
more efficient than ours so how would
you compare like as far as you know
being able
under the same conditions soaked up you
know more power than a traditional cell
is it that you're using a bigger
footprint or you know more salads or
what it's because our charging window is
longer and what that means is that our
panel will start to produce power the
minute the Sun starts to hit it during
the course of a day and produce all day
long so even even till sunset and so
because I have such a large window
whereas our competing technologies are
only maybe taking a portion of that
charging window to to charge at maximum
efficiency allows us to make more power
during the day so see amorphous Ilse are
they depending on the angle to the Sun
or can you just lay this cloud on the
ground or how does that factor in well
all solar technologies are optimized
when they're angled to the Sun with
amorphous it's less critical which means
you can take it out and just lay it flat
on the ground and you're going to get
the type of performance that you expect
from it as some people who would say
that while it's flexible you've got the
problems with likes a solder joints in
some way that where if something snaps
suddenly
section of a panel how does the solar
the power film stuff account for that
well what we do is we got a proprietary
interconnect process which allows us to
make panels that have multiple different
points of contact within within the
panel and that allows us to survive and
I'm going to point to this over here to
survive point damage Wow and what would
anybody had fun with the 22 it has
actually 38 but close okay so yeah what
what that allows us to do is win a panel
is somehow compromised whether it be
point damage or crack or something along
those lines obviously we don't have the
cracking issue because we don't use
glass but this allows the the power to
flow around that area that's been
affected and still produce so even with
these holes in it this Pete this panel
lost less than ten percent of its
ability to generate power so a panel
this size what kind of power output
should I expect from heavy you know
two Emperor's bison this this panel is a
seven watt panel at 15 point 4 volts
because they're so from an amperage
standpoint you're looking at about a
half a watt and outlet I'm sorry
happening up an hour an hour mmm and so
what does it take to get you know a 200
watt panel well it requires us to just
put more solar into the construction of
the panel and what you're looking at is
in the back of our booth here deployed
there is a hundred and ninety watts of
power and what that provides is roughly
12 amps per hour and what's the
footprint of that it's 96 inches by one
hundred and fourteen inches and is that
the largest in your product line it it
is that in what we would call
man-portable we do actually make a power
shade that requires a vehicle
transportation and usually a lot of
muscle to get it on and off of a truck
and that's a shade that has supports and
everything and it is one kilowatt we
make them in one kilowatt sections and
you can tie up to three of those
together so in the field if you needed a
large amount of power in this case the
military just the the primary user of
that and they they will tie two of those
together most often and then they'll put
their communications tense or forward
operating bases underneath the power
shade and generate the power they need
for that time we talked about just like
we have here this is wanting your 10
year you're talking about just wrapping
those guys absolutely let's go so what
are some of the other products i'm
seeing here this is a small portable USB
charger hmm the battery integrated
battery integrated so just to to double
a battery to double-a batteries love
these antelope guys is a great great
battery and those those batteries
actually drive the USB port and one
you've used up the power from those
batteries this solar will recharge those
batteries in four hours or less four
hours drill yeah that's not bad there
you go and it folds up to anything I
like how much can you actually wrap that
up without before you're damaging the
panel's it won't it won't damage the
panel's at all really that's fantastic
the only thing that damages panels is a
crease oh I say and a crease causes
catastrophic microfracturing across the
panel so is that why for instance
there's all of these gaps here between
so that those are your full points yes
yeah and then we use litz wire to
connect all the panels together what
wire litz wire look look wire lids wires
a bunch of tiny wires grouped together
to allow for flexibility within that
wire cool and what this unit is right
here and this was a specialty unit that
we built for NASCAR teams so that they
could have access to electrical power in
the pits where there's some regulations
on AC unit usage so they're using solar
power DC usage to charge from this
they're putting a this has Intel
lithium-ion battery in it 18 amp hours
and then they access the power through
all these 12 volt ports on the more
commercial side what we've designed is
very similar to that this this utilizing
sealed lead acid batteries and an
inverter so it gives you a couple of
different options you can put up to 60
watts of solar in and that will charge
the internal battery which then runs
this inverter or you can access the
power through this swell volt DC
very cool well thank you so much I
really appreciate a chat you're welcome
I fought them Darren kitchenette over
land expo 2013 with Shayna and Sandra
young how are you guys yeah good look
beautiful tiny anime here so absolutely
love us ok so I need to know what what
is the story how long you been doing
this and what on earth enabled you to be
able to do this I've always had a love
affair with land rover and i own a land
rover repair shop in Fort Lauderdale
acts and it allowed me the luxury of
being able to flip this little bigger
together originally 1989 kind of trophy
truck I competed in the Amazon
introducing reason so we are hitting it
out with trying to stay as original as
possible yet still make it so that's
comfortable for us to live in and still
be able to go anywhere that we choose to
go so how long have you guys been going
anywhere you choose to get off well we
just started this round in the beginning
of december we had a fantastic time with
a bunch of other land rover enthusiasts
down in Mexico and then back here in the
southwest of us
this is just the beginning of our track
on up to Alaska across Canada and to all
points east south that's how long to
explain you know I expect to go for and
where is it where is that even an
equation in the term if you gotta have a
set itinerary will bicycle drive the
money runs out and worried about how to
drive any further than we plan on taking
two or three years
what we need to do and then one we go
from here a silver set up into Alaska
and then across Canada chip into Europe
Europe and as much of that as we can up
into Russia or maybe even Siberia didn't
hit down south into Africa down in South
Africa then we'll ship down to Australia
to the west coast and grab across
Australia and settle back for a short
while at least in the east side
australia in sydney daisy and until what
uh what have you done to prepare for
this kind of a trip and you know what
does it take to do such a thing
well my back to them
I was a little kid to be on the road
getting rid of everything that we owned
wasn't too difficult because we're not
all that material it was basically
trying to get this what you see behind
you to be our house the next three years
everything we need is basically on these
four wheels what has it been the biggest
difficulty in getting this to be your
home uh there's some weather concerns
where we basically like to travel real
backcountry where there aren't a lot of
people in a lot of luxuries and we're
doing it if it's 12 degrees or 112
degrees so we're basically trying to get
kitted for all scenarios stay warm her
eyes day well fed keep things cold we
need to so making that as mobile as
possible has been the challenge and he's
fantastic at fabricating his own things
and working things out so basically
everything you see behind you told me
and so you're talking about all of these
different countries all these places all
over the globe that you want to go to
and talking about year-round how would
you define what living the dream are
doing it is exactly what we're doing
just no itinerary we see somewhere that
we want to go we'll head off that way
we'll chat to somebody on the road and
now suggest somewhere else that is
really neat off the grid completely and
we'll head off there and just continue
on one day at a time basically and so
are you sharing this adventure with the
world anyway within it anyway we try to
maintain a website as best we can we are
usually enough off the grid but we don't
get Wi-Fi a lot but yes we have we have
lots of friends and family that are
traveling with us vicariously and is
there anything that you miss when you do
leave you know mainstream society no oh
no really died the more it takes a while
to get to the point where you don't miss
any of the stuff
we've become accustomed to once it's
it's very liberating to be able to just
leave quote unquote society and just get
out in the middle of nowhere alright
where can they follow the adventure
we're on young Rovers calm and we also
under young Rovers on facebook we post
there frequently quite easily all right
thank you so much guys really fun
pleasure thank you here's your good luck
with your attorney and you do
I want to take a quick moment to thank
the fine folks over at domain.com for
directions pudding nice across America
here and you guys are perfect tell you
guys it's what you want to do a new idea
off the ground you're going to need a
great domain and let me tell you remain
out colin has the hook up what you want
because Annette we do our navicomp it's
the perfect containing to it a lot of
times I thought y'all might want already
taken you may have to register something
ridiculous and characters you want to do
that dotnet it's a great alternative it
allows you to go ahead and you know get
your website up off the ground and the
dot net is the third most popular
top-level domain in the world it's just
breaking line comedy you use one of the
original
well later original six it wasn't
supposed to be and fun story about the
RFC is there but anyway you can get
yourself on that right now over domain a
couple with 89 but here's the thing not
only are they supporting act 5 across
America directly there supporting you
guys with an awesome hookup it's called
15% author already affordable domain
names no sings all you have to do is use
the coupon code hak5 so we've got a
great idea think domain.com last week's
trivia question was what is the maximum
length of an SSID and the answer is 32
characters number three number two now
this week's question is which wireless
mode connects machines directly to one
another without the use of an access
point you can answer that over to hack 5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome hak5 goodies
