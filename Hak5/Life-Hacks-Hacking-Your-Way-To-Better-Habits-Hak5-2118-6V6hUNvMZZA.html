achieving your new year's resolutions
this time on hack five hello welcome to
hack five my name is Darren kitchen and
I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us and
I am currently at CES in Las Vegas but
you look like you're right here I know
this is my hologram I was gonna ask if
I'm in VR like pinioning yeah isn't it
cool
no VR if we call the Grimm that's the
best you could come up with it this is
your VR version of the set why does it
still look so janky Shannon even had
time to code it correctly so yeah I'm at
CES this week with tech thing tek ping
which is my other podcast if you want to
drop by we are having a meet-up at
atomic liquors
which is a bar in Vegas obviously that's
on Friday January 6 and we have a bunch
of event details over at facebook.com
slash tech things so you can go over
there RSVP if you want to or not we're
not really like RSVP'ing to the bar
we're just gonna show up and take it
over like we did at Def Con I love doing
that that is so much fun and oh man get
pat you're going about anything anything
is anything anything yeah he's good for
a story or two all right so today we are
talking about habits and goals because
it is the end of 2016 the beginning of
2017 and we learned a few different
things that can help you hack your way
into a better life hack your way into
your habits and help you complete some
of those goals that may have just been
like sitting in your list forever and
you just haven't prioritized so I'm
gonna throw it over to Darren who has
the first several we have we ever done
this right back seriously never done
life hacks yeah hack your happiness
worries it's a it's the end of the year
folks for us at least I'm at CES yeah
it's doing a short show but I want to
show you guys some stuff as we kind of
uh sure in the new year that may help
you if you're looking to create some new
sustainable habits or some lifestyle
changes or we've got some big goals and
we
into 2016 with some really good
intentions and we discovered some tricks
along the way that really helped us
become better hackers if you will and I
kind of want to start it off by just
saying Shannon for instance if you
wanted to say okay this year I want to
become an expert in the Linux terminal
oh that's a cool dream that's good goal
but it's not as good as something more
sustainable like every day I want to
learn a new Linux command so you do that
now you've got a habit now you've got
something that can kind of like Usher in
whatever that dream that goal may be
because often the horizon it seems like
a big thing and it's like unachievable
but if you break it down into like oh
well every day I'm gonna just type man
LS yeah man learn something new try man
woman it's funny no and and the other
big thing that I found was when it comes
to creating those habits the Seinfeld
method was what worked really best for
me I never watched Seinfeld neither did
I so I actually don't get it whatsoever
okay what is the same film is it don't
break the chain right well I see
basically if you set out to like say
like you want to become a better writer
yeah well right every single day
whatever it is that you're trying to get
better at do that every single day and
then Chronicle it right so if you say
like okay cool I want to become better
at Linux I want to learn a new Linux
command every day yeah then every single
day you know on a giant you do a year
calendar and you put an X for the day
that you learned live a new Linux
command and so what happens is after a
week you've got like seven X's and
you're like yeah look at all my awesome
I know I can eat my cake yes and then
like oh you you like don't for one day
and then you're looking and then the
next day comes and you do it you're like
yeah I'm back on right and you do your
X's and you look at it for the month and
you're like I was awesome for that month
but then there's that glaring that one
day box where it no yeah yeah I actually
did that going into 2016 it's great for
developing like healthy sustainable
lifestyle changes for habit
and I found it incredibly effective I
actually did a paper calendar for the
beginning of the year in fact I check
that out this is printed on 13 by 9
Super Bee and I tracked five different
goals and basically you can see you know
some of them start off a little rocky
and they get better and I I found this
like incredibly useful especially
because I also put it in a place that
was publicly visible to all of my
co-workers and friends and family that
that can really help if you want that
observing ego if you will and they can
hold you socially socially accountable
that's I don't think that's actually
like the biggest thing to enforce like
if you do one social accountability
maybe like buddy up with somebody yeah
in particular that like you never do it
on your own but if somebody else is
telling you to wake up at 6:00 because
they're waking up at 6:00 you more you
feel more responsible right I wasn't
getting all of these done because I hung
this on the hallway where everyone could
see it passing by that was in the back
of my mind but you know it's not like
Patrick was like knocking on my door and
being like hey you didn't get an expert
journaling or whatever way for the
longest time I didn't even know what it
was it's it's coded and it worked until
you can see somewhere around June and
then what happened was I started
traveling and then I didn't have a good
solution so I actually I don't I don't
actually prefer that I like the paper
and I can get the bird's-eye view of the
year but what I found really helped me
was a particular Android app because
it's on my phone which is always on me
so I want to just go ahead and and
mention this one because this is kind of
Awesome this is uh that's my homescreen
hang on here we go so off to the right I
have these are just widgets and I mean
you can see like you can you know resize
them or whatever your window manager
allows an Android but basically all I
have to do is you know set up I'll give
you an example Journal right so this is
the app you can see I'm tracking all of
these different habits this is habit
tracker and so this is the actual app
but I actually don't use the app for the
most part I actually just use the home
screen where I embed the widget that
shows me the calendar and then I in
like a button element underneath right
so you can see that's another button
element where I just checked that box
and then I have it set to for instance
if I edit this I can see asks me a
question so the name of it is photo I
want to take a photo every day and I can
say did you take a photo right okay cool
and so now every day I will get this
pop-up like I have this right here that
says photo did you take a photo at all
and you just well actually I haven't so
let me just real quick all right
hopefully that was a good photo and now
I can check the box that I took my photo
so oh yeah I know right it's very
exciting yesterday was the first royal
flush or or whatever you wanna call it
cool house I got I got all the twelve
check but I started last year with six
check boxes this year I've got twelve
congratulating boxes that's exciting
stuff so what is this called so it's
called loop habit tracker you can find
it in the the Google Play Store y'all if
we take a look and it's also available
on github so if for instance you want to
contribute to this or you just want to
compile it from source yourself you can
go ahead and do that
there are many it's it's for Android
like there's so we always use Android
here so well I mean there's iOS
equivalents and you'll find lots of
different habit tracking apps that are
into the similar vein of the you know
Seinfeld style because it works I like
that method that's very cool it's great
for habits alright so what about goals
like really really big goals that you
might have so the biggest thing that I
found for 2016 was having those like
overarching goals not just the habits
that I'm trying to you know as a
sustainable lifestyle stuff but like
those big things that I want to achieve
I needed those in front of my face daily
oh yeah and I live daily out of Trello
which is a like it's like a task list
type thing that you can access and you
can add people onto boards so that they
can also add different tasks to the same
board so that it's it's great for
companies if if you have a company but
it's also good if you just want to use
it by yourself too
to make a list and call it a board and
then add different tasks to the list and
you can assign like a date that it's due
you can also assign like notifications
if you want a notification to pop up and
stuff like that so it's it's great for
those guys yeah in fact I'm gonna go
ahead and assign you to this one right
here and there you go and then I'm gonna
make a due date to that
oh yeah we're supposed to go to supposed
to go to Edwards Air Force Base for
something anyway so I live out of Trello
it's what we use for project management
with you know pineapple duck turtle
whatever development and I just use it
as my task list since I have it open in
one of my tabs all the time so just
having for instance you know my my 2016
goals just glaring me in the face all
the time and I would just have to look
at those and so that was my one thing is
just having them there so that's kind of
what I've come up with now Trello may
not be for you it is proprietary web
software if you want an alternative I
highly recommend checking out Caban
it is Kanban I've heard it come back on
bun yes it's good stuff basically this
right here is project management
software and similar vein to Trello and
the cool thing is this is self hosted
and it runs on basically any lamps
server so you can grab the code off
github and essentially you know if
you've got oh you got a Linux box with
PHP and can been MySQL or even Postgres
or whatever database you'd like this is
pretty cool stuff
indeed katshannon
will have links in the show notes all of
these Shannon alright so my big problem
going into 2016 was trying to figure out
how to prioritize all the different
tasks that I had at hand because I took
on things like editing this year and
that takes up quite a bit of time as
well as like creating thumbnails for
every single show and like making sure
that they all go out on time and stuff
like that so staying on schedule was so
so important for me I had to find a way
to do that right and that's I mean
that's a big task editing the show and
that means that you're responsible for
everything that you guys are seeing
right now so for instance I held up my
hands and
Shannon we're gonna need a giant panda
right here then then it's like man I'm
just like giving you more or you are
giving to thank you thanks for the Panda
those great anytime yeah you know I
could put anything there right and you
wouldn't know to keep it pg so real
screenshot and stick it up on Twitter
yeah I promise little BPD okay hi kids
so my first one is Wunderlist which is
over at Wunderlist calm it's kind of
like Trello but it's outside of the web
interface so you can actually access it
through either the web as a you know
standalone thing or you can download the
software so that it pops up as a
separate item it's available
multi-platform so you can download it on
Linux Windows Mac and you can also get
it on your smartphone devices or your
tablets which is great and it gives you
access to prioritizing different kind of
tasks and you can separate them into
weeks months or days so I have my
everyday tasks separated out Monday
through Tuesday so every single day it
shows me exactly what tasks I need to
get done
so for example on Mondays I record
threat wires so my threat wire tasks on
Monday include record the show write the
show post the show edit the show not in
that order
obviously that would make no sense but
it makes sure that I keep everything you
know listed and separated the nice thing
I like about wonder list is that since
these are day-to-day tasks that I get
done every single week I can also
schedule them to show up every single
week and notify me that thing needs to
get done every single Monday so while I
can check mark it and finish that item
on Monday you know this week it's still
going to pop up next week as well it's
not like you know checking it off for
the entire that's what we need to do is
just get rid of those stupid reoccurring
things like this yeah Jen you'd pay
virginia power and then the next month
they'd send you another bill and you're
like I just I already paid you you know
when you do an episode of hack five and
then the next week comes around you're
like what I just recorded one yeah so
another thing I like that wonder Lily
Loup we're both stuck in while loose the
other thing I like about wonder list is
the fact that it also works as a chrome
app so every time I open Chrome as a new
browser it'll give me a little list of
everything that I need to get done
that's on my main task list so I'm
reminded of those big overarching life
goals every single day when I open my
Chrome browser so for example one of the
ones on there is I need to get some of
my jewelry refurbished and refinish me
for best I need to get some of my
jewelry refinished with link stuff so I
got to take it all in to jeweler and get
it fixed I haven't done that yet so it's
still one of my like big goals for the
year it's almost the end of 2016
you've got like a couple you've got like
two days to get it done I know I'll get
it done oh it's it's one of those things
that's like not high priority and that's
why it's been there all year but I'm
like okay I still need to get that done
so it's nice to have that reminder every
single day the other thing that I
figured out was kind of a life hack for
me was using a real life planner and
this is very similar to the fact that
you have this but there's certain stores
like the super girly store called paper
source which offers these nice thick
planners that have Monday through Sunday
you know every single day is on a
separate page for the entire year of
2017 or 2016 so you can write out
everything that you need to get done and
any kind of scheduling or meetings that
you need to do I found this
yeah so that's very similar yeah I like
the organization of a planner that has
like Monday through Sunday written out
or you know whatever it might be myself
that way I'm not dependent on something
that involves battery life for it to
actually work in that way I can always
access it because I carry a purse with
me everywhere so for a planner for me
it's very functional as well as very
easy to access yeah I would be lost if I
didn't have my journal in my wallet at
all times yeah you know similar to the
planner and the actual like tangible
writing thing the the thing that I've
been doing for the last week that's
really helped to because it's I like to
get my twenty seventeen like my next
year stuff I do it in December to China
like test the water see that's creating
new habits one of them is every morning
before meditation actually doing my
journaling in the morning
instead of in the evening still doing
the evening but in the morning right
three things one what's bothering me to
what I'm grateful for and three what my
intentions are for the day and then if I
review over the weekend I can actually
see like well those are my intentions
and did I any other done nope nope but
having like one or two goals per day
that you can set as a priority and that
are things that you could reasonably get
done in that day are more likely to keep
you optimistic because you will be able
to get those two goals done then you
know scheduling yourself to have like 18
things that you have to get done in a
day and you'll never finish that so
you'll feel negative on yourself
exactly you gotta you gotta set the bar
right instead of laying low you know
save the cheerleader save the world just
be like put pants on okay as long as you
put those pants on like you've achieved
something like 85 85 percent of the
audience that's watching right now has
already achieved that and to the other
15 percent I salute you so you were
speaking about habits and that's
something that I kind of tried to get
better at this past year for things like
flossing which I'm really bad at and I
should be a lot better at but I learned
this from Brian brushwood it's called
the 66 day habit method so usually it
takes a person about 66 days on average
to pick up a habit and do it
automatically as opposed to having to
think about it and be like oh yeah I
forgot to do that I'll just do it
tomorrow
so 66 day habit method practice
something for 66 days every single day
to make it into a habit and then you
won't have to necessarily think about it
you'll just do it so for me that was
flossing and I got way better at it than
I did at the beginning of 2016 and my
dentist appreciates me right now
yeah 66 days well there you go people
may take longer some less but that's the
average for a lot of people the other
thing that you mentioned was learning so
instead of having my big goal last year
was I want to learn Japanese well
there's a lot to learning Japanese so
that was going to be a problem obviously
but I decided to separate it into
something
that's a little bit easier and more
manageable I learned with flashcards oh
you did the the method where you just
break it up into chunks and then it's
more sustainable because you're like I'm
gonna learn new word every day or a
couple of words or whatever happy so I
did learn some new words which was
awesome
but last year I wanted to learn how to
read Japanese kana kana and hiragana
katakana by practicing flashcards once a
day every single day so I was mostly
fluent in about half of the characters
that I wanted to learn by May which is
when I took my trip to Japan for two
weeks so that was incredibly useful and
it took me five months to learn it was
probably about 50 or 60 characters so
now it's the end of the year I've been
practicing those flashcards and adding a
new one on every single day so now I've
memorized over a hundred characters plus
the additional modifiers for different
sounds like SAW and za so next up for me
is learning how to write them because
now I can look at them and know what it
says but I don't necessarily remember
them well enough to write words myself
and then after that I want to focus on
kanji so instead of using that huge like
learning method of I want to learn all
of Japanese I've broken it down into
okay this year I want to learn cut the
kana in hiragana next year I want to
learn how to write the year after that
I'll learn kanji but kanji is going to
take me like the rest of my life because
there's thousands of characters well you
know you just you can't eat the whole
cake at once you can't do you have any
that's laced by slice and you mentioned
Trello for doing tracking I use that as
well for a lot of my work stuff and it
is so useful for gold tracking as well I
love Trello Trello and wonder list man
those are the best I'm I'm excited about
hearing what they think is the best
because I'm not in love with Trello but
it kind of works I am in love with loop
habit trackers so this thing is like
amazing I want to know what you guys are
using to track your goals to achieving
your goals to staying motivated you know
I mean I feel like that's like a big
deal especially having it in your face
all the time yeah and and having it be
like an encouraging thing and not alike
huh you're a loser and didn't get this
done yeah exactly
you don't want something dogging on you
every day then you just feel sad that's
no fun let us know what your things are
