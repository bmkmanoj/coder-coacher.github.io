by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of technol as shannon
is on her honeymoon so she will be
joining us next week until then we are
going to answer some more epic hack 5
viewer feedback and take a little tour
of the studio talk about network
connectivity and other projects in the
works I am very excited also welcome to
the set in progress Paul we're looking a
little like little light back here I
think maybe we could well what do you
guys think feedback at hak5 org that's
what this episode is about this thing
will evolve this is in fact your
warehouse in a way and we would like to
invite you here as we are going to be
doing some amazing projects kind of akin
to the hack house so we've got I heard
see projection screens set up we've got
network cameras it just went in I am
stoked but let's start off with this
tidbit from Jurgen Jorgen I can't
pronounce this anyway he says hey guys
congratulations with the new location it
looks great i'm a regular viewer from
norway and love the show is hoping that
at some point you'd like to share some
of your specs of your studio and you
could tell us you know what cameras
you're running and you know what your
production resolution is he says that
he's into live video events and hoping
to share some information with us later
so that sounds really cool Paul I
believe we are using GF tues GF threes
so they're panasonic cameras their micro
four thirds which means they're
basically DSLRs except tiny GH GF anyway
they are g eight threes and these
upgraded some of the Panasonic aging
line cameras they look really great I
love these so yeah it's just like a DSLR
guy you know you gettin a little flip
out LCD I think there's even a new
version out now but what's nice about
these is you can actually you know swap
out the lens like you would on DSLR the
differences does it have a mechanical
shutter Paul it does okay but otherwise
we like these because we can put on a
nice lens that has a you know low
aperture which means that we can get
nice little depth of field of course I
am very close to the wall here
it's just a white wall so I don't expect
anything fantastic quite yet but we're
going to be working on the set a bunch
and I'm looking forward to that so yeah
these record great in AVCHD but most of
all is because we can get a live video
out of the hdmi port it's a standard
size hdmi no it's a mini size hdmi Paul
is really the one that knows everything
about the cameras here but yeah that
goes straight into our mixing setup and
we're using a black magic 8 m myxer that
takes in all of those HD video feeds and
then that all gets recorded on a chi pro
is that correct ball yeah so that
records in 1080i 60 no Paul knows all of
this what does it record 1080i 30 what
is 1030 1080p ah really oh man 1080p
progressive 30 anyway we're doing the
best we can with that but maybe that can
swap out so yeah we'll get some b-roll
of that it looks really great and Paul's
office is now part of the studio which
is kind of exciting which will lead more
into when we can do live things in here
so that brings us to dawn who sent a
lengthy email about audio and
green-screen sets now audio wise we
understand last week's episode was
pretty terrible as far as echoes
concerned I'm very excited about some of
the cool stuff that has been happening
right up your alley and I think cause
would be proud of this because primitive
ever envisioned we're working on it
right now we are using these kind of eco
foam panels that go up on the wall it's
pretty cool because they don't have any
fiberglass in them or anything they look
kind of industrial that's all you know
post-consumer trash and stuff but those
are up on the wall and they are doing a
pretty good job i would say at reducing
the echo and they're really made for
audio like just acoustic management not
like sound isolation and so far so good
we have a lot more to put in we got a
huge shipment we had giant crate of
these baffles that are going in so
they're they're these foam panels that
are going to hang from the ceiling and
hopefully we'll have enough to put all
over the warehouse and be able to shoot
anywhere and make it sound great as far
as green screens we have only typically
used green screens where appropriate
like Paul and I are kind of anti green
screen in the same way that we're anti
jump-cut but we'll do one here for you
just because we love you wasn't that
fantastic we're on YouTube green screens
we use on hack tip and metasploit minute
because we like those are very oriented
on computer screens and what's going on
on the computer screen so we like to
kind of project them behind us a lot of
times so surprised how much feedback
that we've gotten about using
green-screen sets which sure I mean we
could do those so yeah that might be
something that we play around with i
always like doing something you know
tangible i'm excited that we have
windows again that we can do set
dressing and bring back the the toronto
a cityscape from harkening back to
season six and all of those and
otherwise yeah looking forward to
feedback on that but thanks done now
ankush says love your show and i don't
know if you've already done this on the
show but it would be really cool to show
these batch scripts that steal Wi-Fi
passwords and save them to a hidden
directory has also made another one that
saves them and sends them over you know
why five is saves your stored Wi-Fi
passwords and sends them over ftp which
is kind of cool this is actually stuff
that you can do on the USB rubber ducky
we've done in the past and I thought
that it would just share that with you
as a cool piece of feedback and we will
link to those batch files in the show
notes ready for another jump cut Paul
it's magic I know I'm like running both
sides of the show now Shannon come back
John says that he loves the show and
he's been watching since season one says
keep up the great work and wanted to
share a project he's been working on
it's a mobile robotics research platform
and he built to learn more about
robotics which is really the best way to
learn and it's all about autonomy and
self driving and there's a bunch of
awesome information and pictures on his
site that we were link in the show notes
this is just a cool piece of feedback
that I was like it getting my techno
lassan so thanks for sending that by as
well as an end
who says I'm a fan of the tri-valley or
he's a fan from the tri-valley in
california and he's been watching us
since we moved into the old firehouse
and he's a huge fan and he was wondering
if he could volunteer and help set up
the hack warehouse or anything else for
that matter and I guess we should
probably put it that we're going to do
some things with a hybrid of the Bay
Area hacker brunches that we've been
doing as well as maybe some warehouse
hackery I don't know maybe some projects
and builds and other stuff that we can
do like that you know the address is
somewhat pertinent to operational
security otherwise there's a massive
security system in here but other words
we don't really advertise but we will
have people join us at the warehouse if
you're part of the barrier hacker
brunches which is pretty cool because
then we can vet you and make sure you're
not an ax murderer Jason writes in and
says dude paint a green screen on the
wall actually didn't say dude I added
the dude he says bring back threat wire
that's how he found us and actually
that's a fantastic idea as soon as the
dust settles I think we might be able to
do that show more justice with a
completely new format which I think
maybe the green screen would be
appropriate for just get some graffiti
on the warehouse walls and you know make
a big and hacker themed I love that idea
maybe we can get some art going on in
here and he says that i like when you
show the computer feed monitor as
opposed to filming them over a shoulder
however you'd like to see the same kind
of thing with android the trick with
android is getting the screen from
Android you can do over a DB but it's
not like you can get a nice little HD in
my feet out of there you can on most
Android devices use MHL to get a video
feed out of hdmi off that micro USB port
the problem then is say for instance
last week when we were showing that or
if analyzer app that would tie up the
USB port and then we wouldn't also be
able to plug in the hack RF and get that
live video feed out if you look at most
shows that cover this stuff they either
do the ADB type screencap Bing or they
just shoot the computer screen or tablet
screen phone screen what is a computer
anymore also wants to see more hak5 van
chin and some car hacks so that sounds
pretty cool we can definitely get into
that I'm bummed that we can't get the
van in the warehouse because of the
whole loading dock situation but anyway
thank you for the feedback and we will
in fact he asks about streaming cameras
we have put up a security system it
should be very fun to kind of share that
with you when we have events and stuff
and comb I also writes in about the
whole rebuttal to the nothing to hide
argument I'm going to put the full text
in the show notes because it's really
great and links to an awesome talk
everybody should listen to its grand
Glenn Greenwald at TED talks and it's
amazing so I encourage everybody to
check that out so that's it for right
now when we get right back we get into
the fire round of viewer questions until
then taking a quick break imagine you're
a hacker hacker with an idea it's
fantastic idea you want to share with
the world and you know you're going to
need you're going to need a domain and
the folks that can get you that or
domain com they are like a massive
warehouse with like all the domains and
you can go there and short through all
the shelves and to make it super simple
they've got a domain discovery system
that'll take you right to the ones that
are perfect for your idea so I encourage
you all to check at domain.com mostly
because they're affordable reliable easy
to use but also because they're really
fun on social media and they've been
supporting hak5 for years so you should
go and tweet them at domain.com insane

glitch writes and says what do you guys
getting 3d printers well I'm looking at
the robo are one but I'm not really sure
what do you guys think go Joshua says is
that a big Chinese laser cutter yes it
is an MT 3050 d by morn and it has a 22
x 14 bed in a 40 watt tube Adler web
rights will it blend I hope not chunky
chess one says take a deep breath of
that fiberglass pink yeah okay so
actually in guard that's the stuff i put
in the van it's polyester it's got no
fiberglass it's no formaldehyde no vocs
no other harmful additives and it's made
by 50% post-consumer recycled stuff
sadly it's discontinued because they're
a small manufacturer at a UK it was
really expensive and difficult to get
into the states and now basically every
was going with this doubt safe touch
stuff so yay Dow Chemical it's not fifty
percent recycled content but that's good
stuff to make it says does the warehouse
have a large red button that shall not
be pushed lightly not yet but hopefully
when we have a robot you too can push
the red button archive it says what's
the first thing you want to make with
your cnc machines laser cutters or
whatever I can't wait to make drone
frames and I think we might need to CNC
machine for that because I want to cut
g10 rich says when are you putting in
the water slide never
and finally mr. Smith says what are you
doing about connectivity it's a
broadband cluster here the best we could
do was adsl2 plus x sonic net who has
been actually really cool so props to
you guys we're still waiting on a
comcast line because they're the only
one in the area that can actually
service anything affordably that's
anywhere around 100 megabits right now
we've got two up to 40 megabit bonded
adsl2 plus modems that are essentially
giving us about seven megabits each and
then we're bonding both of those
actually we're not even bonding we're
aggregating those doing a little bit of
load balancing right now with a
multi-way and pep link we are also
playing with some multi win in open wrt
which I shall looks pretty promising and
then we can add on LTE on top of that
the only problem with that is t-mobile
has a five gig cap for sharing your
phone's LTE whereas you could buy only
up to like 11 gigs for their data plans
in the US and yada yada essentially what
we need to do is just root a phone and
plug it into there and then wait for
tmobile to call us and say you did 150
gigs in four days on your phone and be
like yeah we're playing angry birds a
lot I don't know how that works also
massage chair oh there we go much better
I should probably also say that we've
looked at a lot of the wireless ISPs in
the area of which it's ridiculously
expensive for some kind of mathematical
craziness of you can't use too much
bandwidth or will cut you off so really
our best bet actually might be to hook
up with archive org who in Richmond just
like two miles away has a center with a
30-foot mast offering something like 80
megabits on an awesome roof to roof
network so we need to reach out to them
because we have a roof and we like
networks yeah well that's just about
wraps up this week's episode of pack 5
thank you again for all of your feedback
feedback and hak5 org if you have
questions or of course suggestions for
the sad or projects you'd like to see us
do on the show thanks for sticking with
us as this is a crazy transition period
for us can't begin to tell you how
stressed out I am doing a bunch of stuff
that isn't
hacking is more about logistics and
that's not fun so anyway without further
ado of by for Shannon and myself we
encourage you to find us at hak5 door /
/ follow and to support us directly a
check a shop calm and until next week
we're reminding you to trust your techno
list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
