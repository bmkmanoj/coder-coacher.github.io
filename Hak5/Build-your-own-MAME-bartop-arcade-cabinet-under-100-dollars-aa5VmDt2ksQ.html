coming back with a mod that I think
you'll kind of enjoy but before I go
into what the mod actually is and how to
do it I need to give you a little
background on it and tell you where it
came from and just how it evolved from
there so let's go look at that first all
right so the whole idea for this mod was
basically born of me and Darren sitting
here on the couch just like this playing
video games and we just kind of broke
out into discussion dude playing Street
Fighter sucks with controllers dude you
ain't line I want an arcade so bad I do
too
I'm gonna go down to a crappy one at the
pizza shop dude that's not even a
freaking arcade there's none around here
yeah dude you know what we need what we
need our own cab where she can't afford
an arcade cabinet where do we have the
room for it with a set and everything
come on dude I'm telling you I can make
a cab for less than a hundred bucks and
it'll fit on a bar top you serious yeah
I know I can do it can do for the show
of course I'll do it for the show you
have it by Thursday Thursday yeah yeah I
can have it done by Thursday all right
all right my mission now is to build
this mini arcade that'll fit on top of a
bar counter and cost less than $100 so
first things first I need to go do some
design work hey what's up with hey
what's up Dee shellin what you working
on I'm actually working on the plans for
the arcade as we speak oh sweet this is
gonna be on the show notes yeah I'll
have it in both a bitmap form and an
actual DWG in case our viewers want to
modify it as they see fit
sweet all right thanks man no problem
all right designs taken care of now the
next biggest thing is parts we have
spare computers lying around and spare
game controllers lying around so those
are going to get recycled however we
will not be using this so all right
we're gearing up to actually do all of
our cuts and build this thing but first
things first we need to take all of our
plans
I'm out mark out all of our cuts on our
piece of MDF and make sure we've got
enough wood for it just use a pencil
it's real easy
March really well and when you're
cutting make sure you account for losing
that eighth of an inch while using a saw
all right we're ready to rock and roll
everything's laid out time to cut now
safety tip make sure you follow all
woodworking shop procedures while using
power tools and keep your safety glasses
on at all times well except when
watching the show as far as cutting goes
since nobody's perfect you're going to
have to do some sanding to clean up
those rough edges and maybe a couple of
those off cuts that you might have made
using your jigsaw or your circular saw
so you can use a rotary tool to take out
the big portions and get some
half-decent hand sandpaper to really
finish it up and make it look good one
of the really good accents it's going to
make this feel like a real arcade is
that plexiglass cover that you'll have
over the screen to make it look really
good you can paint and outside pour
damnit paint I'll be right back alright
like I was saying we're going to use a
piece of Plexiglas IDE border so it
gives that authentic look you cut out
your border leaving the square in the
middle peel the protective film on the
outside off you paint that and that
paint is going to go on the inside so
when you look at it from the reverse
side it's going to look smooth even and
just have a really really nice gloss and
an authentic look now that you've got
all your cuts done all that prep work
you can actually start to assemble it
now what I did was drill into both the
edges and install L brackets on the
inside so that way you have really
really good support and you don't have
to worry about it ever getting tipped
over and torn up so the cabs all
assembled right now except one vital
piece your control deck now for controls
we went to xrk comm and picked up their
package deal for 30 bucks you can pick
up two joysticks and 20 buttons and
those 20 buttons include white player 1
and player 2 buttons if you want that
really authentic feel you can go to Happ
controls calm
and pickup the same setup but for about
twice the price okay now that we've got
the buttons and joysticks mounted we
have a bigger issue to tackle that is
how are we going to interface those with
the computer there's a few different
ways of going about this you can get a
custom keyboard translator like the eye
pack but they're kind of pricey so we've
decided to stay away from that you can
hack the interface of a keyboard
directly but since I already molested a
model M I thought I might want to stay
away from that I'm sorry Jen so we had
some very inexpensive USB game pads
lying around so I decided to hack those
let's go take a look at that all right
so what we have here is what's left over
our game pad the way these things
basically work is when you push the
button down it connects these two halves
of this pad completes the circuit sends
it to the IC computer recognizes it now
we have to get that kind of translation
over to our actual arcade buttons way I
went about this we should drill a hole
in the trace for both the positive and
the negative solder a lead on to it be
very careful that your solder does not
bridge the connection then on the other
end we just use these little quick
connects they slide right on these tabs
here so now when you push this it does
the exact same thing that if you were to
push a button on a normal game pad
computer does not know the difference
and it works just as well
all right hatchlings here it is fully
assembled your own personal bar top
arcade machine now let me point out a
few key features first things first
contact paper marbleized for most of the
cab and the granite for the control deck
it looks really good and it saves you
from painting okay
next you can see all the buttons laid
out here but there's some accessory
buttons that you cannot see right now
first are the pinball buttons on the
side so you get that same authentic feel
and on the back I have a power button
installed so you don't have to crawl
inside of the cab to turn the machine on
get inside of the cab if you need to do
so I've installed hinges and a latch on
the back panel to make that access very
easy I'm going to go into the hardware
next month so hold tight so for less
than $100 and about a weekend's worth of
time you can have your own personal
arcade machine so any questions or
comments please see the show notes at
hak5 org slash forums and I will supply
the building plans for you but until
then it's time to kick ass and chew
bubblegum and I'm all out of gum
bring it what you got son Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
