I can cross the extra-terrestrial
highway check it out this segment of
pack 5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of texting lust and i am so excited
because hack the past America couple
weeks in now I'm having the best time I
want to thank everybody that signed up
at hacc across America com to
participate everybody does come out to
the meetups we had so much fun in eugene
oregon in portland and we're doing some
awesome stuff here in seattle on the
fifteenth we're going to be in mem ferda
i shouldn't forget on the 11th so member
oregon what's up but seattle is going to
be huge as well we're going to have like
you know we're going to arcades and
we're going to museums and we're going
to hackerspaces we're doing something
similar to in los angeles on the
twenty-second you're going to want to
get in on this if you're in the Southern
California area because we've gotten to
see space shuttle Endeavour I'm so
excited about that we're gonna go to
hackerspaces we're going to go out
having some adult beverages it's going
to be a lot of fun but it's all ages
it's everybody come on out and then on
the 29 San Diego so just wanted to hit
you real quick with those dates as I
trekked across America the hack across
there's all those things and with all
that we've got a fantastic show we've
got stuff from Portland we've got stuff
from Maker Faire so stay tuned and I'll
see you guys on the road
so this is the list sure so latest is
the public laboratory my group and
community we just launched a new
Kickstarter infra gram which is short
for infrared photogrammetry which is
measured and doing quantified infrared
photography and it comes out of our
balloon mapping work of trying to get
the same type of imagery that land
management agencies use for their big
decision making which is false color
imagery to look at chlorophyll activity
in plants and determine land water
boundaries and also like how plants are
doing in fields and the way they do that
is they have satellites with
multispectral cameras that capture
visible and infrared light and then they
are able to do a series of vegetation
indexes and transforms on those images
so you weren't able to do that kind of
stuff with the technology you're using
before with your balloon for photography
well we were just using standard
point-and-shoots and so we started out
prototyping converting cameras to shoot
infrared and flying camera pairs and
then we had a breakthrough actually net
Horning is one of our community
researchers and Chris pasty we're
realizing well hey we can do it in one
camera using a single filter so we take
out the infrared filter that would
normally prevent it for a light from
going through and put a filter like this
in that blocks just the red channel
would weigh together lose it take to
take the I air filter out of the camera
it means stripping the camera down to
the CCD and
putting back together again so depending
on the camera model most of the cannons
it's pretty straightforward and pretty
easy to get down there we have to be
careful when you're handling the ccd and
you can't lose track of where the screws
go so it's not all the same screw it's
not all the same screw so I do it by
drawing the camera out on a piece of
paper taking all the screws and stick
and putting them down the piece of paper
where that came out and taking cell
phone photos as ago and then reversing
the process this camera took about an
hour and a half open to close to convert
and I never use that model before that's
about normal hour and a half to two
hours to do the conversion now the web
cams are super easy because the webcams
just have screwin lenses so like this
one you just mark the fixed focus of the
lens with a little tan or something and
then just unscrew it so there's the back
of the lens and normally there's a piece
of polyester filter stuck right there at
the back nolan's you use people you just
kick it off through with your thumb and
then if you're really good i I couldn't
cut a circular piece of filter well
enough to stick into the body so I stick
it on the outside but doesn't matter
where you put the filter uh he gets
slightly better results inside as you
don't get reflections on the service the
filter sure but outside works pretty
well too and so you just screw it back
in and make sure you get the fixed focus
back to the right point so got webcams
hi yeah it can't recommend that a knobs
like they focus to infinity right right
it was such a huge depth of at the field
so it's the same process with my 808 cam
the filter was actually embedded in the
plastic in front of the lens I was that
so anyway it's the easiest to hack so
that wasn't actually well actually was a
little harder because instead of
unscrewing the lens and taking it off
the back I had to
lenzen actually just sanded it down
really quickly and I popped the piece of
glass out of the front so another
screwdriver on me to show you but yeah
it was like actually embedded in the
plastic on the front huh so I did ruin
the visible light filter because i
sanded down that side of it but the lens
is in great condition so that was fun
cool and so we end up getting instead of
red green blue we get near for red blue
green moving near infrared near-infrared
infrareds a really wide band right
visible light is a small band running
from you know little over 400 nanometers
to just below 700 nanometers so like 300
nanometers in visible light and then
miram threat is another 300 nanometers
worth of invisible light that runs from
about 700 huh 400 so 702 about 1100 but
infrared is really why so what we're so
near infrared is very much like visible
light we just can't see it far infrared
is what we normally think of which is
like thermal mapping like FLIR cameras
and that kind of stuff so what does that
allow you to see sure well i'll show you
some images it lets you so plants in
infrared you just look at a pure
infrared image are going to come out
bright white and that's because when
plants are photosynthesizing they can't
chlorophyll can't effectively utilize
the near infrared band and it would
cause them to overheat so they they
reflect it until you get so our false
color images come out looking something
like this yet mmm all almost a white or
pale coloured plants and then we're able
to do to subtract the band the infrared
from visible light bands this is really
typical right white plants dark sky Wow
um and so will you gather from that
wait plans well tell you like something
about the health of the plan or
something right so the plants are going
to be reflecting amount of infrared if
they're dead they're not going to be
reflecting infrared nearly as much so
you can actually have a green plant
that's not photosynthesizing so if
you're looking at it and it's green
you're not going to get that much
information about what how it's doing
health-wise so the general processing
that we do is ndvi and what ndvi is is a
normalized difference vegetation index
in so here's that same photo this isn't
our alpha web which were this is our big
pour point which is infogrames going to
be a web platform for doing this type of
image processing so you get your false
color image with near thread in that
channel and then this is just the near
fred channel and then if you subtract
the visible banned from the infrared
band it's a little more math than that
you get it an image where the plants
just come out one color so there you can
see plants pop out in just green than
that and then then you can quantify that
those values to determine somewhat how
the plants are doing it's really
dependent on unless you correlate on the
ground investigations to a bunch of
plants so if you know how a few plants
are doing down in your field you can
take those spot surveys and extrapolate
them out to like a whole field of plants
into having to use this we'd use this
it's the way it's used in Land
Management is to spot problems in fields
so Cargill and ADM and those folks have
their own satellites monitoring corn
fields in the Midwest and they'll pick
up plant infestations or I mean insect
infestations or other things through
dark spots in there vegetation indexing
imagery the other thing that they're
used for is on the case that got us into
it was wetlands management which is the
theory because wetlands are very
difficult to survey the the aerial
imagery is a major part of our wetland
management management strategy why are
they difficult to survey because there's
a lot of mud you got to take out a boat
just for
oh so yeah say they end up doing aerial
surveys instead and there and the
bringing the plants out in extreme
relief like this into that like where
the plants are popping out as just one
color lets you determine on very simply
the like active land water boundary of
like we're like irrespective of tides
because the plants are only going to
grow where they're out of the water and
so if you can draw that you can draw a
firm line between where plants are and
where water is you know how the land is
doing whether it's receding or advancing
and whether plant growth is holding that
land in place so you're saying you can
just figure out where the water table is
based on what's growing well more
specifically where the land is how how
well are we doing holding onto land
because those those wetland buffer is an
important thing especially in the Gulf
of Mexico or on the east coast where
they have more sloping drop off to their
the continental shelf those those
wetlands are what are protecting the
shore from storm events so how well
they're doing how much land is still
there is a vital thing attractive
awesome yeah hey you know that that was
the thing that just let the Everglades
were pretty yeah the other Everglades
and all the all the swamps of the the
Gulf or the the most useful barrier to
storms that we have so here's like
here's a pasture up in Vermont on
gigapan so and so this is the same
stitching stuff where the before the
right home using these different filters
and so what do you tell practically out
of this image right so we're looking at
a forest pasture I believe in New
Hampshire and so here you can you have
these varying shades of and VIN visible
light you like varying shades of green
all over and then in
just by doing this transform you can
pull out the trees as dark areas and the
grass that are very actively
photosynthesizing and so is the idea
that over time you would continue doing
these surveys and then see the
differences right so the most most
useful thing is in tracking other
factors and correlating to these so if
you're a home gardener tracking like how
many pounds of tomatoes you get off of
one plant versus another and then look
at their color values and the next year
you could kind of judge your yields
based on the previous year's color data
those kinds of things and this can be
extrapolated to big fields so Doran Cox
who I believe this is one of his
pastures is in Vermont it's one of our
community researchers he's been using
some of our prototype hardware over the
last year's to do field trials of cover
crops and so he's got some temperature
data on the ground he's got harvest
quantities because he's quantifying how
much hey he actually pulls in from each
one of these different trial sites and
he's correlating that to the imagery yes
so it's cool so I really a temperature
data from this know is that next is that
important uh that would be something
totally different so hacking a camera
like this or doing lick on our
Kickstarter we're putting together we
have live webcams and stuff these kinds
of technologies aren't going to get you
the CCDs can't pick up the farm thread
so that stuff is like way outside of our
range in your custom sensor for that but
we're able to do like very simple
modifications and get on functional ndvi
because we can get the near-infrared and
so will I this free here was that census
is this is a webcam this is a webcam
that came out of a laptop top and this
type of web cam is actually really fun
to play around with because normally if
you pick up a webcam that's like a
little box webcam external one it only
implements part of the UVC spec which is
the
camera specification for four USB
webcams and I is that because it's
cheaper and so when the in the in laptop
cameras they tend to implement the whole
spec which means you can set the white
balance and auto exposure you can
reprogram them and actually send them
full instructions instead of having them
like running in auto mode all the time
so that allows you to do the kind of
guests and cameras without the filter
and what is that what is that just
little take a piece of gel or whatever
on the end of the lens it's the same gel
I'm using hand so what is it so these
are these are the filters we're using
we're actually using a theatrical deep
dive polyester filters instead of glass
filters oh wow they get similar response
and there are lots a scientific glass so
it slipped is uh what does the new case
serve your involve technology wise so
technology wives got three reward levels
we've got my favorite which is the ton
dollar reward I mean obviously i'd like
more of people's money but the
ten-dollar awards my favorite because
you can just convert a camera like this
so this is a power shot i picked up on
craigslist for fifty bucks that's pretty
old now and i pulled out the filter and
the are our kickstarter will come with
filter pack and this is a white balance
and target card for doing some vanilla
break based on that blue
and creating black right so you do a
white balance to the gray spot sure and
then you check your results by looking
through it and seeing okay so do I
actually get a clean image do I get a
clean green and a clean blue clean white
and clean black what does that look like
we do on the camera tht give a
viewfinder on that let's see yeah so
I've got a white balance talk to the
memory card out I think so white balance
it so card Scully response is pretty
good set my way balance point so it was
already pretty well by balanced but
there you can see them getting blue and
green but if I point it out of anything
else at a bag right so look at that hour
felt the velcro that bag may look green
in invisible light but it's actually
reflecting a significant amount of
near-infrared so we're talking about
this area right here the only camera
it's kind of like orange right because
we're feeding near-infrared into the
into the red band Wow so it turns out
velcro is extremely responsive in your
friend over dance fantastic and yeah
Chester ten dollar reward level at 35
bucks we're gonna have a factory
modified set webcam that'll probably be
a model very much like this um and then
at $95 level this is the reward we're
still working on it
how well how many back as we get but
we're going to have at least a 2
megapixel camera that has a battery and
memory card etc so people can walk
around in with it so my prototype is an
808 cam nice and so this one has a if
you look really closely I got a little
blue filter in the top jazz on Italy see
that but hopefully it'll be something
much like that and it shows with a
camera this size of course that means
your balloon but not necessarily have to
be five and a half feet right you could
do I brought a bunch of kites at me but
yeah you can do it six foot or even
smaller kite at five foot or four foot
cut to lift one of those and so are you
still a fan of the chi t Tobin blooms um
whenever there's wind yeah I'm a big fan
I've been getting to be a big fan of
these 808 cams um the West Lothian
Archaeological Society John Wells over
in Scotland he got me into these he has
been working with kids and I mean the
cheapest kites they're doing aerial
mapping for like less than 50 bucks for
the whole kit you know which is like
camera rig string cut and it's the kind
of thing you can handle a ten-year-old
I'd say let's go out map this
archaeological site so yeah I've been a
big fan of these another thing I brought
this is fun this isn't commercial but
this is from the UK again let's watch
japanese but learned this from UK custom
UK this is a 40-foot this is a 40-foot
photo pole so this is all carbon fiber
telescopes out and my really simple
rigging a basically now on the top and
then put up
put a quarter 20 volt for the quarter
twenty bolt hold my camera on right
there and so you just put a
point-and-shoot on this yup and then
you've got 4000 just send up in this guy
yeah weighs nothing to really know what
this for a Wi-Fi antennas right so yeah
they're soulless car pulls they're for
fishing for carp apparently in Japan and
the in the UK they have this method for
fishing where instead of using a real
they just use a single long pole they
tie a bait to the other end I really
don't know much about the fishing side
but I'm totally awesome for photography
and less efficient excited
what would you say failed okay so this
is my raspberry pi hack raspberry pi cam
you can see it's here I got the lens out
and I have it mounted on this is a
filter switcher that's normally a
component inside a security camera and
secure security camera lens and the lens
mount works i can get photos I've got a
reduced reduced angle from this lens
because the sensor is kind of small in
the pie camp but my big hope with this
was that I would be able to match the
pike am to a filter switcher and do near
infrared and visible light photography
in here so I can pull it so right in
here I can actually pull with a solenoid
I can pull the visible light filter out
in front of the camera unfortunately the
Raspberry Pi cam the filter is not
attached to the sensor it's not attached
to the lens which is pretty normal
normally you have it like on the inside
of the lens or someplace where it's easy
really removable it's actually attached
directly to the sensor so it's
essentially impossible to get out but I
was really hoping that was going to work
because it would be so badass to be able
to do the New York Fred photography on
the pike am because it does it shoots
raw and oh like a little webcam here
talked about right so yeah these webcams
still work and actually some folks in
our community are working on software
for the pike am controlling the USB
webcams we don't shoot raw we still have
to work with JPEG imagery that comes off
of there but yeah that's what we're
doing so this was like yeah I'm so upset
when I when the pie camp came in the
mail well only only like a day later you
know looks like got it let's find a day
oh hey there never I've seen you in a
while let me tell ya never told you my
favorite top level domain I know you're
probably kicking yourself like does even
have a who has a favorite top level
domain I do I'm gonna tell you right now
