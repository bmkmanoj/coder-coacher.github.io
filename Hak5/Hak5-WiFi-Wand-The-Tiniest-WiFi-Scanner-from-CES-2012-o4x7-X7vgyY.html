coverage for hak5 I'm Darren kitchen
here at CES 2012 and I found a little
gadget that maybe double-oh-seven would
like or really anybody in an office that
needs to convert paper paper paper
documents into something digital those
PDFs that we love and uh here at Ken Zen
they have manufactured this great little
wand here called the magic scan and what
this guy does is you just take a piece
of paper right nap by 11 or something
like that and you can just roll this
over it to create a PDF and then it just
stores that on a microSD card on the
unit it scans and resolutions of
anywhere between 600 and 900 DPI and
what's really nifty about this new unit
that they're just now bringing to market
is that it has a switch here to convert
it over into Wi-Fi mode and once it's on
that mode you can actually get at the
file on that micro SD card over Wi-Fi
using your smartphone so they actually
have an app for Android and iOS so it
can imagine for you know road warriors
and businessmen like on the road or even
you know make poor press because I don't
know whatever this could be really nifty
I like the idea of it's not actually
using Wi-Fi direct connect it's creating
its own wireless access point and they
have their own software to go and
retrieve the file off the device but it
is pretty nifty this is retailing a
little over a hundred dollars and we
should expect to see it hopefully in q1
for more continued coverage of all
things CES 2012 head over to revision
3.com / CES and of course would like to
thank Ford for powering our coverage in
the 2013 escape that all new hands-free
power liftgate is incredibly easy to use
with the available intelligent access to
you simply put your foot under the
bumper and the power liftgate will
automatically open providing you access
to the cargo area thanks to forage for
powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
