Printrbot this segment of hak5 is
brought to you by go to assist hey
everybody I'm Shannon Morse and I'm
playing with my very first 3d maker
specifically this one is called the
Printrbot LLC so you can buy this one is
preassembled for like seven ninety-nine
we have the ones that would normally
cost 649 bucks and it takes like six
hours to actually compile everything all
the hardware and everything to get this
actually running and the software isn't
even in that total time so today I
wanted to show you how to do the
software and how to get everything ready
for your own Printrbot LC and then
hopefully you'll start making your own
3d prints at home pretty quick and
simple after I figured out all the parts
that break so let's go ahead and get
started printrbot dot-com is the website
where you can get all the details on how
to install everything and you can find
different printer bots that you can
purchase so that's where you can find
all the installation guides and whatnot
now the first thing we want to do is go
to the program called repeater your host
now since i already have a product a
project compiled in here I can't get
into the printer settings but i'll go
ahead and tell you what exactly you have
to do with that so the first thing you
want to do is go ahead and connect your
printer so you want to you know put in
the power supply make sure that's
working and your fan is working you also
want to plug it in via USB to your
computer so you know that you're getting
a connection between your USB or your
computer and the printer now one thing I
did find out what this is when you plug
it in via USB you might have to install
some drivers for it as well so keep that
in mind just go into the device manager
and make sure that it pops up correctly
if not just google it and you'll find
the correct drivers for it after that
you can go ahead and get into the
repeater your host program so you open
this up and the first thing you need to
change is your USB connection make sure
your connected to the proper USB port
and the baud rate so you want to change
that to 250,000 after that you want to
change the behavior
of your Printrbot so this is basically
the temperature in the heat bed
temperature both of those for the
Printrbot LC that's going to be 210
degrees Celsius in 70 if you're using a
BS PLA is a little bit different that
one is 190 your dimensions are going to
be about 150 millimeters so that is
basically the size of your printer BOTS
heat bed so that's you know 150
millimeters 150 and then 150 up so it's
basically a exact cube the other
Printrbot that they have on sale that
one's about 200 so it's a little bit
larger than this one but we have the
little guy right here now you can move
on to your slicer settings so slicer is
a is a program that you can use for 3d
printing and 3d modeling it's going to
basically compose everything and make it
work with your printer it's a lot more
scientific than that but I'm making it
super easy so what you need to do with
this is click configure and once that
opens you need to change just a few
things in here these basically have to
do with the temperature as well and
speeds and then a couple of other
settings so we go in here to print
settings I'm going to change the layers
and the perimeters these are going to be
point three millimeters and then the
first layer height will be one hundred
percent after that I go to in Phil Phil
density is point three and then we're
going to keep it as rectilinear for the
fill patterns in the top bottom fill
pattern everything else you can leave
the same so you don't have to change any
of those you can skip down to skirt and
brim after that and you want to do two
loops total now we'll go over to
filament settings so the diameter this
is going to be the diameter of your abs
the plastic the filament that you're
using this is two point nine five
millimeters for cooling you want to
scroll down all the way to the bottom
and you're going to change a couple of
things down here enable fan if layer
print time is below 70 slow down if
layer print time is below 20 and then
print speed is going to be 15
millimeters per second so hopefully
that's pretty quick because I can't wait
to print out this awesome shark after
that you just go over to general for
printer settings and you want to change
the bed size so this is really important
this makes sure that you're not printing
outside of your actual range I only have
150 x 150 millimeters so I had to change
that on the x and the y axis as well so
print center obviously that's going to
be the middle of your printer the print
very center of the actual bed so that's
150 divided by two for each one so
that's 75 that's pretty easy and pretty
obvious then we go over to extruder one
nozzle diameter for most printers that
you're going to find on the market all
your 3d printers is going to be point 4
millimeters most of them apparently use
the same kind of nozzles so that's a
pretty obvious setting now once you're
done with all these i really suggest
that you save all your settings so you
don't have to mess around with them
again so up here i just click the save
button and I saved them all as Printrbot
so anytime I open this up slicer it's
going to automatically go to the
Printrbot settings the file that i have
saved now i can close this discard any
changes continue anyway yeah okay so
this is where we get to the really fun
part this is where we connect we make
sure that it's printing properly and
then we get it set up to actually start
printing our very first model so excited
so first thing you do is click connect
up here and you should get a little
green power button now if you get any
kind of errors when you do that just
make sure that you have the drivers
installed and you have it plugged into
the right port make sure that your
serial connection is giving you the
right right access to the printer so i
connect it already and then I go over to
manual control now under manual control
you can change around the X and Y axis
as well as the z-axis so Z is what it
makes it go up and down x and y make it
go right and left and forward and
backwards each of these you want to test
out at about 10 mm
ters make sure that it's having no
problems moving back and forth this is
especially important if you've built
your own you've never done one before
you want to make sure that you put
everything together correctly and you're
not going to have any problems or
anything breaking like the the cords or
the belts so go ahead and test that out
and once you have that done click the
little home button so if I click home
right now it basically configures the
Printrbot to go specifically to the
front left corner and this is going to
set it up for pretty much every single
printing job that I do thereafter so I'm
always going to set it to home after
I've done compiling and configuring it
so after that I think I'm pretty much
ready so let's go ahead and download our
very first printer model so I'll go over
to thingiverse whoa look at that a
Legend of Zelda rupee LED cover okay
that's kind of awesome so from
Thingiverse you can download all sorts
of free 3d projects that you can just
use for your printer bot no matter what
kind of printer that you have they work
with several of them if not most so you
can go into whichever one you want so
the one that I did was mr. Jones mr.
gels this is the one that's suggested by
Printrbot in case you've never done one
before it'll basically give you an idea
make sure that everything is working
correctly and it's generally pretty
small so it's not going to take that
much time to actually print it out so
you go here and then you just click
download this thing and you'll get this
nifty little zip file if you chose to
download all things so I'm going to show
this in the folder so this is my mr.
joel's copies so there's two in here
there's mr. journalism mr. jaws version
2 I just went with mr. Jones number one
I go back to repeat ear and from a PT ER
I can go ahead and add my new projects
so I have mr. Jones stl here if I wanted
to add something new I could choose mr.
Jones version to click open
and from there you choose slicer and you
want to slice with slicers so after
you've chosen it go to slicer hit slice
with slicer and it's going to give you
this G code editor so you'll notice on
the the model over here it's basically
going to give you the exact track of
where your printer is going to go so
it's going to show you exactly what's
going to happen with your printer and if
you want to make any changes you can
actually do that here I for one am not
that advanced with 3d printers so I'm
not making any changes to the g-code so
after that I go back over to manual
control make sure i'm at home looks good
and then I go to my heat and heat
extruder and print bed so down here I'm
going to make sure that it's set to 210
degrees which it is and then heat print
bed which is also on I'll change to 70
so you can see right here with these two
numbers 2 0 9 degrees so it's just under
2 10 and then 67 degrees Celsius just
under 70 so you can tell that it's
starting to get up to the point where I
can go ahead and start printing out my
new project my mr. John shark so after
this you want to check your temperature
curve this is going to show you exactly
where your printer is on the timeline
there's going to be a purple line up at
the top around 210 degrees and then one
down here at 70 you can kind of see it
down there since it's not quite up to up
to range once you get your red line for
the actual nozzle and the printer bend
the blue line up to speed you can go
ahead and start your printer so let's go
ahead and start it and see how it goes
you guys know it's that time of year
again when everyone is trying to spend
some time away from the office whether
it be vacations or just anything to get
into the Sun let me tell you taking
personal time being an IT is a huge
challenge because users and they always
