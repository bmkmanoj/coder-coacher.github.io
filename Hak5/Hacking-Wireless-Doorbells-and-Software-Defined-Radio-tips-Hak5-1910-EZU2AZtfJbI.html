software defined radio tips this time on
hack five this episode of hack five is
brought to you by domain.com hello and
welcome to hack five my name is darren
kitchen my name is Shannon
it's your weekly dose of Technol us I am
so excited to in this awesome episode of
hack 5 we are going to be taking a look
at some of the awesome feedback that
we've gotten over the last couple
episodes on hacking sub 1 gigahertz
gadgets using of course the rtl-sdr and
the yardstick 1 of course mm-hmm I'm
excited so we should just dive right in
I think so
so we got a question for Peyton can the
yardstick one be used with GQ rx or do
you need an RTL SDR for it so surprise
the yardstick one is not a
software-defined radio in the
traditional sense
it's a transceiver that operates on
common frequencies with the ability to
transmit and receive common modulation
techniques so more specifically it's
flashed with the RF cat firmware which
allows control through the interactive
Python shell or allows you to write your
own programs using the RF cat library
which is what the torch hat was using so
if you happen to know that the frequency
and the modulation you can use the
yardstick 1 to receive that data but not
necessarily through GQ rx you still have
to use Python right and for those not
familiar with GQ rx which is an awesome
bit of software it is a general
software-defined radio receiver that is
powered by the open source GNU radio
framework and it allows you to tune
various radios including hack RF the
u.s. RP and of course our very favorite
the our TLS you are actually have one
going right here and you can see I am
tuned to 94 point zero nine three and
just picking up a little low
let's see receiver options a little wfm
let me turn my volume up ya local radio
station local radio FM I was doing some
some lower frequency stuff earlier today
picking up strange the RTL SDR like the
one that he's using you mentioned is
pretty much our favorite rx device I
mean it's cheap it works so it's pretty
sweet and that works with GQ rx in the
same way that the yardstick one is our
new favorite TX device
our transmitting device and they're both
very low cost they both do a few things
very very well it's a great kind of way
to get like your toe tip into some of
this stuff because especially with the
Internet of Things and all of these so
many devices it's it's kind of your best
bet and then I would say the next step
it's probably a hack RF or a blade RF or
USRP or something like that but those
are a lot more expensive so just to like
to get your feet wet I always say start
with the $20 rtl-sdr and then if you
want to start transmitting there you go
hahaha we also got a fantastic question
from trans feminist autism who wrote
that the FCC is database is a very handy
thing however I would like to know or to
see how to figure out the frequency and
the modulation type without using the
FCC database basically hacking a device
you don't own and don't have physical
access to so if you don't know the
device that you're targeting it's going
to be a lot more difficult to audit so
let's take a look at a very basic
example so you want to do some security
research on the viability of doing a
replay attack against this Wireless
doorbell just like if you were to attack
a network or launch a spearfishing at
campaign the first order of business is
to learn everything that you can about
the target now since the receiver the
with the FCC ID is inside this locked
warehouse the only thing that we have to
go on is that the manufacturer turns out
is Honeywell so a good start would be to
search for models of Honeywell wireless
doorbells and see if we can't figure out
their operating frequencies that said if
the tools at our disposal just so happen
to be a yardstick one in an rtl-sdr
it's a pretty safe bet that unless the
doorbell is actually operating at a
yardstick one compatible frequency
namely 315 433 and the 900 megahertz
ranges then we're not gonna be able to
transmit on it anyway so in this case
it's just a matter of tuning to those
common frequencies and trying our luck
so with GQ rx here I'm going to tune our
rtl-sdr to those common frequencies and
ring the doorbell tried at 315
nothing tried at 433 nothing try it at
915 Eddie there we go at this point
really it's just a matter of redoing the
same steps that we did two weeks ago
yeah
with hacking those key fobs solely cool
I love it so now we are going to take a
break and thank our sponsor but when we
get back we're converting radio waves to
packets across the internet using cats
just like curvy cats
domain.com and Doc Club came to hak5
with a great idea build a club all about
learning stuff making things and having
fun so we've been hosting open houses at
the hack 5 warehouse through hack House
Club and with the help of domain.com and
dot club we've taken it to the next
level with a quadcopter arena of doom
from LAN parties drone racing and battle
arenas to 3d printing software-defined
radios and let's not forget barbecue
hacking is just plain better when it's
social dock club gets it and they are
the perfect social domain whether it's
IRC or clubs in RL it's all about coming
together and having fun so what better
domain to do it than a dock club it's
perfect because a dock club is
universally and globally understood so
if you're looking for the ultimate
social domain consider a dock club so
join us this summer in the San Francisco
Bay Area and bring your mini quadcopter
to the arena for drone battle dot Club
we're setting up the leaderboard so show
us what you've got
and what's your dock club let us know
and we'll share it with the hak5
audience that helps spread the word get
yours over at domain.com slash club
they're only $9.99 a year and there are
thousands of great domains available and
be sure to use the coupon code hak5 to
get 15% off and let them know we sent
you so when you think domain names think
domain.com we are back and before we go
I wanted to point out an awesome feature
that you might overlook in GQ rx and
that is the ability to actually stream
audio over UDP packets I would actually
tell you a joke about it but I'm afraid
that you want to get it so essentially
it's just a matter of clicking the
network config and ER the audio tab
entering a host import and then you'll
be able to pick up the audio stream as a
single channel 16-bit stream at 48
kilohertz sample rate there we go so get
this if I go ahead and enter in
scheana's IP address here it's under
audio the audio tab here
and then I hit hit Network options and I
can go ahead and enter in her IP address
and the UDP port number and it's really
just escape to get out of this menu
there we go
cool and you got my you got my IP
address yes okay it is I I believe so
it's dot one three four so okay so then
I can pick up the packets using one of
my favorite command-line tools netcat
which you all know from my hack tips so
netcat in ubuntu for example is NC so I
type in NC tak L and L is for listen tak
you for UDP and the port number and
you're using one two three four correct
yes okay so when I press ENTER I just
get a bunch of garbled a gook so as you
can see my terminal gets pretty much
filled up with a whole bunch of packets
yeah I think it's not that useful but as
you know in Linux it's all about piping
or passing that standard out from one
thing like netcat to something else like
for example a place so I'm gonna use
this tool called a play to actually play
the audio so once again I'll type in the
same thing NC Tech LTAC you one two
three four and then I'm gonna pipe it so
that long pipe letter nothing a play
tack are for rate and it's gonna be
forty-eight K tack F s sixteen
underscore L II tack T four type raw
taxi for channel and channel is going to
be one what did that F stand for that is
the type I want to say no the type is
raw F is format format yeah it is a
format that's not indeed so okay go
ahead so I press ENTER and hopefully you
can hear that through my microphone but
I'm basically getting the radio signals
piped through UDP so there we have it
I'm pretty much listening to Darren's
SDR through gqr x and netcat dude I love
netcat this is the beauty of Linux and
get this this technique can be useful
for all sorts of things not just you
know
it basically like imagine having
wireless remote nodes right we could
even have for instance you know a
Raspberry Pi or something running and
being able to send this over a wireless
network or the Internet so we get
analyzed into code remote signals from
things like well you know a dsb which
we've talked about IOT DS which we'll
talk about soon a is a PRS I mean it's
really limitless anyway there is so much
more cool stuff that you can do with GQ
rx which I always want to call GCHQ for
some reason but that is totally
something different so anyway check it
all out you can even control this over
the network it's really cool check it
out g QR x dot DK alright so if you guys
have any tips to share with us let us
know in the comments below or you can
always email us and stay tuned to next
week as we're gonna get into hacking
keyless entry systems with the rtl-sdr
and we're gonna bring you back with the
yardstick 1 yes also if you guys are
looking for either of those really
awesome devices and you want to support
hack 5 directly head on over to a cheeky
shop comm because your support actually
keeps us going yes we thank you so very
much for doing that thank you
and hey while you're at it check out the
show notes for this and all of the
previous episodes as well as all of our
other shows and all of our other
episodes the ways to follow us and all
that good stuff over at hak5
Oregon yay yes with that I am Darrin
kitchen I'm Shayna Morris trust your
techno list
she doesn't I don't know what to do with
it
just just smile and nod</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
