to you by gazelle the fastest and
easiest way to sell and recycle your
gadgets with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2011 and i'm here
with jim louderback ok Jim last year we
filled so many weird and wacky things
and there's I got to say there's even
more this year yeah this is a good year
for a lot of real experience stuff and
we've got a whole bunch of it here let's
just jump right into it okay because we
got the zillions of so let's start off
with this you ever find yourself out on
the road using your iPhone and then
suddenly you say to yourself gosh I need
a bottle opener I need a bottle of all
the time this is from this company head
case and I gotta show it to you cuz it's
a nap but you look it's a bottle opener
here and what happens is when you
actually open a bottle with it it's set
up so it can play a funny sound it can
start a song it can show an image 29 99
for this thing it's like ya head case is
what it's dope the only it's really
interesting is you know sometimes you
don't want to have a bottle opener on
your phone cuz it does kind of make you
look low rent so they've actually got an
ad on here that actually turns it into a
little bit of a belt clip well that's
perfect yeah this is the head k so
that's the first thing I found what you
got for me I found these things called
the city of cubes yep as it talks to
sorry it's thought i just opened
something these two few cubes are going
to cost $149 and they're coming Ellen
with all these are wirelessly connected
to this app store where you can download
different games and they will talk to
each other and you can play games with
each one let me also know where they are
right like if I stacking like this it's
kind of dis over this game it's kind of
like a like bejeweled or something where
you can destroy the different colored
blocks whenever I see each other and
then you can turn it upside down the
start of game
that's pretty cool something till two
different ways whoops and then you can
drop them too and you can drop them
because they're very very malleable and
they bounce so 149 bucks for one of
those huh um it's awesome that's pretty
cool and you can buy more cubes like the
classic board game but hey look I set it
up don't touch it don't touch it won't
fall over all right well we look at that
i want to show you this this is um like
an alien pig hello alien pig no one
alien tape what'd you do with this is
you don't have to have the bottle opener
version but you can stick your iPhone
and about you stick your iPhone in it
and it becomes a speaker system oh yay
that's really you know i love the pics
wow that's really really like that's
pretty good right that's definitely
weird um speakers here is the eyes and
you know this has the button so alien
pic it's about 50 bucks and you know
what if you don't have enough pigs in
your life Shannon this'll do it right
huh I love you Pig so you got something
animal-related for me yeah you know what
I think my angry birds cake cake your
pigs mama let's try come on why do you
guys so this is an angry birds for days
okay what's Marvel it's gonna be 15
bucks and it's coming out and made but
it's gonna be available in like we're
getting that angry bird dog alright wait
okay so here's what you do you get it
I'm gonna see if I can get Darren it's a
shooting what's me that is so cool so
loved it fifteen bucks and you can shoot
these things around all the time well
you know what we found a ton of other
stuff walking around the floor and
everywhere else so yeah you want to go
find some other do come on route of here
I'm bringing the pig me shouting I bet
my balls bounce of the near bomb what
yeah okay how do you do that okay so
these are the Spiros these little balls
their robotic balls controlled by your
iPhone and you just take hey hold it
hold your finger on the ball and move it
up see what's going backwards wait go oh
no you're going fast enough here we go
so mine's a little air look at mine I'm
pastas you are you are such a loser you
 in the corner there up you're
catching up Oh guys no no stop so these
things a hundred dollars when they come
out later this gear and they're really
kind of fun although they're a little
confusing now I'm stuck in the car haha
i won what all right your goal is faster
than my ball okay okay this is a Spearow
what you got for me let's go find right
okay so I found this weird and wacky
tool right here this plays your old
record so you can stick this little guy
on top of your records and I'll play
anything you want and you turn it on and
off with a little antenna right here so
i just turned it off that is so bizarre
bottom of it has the needle you think
that's good for your record I think so
well it's rubber so I don't think it'll
mess it up yeah so don't move the
records move the needle and it plays out
of a speaker on the top of it it runs
off a 9 volts it's less than 100 bucks
in it you can buy at a bratz Tokyo calm
right now alright that's a good one but
we feel like that's definitely where I
got this one out hey all right so yeah
where are you this is the sound a lot
like it's always like an anechoic
chamber in here I'm like I designed for
HD audio there's four different speakers
in here okay basically you lean back and
all your
yeah ik there and you self out here I
can't hear you what okay check it out

you know all my friends would think I'm
just nuts if I was carrying one of these
things around with me no I don't use the
pink one I think I'll use the yellow
ones okay this is almost like a banana
phone hello banana phone oh oh god now
I'm gonna have that stuck in my head
thanks a lot to You vana phone hey sorry
oh these are I just think it's a cool
idea to do you know your little headset
adapters and instead use a real phone
also look we've got um this is actually
a dock so you can stick your iPhone in
there it's got this cool little wireless
version Hey okay I like the little
engine that will antenna you know of the
toilet how many phones you think I

of old gadgets of course you do you come

the battery in the motor you buy okay so
give me a ride on z51 352 612 Unga dude
all right your own surface expensive
skateboard okay so this is really pretty
isn't it yo what is it it's USB jewelry
by memoria it's like 80 bucks online and
you can find it only on online you can't
find it in the US are those real
diamonds there's swarovski crystals way
I deal with them they're very very nice
crystals they're kind of like the
upscale version of crystals they're not
as exciting exert conia yes okay sort of
like that we were to me I thought they
were adorable for the lovely tech geeks
like myself who are very girly so
looking and these are like a weary like
a necklace or earrings these are
earrings you know I would wear the
necklace i seriously would consider
wearing the necklace okay oh weird you
know what I think anything you wear is
beautiful so far yeah anyway you must be
jewelry well you know what next you're
gonna have implanted USB why not Jim
alright alright what else so I know you
seen speakers of all sorts but this is a
speaker of original kind it's a flexi
speaker oh thanks oil
yeah it's correct when you change it
around my fix it kind of changes the
pitch to the frequencies fun mini noise
I'm this is it right here too right this
is it right here just a nice one I'll
see well it's going to do I'm sorry Jess
okay don't touch my junk there's
electric water so I think so oh yeah wow
that's an actual lsat tanker yeah for a
little one like this a little sample
unit is like 20 bucks and then you can
get all sorts of customized ones like
this crazy sailboat one right here and
they get really really loud no touching
ago I used to lick 9-volt battery you
would oh my gosh okay you need a stop
Jim all right go to so pale all right so
Shannon check this out this is the Air
Guard and what it does as you put it in
your car and let's say you're in a I
don't know two day traffic jam it'll
tell you when the air in your car is
really bad so you should change your air
conditioning so it does just a
circulated air about that air from
outside or vice versa at the air in your
car gets stale it says to bring the air
from outside and now fifteen dollars the
other thing that this toaster i think is
really cool is it detects alcohol ah so
if your friends bring your opens here
and you don't know it's gonna rat him
out how cool is that right that is
perfect i'm always needed something like
that yeah so you don't get caught with
one of those open container laws i think
for 15 bucks it's a little bit of piece
of moon that could save you it's an air
guard alright so that was some pretty
weird yeah no that's sweet um what is
that okay
what is this thing at the cyborg that's
for sure
hey call me
let's get out of your see you take a
look at other stuff oh man stay away
from those metal known about them to get
you going I don't know I was a fun tour
around the floor about you know what
we've got more stuff here like you know
the pig stain oh yes but if we now have
a friend for them give a friend for the
pig this is an alarm clock called the
talkie and what it does and it's going
off now what it does when you wet it
wakes up it starts bouncing around
coming around and until you catch it and
turn it off or throw it away it won't
actually turn off they've got this other
one which is called the claw key that
does the same thing when it goes off it
kind of roams around the room and you
got a little rat ass guaranteed to get
you out of bed oh yeah yeah that would
definitely get me out of it well this
one is a 40 bucks that one the thing
that I do over there was about 70 bucks
you know you gotta wake up yes you have
was better gather you have to wake up
eventually oh hey this is from Dynomax
and it's another little exercising
equipment but you're studying that up

lawnmower and it works your muscles in
your arms and it tilts sideways like

iphone so what you do is you take this
out to your grill you stick this in your
meat that you're cooking and it gives
you the temperature of your meat here
digital it's 72 degrees here at the
convention center but then you can walk
away and sit down and play with your
powerball or whatever and check your
meat as it gets you know what that could
be awesome for us gamers you don't want
