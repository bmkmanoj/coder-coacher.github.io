threads welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today
we're checking out cool application
launchers there are a lot of Handy ways
to open your applications in Windows
from the built-in quick launch menu to
some of the desktop add-ons personally I
like something fun and animated and
while on Windows I can't use known doggy
launcher there are a few to choose from
in the Windows OS first off is one of my
faves rocketdock this application
launcher is animated and smooth and it
features full customization you can even
add taskbar support which makes your
taskbar minimized windows into icons on
rocket dock it features multi-monitor
support a drag-and-drop interface which
is great auto-hide portability yeah you
know how I love my portability apps and
it's free so I'm gonna go ahead and
check that one out you can download
rocket dock over at rocketdock comm and
when you first download it it comes with
a whole bunch of built-in icons for my
computer or recycle bin and whatnot but
it's really easy to get new ones over
there you can just drag and drop so I
can drag and drop my stuff what stuff
folder over there just like that and I
can also even minimize windows and
chrome so I can choose this one for
example so that Chrome window will show
up in my Rock dock so it's very cool
it's very easy to customize it and
generally I like it it's nice and smooth
next up is Star docs object dock there
is an object plus for about 20 dollars
but I'm going to focus on the free ones
just to keep it fair isle chick dock
works about the same as rocket dock with
a very few differences
this one has some nice built-ins like
the five-day weather look out importing
your quick launch bar and the ability to
change the effects they offer lots of
customizations and options which I
huge fan of so I can go down here and
pull it up and it'll auto hide if I want
it to I'm gonna change see I'll look at
this and I'll enter my location I'll do
that one then I'll bring up the forecast
for my five days oh cool okay so it
gives me a lot of customizations but as
you can see it does lag a little bit so
I don't know that one might be my
favorite still thinking about it
the third one I'm checking out is true
launch bar this one is a little bit
different in a lot of ways first off
there is a trial version but after that
runs out you're supposed to be twenty
bucks to keep it yeah no thanks with
true launch bar you can customize a menu
for your test bar and drag and drop
icons into it you can also create
tooltips separators and sub menus so
let's check this one out now to open up
true launch bar you do have to go
through a little bit of a menu you have
to hit right-click on your toolbar go up
to toolbars and choose true launch bar
and then just hit okay so this last one
actually integrates into your taskbar
down at the bottom and you can add on
any kind of icons that you want to just
by dragging and dropping them so it's
kind of nice it's very simple and it's
it's integrated which is great it's
definitely different from the other two
but it has the same general idea after
the break I'll let you know my favorite
of the three but first here's a word

favorite has got to be rocket dock with
its smooth transitions and it's super
easy abuse I gotta say it's pretty
awesome
I've always liked that meet Mac
interface with the floating icon bar so
this is a nice add-on
and I didn't notice any difference in my
computer's performance while running it
on the other hand star dock object dock
was slightly jittery on my machine do
