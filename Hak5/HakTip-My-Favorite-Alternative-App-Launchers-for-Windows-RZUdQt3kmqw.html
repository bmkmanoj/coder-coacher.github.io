Jackthreads welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas i'm your host Shannon Morse and
today we're checking out cool
application launchers there are a lot of
handy ways to open your applications in
windows from the built-in quick lunch
menu to some of the desktop add-ons
personally I like something fun and
animated and while on Windows I can't
use gnome doggy launcher there are a few
to choose from in the windows OS first
off is one of my favs rocketdock this
application launcher is animated and
smooth and it features full
customization you can even add taskbar
support which makes your taskbar
minimized windows into icons on
rocketdock it features multi-monitor
support a drag-and-drop interface which
is great auto hide portability yeah you
know how I love my portability apps and
it's free so I'm going to go ahead and
check that one out you can download
rocketdock over at rockit calm and when
you first download it it comes with a
whole bunch of built-in icons for my
computer recycle bin and whatnot but
it's really easy to get new ones over
there you can just drag and drop so I
can drag and drop my stuff what stuff
folder over there just like that and I
can also even minimize windows and
chrome so I can choose this one for
example
so that chrome window will show up in my
rock doc so it's very cool it's very
easy to customize it and generally I I
like it it's nice and smooth next up is
star docs object doc there is an object
plus for about twenty dollars but I'm
going to focus on the free one just to
keep it fair object doc works about the
same as rocket dock with a very few
differences this one has some nice
built-ins like the five-day weather look
out importing your quick launch bar and
the ability to change the effects they
offer lots of customizations and options
which I Adam a huge fan of so I can go
down here and pull it up and it'll auto
hide if I want it to I'm going to change
CL look at this and I'll enter my
location we'll do that one update then I
will bring up the forecast for my five
days oh cool okay so it gives me a lot
of customizations but as you can see it
does lag a little bit so I don't know
that one might be my favorite still
thinking about it the third one I'm
checking out is true launch bar this one
is a little bit different in a lot of
ways first off there is a trial version
but after that runs out you're supposed
to be 20 bucks to keep it yeah no thanks
with true launch bar you can customize a
menu for your task bar and drag and drop
icons into it you can also create
tooltips separators and submenus so
let's check this one out now to open up
true launch bar you do have to go
through a little bit of a menu you have
to hit right click on your toolbar go up
to toolbars and choose true launch bar
and then just hit okay so this last one
actually integrates into your taskbar
down at the bottom and you can add on
any kind of icons that you want to just
by dragging and dropping them so it's
kind of nice it's very simple and it's
it's integrated which is great it's
definitely different from the other two
but it has
same general idea after the break I'll
let you know my favorite of the three

to be rocket dock with its smooth
transitions and it's super easy abuse I
gotta say it's pretty awesome I've
always liked that neat Mac interface
with the floating icon bar so this is a
nice add-on and I didn't notice any
difference in my computer's performance
while running it on the other hand
stardock object dock was slightly
jittery on my machine do you guys have a
