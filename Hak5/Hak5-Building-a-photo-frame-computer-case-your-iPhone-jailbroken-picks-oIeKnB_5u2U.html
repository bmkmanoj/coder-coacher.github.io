so back back to us
hello welcome hak5 my name is Darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse and this
is your weekly dose of Technos because
we've got a fantastic show for you guys
it's for you I'm playing with noise
again no come on snubz it's gonna great
it's gonna be great
we're gonna we're gonna be building this
mod the wall not me know who gave you
that well you're not allowed to have
power tools you know you hurt yourself
Dave went on a business trip so I don't
have adult supervision but I found them
great that's awesome well tune in later
we're gonna be talking about how you can
take to Ikea picture frames and put
together some beautiful smart yeah yeah
I will be talking about will we get a
lot of feedback so I was like whoa
feedback user picks for the top
jailbroken iPhone apps mm-hmm a lot of
cool jailbroken iPhone stuff you can do
you can actually run Metasploit on one
yeah mm-hmm you and all your friends can
get two packet lovin on speaking of
friends we got some friends here from
all over the world
it's Cody Christian and Alex Ackerman
how are you guys it's awesome to have
some people in the studio as it were
fine so what brings that San Francisco
their trip and he came over and we're
hitting six different cities and four
weeks across the US and our first city
who started off was in here what's here
and I said brother uh and having fun and
visiting all these cool place so it's
like a like we blogging or swearing and
everything across America pretty much
yeah heaps of stuff going up and with
made special site to be able to collate
all that into one website and say get to
a 2011 coming down to Australia and I'm
going to visit you okay buddy well all
right we should probably get right into
it it's time for the hacker headlines so
watch out Ruby and Django you may not be
the only scripting languages in town
this for your own web server this week
more Yoshi Kazumi of php.net posted an
art of save for a built-in web server in
the PHP binary while this wouldn't
replace Apache as the web server choice
from major deployments cutters wanting
to get a development environment up and
running quickly would benefit from not
having to write an HTTP httpd.conf file
that's the one the daemon yeah you know
I hope that happens but you know it's
just in RFC right now so we'll see I
check that you got to be careful if
you're on Android because 21 of the most
popular free apps on the marketplace
have been injected with group kids and
we published Android police comm is
reporting right now
guitar solo light for example was
republished as super guitar solo and
added with new amazing functionalities
such as secretly publishing your IMEI
and user ID among other data to a server
in Fremont here in California right well
Google's already pulled the publisher
from the marketplace and the uses remote
kill switch to go ahead and remove the
apps from the devices but that wouldn't
necessarily cover any additional
payloads which may have been downloaded
from the 20,000 some odds on the phones
then Georgia warned us about this so
TorrentFreak reports that 70% of
respondents to a Danish poll say that
they find piracy socially acceptable 7
out of 10 said that it's acceptable
about 20% say that's a it's completely
acceptable no matter what and 30%
replied that it's completely not
acceptable
although most that took the poll say
that piracy is okay they mostly agreed
that selling those downloaded goods for
profit are completely not okay I'm a
little surprised to see how so many
people think that it's alright to
download you know you can't pirate hack
5 because it's Creative Commons yeah I'm
just gonna put that out there check it
out are you a fan of the hack 5
motherboard casemod it's a motherboard
box turned into a case well Asus might
be or also saw raíces might be a fan of
it as well because the Taiwanese
manufacturer showed off recently a
concept packaging box that contains a
that doubles as a mini ATX motherboard
case allowing additional components such
as a hard disk an optical drive to gonna
be installed and I'm just gonna go ahead
and predict it right now thermaltake is
probably gonna do something like a
server a wall-mounted server case here
real soon yeah probably going that out
there so check this out last year a 40
year old computer specialist hacked into
an advertising server and made a large
plasma screen huge plasma screen off a
highway in Moscow played 20 minutes of
porn he faces up to five years in jail
this week the man pled guilty to hacking
into an advertising server and having a
large plasma screen in Moscow played 20
minutes of porn citizens of Moscow the
Moscow nians the people they were yeah
they were porn okay they've been warned
okay and at this point I think it's time
to go ahead and find out about your
favorite pics it's time for the roundup
I love those little tools that help out
with everyday tasks I have talked about
motion-detecting webcams in the past but
here are a few of the user picks so
first off Gary writes if you want
something sophisticated that runs in
Linux try zone minder zone minder is a
professional quality free motion
detection program for webcams and other
cameras it does everything y'all can
does plus more in a bun - there are
install instructions and everything is
in the repositories know to prevent
false triggers deucey clouds passing the
Sun during daylight set up an exclusion
zone that's pretty cool another note
this program uses MySQL Apache PHP and
may be difficult to set up initially but
it's well worth the effort another user
sent in thought I'd let you know that
vitamin D is the best webcam software
that there is the ability ability to
recognize motion detection between
humans and animals seriously that's
awesome so what little gems are rocking
your world hit us up we'll share up tips
at hack 5 org and now a special word
from our sponsor if your assets
administer you know that SSL is crucial
for securing ecommerce transactions
online forums email corporate internets
really any kind of private data and if
you're looking for SSL I really think
you should consider domain.com because
they've got just the ticket domain coms
thought SSL fault SSL 1-2-3 has been
around for years it builds trust because
they're one the longest SSL providers a
trusted name and it's really easy the
spot SSL 1-2-3 is all you need to
encrypt your site it's got the strongest
level of encryption and the verification
seriously happened is nearly immediately
we got ours in just a few hours and it's
also really affordable if you use the
coupon code hak5 you can get your SSL
cert for less than 40 bucks a year and
that's really the best price on the web
for the thought SSL 1-2-3 product bottom
line if you needed SSL and frankly we
all do go ahead and give domain coms
thought SSL one two three
try and I got to say thank you for
domain.com for supporting hak5 from
sponsoring us for over a year now in
supporting hak5 Oregon one of their
virtual private servers get 15% off at
domain.com when you check out with
coupon code hak5 your next big idea
starts at domain.com
as you guys know there's two things
snubz loves hold aside from portable
apps of course and that's jailbroken
iphone apps and your feedback so we
found a way to put them both together
and something we're like to me to call
the snubz report yeah yeah that's right
so yeah we got tons and tons of feedback
when i did that i phone jailbroken apps
episode and you guys sent me a ton of
them so i just wanted to wrap him up
great so what did you find so first off
the max gamer he uses JavaScript
anywhere whenever he needs something to
do on his iPhone and lets him hone his
HTML skills and play with his web design
and it's a simple app for web
development and programming that lets
you work on programming JavaScript HTML
CSS pretty much whenever you have ID on
your so you can practice especially if
you have classes on this stuff this
could really help you and it's free and
it's not a jailbroken one but it's
available in the App Store so what does
that go ahead it can get it it's called
JavaScript anywhere JSA any nice what
other kind of fun this is did we get
package backup
well PKG backup it backs up repo sources
and cydia apps and saves them as an info
file in contacts have to restore it's no
problem you go to cydia download the app
again and then sync your contacts from
my astute itunes and press restore in
the package backup app so this read
downloads all of your sources and your
apps so it's really good if you have a
lot of apps installed and no time to
keep track of them it is $4.99 though
and it is available in city that's
awesome though i love the idea of
keeping config data in contacts because
contacts or sync yeah i actually there's
a contact on my phone and I've had this
through my pocket pcs my palm so I know
blackberries
it's my half-life original half-life CV
key I added it as a contact and like 98
or whatever whatever came out great way
to keep see the keys yeah okay on to the
next one Mike thank you Mike he sent in
another VNC one you know that I don't
love you that's head from my iphone to
the computer control your iPhone from
your computer bean see is another one
it's a little bit faster faster and it
does a quick toggle into the SP
settings and it's free well we like free
oh yes I like free next up it's MC
cleaner there you go it lets you
anonymously block calls and create a
blacklist or whitelist whichever you
prefer
you have choices to have the phone keep
ringing go straight to your voicemail
hang up or accept the calls the phone
won't ring watts blocking a call and
there's a 15-day trial which is awesome
but it's around twelve dollars total in
Cydia you know you can do that with a
Google Voice you can set that up you can
have different voicemails for different
people it's great handy yeah I file is
the next one it's a very useful file
manager and viewer it gives you fast
navigation through the iPhone system to
view your files you can view movies
sound text HTML even PDFs and zip files
really zip files yeah that's interesting
files can be sent as email attachments
straight from your phone or edited and
bookmarked as well as uploaded straight
from the I file built-in web server it's
four dollars plus a free trial at the
beginning nice well come on where that
were the hacker ones though cuz you know
I'm like the hacker ones this one is for
you yeah yep it's called peer knee pro
and it's a network sniffer mm-hmm yes
it's native ARP spoof err yes this can
be used to sniff usernames passwords
data traffic running over your wireless
network and there's a new version with a
graphical user interface and it's very
very friendly it's a dollar ninety-nine
in Syria but I also found out that
there's peony which is the basic version
and it's free yes
so I don't know what the difference is
between Pro and the regular peony but
yeah oh yeah the GUI is what's up we've
been talking about command-line sniffers
for Linux but you know when it comes to
the phone like command lines not
happening unless you're like rockin
droid we can pull out the keyboard
thingy with my iPhone with a keyboard
Wi-Fi sync this wirelessly syncs with
iTunes from wherever you are whenever
you are whoever I don't care Wi-Fi sync
enables wireless syncing with iTunes at
the touch of a button never go looking
for the USB cable again because we know
that us geeks have way too many USB
cables and yeah I always lose them it's
something like that I my Droid recently
I said of an ftp server I'm Android
so I could copy music to the SD card
because I couldn't find the SD card the
USB cable so only thing is it's 999 oh
so but it's one time so it's okay and
it's available in the city a store
that's so cool that there's a store
that's a whole marketplace if people can
make money on apps that aren't approved
by Apple I love that yeah I do too like
anymore
Edie writes I use blue ever blue ever is
an iOS application which enables
Bluetooth dial-up networking support in
client mode for your iPad iPhone or iPod
Touch I blue ever has its own Bluetooth
and network stacks and you can connect
your iPad or whatever to a Bluetooth
dial-up networking an able enabled phone
and then access the mobile network via
the phone's connection so you can share
your phone's data plan to your iPad
phone touch whatever and save your money
to buy an iPad 2 or whichever iPad you
want and make your iPod Touch be more
like an iPhone 5 bucks yeah you're gonna
love this you're that laptop you just
bought it's got bluetooth so go ahead
and get your tether on yeah or the other
way around you know I could set a
tethering on mine with Bluetooth and
then you could you know cuz you're on 18
TC or GSM and I'm on like what CDMA so
you know if you can't you have no tubes
you can tether to me that's the same
inet was another one from Edie it's this
non-jailbroken app it's 399 and it's a
network scanner it's a great tool to
find out what devices are connected to
your network or the hunter you can never
find yes
or the maybe the hotel Wi-Fi network say
what's on there yeah
fun times private subnet it's no fun you
know yeah a lot of fun with that we've
had fun with that but we're not gonna go
that now
okay now this one touches my heart
because I always find these awesome Daft
Punk themes on Cydia but none of them
are exactly what I want and Nick wrote
in just following up to your jailbroken
iPhone app segment I found this site
called code themed which makes it really
easy to make your own winterboard themes
you should check it out hmm Thank You
Nick nice so you could have you could
have like a combination of all the
things when you have that tone that you
really like where it's like Navi good
okay
that's my favorite who doesn't love Navi
we had so many more people send in app
recommendations for me and honestly I
got so many that I couldn't list all of
them good well they can where can they
hit you up they can hit me up at
feedback at hack 5 org or sometimes at
hack 5 org awesome we may have another
roundup in the future so you know you
guys see all this good stuff send it by
Stubbs she does a great job of packing
you all together so we can bring it to
you and now I think it's time to
transition over to talking about the
crack the code challenge do you have
what it takes to compete and to crack
the code challenge brought to you by go
to a6 express test your skills in our
private lab network right here and

let's face it technology is beautiful
seriously look at this motherboard the
countless engineers that it took to make
something this beautiful work it's just
phenomenal why isn't it on display I
mean we put our loved ones and photo
frames and put them on the wall why not
our computers and that's what we're here
to do today because you know while the
cardboard box motherboard box that kind
of comes with it
mod was a lot of fun and it's a
inexpensive way to get a server going
and in fact I think even Asus greeted
with me on this in fact it was even
written up in a recent life hacker
article so that was pretty cool about
you know taking your components just
popping them in a cardboard box it
really doesn't give it nearly as much
justice as doing something like this
I've just gone ahead and taken one of
the clusters of our proxmox machines and
this is an i-5 with four gigs just
chilling here in this beautiful picture
frame and I've gone ahead and added some
accent lights change some colors around
and put it inside of two picture frames
and we're going to be doing that today
it's a pretty simple mod but it's got a
stunning effect and let's just go ahead
and dive right into it so let's check
out what's inside over here so I've put
hinges that's the word so I've got these
cabinet hinges on here and it's really
nice cuz they snap close and they're
black and they match the decor I could
go with something like a piano hinge but
I really like how this matches the whole
theme of this so this is actually two
picture frames and if we open it up here
we can see inside we have the
motherboard mounted on the back panel
which has been painted matte black and
we've got all of our run our wires kind
of trimmed up all nice with some nice
loom and all going down to this bundle
here tied up with a two and a half inch
hard drive and a small as we can get
power supply there's actually a 1u power
supply it's really nice because it sits
flush in this box and then I've just lit
it with some white cold cathodes and I
think it looks really nice and then that
bundled down there and then when this
all closes
it's kind of hidden and tucked away
behind the gnat
so let's go ahead and get started now
these picture frames we're 20 bucks
apiece on sale over at IKEA
they are the RIBA so you can go ahead
and pick those up cheap I mean seriously
the whole cost of this project is about
what you would pay for your standard
fare computer case but who wants one of
those when we can have something nice on
the wall so I'm just gonna get right
into it and get these bad boys open and
what we're gonna do today is build the
basis of that case mod and then next
week I'm sure you guys will have plenty
of suggestions for you know how we could
make this better and I will be doing
some follow-up where we're going to
pretty it up and put in some some nicer
vents and do some better cable
management and pretty it up some but
alright so we got our first picture
frame just a matter of getting the back
piece off and we're gonna get rid of
this paper and this is the map that
comes with it it's white and what we've
already gone ahead and done taking that
and painted it red
you know any color will do but I think
that something you know bright and vivid
like red is totally gonna especially
with this set so I'm gonna go with red
and we've painted this back panel here
black and then our back piece we're
going to need to drill because this is
what we're going to mount our
motherboard to now I've already gone
ahead and painted it matte black in fact
I have another one of these that I
already have drilled the holes for the
motherboard and so we can see if we just
take on motherboard here and this guy is
just going to line up mm-hmm that lines
up perfectly so we're just going to use
this piece here as a template if we
hadn't already made a template it's
simply a matter of measuring out your
motherboard so that you can Center this
one of the tricks to doing that is to
take a tape measure from corner to
corner on this square piece here and
draw an X and then set it in there and
that's an easy way to Center it on this
and then we'll just take our marker pop
them in the screw holes here make some
marks drill some holes since I already
have a template and no I'm not going to
get hurt
all right I know nopal I'm not gonna
drill into the table this time pretty
sure I'm not gonna drill into the table
this time
that's pretty enough cool the risers
that came with your motherboard or with
your case aren't necessarily gonna work
in this scenario so what I've gone ahead
and done is just get some machine bolts
and nuts and we're just gonna slip those
through the other side and then screw
the nuts on and we will have a mounted
motherboard and now our motherboard is
just gonna sit right in here and if my
measurements were correct the first two
okay I got three I got a four my
measurements were correct
all right and then now we have just a
few nuts to put on these forgetting
something important this is one of the
things that I wanted to do ahead of time
that was put black Ethernet in because
it just so happens that the way that
this all lays out perfect with the power
supply and everything is that I will
have the hard drive and the power supply
here I guess what you would call them
the bottom of the motherboard whereas
all of my i/o is over at the top and
really since it's a server the only
thing I need coming out of here is
Ethernet you know so it's going to get
its power down here it's disk here but
that Ethernet needs to go somewhere
that's not a board with Wi-Fi built in
although that would be a lot prettier
because then we'd only have one cable
going to it
maybe I should have considered that so
in order to get the the Ethernet plugged
into the Nick here rather than snake
around the entire bezel what I'm gonna
do is actually plug it in and then loop
it behind the motherboard and then just
have it go down the same place as our
power now the board can bend a little
I'll just squish this down it'll work
I'll make it yeah that's good and now
it's time to put the rest of the
components in so those really don't
involve a whole lot just our motherboard
or I'm sorry our hard drive here and our
power supply got a lot of questions
during the build about this power supply
so I will let you know it is an AP AP II
VI a and AP a-- is an ITX tak ap-250 W
and it's 1u which is what's the hotness
about this what do they say measure once
cut twice is that what it is is it the
other way dang it alright in this case
what I'm gonna do is put my motherboard
on the bottom right here when I'm
looking at it this way and that is going
to give me just enough room to plug in
means to the motherboard
yeah you can't see it because I've got
heat shrink and a nice loom around this
but what I've done is actually snip this
and use some wire to extend the
additional 12 volt power scanner goes
onto the motherboard said I could
actually get my motherboard to sit down
here so we're gonna have to go ahead and
do that now oh no in case of infestation
use this crowbar where's the crowbar go
snobs look out
it will work I mean if you want we can
do some cut points because this is gonna
be tedious here for another couple of
minutes all right this isn't the most
pretty solution whatsoever but I've just
gone ahead and taken some extra wire and
put some crimps on the ends you feel
about this a million different ways it's
like honestly if I had some wire nuts
I'd probably just use that right now or
you know you could do the thing where
you twist them together and you wrap it
in some electric tape or some heat
shrink and you're probably wondering why
am I not doing heat shrink right now and
that's because later on I think next
episode when we do a follow-up on this
and pretty it up we're using some really
cool loom that's gonna make this really
sexy so there's no point in doing all of
that right now because it's really just
gonna go over you know the whole thing
and that should look pretty good so I
got my last one to do here and really
I've just cut the yellow and black wires
and I'm not using the same exact colors
that one doesn't look too good but yeah
just these little crimp guys put the
yellow one in there with the red one the
like oh no and then they're hanging out
in the little blue guy the blue guys
like hey what's going on and then you
like crushing down and then they're best
friends like the blue and the yellow and
the red they just they just became like
BFF they don't really have a choice in
the matter and there we go we have
extended our cable in fact I've extended
it quite a bit more than we needed to
but that's fine all right well let's get
to mounting this now there's a couple of
ways that we could go about this as we
see our ATX or just regular ol
motherboard power that sits in there
just fine we've extended our additional
12 volt so that's gonna plug into one of
these this way that is right down here
there we go
ooh you know what I've got enough now
that I could if I wanted to potentially
go under the motherboard yeah that'd
look pretty good it's less wires going
everywhere hmm do I want to do that yeah
let's do it all right there we go I
think that looks pretty good we're gonna
set our power supply here and our hard
drive over here I think we've got just
enough on this molex to reach right
across and then we'll tidy up this SATA
cable so you're probably thinking how
are we going to fix these now we do have
of course the screws on the bottom of
the hard drive here we don't however
have that option here on this power
supply now there's a few ways we can go
about this we can either use like
double-sided sticky tape and this stuff
really strong but what I think is
actually stronger and we've used plenty
here on hack 5 this industrial velcro
and I love this stuff seriously it's
used for everything you don't believe me
look at any of my cellphones they've got
the you know the loop side I'm sorry
yeah they've got the loop side on just
about every device because I've got the
hook side on my motorcycle and I use it
to like you know run the Google Maps on
my phone and then have that next to my
tachometer good stuff all right and
we're going to stick the sticky side
down and the loop part on the PSU
and I just want to make sure that I have
enough room on the other side for the
bezel that will be sitting right here on
top that we are eventually going to cut
into so that we can actually get to the
80 power supply power cord thing here as
well as the vent so and I want to make
sure that I do not cover up this tiny
little breathing hole here on my little
Scorpio blue Western Digital 250 gig all
right now with the velcro that's gonna
make ease these things a little easier
for testing later on if I ever need to
for instance remove this hard drive
reimage it something like that I haven't
actually screwed it in here ok so this
is the back piece we now have everything
mounted and as you can see this is not
going anywhere everything's solid even
though it's just velcroed and screwed in
I'm feeling pretty good about that so
it's time to go ahead and mount the
whole mess so we take our first picture
frame and we're going to locate the side
that has these little metal tabs and
that is just going to go ahead and slide
on over top of this and then we're gonna
okay great put our Ethernet hanging out
here because we will eventually have it
coming out a hole that we're going to
drill there so with the first frame the
only parts that we've used are the
actual well I guess you'd call it the
frame of the frame the backbut we have
painted matte black and mounted all of
our components on and that little inside
piece that kind of holds it all together
with this one what we're going to do is
discard the back we can say goodbye to
that
and this and simply replace this white
one with one of our pre-painted red ones
I just push these down to hold it in
place and already you can really see
this coming together we just set that on
top look at that isn't that beautiful
it's gonna look something like that you
can pick these up at just about any
hardware store this is just hardware for
a cabinet so it's just a regular cabinet
hinge and what's nice about this is they
snap closed like and they closed really
tight in fact you can see that it's
somewhat inside there's a nice spring in
there so I was originally thinking that
I would need these and in addition to
them I was looking at say for instance
picking up one of these latching locks I
don't actually think I need to use the
latching lock whatsoever because it just
it holds it so well now maybe if I were
to put these latches on the side so that
when I open up the frame it opens from
the side then I might need a latch so
that you know it stays square but the
way that I've actually set this up is
I'm going to be putting these on the top
so our server actually opens up like
this and that way everything stays
square and they don't need to worry
about any sort of latches so for this
part this is the tough part because I
actually need to hold all of this down
while I screw all of this in so our top
is where the i/o is I'm gonna line all
of these up here and then I'm just using
some of these guys and clamp this down
okay all right I'll think these grips
off there we go we have motherboard
power supply hard drive and well an
Ethernet cable stuffed in there for
right now mount it inside of two picture
frames one with the glass in the front
and the nice painted mat and the one in
the back with our board painted matte
black and the back piece but no glass no
matte there and yeah it looks pretty
good this is a good start for this
project I'm realizing that just shooting
this is running long and also there's so
much more to get going with it
for example talking about some lighting
and also talking about ventilation and
other things like that so we're just
going to have to make this a two-parter
and tune in next week when we're going
to put some loom on here and we're going
to tidy everything up make it super
pretty
come on if you're gonna hang a beautiful
piece of art that is a motherboard on
the wall you're gonna want it to be
pretty and I'm going to want to hear
about your feedback so go ahead and be
sure to email feedback at hak5 org let
us know what are your thoughts what
would you do differently with this
project what are you looking forward to
seeing us doing with this project and I
looked toward to hearing from you guys
so we'll be back in just a bit last
week's trivia question was in character
it is programs Jared I'm sorry but
you're disqualified from the trivia and
you can't win yeah sorry you have to do
it at 5 and 3 but if you guys want to
win some hack 5 swag you can go over to
hack 5 daughter slash trivia and answer
this following question in war games
awesome moving this character gives his
name to the first computer game that
Lightman finds hmm we'll be right back
no no I don't care you go over there
we'll be right back after a brief word
from our sponsor
join modding wizard Ben Heck and friends
as they build and modify a host of
amazing community inspired creations the
Ben Heck show is brought to you
exclusively by element14 the online
store in community for electronics
design engineers in the latest episode
Ben builds a portable workbench
now that just about wraps up this
episode of hack 5 but you know we've got
a couple of things to get to before we
get out of here
it sounds Jetport 25 actually it's not
checking for 25 it gets to be 110 if it
was pop3 or IMAP I don't know prymatt
she had saved me a trip line thank you
for your email trimline rights and how
do you plan your episodes can we help
many hands make light work I think one
of the best things about your show is
that it reveals resources and methods
relevant to my interests thank you yeah
this is this is how we do it we are the
snubs report and then after that we've
got crack code challenge and then
there's one of those things that we do
the case by like paper no I mean we also
actually coordinate by Google Docs
Google Docs are awesome for the trivia I
do and I gotta say it really helps some
people email like feedback a hack five
words tips a hack five because even
though they all go to the same place to
all of us it's nice to have those
filters to say tips headlines feedback
you know and yeah it's great that we can
get you guys involved so thank you so
much to all of you who write in all of
the time you guys are a big big part of
the show yes
Garrick writes hey Darin and the team
can you do a segment on how you did the
multiple screen setup I would like to do
a four monitor setup and show a snake or
cube scrolling so that I can show it off
at my next house party we're actually
not quite done with this we got four
across here right now we actually have
two more LCDs sitting there waiting we
just picked up where'd they go Paul
these ridiculous articulating arms or
whatever we're gonna be building out
something pretty sick for you guys yeah
so we got all these visa mounts and we
can have like monitors on arms going
everywhere right they're all just kind
of running IRC right now and they're all
just running off one of these boxes I
know it's in a computer case I lose my
geek cred right but it's really just a
matter of these are the cards were about
to upgrade them to of just putting in
multiple cards because now at the PCIe
it's not like before when you have like
you know your good card was on an AGP
port and then you'd have like you know
some PCI cards that really suck these
PCIe cards you get a motherboard that's
got two three four ports and it's just a
matter of plugging multiple cards in
and if you're running Windows it's you
know 90% of the time there's gonna be
automatically recognized right-click on
your desktop properties whatever you're
gonna see in or right screen resolution
you're gonna see them there
it's I found personal experience it's
best to stick with Moulton one
manufacturer so like all for instance
all of these are Nvidia cards rather
than a mix of Nvidia and ATI as far as
Linux is concerned I've never had a
problem with any of the Debian variants
like Ubuntu or Mint recognizing them and
playing nice I've never had to like you
know manually configuring xorg accom for
any of that it's pretty much built-in
you do have to kind of drive them around
so that they logically make sense but
yeah some that yeah just plug some cards
in and see what happens it's really the
easiest way to go that's cool misty
right good show can't wait to see what
you do with the cluster any any wave
reason I'm mailing is this is a cold
packet sniffer it's called TC pick
another awesome Pakistan tried to throw
this into the lineup because he puts his
like for example you can sniff IRC
traffic by doing TCP attack I at the 0
for your interface and then quote port
six six six seven and then you know
tacky I'm assuming Eve 1000 is for 1000
packets and I'm not sure what yr is
gonna be taking a look at a TC pic later
that's because yeah that's great now we
got TCP dump T shark which is the
Wireshark equivalent and there's so many
great packet sniffers for the command
line and you know you couple those with
the previous hack tip about screen and
that's a great way to do some debugging
because you've got a top screen that's
doing your packet sniffing and then your
bottom screen you're doing your
debugging and then you issue the command
and immediately at the top of the screen
you can see what's going on it's great
and then no fussing with window
management crappity crap I don't I'm me
I'm so stoked about this stuff because I
am Linux all the way I mean I just got
this new machine and well we've been
booting while we've been doing this
episode I've actually been building a
black bun to box so I am now on black
yeah are you gonna put black fun too on
yours as well I have a four full report
for you guys oh you know it kind of like
wow what does it come with dude it's got
you know information gathering network
mapping bone
ability identification penetration
testing privilege escalation mittens
access radio analysis VoIP digital
forensics reverse engineering and
miscellaneous very nicely organized yeah
I got a say so misty also mentioned that
there's lots of other cool stuff and she
has curses support on Linux and they're
using it on debian 6.0 no on to the tech
the last photo of the week was of this
