5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to active the show will we break
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today we are checking out end
if a command inside of nmap and also
some of your tips so first off and if
this is a tool that allows you to
compare to xml output files made by nmap
and you can see the differences between
a couple of different outputs
so remember episode 103 that is where I
showed you exactly how to output to an
XML file and you can even see how to
look at it on your command line to use
it all you have to type in is ENDIF and
then whatever your xml files are called
so i created two earlier and i'm not
going to show you how to do those cuz we
already showed you in a past episode so
you do test one XML and then test two
XML or whatever the name of your two
files are you hit enter and you get some
interesting output so the minus sign
that you see on some of these lines
indicate the first of the two files so
if I scroll up just a little bit I'll
see that the first of the files is test
1 the minus sign is four point seven
four that is test one so all of those
are for test one and then test two is
the plus signs so the plus sign is for
the second file that you did now you'll
see all the differences between these
two so if there is a difference you'll
see - and map for the first one plus and
matfer the second one and so on and so
forth now you can also use tack v4 for
verbose with end dip as well if you want
to do that it would look like such and
diff tack the
test one XML and test two dot XML hit
enter and it'll show you a verbose
output now with ten V I'm not gonna see
much of a difference with these two
commands that I put in the test 1 and
test 2 files because there isn't much of
a verbosity difference after I do that
now if you want to you can also type an
ENDIF tactic XML and then your two files
this is going to show you the XML output
on your screen and then you can save
that information into a new XML file if
you wanted to you can also mess with a
scan while it is scanning as well this
was just a little tip that I wanted to
add into today's episode for example I
could type in nmap 10 dot 73 dots 1 dot
0 / 2 for
so a couple of the different options
that you can add in while you have a
script running in the background are you
could choose let me run that again you
can choose V to show you a verbosity
increase while it is running you can
also hit D to show you debugging you can
type P as well to see packet tracing or
you can hit a question mark and that
will actually show you a help menu for
all of those different options now this
is called runtime interaction and you
can see all that crazy information going
on in the background now as soon as it
is done you'll have plenty of
information to see once you are finished
now we'll be right back with your
feedback after the break the hack shop
attacked Five's premier store for all of
your pen testing needs including one of
my favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard it can type scripts into
a computer ridiculously quickly like
this week's favorite from den u Deven
this is a very simple FTP script that
you can use for Windows boxes now of
course we couldn't do this show without
your support so we would like to thank
you with something special use the
coupon code snubz with any order from
the hack shop for your very own sign
hack tip stickers so cool and thank you
so much for supporting the show we're
back in now it's time for a couple of
really good tips from you guys from our
viewers so thank you so much first off
for sending in your submissions let's go
ahead and start with Matt he says I
figured I would point out the tool and
cat which typically comes with an map
from the repositories the nice thing
about this version is that it has two
new options tact app receive-only and
tactic send only they are useful for
one-way transfers since by default
netcat is two ways the thing is that
even if net cat is finished receiving or
sending data it will stay still keep the
connection open for the other direction
with the options mentioned above once
the file is sent or received it will
shut down so that you don't have to hit
control-c either just thought you might
find that useful and I did thank you so
much Matt I know we've been done with
the net cat series for a little while
now but
hey I really like your feedback so thank
you so much and I know not everybody is
caught up with the soap show so I
appreciate it and our next one comes
from Sergey he said that you had trouble
getting DNS resolution to work when you
were scanning your 10 dot 73 Network yes
that is true I had so much trouble with
that and it still happens with this
luckily he says that there is nothing
wrong with your Linux laptop if you were
to use your ISPs DNS server it wouldn't
be able to resolve these addresses since
the ten dot X block of IPs is a private
range and can only exist behind a
firewall on a home or a business network
none of the public DNS servers would
know what to do with ten dot X addresses
another way to resolve IP address would
be to use local host files which would
be in slash et Cie or Etsy slash host on
Linux this is actually the first place
where your computer looks to resolve an
IP address you would have to type each
existing host IP in your ten dot 73
Network and its host name if there is
nothing in slash Etsy slash host your
laptop moves on to DNS servers to get
name resolution DNS servers are
specified in slash Etsy slash resolve
Conville
but it doesn't look like you are running
your own internal DNS server on the hack
five network so the look up on your ISP
server which you probably get from DHCP
fails and nmap only shows IPs but no
names thank you so much Sergey that was
really helpful I was very confused as
far as why my DNS server was looking up
everything correctly and that totally
points it out for me so it completely
makes sense and I'm surprised I didn't
think about that first so thank you and
our third message comes from do moot t6p
and I probably totally pronounced that
wrong but you have a crazy screen name
so thank you anyway he said I wanted to
point out that the service column will
show a name based on the port so if you
change your SSH server to port 666 and
map will show that doom is running I'm
really proud for discovering this myself
after an hour of searching why my Linux
has a Windows service that's awesome I
love Easter eggs thank you so much for
setting those different pinpoints in of
course you can always let me know what
you think this is the end of our network
at being a segment in series so I want
to know what you guys thought you can
email us tips at hack 5 org and I'm
going to move on next week - mopti go
now I know that you guys have probably
checked this out in the past if you
haven't yet well I haven't either so I'm
really looking forward to checking out
and going through everything from how
does the GUI work to how to collect my
own data yay it's gonna be super fun so
make sure to stick around and check out
that series with me here on hack tip and
be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you every
week to trust your techno west</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
