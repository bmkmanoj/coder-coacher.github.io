by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5
it's uh season 10 episode 1 and I'm your
host Darren kitchen flying solo once
again if you've seen or let us know yeah
really use snubz up in here anyway we
have way more great stuff from Def Con
so I hope you guys enjoyed this week
we're definitely looking forward to also
coming back next week hopefully with
Shannon and a bunch of great awesome
changes all in the works for season 10
so kind of stick with us enjoy the DEF
CON experience as we did and oh and of
course if you haven't already got
involved in the crack the code challenge
our last bit of it will be this thursday
so head over to hack 50 work / challenge
and help us find snubz bring back season
10 yes all right that's it Paul once
again I have the great pleasure being
here at Def Con 19 joined by Moxie
Marlinspike Moxie how are you good do we
love your work especially SSL strip that
like really turned some heads yeah
deadly every time yeah yeah so it's been
it hasn't gotten any better though I
mean as far as like the deadliness is
concerned tell me is like what has what
has changed with ssl since that tool
came out well you know not much you know
that the people have been promoting this
thing called h st s strict Transport
Security as a response to as a sales
trip but it hasn't really gained a lot
of traction it's not in all the browsers
yet and most sites don't have it enabled
you know additionally lately I've been
talking about this property called trust
agility
and what I've been trying to do is look
at SSL and the context in which it was
originally conceived and even think
about how things have changed over time
to sort of you know fit that into the
the picture of you know what are the
problems that that have emerged well how
did we get to where we are right now
with ssl right I mean I think okay so
something that's important to remember
is that ssl was designed in the early
90s yeah you know there wasn't a lot of
information if so was deep yes it's
exactly yes and and really like the
people who design des were in a much
better position to do that well then the
people of design as a cell you know who
were employees at Netscape and you know
who didn't have access to a lot of
information about how to do this stuff
you know I didn't have this kind of
backgrounds and really did remarkably
well given what little information they
had and how few resources were available
about cryptography and then why are we I
mean if that was just 90s technology why
are we still stuck with it well I mean
it's one of those things right you know
it's changing the Internet is pretty
difficult and this stuff has been
deployed pretty widely and it's also you
know been it's been it's been good
enough right and you know when you look
at a secure protocol they're really
three important pieces secrecy integrity
and authenticity and they actually did
okay with secrecy and integrity you know
we've sort of scraped by the prints of
problems there's still some problems but
it's really authenticity that has caused
all the friction and the real problems
that we see today and why is it because
of the certificate authorities is it
because like like who's in control and
how is the control changed because in
the 90s wasn't it just one body yeah
exactly so authenticity is controlled by
the certificate authorities and right
now according to the eff SSL Observatory
project there are about 650 different
organizations that are capable of
signing certificates and thus
intercepting communication if they like
it used to be that yeah there was really
just one essentially variscite verisign
yeah and you know basically what I've
been trying to do is think about the
problems that have emerged from
certificate authorities and you know
particularly recently there was this
major attack with comodo and we all
remember that that's something about the
komodo hack for those that don't
remember okay right well so basically
what happened was komodo got hacked and
a bunch of certificates got issued and
they were for like google and yahoo and
skype anomaly anything that an attacker
would need to intercept most
popular webmail login credentials so now
they have a certificate that says they
are PayPal or Google and when you know
you go to that they issue that
certificate they showed that they
couldn't get Xavier singing between
could intercept the connection and you
wouldn't know and so which you know
which is what certificate authorities
are trying to prevent and you know if
you know so it couldn't have been worse
right you know it was it was a pretty
embarrassing thing all around because
the Komodo responded to this by making
these claims about you know how
sophisticated and advanced the attackers
were that's that's the new keyword I
mean it's obviously if we got hacked
because we're huge it was an advanced
persistent threat and they were they
were serious actually they explicitly
said they believed it was the state of
Iran you know they are rands like cyber
army I remember actually reporting on
this and they had like some IP logged in
an IP address from the thank you well
cuz you know if you get a if you get a
like HTTP request from a type II and
Iran obviously it was an Iranian not
just an Iranian but the iranian cyber
army all right yeah yeah they set the
evil bit I can't remember anyway so so
they get hacked they got hacked they
said it was from Iran and that they
thought it was state-sponsored because
of subclinical and advanced and
everything and then basically a lot of
information came out after the attack
about who the attacker was and
everything and the attacker was posting
some pretty embarrassing communique is
online about you know that seems to be
the theme this year's snarky hackers
well the thing is that it was
embarrassing both for the attacker and
for comodo because the attacker was
posting these things with he was making
these ridiculous claims about how you
could hack RSA and all the stuff and
then simultaneously making like really
proud statements about how he could do
trivial things like export functions
from dll's and creative zone so ppi's
and stuff like that that you know you
net shouldn't really be proud of if
you're you know super advanced and so
you know it kind of looked bad for them
but it also looked bad for Komodo
because komodo have been saying you know
like how advanced these people were and
so
anyway it seems pretty clear at this
point it was not the iranian cyber army
and it might not have even been somebody
in iran it could have been to somebody
proxying traffic through there nice so
what so what is the alternative you
mentioned HST what what is that Oh
strict Transport Security and and that's
kind of trying to solve a different
problem but you know looking basically
what I want to do is look at Komodo
right and and I think the interesting
question for me is like in the aftermath
of all of this what happened to Komodo
you know and nothing nothing happened
them they didn't get sued they didn't
lose any business they got an egg on
their face but it kind of yeah you know
but at the same time the CEO of Komodo
was named Entrepreneur of the Year this
year at RSA we ain't it you know that's
the thing is it doesn't matter which
certificate authority gets owned if any
of them get challenged it's the it could
have you know been any domain right I
mean every every certificate authority
has the ability to issue a certificate
for every domain on the Internet so is
that what that protocol tries to address
well the I mean so you know in
particular if you want to build a video
site over your website has a play button
i highly recommend getting yourself a
dot TV domain see a dot TV website lets
you showcase your original content and
create a unique site that's just another
youtube channel just go over to domain
calm and search for your perfect TV
domain for your no idea then use the
coupon code hak5 at checkout to save an
extra fifteen percent and if you need
hosting for your new TV website don't
forget about domain coms hosting plans
they started less than six bucks a month
and have everything you need to build
maintain and promote your site remember
when you think domain names think
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
