power Apple might be more secure and the
rest keys they're hacking again all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Patrick Norton and this is threat
wire for June 21st 2016 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom thanks to all our
patrons at patreon.com slash threat wire
you make the show possible
net neutrality lives people the US Court
of Appeals for the DC Circuit which has
struck down FCC net neutrality measures
in the past has upheld the FCC's
implementation of debt neutrality now
that was being challenged by a group
including AT&amp;amp;T in various Cable and
Wireless trade groups so for now the FCC
can prevent your ISP from blocking or
slowing Internet traffic it can forbid
carriers from offering better
performance to websites or services that
pay a fee and of course this whole
reclassifying ISPs is titled to services
that can be regulated by the FCC I say
for now because I fully expect opponents
of net neutrality which include the
national cable and Telecommunications
Association think Comcast Time Warner
and cable Belgian the CTIA which
represents ATT Verizon Sprint and
t-mobile and a long list of others to
fight this to the Supreme Court
basically they claim the FCC is
overreaching the power granted it by
Congress because that might prevent them
from making more money a hacking of more
than 50 million dashes hopes in the
world of virtual currency what's the
title the New York Times gave to its
coverage of a hack that took nearly a
third of the hundred sixty million
dollars of ether in the Dow that's a
decentralized autonomous organization
that processes the ether transactions
you confused yet good ether is
essentially a virtual currency a Bitcoin
competitor and the Dow is a particular
set of investors that built up oh I'll
call it a program using the etherium
programming language which is way more
sophisticated or at least complicated
than the scripting language is used for
Bitcoin the dalles blockchain or public
ledger of all the transactions that took
place on its chunk of the etherium
network has a records of everything that
went down there were flaws somebody
exploited them and now the question is
whether or not the Dow will reset the
blockchain or was until late Friday when
the etherion blog posted an explanation
of what happened along with the plan for
a soft fork which
include no transactions or blocks being
reversed which means the person or
people that wrote the problematic
contract are not being bailed out in the
u.s. bank failure sense at least not yet
I'm not sure I buy into the idea that
this is dashing hopes and virtual
currency Bitcoin is doing quite well
it's it like flirting with its peak for
the last few months and well quite
frankly a significant number of the
people invested in ether are really
serious about having a ruthlessly
decentralized economy now whether or not
that's actually compatible with a
functioning currency is another question
time will tell and if you want to learn
more about this hack and the whole ether
Dao concept check out Arata securities
etherium slash the dow hack simplified
it is a very good read ok this story
goes back to earlier in June but it
fascinated me and I found it last week
so into this show it goes and talking
about the battle between navigation apps
and local residents quote the apps
didn't create the traffic brookhaven
Georgia Councilman Bates Madison told
The Washington Post quote but they gave
drivers options they wouldn't have known
about otherwise sounds nice right waves
gives you a clutch route around traffic
to get to the interstates you can speed
up your commute except in the case of
Brookhaven says the post we're talking
about an extra 45 thousand cars a day
rolling down residential streets sound
awful quotes traffic weary homeowners in
ways are at war again guess who's
winning is the title of the article by
the post that dropped me on to this
discusses the efforts of homeowners
trying to spoof ways into thinking their
street is blocked by an accident or
slowed by a speed trap I've been getting
kicked off ways because Waze can figure
out that they're not actually moving or
that the reports are false because other
ways users are just moving along fine
and brisk is ways making drivers more
efficient or they threatening
neighborhood streets with traffic they
were never engineered to handle whatever
your answer to that is you can expect
battles between communities and apps to
continue whether it's a city modifying
traffic pattern state governments and
Tempe to legislate listings and street
routes or good old-fashioned spoofing by
residents to continue into the future
you thought people drop in fake reviews
and the Yelp was crazy what you see what
happens when people start well spoofing
Google Maps wired says Russia's breach
to the DNC is about more than Trump's
dirt case you didn't tip to this one
Tuesday
sweet CrowdStrike dropped the news that
two separate russian based hacking
groups apparently in competition we're
deep inside the DNC's network and that
pretty much the same thing happened
during presidential elections to both
sides of the fence in 2008 and in fact
that this kind of stuff happens all the
time
surprise foreign nations hacking into
your stuff a more cheerful news Apple
revealed at WWDC that all apps in the
App Store will have to have app
Transport Security turned on by January
1 2017 or I should say at least all new
apps submitted to the App Store
basically means that apps will have to
use HTTPS to connect to web services and
that encrypted connection will help keep
your data secure assuming that HTTPS
itself hasn't been violated I wish I
could just figure out if they would
start applying this to all older apps
too because I like me some additional
security our featured comment today
comes from high tech guy a teen who in
response to was Twitter hacked in the
June 14th episode says shocked no
mention of TeamViewer remote controlled
PC seizure storm well Jeff savage Ed's
thank you I was about to comment on this
exact topic so apparently the thousands
of people that had their bank accounts
drained because they shared passwords
with Twitter and TeamViewer don't exist
a hack 5 Jeff buddy I covered the
TeamViewer breaches in the June 7th
episode of threat wire passwords mega
breaches as the name of that episode
more than a week before you and a high
tech guy 18 asked about him pays to
watch every episode yo and pays even
more to use a password manager and best
practices for passwords Shannon and I
spent a whole episode of tech thing
walking folks through that there's a
link in the show notes and people in
case you didn't catch it in the last few
episodes passwords password managers
separate passwords for everything in
your life it's critical for survival in
the digital age thank you to everyone
