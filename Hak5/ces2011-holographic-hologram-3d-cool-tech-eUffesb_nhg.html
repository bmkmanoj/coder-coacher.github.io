to you by goto assist express support
smarter with go to assist Express I'm
Darrin kitchen for hack five at CES 2011
we're here at in division Labs I'm here
with Jeff hey Jeff how are you I'm
wonderful thank you so what is this
technology that you guys are demoing
here this is a holographic imaging
technology so we portray
three-dimensional images for marketing
purposes educational medical field but
yeah it's a real exciting product now
tell me about the hardware the hardware
consists of we have a monitor the
technology is driven off of flash flash
video and then we have a CPU a processor
down below and the image again the way
it all comes together creates a visual
image of a holographic image that it's
pretty captivating you know the monitor
itself is it just any old monitors
there's something special there it's
it's a it's a basic monitor I mean some
of the technology and things behind it
we're not going to get into everything
and how it works but it it that the
hardware isn't that specific okay so you
say for educational markets for medical
how do people program the images is
there do you guys have like a software
development kit for it or something like
that
we don't there's we have development
partners that help us develop the files
if somebody doesn't know but flash video
a lot of people are able to render that
but so we don't sell a specific kit but
any graphics firm knows how to create
the video content and are there any
interactive components can you touch the
the glass can you reach in and touch the
image great question the future of it is
that's where I see it evolving to
interactive wise it would be great to be
able to take this to different companies
and maybe build or design a specific
product to a consumer as you want to add
color or do something around it so we're
definitely going there but for now it's
more of just a presentation or
demonstration piece and what about the
constraints as far as size and the
environment are concerned can use this
outside with little lighting kind of
requirements
getting great question it works in most
almost all environments
we're very litany and you can see how
beautiful the images are in dark areas
it it works well as well so we haven't
seen any limitations there size-wise we
have the ability to build much larger
models we've had some applications where
people have discussed human figures
being able to be in a hall or some type
of an area doing a introduction or
presentation either in a for a company
or City Hall so we're not really too
limited as far as to what we can do it
if somebody would want something custom
we could do it alright and this is an
all-in-one system there's a computer
built in as well so you don't have to
run it to a network or anything like
that what about the consumers can they
is this something that you sell directly
to consumers we would sell it directly
just to consumers we have distributors
that we're looking to do through but a
consumer could take it or an individual
company absolutely its plug-and-play to
answer your questions so it comes out of
the box other than getting the video
content in there it's ready
and what's the platform on the back end
there for the video a flash video you
mean okay so it's a flash based yep
flash based all right and I was gonna
say as well yeah it's plug and play
ready to go so great thanks so much and
where can people find out more about it
in a vision labs USA and I'm Jeff wall
you can be reached at through the
website their innovation labs calm or
