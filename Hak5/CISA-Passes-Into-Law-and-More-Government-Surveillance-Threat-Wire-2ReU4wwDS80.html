surveillance product catalogue is made
public hello kitty has been hacked and
junipers screen OS has a back door all
that coming up now on threat wire hello
world I'm Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for December 22nd 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom thank you
to our patrons for making threat wire
possible seriously you are the best
bosses I could ever ask for now back in
October we were pretty upset that the
cyber information sharing Act passed the
Senate by a vote of 70 for 221 but we
hoped that it would not go further tech
firms and civil liberties groups alike
have publicly opposed size' and even
signed an open letter in opposition the
Act would allow companies to share user
information with government agencies
pretty much any government agencies
without a warrant and is touted as a
cybersecurity bill the opposition says
that size' is another form of legal
surveillance on law-abiding citizens
unfortunately though a house speaker
named Paul Ryan slipped size' into the
omnibus bill which is basically a bunch
of legislation that has to do with
federal funding not cybersecurity the
bill passed the house as well during
this late-night session and has now
passed President Obama's desk and yes he
signed it into law this law has been
stripped down to its bare minimum and no
longer includes Prevention's against the
NSA getting its hands on personally
identifying details and does not include
any kind of restrictions on government
use of the data that they collect since
the omnibus bill has been also included
many changes to federal funding that
many would consider to be positive
changes such as tax breaks for college
tuition and renewable energy military
troops getting pay raises and lifting a
ban on exporting crude oil to add the
size of bill into such a package made
the chances of a veto incredibly slim
and Paul Ryan I think he knew that gee
golly it's a great day to live in
America isn't it happy holidays everyone
the US government is no stranger to
fancy
tons of devices used to track your cell
phone like stingray anyone but a new
government catalog obtained by the
intercept has shown us that the devices
are used by both the military and by
government agencies and they come in
many different forms surveillance
products range in price from a few
thousand to a few million dollars in the
full document contains capability
descriptions photos as well as vendor
information some of which are really
known names such as Boeing for example
many of these devices have never been
publicized the products have a wide
range capabilities but all of them
include some kind of surveillance for
cell phones in one way or another
unfortunately the use of many of these
devices on us grounds by local law
enforcement violate the Fourth Amendment
and are complicated for a ruling judge
to understand which makes it really hard
to issue a warrant based on these broad
misconceptions is nothing sacred anymore
first VTech and now hello kitty sanrio
the company that owns hello kitty along
with all of her kawaii pals runs an
online community at sanrio town calm
this weekend a researcher named Chris
Vickery contacted salted hash in data
breaches calm about a daily leak from
the site which includes first and last
names birthdays gender country of origin
email addresses passwords which were
sha-1 encrypted but not salted as well
as password hints including the
questions and the answers yeah so the
leaked data is currently being withheld
by the outlets and sanrio has begun an
investigation now because the passwords
can be easily reverse engineered because
they weren't salted users are advised to
change their passwords and security
questions and answers and by the way
don't use the same password on multiple
sites and now's a really really good
time to get a password manager if you
haven't done so yet lastly is Juniper
Networks the company behind many popular
networking and security related products
they issued a security advisory on
December 17th about unauthorized code in
screen OS the operating system used by
firewall and security service gateway
applications that they sell the code
would allow a quote knowledgeable
attacker to gain and minna straight
evacs
to net screen devices and to decrypt VPN
connections the vulnerability requires
telnet or SSH to be enabled to be
exploited metasploit project founder HD
Moore discovered that a hard-coded admin
password could allow this to happen as a
back door into the system juniper has
already released a patch and strongly
advises customers to update as soon as
possible even though they have not
confirmed any use of this exploit in the
wild no culprits have been named by ARS
technica suggests NSA involvement based
on previous leaked documents in the
mention of an NSA operation that would
allow the agency to create persistent
back doors on juniper firewalls before I
go I want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who supported the show so far
on patreon of course if you want to
become a patron you can go to
patreon.com/scishow be bees like these
ones in our next episode because they're
super cute I really like the small ones
those are my favorite because I could
totally put them in my hacker bag and
take them to a convention although i
would probably get kicked out of the
hotel for doing that help us hit our
next milestone goal of two episodes per
week with the rotation of your favorite
hosts and an RSS feed as well yeah I
can't wait to get to that point so
definitely help us out of course I hope
that you will contribute to keep this
show coming completely independent in ad
free if you can't donate that's cool to
share the show with like one friend this
holiday season just one I think if
everybody out there shoes are with one
friend maybe we can get a few more
patrons I think that would be very cool
you can find all of our episodes links
to our social networks other stuff like
that to contribute over at threat wired
dotnet and with that I am Shannon Morse
and i will see you on the Internet end
of line
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
