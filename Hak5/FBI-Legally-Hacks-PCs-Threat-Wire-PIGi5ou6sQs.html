probably a bad idea given the FBI can
legally hack a PC Plus how to spot a
credit card skimmer and more all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for June 28th 2016 your summary of
the threats to our security our privacy
and Internet freedom if you haven't
checked out our patreon page recently we
have been posting various additional
content there such as stories that we
can't necessarily fit into our weekly
episode so definitely check it out and
consider becoming a patron of threat
wire at patreon.com slash threat wire so
first off the FBI they seized a server
that has been hosting a dark web site
called playpen which served up child
porn way back in 2014 now since that
time the FBI decided to keep the site
online and effectively distribute
malware to anyone who accessed it
collecting MAC addresses operating
systems etc etc so late last week news
spread that because of this ongoing
investigation a federal court ruled that
users should have and I quote no
expectation of privacy on a personal
computer inside their own home and no
warrant is needed for the FBI to hack a
computer remotely because it wouldn't be
protected under the Fourth Amendment the
case is with the United States of
America versus Edward Joseph mattis who
is being charged for four counts of
child porn senior staff attorney of the
EF F mark-room old said quote the
implications for the decision if upheld
are staggering law enforcement would be
free to remotely search and seize
information from your computer without a
warrant without probable cause or
without any suspicion at all so
currently we give our IP address to
third parties every day when browsing
the web so according to the courts that
is not protected under Fourth Amendment
rights but a warrant should still be
necessary to hack a computer system by
the FBI I mean since this included
information captured by the FBI also
includes additional information about
the system of users this brings to light
an important matter if the ruling which
was made by a federal district court in
Virginia is upheld it could mean that
the FBI or other
law enforcement could search your PC
without warrant or cause for any reason
any reason at all the security and
privacy rights of citizens could be
negatively affected by courts that not
only do not understand the technology
but also tend to fear it on May 24th two
cyber security researchers alerted
Google of a problem in the Chrome
browser that would allow a user to
bypass DRM restrictions under the
Widevine technology so this technology
basically allows chrome as well as a few
other popular browsers to stream
encrypted videos such as videos from
Netflix or Amazon Prime wide vine
handles a key exchange between the
provider and the user so that the stream
goes through on DRM content the
vulnerability could allow someone to
download a copy of a movie or a TV show
as a plays in the Chrome browser Google
has yet to fix the vulnerability with a
patch but they have been watching the
issue the problem if patched could still
be reverse engineered to work on a build
of the open source chromium browser
which also uses Widevine now both
researchers are waiting ninety days to
fully disclose how the hack works
publicly so that Google can fix it in
the meantime
and hopefully they do Komodo has come
under fire a few times in recent years
for their lack of security in regards to
self-signed digital certificates for
websites as well as a few other issues
now they've tried to trademark let's
encrypt which is the name of the
nonprofit that issues certificates for
free so kimonos filed applications for
three different trademarks including the
words let's encrypt and did not appear
to be backing down anytime soon
according to their CEO let's encrypt was
piggybacking on their business model
with 90 day free digital trial
certificates calling the nonprofit non
ethical and saying that copyrights can't
be decided by loyal but blind followers
who bully an enterprise by their tweets
I mean really the CEO said that luckily
Komodo did change their mind and
abandoned all three of the trademark
applications as stated and updates on
the 24th it kind of sounds like to me
that someone was trying to rain on the
nonprofit parade but the negative
response that they received made them
back off and it's a good thing that they
did self checkout lanes are found all
over the United States as well as other
countries for quick payments
of goods at thousands of different
retailers unfortunately they too can be
hacked Krebs on security wrote about
these Ingenico credit card terminals and
the skimmers that were being used on
them last month and this month Ingenico
themselves posted a tutorial about how
to spot them as a customer now luckily
it's pretty easy
the Ingenico is c250 terminals with the
skimmers appear larger they cover
backlighting on the keys and the
signature pen cannot rest easily in the
space provided for it using these dead
giveaways can help you properly identify
one while you're buying your groceries
but for how long I mean who knows the
unfortunate part about releasing these
details publicly is that the scammers
are very likely to try to improve the
skimmer so that they aren't as easily
identified but do what I do though you
know pull on different things like the
credit card swiper and the PIN pad you
can look for cameras check for weird
bluetooth near ATMs that was actually a
thing that crubs on security wrote an
article about and you can cover your PIN
code too on credit card terminals as
well as ATMs now obviously none of those
are fail proof but it's honestly better
than just not doing anything before I go
and want to give a huge huge thanks to
