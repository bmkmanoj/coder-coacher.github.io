probably a bad idea given the FBI can
legally hack a PC plus how to spot a
credit card skimmer and more all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire 4 jun 28 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security our privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon page recently we have
been posting various additional content
there such as stories that we can't
necessarily fit into our weekly episode
so definitely check it out and consider
becoming a patron of threat wire at
patreon.com / threat wire so first off
the FBI they seized a server that has
been hosting a dark web site called
playpen which served up child porn way
back in 2014 now since that time the FBI
decided to keep the site online and
effectively distribute malware to anyone
who accessed it collecting MAC addresses
operating systems etc etc so late last
week news spread that because of this
ongoing investigation a federal court
ruled that users should have and I quote
no expectation of privacy on a personal
computer inside their own home and no
warrant is needed for the FBI to hack a
computer remotely because it wouldn't be
protected under the Fourth Amendment the
case is with the United States of
America vs. edward joseph matt ish who
is being charged for four counts of
child porn senior staff attorney of the
eff mark room old said quote the
implications for the decision if upheld
are staggering law enforcement would be
free to remotely search and seize
information from your computer without a
warrant without probable cause or
without any suspicion at all so
currently we give our IP address to
third parties every day when browsing
the web so according to the courts that
is not protected under Fourth Amendment
rights but a warrant should still be
necessary to hack a computer system by
the FBI I mean since this included
information captured by the FBI also
includes additional information about
the system of users this brings to light
an important matter if the ruling which
was made by a federal district court in
Virginia is upheld it could mean that
the FBI or other
law enforcement could search your PC
without warrant or cause for any reason
any reason at all the security and
privacy rights of citizens could be
negatively affected by courts that not
only do not understand the technology
but also tend to fear it on May
twenty-fourth to cyber security
researchers alerted Google of a problem
in the Chrome browser that would allow a
user to bypass drm restrictions under
the wide vine technology so this
technology basically allows Chrome as
well as a few other popular browsers to
stream encrypted videos such as videos
from Netflix or Amazon Prime wide vine
handles a key exchange between the
provider and the user so that the stream
goes through on DRM content the
vulnerability could allow someone to
download a copy of a movie or a TV show
as a plays in the Chrome browser Google
has yet to fix the vulnerability with a
patch but they have been watching the
issue the problem if patched could still
be reverse engineered to work on a build
of the open-source chromium browser
which also uses Widevine now both
researchers are waiting 90 days to fully
disclose how the hack works publicly so
that Google can fix it in the meantime
and hopefully they do Komodo has come
under fire a few times in recent years
for their lack of security in regards to
self-signed digital certificates for
websites as well as a few other issues
now they've tried to trademark let's
encrypt which is the name of the
nonprofit that issue certificates for
free so kimonos filed applications for
three different trademarks including the
words let's encrypt and did not appear
to be backing down anytime soon
according to their CEO let's encrypt was
piggybacking on their business model
with 90 day free digital trial
certificates calling the nonprofit
non-ethnic alanson that copyrights can't
be decided by loyal but blind followers
who bully an enterprise by their tweets
I mean really the CEO said that luckily
Komodo did change their mind and
abandoned all three of the trademark
applications as stated and updates on
the 24th it kind of sounds like to me
that someone was trying to rain on the
nonprofit parade but the negative
response that they received made them
back off and it's a good thing that they
did self checkout lanes are found all
over the United States as well as other
countries for quick payment
of goods at thousands of different
retailers unfortunately they too can be
hacked Krebs on security wrote about
these ingenico credit card terminals and
the skimmers that were being used on
them last month and this month ingenico
themselves posted a tutorial about how
to spot them as a customer now luckily
it's pretty easy the ingenico is c250
terminals with the skimmers appear
larger they cover back lighting on the
keys and the signature pen cannot rest
easily in the space provided for it
using these dead giveaways can help you
properly identify one while you're
buying your groceries but for how long I
mean who knows the unfortunate part
about releasing these details publicly
is that the scammers are very likely to
try to improve the skimmer so that they
aren't as easily identified but do what
I do though you know pull on different
things like the credit card swiper and
the pin pads you can look for cameras
check for weird bluetooth near ATMs that
was actually a thing that Krebs on
security wrote an article about and you
can cover your PIN code to on credit
card terminals as well as ATMs now
obviously none of those are fail proof
but it's honestly better than just not
doing anything before I go and want to
give a huge huge thanks to everybody who
