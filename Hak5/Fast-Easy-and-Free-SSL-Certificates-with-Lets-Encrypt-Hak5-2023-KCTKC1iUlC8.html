certs this time on hack 5 hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen my name is Sheena mori
it's your weekly dose of Technol s yes
it is and we have an awesome show
planned for you today
no more plaintext that's right we're
gonna have hopefully it concise wrap-up
on how to assess ell everything get
yourself some HTTPS with free
certificates on your web server in no
time flat with just a few commands but
first up we do have a few announcements
first we have a pen test with hack 5 and
that is coming up seven September 16th
through 18th and you can find all of the
details over at pen test with hack
five.com it is really really fun and
seats are selling fast so you got to
make sure you get in it right in on this
because we are going to be Sebastian
from the Wi-Fi pineapple as well as mu
between Metasploit minute and myself we
are gonna be teaching the USB rubber
ducky land turtle the Wi-Fi pineapple
Metasploit all wrapped up together in
like a story-driven kind of InfoSec
dinner theater I have no idea how to
describe this it's really it's really
fun we've gotten tons of awesome
positive feedback from our previous
classes so we can't wait for this one
yes so so get in on that and we will be
catching them all that would be a
reference to hacking devices not
necessarily any of the other no I'm not
doing that here you know we are doing is
it only took us 11 years but we are
celebrating turning 3 in binary DUP Def
Con at Todd English pub which is next to
the Aria at crystals it's gonna be at
9:00 p.m. on Friday night you can find
the details over here at hack 5 org we
are very excited yes we have this meetup
should be really great bt-dubs we are so
not like reserving space or anything so
just show up and drink beer there you go
right we're also gonna have a big Wi-Fi
pineapple announcement very excited
about that
7i are speaking at the DEF CON wireless
village on Saturday at 4 p.m. at Sky
View 1 so come to our talk it's going to
be awesome we are
launching the Buffalo bulldozer and
that's all I can say about that the
weirdest names ever and then of course
you can stick around afterwards after
like most of Def Con happens because at
night there are parties and there is a
drone Club right next door to the
wireless village it's at Sky View too
it's gonna be happening two nights so
it's Friday and Saturday night from 8
p.m. to midnight and we're gonna be
there we're gonna be hanging out droning
up all the drones on Saturday night so
come check it out and maybe we can fight
drones
yes drone battles it's like Fight Club
but for drones
it is like Fight Club for drunks it's
very exciting ok what with all of that
Shannon I am very excited to ask you a
very watson question look up what that
means you are what is what is SSL we
tease this at the top we sell stuff what
are we doing here so SSL stands for
Secure Sockets Layer it's a standard
security technology to link a web server
in a browser together via an encrypted
link and the encrypted link uses a
public key cryptography which is where a
web server has a public key and they
have a private key and then a handshake
occurs between the two whenever a user
visits the site the web server will have
to create an SSL certificate to be able
to use SSL on the site legally I guess
you could say a server that the server
creates a public and a private key
combination and that public key is
public obviously and it is placed into a
certificate signing request so this is
called a CSR for short which you will
see a lot of times if you're planning to
get a certificate online from a CA or a
certificate authority so this is a data
file that contains all sorts of
information about the server the CSR is
submitted for the SSL certificate
approval and then the certification
authority validates you and then hands
out that certificate so this is why you
always run into that issue where if you
don't have a valid certificate your
website might be like a site it's not as
the cell right we can actually look at
ours is the certificate for hack 5 org
it was verified by as you can see right
there GeoTrust so there are many of
these different authorities that will
say yeah
guys pass the sniff test you seem like a
legitimate organization there and and
then you you know you get your
certificate and there you go and that
certificate shouldn't match the private
key as it should for that domain and
this will let you establish a private
encrypted link between the web browser
or the web server and then the users PC
now as a user you can see an SSL cert
credential by just clicking on the
little lock icon in the browser you'll
see it very often for example on the
less encrypt org site or hack 5 you'll
see a lock icon there the certs contain
the domain name the company sometimes
they'll have the address city state and
country and expiration for the
certificate if it expires and then the
certificate authority so for example for
ours which was GeoTrust
there we go so if anything is out of
whack of course the browser will warn
you if as the user if it's late or if
there's an issue is going from does this
all the time I usually I'm just like in
fact I used to do a bunch of these
self-signed certificates when I was
doing a lot of IT stuff for internal
things and of course you would always
get that warning because you know you
generated your own keys right which
works it's just not you know some major
organizations family by using self by by
yourself yeah you're like I vouch for me
as opposed to like some big company like
geo trust being like he's cool right
does the weirdest system but whatever
yes so if a web server doesn't get their
certificate from a third party or they
just decide to validate their keys
themselves it's not considered as
trustworthy if there is a third party
used to validate the keys for a
certificate but the third party is
unknown it also might not be trustworthy
so keep that in mind so that was all
about the SSL stuff Shannon but from
what I understand SSL is that lame weak
sauce old stuff yeah it can be hacked
that's fun times
so transport layer security this is the
new hotness on the interwebs it's sort
for the other words TLS which is the
newer SSL with SSL being its predecessor
so TLS is more secure than older
versions of SSL pretty much all versions
of SSL which could be spoofed in hacked
TLS version 1.3 is currently
being drafted so this is going to be the
newest one that everybody is going to be
targeting to be a more private layer for
security for individuals and this is
going to remove weak systems such as md5
rc4 and it's going to add algorithms
that are more secure and newer and who
knows what we're going to see with that
one probably some new like elliptical
curve algorithms included in there but I
guess we're gonna see you know until the
quantum computers but that's a story for
another time
so TLS is very often still referred to
as SSL commonly because that's mostly
just because it's the mature version of
the secure protocols as a cell or they
might say tls/ssl as well yeah it's one
of those things so yeah so then that
brings us to this lesson crypt stuff
because that's the new hotness Chenin
tell me about let's encrypt
so let's encrypt is a certificate
authority a CA for short
they started in April of 2016 you've
probably heard of them in passing if you
haven't checked them out yourself they
were started by the internet security
research group for short that is is RG
they offer free automatic secure
certificates to pretty much anybody who
owns a domain name they offer free TLS
certificates and these are using the
x.509 certificate encryption which
allows PKI or public key infrastructure
to work so this is very commonly used in
systems online for TLS it's interesting
too because all of this is very similar
to techno of the technology that we work
to use PGP yeah so check out our
episodes on using GPG or malevolent for
instance same kind of idea and one of
the nice things about let's encrypt is
that it's an automated process so let's
encrypt is trying to make encryption
with certificates ubiquitous on the
internet and very easy so that you know
encryption becomes the norm as opposed
to sites though using just simple HT so
the the thing about that is I remember
even doing this you know 15 years ago
and it was always a bit much because you
have to go through not just you know
generating your CSR isn't going through
the authority but having like for
instance for a company they would want
to check your dun and bradstreet numbers
and they would want to check your
physical address and all of these other
things and these are good things too
you know organizations like validated as
being like a legit organization you know
like are they registered with the Better
Business Bureau and things of that
nature but it's like look guys like it's
cool that we're passing sniff tests here
but it's no reason why we shouldn't have
every one with a domain name also be
able to have a as well certificate and
Bri yes that's frees a huge part and
then there 509 certs their domain
validated that's the way that they make
sure you are who you are which means
that they're validated by proving that
you own the DNS for a domain so we owned
the DNS for hack 5 for AK 5 dot org all
of let's encrypt certificates are
transparent so you can see what's been
issued in what's been revoked and the
automatic issuance of certificates is an
open standard so if somebody else wants
to use this standard of technology that
let's encrypt is using they can easily
do so you know let's encrypt isn't like
having locking that don't know I like
that it's it's kind of an open protocol
so how does it work okay so the nice
part about let's encrypt is they also
have a how it's work how it works
website so let's encrypt identifies the
server admin via their public key that's
the very very first part of all of this
and then a new key pair is going to be
generated whenever the administrator of
that domain talks to let's encrypt to
prove that they own the domain that they
say they do the server owner will have
to prove that they own the domain by
adding a DNS record under their comm
which if you've ever created a website
you probably had to do this either to
transfer your domain from a different
registrar or what have you
I've had to do this when I switched my
site to Squarespace for example so it's
something that you do in other words
we're just saying hey we want to make
sure that you actually owned that domain
yeah and another way that you can prove
that you own a domain is by setting up
an HTTP resource or just a simple file
under a URI which stands for a Uniform
Resource identifier give you a file and
be like hey put this on your web server
just in case you don't have you know
simple access to modifying a text record
or something like that in DNS right
since the last step for just validating
yourself is the server owner has to sign
the private key pair to prove their
identity so let's encrypt look
all this information and then verifies
the data and make sure that it's legit
and then the server owner can then
manage a certificate so to get that cert
that's another step in itself the server
owner has to send let's encrypt a
certificate signing request a CSR with
their private key and then signed with
the domains public key which let's let's
encrypt validate and then they will send
them the certificate so it's kind of it
sounds a little confusing the way they
put out there but that mean that's the
way that works for any registrar any
certificate authority that you may go to
like you know geo trust like I mentioned
with hack five org however there's no
reason why hack five couldn't be using a
let's encrypt certificate right now and
when we get back we're gonna be showing
you how to set up just that because it
turns out well all that theory is really
cool the actual practice of doing so and
oh god I can tell you from years of
experience with iis five this is so much
easier say you've got a great idea like
an internet spirit guide how would you
bring that to the web well I'll tell you
what we do a hack five we head over to
domain comm it is the most fantastic
place because their domain discovery
system simplifies the checkout process
and helps you get your idea to the web
in no time flat and get this the guys
over a domain comm huge fans of hack
five and so they have a coupon code just
for us that we can share with you it's
called act five and it spells hak5 when
you use it at checkout at domain.com you
will save 20% and guess what even if you
don't need a domain name this exact
moment in this exact moment you can
pause the video and tweet at domain.com
and say thanks for supporting us crazy
kids over at the main com
one time sir yes when you have a great
idea think domain.com we're back and
we're now going to set up a let's
encrypt certificate on our brand-new
speaking website do all the things we
our org know let's go I actually have
check it out Shannon I have Internet
spirit guide dot-com oh my god where you
can go when you can write that that is
not no that isn't Sarah that's not Sarah
from the hack shop it is in fact the
internet spirit guide here to tell you
that you should turn yourself to let go
of all the data a year to lose I have
never seen that picture before you
didn't know that that was happening so
um Sarah I mean the internet spirit
guide ear has an amazing website
internet spirit guide calm however you
may noticed up here that we don't get
the cute little lock icon and actually
if I add the HTTP colon slash slash
myself you will see that it will fail
it's gonna say all unable to connect
because that's not the right thing and
that's not what we're doing and that's
that's okay
because if you have SSH access to your
server this is going to be super simple
to turn into an HTTP site because the e
FF maintains this awesome tool called
cert BOTS sir cert bot right I like
survive like sir bots to see Serpa is
the let's encrypt client and it will
enable HTTPS on your server it was
previously known as the let's invert
client but now you can find it over at
github check this out github calm cert
button actually the easiest way to get
started is suggest head over to certify
org and go ahead and choose your web
server from the drop-down I'm using
Apache on this server and the operating
system is Ubuntu 1404 and then BOOM here
are the automated install instructions
how awesome is that so just walk us
through for our specific scenario did I
say a specific I can't speak today by
the way but we're just gonna keep
rolling so I'm gonna go ahead and SSH
over to my server okay and your password
is obviously curvy you
it is this is actually octopus lipstick
because I'm continuing to use the NSA
meme generator for all of my server
names and what we're gonna do we're
actually just gonna do a little
copypasta here what I have is a lamp
server running so that's obviously
Apache PHP my sequel running on Linux so
you can see that I have like var /ww 80
ml is where I've got all my good stuff
and and to do to do all we need to do if
I take a look at my directory I'm in
slash route I'm just gonna do it right
here to keep things simple I'm gonna go
ahead and paste that command from the e
FF site so what this will do is download
this file and you notice that it's
actually doing it over HTTPS how
fantastic is that grab myself a copy of
cert bot I can see it's right there now
we just need to change its mode so it's
executable or we could run it with bash
there we go and now if I LS again I'll
see it's nice and pretty in green and if
we just all we have to know how to
change colors now and oh right
is that a hack tip all right well my
terminal is purple beware all we have to
do at this point is go ahead and just
run dot slash cert bot auto so go ahead
and do that all right and we're going to
go ahead and continue and it's going to
ask for the name which is going to be
internet spirit guide com can even put
in the ww1 doesn't matter do you have to
include the I would have to do it for
both okay
all right and the email address that'll
be my email during hack v 2 org okay and
we accept the License Agreement Terms of
Service and we're prompted if we want to
allow HTTP in addition to HTTP or did
you do that well you would do that if
you want the ability to SSL strip web
sites you know I'm not really sure I
will say that for instance internet.org
as an example the free internet from
Facebook to the developing nations
restricts HTTPS I don't know why oh
that's kind of stupid so there may be
some weird edge cases in which you
wouldn't want in which you would want
the ability to also get to the plain
text version of the site or we could
just say make all of them all of them
request secure because you know we need
to make sure we have a secure connection
to the Internet
I'm actually just gonna choose both so I
can show you an example of the
difference all right and then there we
go so we say you should now have your
configurations at and we can head over
to this site or we can just go ahead and
hit OK and congratulations we're done
right our certificate change has been
saved we should test it yeah right we
should so all we have to do is come over
to the internet spirit guide and you'll
notice there we go that's the HTTP
version and if we refresh this page
notice the HTTP and there we are we've
got a cute little lock icon lock icon
and it is secured and we can view the
certificate and we can come over here
say view certificate and voila we have a
certificate now here's the thing that
you may notice it expires in October yes
but thankfully certain bots can actually
automate the renewal for us that's the
thing normally yeah normally from like
the bigger certificate authorities you
get a certificate that's like good for a
year or two years things of that nature
these don't last as long but it's really
easy to renew them let's check this out
so if I head over to the terminal we can
go ahead and do a dry run of a renewal
so let's close this and get back over to
our terminal all right great
so that same exact cert bot thing here
and then run slash root because that's
where we are slash cert bot and then I'm
gonna do it with renew tak tak dry run
and what this is gonna do is gonna
process our certificate it's going to
see if it can actually automated Lee
without any human interaction go ahead
and contact let's encrypt and get this
certificate renewed and it says
congratulations all renewals succeeded
so there we go so what this means is I
now have confidence adding the actual
renewal to my crontab oh yes make it a
cron job yeah I love me the UNIX task
scheduler so much better than the at
command in Windows so to do that all we
have to do is run crontab
attack II and we're gonna be asked here
which you know is a favorite text editor
and I mean obviously we're gonna choose
nano because it's the name of the Wi-Fi
pineapple and here is our crontab file
so we're going to come to the very
bottom and we're gonna go ahead and add
this command now here's the thing about
cron tabs if you've never done it before
if you're not familiar with them the
syntax is a little weird but if you're
feeling lazy like I am you can go ahead
and check out this awesome site here
doo-doo-doo-doo not internet spirit
guide although you should check this
site out as well but the crontab -
generator org is an epic place that will
help you go ahead and create your your
tasks so what we want to do is I don't
know and we'll do this every every day
at 5:00 a.m. 5:00 we'll do it at snot
five exactly we'll do it at 553 a.m.
pick a weird time right cuz like we
don't want to do it on the hour cuz
everybody else in the Internet is
probably doing things on the hour and
then we'll go ahead and paste in the
command that we want to execute I'll
just put in fubar because I don't know
exactly the the command off the top of
my head but we'll generate that and look
at that so it gives us this is what we
should add so 53 is the minutes five is
the hour and there's asterisks mean all
of the other times and we can get into
what those are and then this is the
command and then this right here just
suppresses the output so we actually
don't really care about that as much as
I just want these 53 five star star star
like come back over to micron tab there
we go and now I just need to enter in
slash root because that's where I left
that cert ba audio file cert bot - auto
and then in this case it's renew but
we're not doing a dry run we're doing it
quiet and we're gonna say no self
upgrade alright there's quite a let it
do it in the background yeah okay and
then save that and close it and there we
go right that was it
incredibly easy so now every single day
it's going to be try to renew the
certificate now the certificate is
doesn't need to renew every day but you
know as long as this happens at least
once in the next three months we're good
to go
so cool alright so that is it for
setting up HTTP with let's encrypt and
as you can see it really honestly could
not be easier let us know what you guys
think over in the comments or you can
always tweet us at hack 5 as well if you
are using let's encrypt I would love to
know and at this point there is
absolutely no excuse for a plain text
web so seriously if you're on HTTP right
now get your butt off HTTP and go HTTPS
with some tea lesson yeah and now it's
time for the technolo stéfano of the
week every week we are asking what
tickles your techno lust
so tweet Instagram or Facebook a hashtag
hak5 for your chance to win some awesome
gear from a very own hack shop and today
we're givin away our Wi-Fi pineapple
Nano with a sweet new sticker pack check
this out did you know we have awesome
sticker decals now for all of our cool
products I kind of love the deer decals
so I want to know you should put those
on the set oh I should alright I'll put
these on the set will you tell us who is
our WinRAR there were a lot we actually
got quite a few entries so it's hard to
choose but I'm gonna go ahead and run
through these real quick so you can see
some of the entries that we got these
are amazing I love that server closet
and loves the server closet I love these
three monitors awesome dude yes thank
you everybody these are just a few but I
have to say my favorite is the
wardriving dog alright yeah lord helix
yeah since I get to choose this week so
hard helix it's your children this week
lord helix is it so we will be hitting
you up on Twitter getting your address
so we can send you out the new Wi-Fi
pineapple nano I'm very excited about
that here you know it get that die cut
act 5 sticker over on your side right
it's up here there we go
you know what close yeah ok right here
wherever so much fun like that on my
forehead no I'm not doing that okay
we're done here you're so down here
alright so this weekend we are going to
be at Def Con we're gonna be crazy busy
at our booth Liam you know it's giving
you guys stickers and stuff so hey this
is actually kind of perfect because what
we have been talking about this entire
episode
then encrypting your web server which
you should be doing with let's encrypt
which is backed by some awesome
organizations like Mozilla and
specifically the e FF I can't tell you
guys how much we love the e FF you've
you've watched our sister show threat
wire you know that these guys do awesome
good for the Internet and we want to
benefit them so if you're coming to Def
Con come by the vendor area you will
find our awesome huge booth you will you
be able to see us from across the room
there's a giant inflatable pineapple
like you probably saw in that newborn
movie and you will find you will find ah
this is a land Peralta original land
Peralta does awesome drawings on the
daily tech news show with Tom Merritt he
did this special for us and we are going
to have it just at Def Con and we are
autographing these for like a I don't
know a donation of a buck donation
because we are raising money for the e
FF because they do awesome stuff like
let's encrypt so yes we're super excited
just be handing those out and yeah just
ask for a donation your your preference
looks like I think so too I don't really
like the purple hair well I mean right
of course if you can't make it to the
convention you can always check out a
check a shop comm we have tons of
awesome sales they're two of our Wi-Fi
behind up on nano art yeah we actually
have Def Con special sales going on
right now even if you can't make it to
the conference OHA K shop comm that's
what supports us directly and yeah check
it out you can get fashionable hacker
accessories and don't forget to sign up
for pen test with hack 5 or our meetup
that's happening this weekend over in
Las Vegas we're super excited to meet
everybody and I can't wait it's gonna be
so much fun
I am so excited all right good it does
not begin with the new look peak I like
it awesome anyway thank you so much guys
we will see you next week
I'll see you guys in the comments until
then trust your techno Lester we're back
and it's time to get this no I know
no no tag XO card
