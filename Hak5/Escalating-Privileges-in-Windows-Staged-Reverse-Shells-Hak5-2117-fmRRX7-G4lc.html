meterpreter river shells and stage
payloads with the USB rubber ducky all
day and more this time on hack five
he'll open hack five my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse it's a weekly
dose of Technol us welcome everybody to
this awesome episode I'm super excited
about this it's gonna be a fun one yeah
it's very very cool but first off I did
want to remind everybody to stick around
until the end of the episode because the
entire month of December including this
week we are giving away a ton of gear
from the hack shop as I guess you could
say hundred dollar coupons every single
day right and then the grand prize
winner the the ultimate pineapple kit
with the six hundred and fifty dollars
worth of gear it's just it's gonna be
crazy yeah it's gonna be super super fun
and it's fun to like celebrate the fact
that our very own Wi-Fi pineapple has
been featured in a video game by a
pretty little developer we love it you
soft I guess I kind of skipped the
reason why would yeah we're doing that
because we're in watchdogs too
it's pretty cool and TV shows and movies
well my place now so yes great they
should put us come on
watchdogs three get a little daring
scope so big girl character has like
kind of purple hairs so there you go I
think you guys could be could be in a
mosh
I don't really has a thing on her head
loyal yeah she's stuck at the hacker
space but then again I'm not actually
playing any of the missions at any of
those it's if you're an athletic gamer
it's one of those where you don't have
to do any of the story so you can pretty
much just like screw around San
Francisco also I wanted to mention that
we're super super close to hitting our
next goal for threat wire on our patreon
hey yeah gratulations in fact everybody
go stop watching now go over to the hack
5 youtube channel but you may in fact
already be on and watch the route wire
because Shannon is killing it yeah it's
so much fun so I believe this week I
think if I'm talking about the correct
week we're pretty recording um we're
going to be doing a whole wrap up of
like the biggest hacks of 2016 so
wrapping it up because a lot of them
were from earlier this year we might
have forgotten about them so hey don't
miss that one that sounds like a great
episode check it out I'm very excited
you guys have an RSS feed for the audio
listen yeah
Catriona that show is growing I love it
patreon.com slash threat wires yeah find
all the information on that but today I
just pulled a Patrick door and I'm like
you didn't even know you like wrap it up
if you're if you're what to deck bang
and you'd you have to count it every
time Patrick Norton does this but
doesn't speak yeah
and then you just have to comment on
YouTube and just be like seven tell you
something well sometimes I'll just keep
on talking so that he's standing there
like this you know so hard Shannon is
the biggest troll I'm such a joke Katie
are undry I magically got a beer so
anyways we don't typically talk about
zero days or very recent exploits
because in six months from now when
you're actually watching this it'll
likely be patched and then we'll get the
comment in the YouTube in the youtube
comments section that's like this is old
it will be like yes we've recorded it
six months ago so yeah that actually
happens quite a bit you know the crazy
thing is unfortunately I still remember
a lot of those like commands from very
early episodes so like season 1 it's
like does XP and it's like NAT SH fire
will set up mode disabled and it's like
that doesn't even work anymore it
doesn't I need to go back in time and
fix it all with PowerShell moving so
that Sun today we are looking at a very
recent privilege escalation or a UAC
bypass method because it illustrates
nicely a common workflow of Metasploit
and something that we are so very very
happy to see again the USB rubber ducky
so Darren yes what is privilege
escalation and what is this attack going
to do for us as penetration testers
right so the concept is you know we're
typically used to you know getting on a
box whatever our attack vector may be
and in this case we're talking about the
USB rubber ducky so we're probably our
initial access is going to be social
engineering it's going to be physical
access yes exactly keystroke injection
and in a few seconds get the job done in
this case you know what we typically try
to do is get access get persistence
meaning you know two is one one is none
and we want to be able to maintain
access to that box remotely whatever
that is but once we're on that box we
want to escalate privileges because
typically what happens is we get onto a
machine and we just have the
the user for example our editing
computer you want to do pivoting exactly
I want to be able to like get out of
because that editing computer of their
everything is running as a normal
windows user not as administrator notice
when I tried to change master files on
the Nook which is kind of a pain because
then shannon has to come to me and be
like hey can you log in is admin on the
editing machine because also try running
adobe creative software on a machine
with limited user access right you know
we're trying to do the responsible thing
so you really know what you would have
been able to do that all of those adobe
up you can use this exact technique to
bypass that and upgrade your s you can
escalate your privilege you mean i
should pay attention just kidding always
being attention mary so what are the
steps involved in carrying out this
attack so basically what we're going to
do and this is nice because it kind of
illustrates some common themes with the
USB rubber ducky is that we're going to
create a stage or payload now we've
talked about that recently when you're
doing excellent raishin yeah yeah and
the idea there is basically we're
creating a payload that executes some
other stuff that's like not all
self-contained right right I love a
self-contained yes characters
yeah so nice the problem was with
self-contained or inline payloads is
that while it's really nice that they
have everything in the one package that
they need to do so they never have to
call out to external resources which in
some cases may be blocked right um the
downside is typically they have to be
much bigger because they have to contain
it the entire attack all in one now with
something like keystroke injection using
the USB rubber ducky the bigger it is
the longer it takes this is a staged
payload because when you go ahead and
plug your USB rubber ducky into the
computer it's going to take about 2.7
seconds nice and I can say that long nah
yeah that isn't and I feel like you
could definitely social engineer
somebody in that time you absolutely
could get them out like away from their
computer and I actually get that number
here from this is whose research I'm
actually demonstrating I'm demonstrating
research from skiddy on hack 5 forms
it's a two to four second download and
execute UAC bypass exploit and there's
barely anything displayed on the screen
and it happens in a
you know two to three seconds so we're
going to go ahead and dive right into
this but it uses a current method if
you're watching in December 2016 a
current method that is sep 2015 7 as
well as Windows 7 and you know Windows
8.1 etc to do bypassing UAC by using a
really cool method which involves the
Event Viewer so good stuff go and check
out the hack 5 forums for more research
on that and hey thank you too skinny for
DMing me all of this cool stuff so I'm
hoping that we can use this as an
example of how some of these payloads
work so that is our initial attack
vector so I mentioned the stager so that
stage your payload that the USB rubber
ducky is actually typing out is just a
quick little PowerShell which will
invisibly in the background download and
execute in this case a visual basic
script and what that visual basic script
so that's our second stage think about
it like a you know an Atlas 5 rocket
where every time you know you you know
you burn off your fuel and then you
jettison that stage because it's done
its job and then the next stage takes
over and then gets you to the moon
obviously yeah obviously yeah I'm a
rocket scientist
well vintage space you should watch it
it's good to stop watching go watch
fidget space then come back the idea
there is that that visual be is basic
script or second stage in the background
invisibly downloads and executable and
then runs that so it's a stager to run
stager to run finally our payload ok got
it but it makes it so that it executes
silently and quickly and we like it and
it brings up a lot of different kind of
techniques and it brings up setting up
our meterpreter listener because in the
end what we're gonna do what are we
actually executing yes what are we
executing we're getting a reverse shell
on a machine where we're going to be
able to escalate privileges out of just
that user privileges and get into system
privileges which is kind of like route
on Windows oh that's fun yeah so I'm
excited about this and so that's that's
pretty much what we're doing alright so
I think the first thing that we need to
do is actually create the payload yes
what do you think I think you are
absolutely correcting you know what
this has been made very simple for us
because there is on github
skitty Tech has actually put up on his
github the UAC
D rubber ducky wow this is yeah complete
with the ASCII art and everything
massive right so got comments mm-hmm I
love code that is well-documented yes
there's a video demonstration and
everything you know so basically all we
have to do is take this over to and I'm
using a virtual machine for this but I'm
going to grab that and we're going to do
a git clone of this and you're going to
see where he's done like a lot of the
work for us which is awesome so we're
going to this is going to create our
payload for us we're going to go ahead
and CD over to that get repository we
just cloned and you'll see we've got a
couple of text files
I'll get the PMD exactly so that's
what's going to do all the magic so what
we want to do is execute that with
Python so python UAC - duck py and then
look at this nice walks us right through
it so we can decide to do this with or
without the UAC bypass we obviously want
it with so we'll choose number two and
then it says okay he's a blazing fast
payload with you a CPI pass please input
the binary payload direct URL so that
right there what is that that is going
to be the URL for the executable that we
want this to run okay
so you just stick in a link that ensign
with dot exe the one from the get
exactly well wherever we end up hosting
it okay so I'm going to host mine on my
website which is Darren dot kitchen
because that is just cool because it
makes sense because that's my name
Fieldy now okay so what I'll do is I
haven't actually created this binary yet
but we will and I'm going to host it on
Darren kitchen slash Bob exe because I
love Metasploit minute all right next
thing is please input your payload save
file name so like update XE so this is
what it's going to save it on the target
machine as okay then it's like okay cool
now we're going to need to generate that
visual basic script and we want you to
paste that raw text somewhere and give
us the URL for it so it's going to be I
don't know let's see we haven't actually
yet this is where it would be nice if it
actually pasted the VBS in line it
doesn't so let me open a new tab and LS
and you'll notice that this UAC duck
payload VBS has just been created so
that's what we need to host online so
I'm just going to go ahead and cat UAC
duck payload VBS and you see this is the
visual basic script and you can see what
it does is it creates this object uses W
shell or W script shell and it goes
ahead and downloads
you know Darrin kitchen slash Bob dad
exe as update dot exe by the way oh
that's smart there are many methods to
do this this just happens to be one of
them and so you know skiddy has gone
through the trouble of making this
awesome tool that creates all of this
stuff worse so let's run with it but I
know just because your immediately being
like oh but C script if it's disabled in
the or W script and now there are so
many ways to skin a cat
so let's skim this one this way and now
that I've done catting that file and
making cat jokes let's go ahead and
upload it sed uh let's see what is it
going to be called I'm going to rename
it I'm going to copy it to I don't know
GGG dot txt because I'm feeling creative
and I'm going to SC p that over to my
username at Darrin kitchen and kitchen
in the root of my web and the root of my
web server there all right so that's
uploaded which means that now I can just
go ahead and if I just pull that up
again I can go over to Darrin kitchen /
GGG txt and it should be there and there
you go okay so that is going to be the
URL so let me go back here and just
paste that in so it's HTTP whoops ah
this could easily be HTTP I just did it
as HTTP but whatever it's just a demo
moving on now this will be named as I
don't know update VBS sounds pretty good
so it went ahead and generated our ducky
script txt
so I'm going to go ahead and LS and
you'll see it right there I can cat
where is it it's called ducky script
you'll see it's a very small payload it
just does a delay 750 GUI are weights
100 milliseconds types in this power
shell which downloads and execute this
txt as this VBS in the temp directory at
its center so to make this go really
quick I'm just going to go ahead and
actually head over to doc toolkit comm
which if you haven't been to check it
out this is awesome there's a payload
generator with premade scripts for lots
of different operating systems where you
can just check boxes to decide what
exactly you want to do and then you fill
in the blanks okay
it also has a encoder and a decoder
actually that's pretty cool but I'm just
going to use the encoder here paste that
in I'm going to choose United States
because that's going to be my target and
generate script and say okay and now
I've got my inject up in and I can go
ahead and just save this inject bin - or
nask us that sounds like a fantastic
place to put it
but I just want to demonstrate that
because a lot of people sometimes get
hung up on ducking coders because
there's Python one and the Java one and
a few just feeling like you want to go
to a web site and are you feeling fancy
today feeling fancy okay so what about
that executable that you were working on
for that we're going to have to use part
of Metasploit so MSF venom there's also
MSF payload and MMS FPC and this is a
little bit outside of the scope of our
normal realm so I'm going to point to
you - Moo bik's Metasploit minute on the
hak5 channel for more on this but
basically what we're going to do is use
MSF venom to generate a reverse shell
executable well it's going to be using
meterpreter reverse tcp for windows and
that is what's going to go ahead and
execute now again this could be anything
we could be executing calc dot exe
because we feel special uh in this case
I want to get a reverse shell so that's
exactly what we're going to do so let's
head back over to our to our cally box
over here and I'm going to go ahead and
just run MSF venom and we're going to
give it a architecture of x86 because
that's going to do the Sheen we're
exploiting and then tell it the plot
form is plat if I can spell is Windows
and then we're going to go ahead and
specify a payload with tack P now that
payload is going to be Windows shell and
then reverse underscore TCP just like we
normally would and here we actually
specify the options for that payload
this is just the same as if we were
running it right through Metasploit l
host and in this case I don't know the
IP address of this machine let's find
out if config this is going to be the IP
address that our reverse shell calls
back to so in this case I'm using the IP
address of this Cali box because it's on
the same land as our target Windows box
over here on the left just for the
demonstration so I set the L host to
whatever IP is so this would be like the
say the IP address of our meterpreter
machine sitting in the cloud okay it's
everybody see enough yeah you just have
one of those sitting there waiting for
meterpreter session for whenever I
definitely have one set up right now you
know moving to several and and we I just
think we had one when we got a tech
support Li wait don't have one because
move X has them right we just sent him
to move X fix enjoy a couple of shells
yeah I'll talk about how Microsoft
called me earlier and how that would
have been so good that would have been
useful anyway so now we have just
specify the port so this will be the L
port and we're going to use the for for
for for because we're awesome and this
is going to be an exe and then finally
we're gonna specify the output as Bob
dot exe because we were awesome okay
alright so that's been created we see
our little Bob DXE right here now I need
to go ahead and host that and remember I
said that it was going to be a daredevil
kitchen that kitchen slash what did you
call it
Bob dot exe okay so I'm going to SCP
that over to my host
all right so now that is hosted in the
cloud cool well that was easy enough
right okay so now how about the
meterpreter listener because that's
important - is that just the same as
we've done before with the Wi-Fi
pineapple in the rubber ducky pretty
much I mean you've been in Pentos with
AK v number of times now to know that
that's a very common thing we want to
always get remote access to our networks
or our devices to be able to
administrate them meterpreter is a
fantastic tool for that don't get me
wrong
love me some netcat but meterpreter i'm
a girl but their trip the bird I'm a big
fan isn't it cut right well let's go
ahead and set up a listener okay and so
for that
we'll just fire up msf console and
hopefully we get the cow
we didn't get the cow that doesn't
necessarily mean that everything is
going to fail although we did get cow it
would have been way better so we're
going to use the exploit multi handler
that's pretty awesome alright and we'll
set what can show our options but really
we just we know that we just need to set
our L Houston Airport like from before
so set our L host to that IP address we
used before set the L port to four four
four four and I'm going to set exit on
session to false that one isn't listed
in the show options but it's a fantastic
option that move X is explained before
on Metis one minute that just makes sure
that your session doesn't you're
meterpreter session doesn't die if it
closes it'll automatically respond which
is good because there's nothing worse
than like having a shell and then it's
like that time that you saw a
spreadsheet on the scammers desktop and
then it just disappeared scamming the
scammers so okay
finally let's go ahead and actually run
this as a job so exploit with the exit
exploit tak J so we're going to go ahead
and run that as a job all right now
here's the thing I forgot to bring a USB
rubber ducky in here with me oh you know
what there's one right yes ripped off
but not now we've demonstrated how to do
this a number of times we have that
inject op bin that I just saved on the
NASS I just copy that inject a bin file
to the micro SD card of the USB rubber
ducky pop that SD card in the duct right
plug the duck into the computer and it
executes the keystrokes yeah since the
majority of duck like development is
this lather rinse repeat of like you
know testing on your target and then
making it better the nesting it yeah
we're just going to go ahead and do this
the same way that we would while we were
doing research which is to manually do
it ourselves
okay cool because again we're just
emulating keystrokes with USB rubber
ducky because otherwise I don't feel
like breaking one out so in that case
let me just go ahead and take a look at
that script and we'll just type it out
manually so over here if I cat the ducky
script you'll see that it hits okay so
it hits Windows key R so I'm going to do
Windows key are great then it types in
this powershell and
hit Center so I'm going to go ahead and
copy that PowerShell hang on I can use a
mouse and I'll go ahead and here and hit
paste and then I'm going to switch back
over to this window so we can see what's
going on in Metis light when I hit enter
and a window pops up and then disappears
and that's it
okay okay the rest of it is happening up
in the cloud so at this point it's
downloading our VBS script or VBS the
script is running invisibly in the
background that our VBS script is
downloading the executable the
executable is running and in just a
moment we now have a shell now it's
sending the stage because remember this
is a stage interpreter so there's
several stages to this and that's been
sent and we now have session one open
fantastic if I run sessions I can now
see that I have one meterpreter session
nice I have it from this Windows machine
it's logged in as DK that's just a
regular user and I've got its IP address
everything else so let's go ahead but
it's just a regular user it is and let's
go ahead and verify that by interacting
with the session okay so I'll go ahead
and do sessions tak I for interact and
then I'm going to choose the session ID
number one so this session right here
alright now I have interpreter prompt
I'll go ahead and pull up a shell
alright great so now I'm in the command
prompt there if I run a Who am I you'll
see I am the user DK which is just a
regular user so like this user right
here doesn't have you know that many
privileges right well let's go ahead and
exit out of this shell and talk about
this one command which sounds cool and
many people get confused about it it's
called get system get system so system
is like route that sounds oh okay I was
going to say it sounds similar to
something you can run and I believe it's
netcat where it just gives you all the
information about the computer right so
that's a meterpreter command that would
give you information about the computer
and if you gets this info or something
of that nature a get system transitions
you from whatever privileges you're
right now and then steps you into a
system
if you have system system is like root
so if you don't have system running this
isn't magically going to get you root on
a system it's just for switching
contests okay but it demonstrates here
that we were previously as a regular
user and now I'm going to go ahead and
run get system and it says boom got
system via technique one name pipe
impersonation so we are now in memory
slash admin woohoo Wow I run shell again
and run Who am I I am now anti-authority
system which means if I wanted to like
copy I don't know like I get echo foo
into bar did that and cool and then I
mess up my redirection because I'm on
Windows and I'm expecting it to be Linux
though regardless I am now running is
really cool yeah we can do all sorts of
cool stuff like check this out I could
do go back to meterpreter and run
screenshot oh and now it's saved a
screenshot that I can just take that URL
or that UNC it all f2 it's not the
desktop screen shot yeah
paste that in there and Lu that not so I
can now see exactly everything that
that's awesome
it's doing you could do all sorts of
things with that oh you know well and
that that's where this ends because it's
like great guy you're running as rid on
that Windows box and showing you the
techniques that are typically used yeah
in a scenario of you know using social
engineering and keystroke injection
right to run a staged payload that grabs
network resources that does a privilege
escalation technique to get you a
reverse shell as route or system and all
of this happens just because of that USB
rubber ducky command that takes like two
seconds it does it and a little bit of
setup it does it because of there's a
bug in Event Viewer and yeah and you
should definitely go and check out the
hack five forms because there's a great
write-up by skiddy over here on this and
you know go and check out you know
there's so much to this go ahead and
check it out because it's an active
development there's cool stuff on the
github but there's going to be links in
the show notes if you want to continue
contributing to this awesome

hack 5 at hack 5 Darren at snaps just
got my Evie trying to evolve into a
hacky on she doesn't know she needs a
pineapple to evolve oh I have super cute
so cute she's surrounded by what are
they look like antennae yeah they look
like antennas but they might not sure
let us look at us super cute I love it
and Nokia TV's my favorites so I think
since she needs a pineapple to evolve
