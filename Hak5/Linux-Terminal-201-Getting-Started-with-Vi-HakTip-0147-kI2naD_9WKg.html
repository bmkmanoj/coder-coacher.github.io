and this episode of Hawk tip is brought
to you by Atlassian welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are talking VI VI is a text editor
similar to G edit or nano but it is
somewhat abstract and it's kind of hard
to grasp trust me when I first started
using VI I was a little confused and yes
VI is the correct pronunciation by the
Creator
now while G edit and nano can be used on
graphical user interfaces VI can be used
without a GUI for servers that don't
necessarily have that capability VI gets
its name because it's a visual editor as
opposed to just a line editor a most
distros on Linux come with VI or vim
which is VI improved now to login to
your VI all you have to type is VI into
your terminal like this so in my example
you can see that I have them VI improved
installed on Linux Ubuntu to quit all
you have to do is type : Q or : Q
exclamation mark either of those will
work for my operating system however
yours might have one or the other
working for it if you main changes that
you don't want to save all you have to
type is that : Q or : Q exclamation if
you want to pass by entry to a text file
type V and then make up your text file
so in my example I'm going to use by
example dot txt now as you can see I am
writing to a new text file called
example dot txt the mode that you
started is called command mode which
means that many keys on your keyboard
can control them or VI as commands and
won't give you the normal output output
of a keyboard so for example that Q
would quit instead of just typing Q now
if you want to type something first you
use the command I for insert and then
you can do your typing so in my example
I could type in I have five rules like
that and it'll actually be saved on
my text file as hack five rules once you
are done editing a VI doc you can save
by hitting : w also in regular command
mode l hjk and the arrow keys will move
you around so for example arrow keys
down and up and the same things will
happen with K L and J and all of those a
few other things to keep in mind with
other moves that you want to do in that
default mode which is called normal mode
in VI you can also move around with the
number 0 shift 4 or shift 6 wbg and then
page up and page down so for my example
in this I can write a bunch of stuff to
VI and then use these controls to move
around in normal mode so page up and
page down is going to page up and page
down arrow keys again shift for shift 6
W B and number 0 so basically these are
going to let you jump around in your
text document to different places for
example one thing that I did was hit V
which is going to take it to the end of
a line another one was W which takes it
to the beginning of the next line etc
etc so just test out all of those
different commands so that you can fully
understand what each of them does
whenever you're in normal mode now you
can also use you to undo or you can use
a capital A to append a line or a
lowercase 0 or an uppercase 0 to add a
new line and then you have a capital X
that can delete a character wherever the
cursor is and then DD will delete the
current line DW D G those will all work
to with the comparable commands so you
would just add D to the beginning of
whatever command that you want to use so
for example that DG that I just did that
deleted the line to the end of file
while G by itself goes to the last line
of the file now anytime you use D for
delete it actually just cuts your text
into a clipboard so then you can paste
it back with P the Y command can be used
kind of like the D command to get
copying instead of deleting lastly I us
wanted to share capital J which is
basically
going to let you append two lines
together so for example if I want to
append kirby rocks and watch all the
things I hit capital J and it'll append
those two lines together now we're going
to take a quick break because I know
that was a lot of information feel free
to reverse and listen back through it
again if you need to but we will be
right back with more information about
VI right after this break today nearly
anything is possible and if we can dream
it
teams can build it so how do you bring
everyone together to create what's next
the solution teaming up with that lassi
and the makers of collaboration software
that lets teams work and communicate
better together
you can assign track and manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA create and
share content organize results and bring
team members up to speed with the
flexibility of confluence instant
message or video chat with your team
from any device with the freedom of
HipChat and test review and manage code
in real time that's the power of fit
bucket you know that we do a lot of
coding around here I've used bit bucket
to share code snippets with my
co-workers and get their feedback so
that I can make better segments for you
guys whenever I'm learning new coding
languages you can visit Atlassian comm
to learn more and see how JIRA
confluence HipChat in bitbucket give
your team everything you need to
organize discuss and complete shared
work at lesson helping teams everywhere
team up to create what's next
Atlassian comm we're back with more VI
so let's get to searching you can
actually search in VI which is kind of
like you would any other word document
but instead of using control F like you
would on the internet or in a document
you just type F so for this example I'm
on the first line and I'm gonna move all
the way to the beginning you do have to
be on the right line that you want to
search so I'm gonna type f k f r-fl and
so on and so forth you can continue
searching for that same thing using the
semicolon if you want to search for word
you can type forward slash and then your
word and hit enter so I'll type in /b
with a capital K and then hit enter and
it'll take me to the beginning of Kirby
type N and
go to the next word found in this
example I only wrote Kirby once so it's
not going to find any additional Kirby's
now for search you're in a place you can
use the colon for an X command this is
the same thing that we use for : Q for
quit in colon W for right and then you
type the line was something you would
like to replace so for example if I
wanted to replace the first line which
is a lowercase H in hack five to an
uppercase H in hack five I would use a
/h hack five with lowercase is in
forward slash capital H in hack five to
find hack five and then replace it with
that uppercase H in hack five because it
is a proper noun now if bi or VI asks
you for confirmation you can choose Y
for yes and for skip a for all or Q for
quit one for just once and then quit and
then ctrl e or control Y for scrolling
up and scrolling down now for editing
more than just one file you can type by
file1.txt for one file or type of I file
one txt file two txt so this is very
similar to any other command that you
use in the Linux terminal where you can
edit two different text documents at
once so you just stick them right next
to each other and it'll hold them in
little buffer spaces for you to edit now
if you want to switch between VI open
files which I only have one file here
but I'll show you the command you'll
first escape to get back into your
regular mode your command mode and then
type : n or colon capital n now if you
type : e alternatively this will open a
file in VI next to the current one that
is open instead of just closing one and
opening the other you can copy a whole
line of information from one file to
another with either y Y or P commands
again now lastly if you want to stick a
whole file into your second text
document first you would want to open
and view that second file in VI and then
type : our file - txt after you have
stuck your cursor wherever you want the
file to to appear so now that you know
VY or at least you know a little bit
about V to get around you can exit with
Z
z or you can exit with : Q to just save
and exit : w q to save and quit or : w
and then write your new name txt to
write a new name for that file that you
want to say oh that was a lot of
information I know it was VI is very
confusing it's not like G edit at all
but you can let me know what you think
and if you want me to go over any other
commands in VI as well in the future
send me a comment below or you can email
us tips at hack v org and make sure to
check out hack v for more great stuff
and just like this we just got back from
DEFCON by the way it was a lot of fun
and we got lots of interviews so
definitely check those out and of course
if you're watching on youtube make sure
to hit the subscribe button
we just hit 250 K subscribers on YouTube
I'm super super happy and excited about
that but I want to see where we can go
from here with that I am Shannon Morse
and I am reminding you to trust your
