crash space on this segment of pack five
this segment of hack five is brought to
you by goto assist so here we are
hi dear and welcome to crash face so
we've been around for about two and a
half years now we're located in culver
city this is our front room we teach all
of our main events and our public stuff
out here we also have a little art
display up in the front as we show off
projects are members of work done and
and other things that are going on so
the back of the room is set up for our
members to work oh wow it's just like a
bunch of different rooms than you assign
each room each room has a different
purpose so this is sort of electronics
this is a several different 3d printers
the buco bot made by one of our members
he runs a shop out of Pasadena a couple
rep wraps electronics test equipment
logic programmers all that kind of stuff
is in this shop as well as sewing we've
had a couple projects going on with that
and wearable computing lately so this is
the board of the primary work areas
behind you you have our our laser cutter
our MakerBot a bunch of electronics year
drill presses test equipment radio gear
all back here and these work benches get
used by our members for all the
different projects they're working on so
everybody has a different interest we've
got some wearable computing we've got a
bunch of blinking light projects that
we've done we did a mobile rave recently
that rolled around on the back of a
truck we could roll it in front of dance
floors we've currently got a bunch of
drone projects going on we've got some
classes on Amazon services coming up in
the near future so it's whatever our
members are really interested in what
you see is primarily hardware or
software okay we stick to you know we
stick to stuff you can do on a desktop
right so we've done everything from
electronics designed to software
projects to you know it's installations
and lights and art projects so we got it
we've got a good mix and workroom the
kitchen slash story
slash hazardous chemicals all these lows
this is our this is our dirty shop this
is where all the machining tools are
mills and lathes and drill presses and
and routers and this is where they're
going to make a mess when they carve
into metal and wood and all the rest of
that and then the back shop we've got
welding here we've got band saws we've
got table saws we've got a kiln right
we've got stock supplies so we sort of
take over the whole space we got so much
stuff in here and people pull out the
tools as they need them and crank on
their projects so have you been involved
in the the community here at crash space
and how do they find out about it and
you know what do you guys do so the way
you really want to get a hold of us is
start on the member list right we have a
mailing list called crash face org and
it's a crash based group on Google
Groups and that's a great way to get
started because you can just join the
group you can jump in the discussions
every Tuesday night we have a member
meeting and particularly the second
Tuesday of the month is our open public
house night so we can basically show off
our projects that people have been
working on give tours and and get people
introduced to the space and then they're
welcome to join and become a member and
and come use the space themselves so
it's the primary reaction when new
members or new potential members come to
your house is what are you here so
everybody likes the projects and they
like the demos that we get to show off
the big thing that starts off is sort of
what am I going to do with this and the
answer is whatever you want right we
really want people to pick up their
project and jump in and we've got such a
broad range of expertise and everything
from machining to electronics to art and
so when you hit a problem on whatever
kind of project you're working on
there's somebody in our group that can
help you and can get you past your hump
and as long as you're willing to dive in
and start doing something they'll get
you through to the end
exactly exactly we all share our ideas
and it's a lot of inspiration right so
and so's building a cape right now that
he's gonna put lights in and that might
spread an idea to somebody else who
wants to do their wearable computing
project and that's the way all these
things get started
crash based on org is our main website
you can look at our event calendar see
what's coming up if there's something
interesting come on by the space and
join our mailing list and jump in and
