turtle basics today we're going to be
unboxing our land turtle and getting it
set up for the first time and here it is
it looks just like a USB Ethernet
adapter in fact it works just like one
as well the difference being it's
actually a smart USB Ethernet adapter if
you will that runs turtle modules that
us do some amazing things like remote
access man in the middle we can do some
network intelligence-gathering it's
really great for penetration testers
systems administrators tech enthusiasts
alike and we're going to go ahead and
get this set up using Windows I have a
couple of virtual machines here the
setup procedure will be very similar in
Linux or Mac but I wanted to show the
windows side first because it does not
have a native SSH client so it's the
only one that that's a little bit more
complex but this will be pretty easy so
the only download you'll need is
yourself a copy of putty if you're using
you know Linux for example of course you
already have SSH just type in SSH and
then the IP address of your choosing so
with that said let's understand a couple
of basics about the land turtle before
we get going
first of all let's appreciate the fact
that this really is a device with two
Ethernet now it does I know it doesn't
look like that but once you're on the
inside you'll notice that you have
similar to any other embedded Linux
system with Ethernet eth0 and ETH one
two independent Ethernet interfaces and
by default these guys are bridged which
means that it's going to allow the
Internet traffic the network traffic
whatever have you to run between these
two I say that because it's not obvious
at first because this USB port here this
USB plug is actually not only powering
the device but it is also an Ethernet
adapter in fact it's a generic Realtek
Ethernet adapter as you'll see when you
plug it in for the first time and I say
that because we should understand the
the direction that things are going if
you will so first of all the by default
the USB side that Ethernet connection is
going to be the DHCP server and it will
offer to what
her host machine you plug it into it
we'll offer an IP address by default
it's in the 172 1684 dot X range and
likewise the actual you know the actual
cat5 cat6 you know your your normal
Ethernet plug here on the back this is
by default going to be looking for an IP
address from a DHCP server so this is
the client side where it will want to
accept an IP address from the land that
you drop it on that said you can of
course set both of sides up for static
if that is the configuration that you
need it's fairly simple but out of the
box this side is going to give an IP and
this side is going to get an IP so with
that let's go ahead and get it plugged
in I already have one plugged into my
system will virtually attach it to the
Windows machine here and the boot up
I'll just show you using a USB battery
pack again USB power means it can you
know run off just about anything that's
USB so what you'll notice is immediately
you get the green light turns on that
indicates the power and then the boot up
sequence is going to start that's a 30
second boot up sequence and you'll
notice it by the blinking amber LED so I
already have one plugged in here let's
go ahead and get it onto our system so
in this VM I will choose removable
devices and you'll notice it shows up as
a real tech 10100 LAN and we will choose
connect and our normal driver
installation here and with the default
driver installed we can go ahead and ssh
into the device and get it set up with
the latest version of the software so
for that we will of course need putty
putty is a open source and free SSH
client for Windows go ahead and download
this and what we want to do is very
first under window and translation we
want to switch from utf-8 to iso 8859-1
1998 just go ahead and do that the
difference being by choosing this the
and see graphics will actually look
better otherwise you might get some
garbled stuff it won't actually change
any of the handling of the device but it
will look a little bit better so you may
want to save that as a profile and I'll
show you how to do that now enter in our
IP 172 dot 16 dot eighty four dot one
and I'm gonna go ahead and name this
turtle and hit save and now from anytime
I can just go ahead and double click
turtle here I will accept this signature
I will log in as root and the default
password sh3 llz first time ever logging
into this we're going to be prompted to
create a new password and we're graded
by the mainland turtle menu go to use
the arrow keys to navigate enter goes in
escape goes back go to config and at
this point we will be able to check for
updates but not of course until actually
plug ethernet cable into the back of our
land turtle plugin Ethernet cable from
your network something providing DHCP
something providing an internet
connection and once that cable has been
plugged into the land turtle we can go
ahead back to our menu here and choose
check for updates and this downloads the
latest version of the software installs
it some things to keep in mind while it
installs it does wipe the entire device
so if you had previously set one up and
you have some special stuff on it you'll
want to back those files up off of it
also keep in mind that whenever it
updates the latest firmware and
downloads and installs that it's going
to go ahead and reset the password back
to that default sh3 llz this process
takes about five minutes so just sit
still the connection here you'll see
it'll download the upgrade file and it
validates the file and it says do not
unplug the land turtle it takes about
five minutes and we'll disconnect we get
disconnected that's expected it says
this session right here it says this
session will now close and there we go
the LED is stopped blinking because it's
finished booting up and in just a moment
you'll see a special blink pattern
indicating that the computer to which
it's connected has received an IP
address from it and there it is blink
blink blink blink
the second blink is longer than the
first
it's on/off and then long on and there
we go and after that just go back to
regular Network activity and that's it
now we're updated so for more videos
like these check out LAN turtlecom and
i'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
