the US next year the Internet of Things
is perfect for spying all that more
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Patrick Norton and this is threat
wire for February 10 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom hey and thanks to
everyone who supports us on patreon.com
slash threat Y quote we are taking all
necessary steps to ensure that our users
can continue to enjoy our products and
services safe in the knowledge that
their data is secure that was Alan Wong
the chairman and group CEO of VTech
Holdings Limited they make the VTech
choice so last year back in December
that was that was v-tex response after
the horrendous security practices and
VTech led to data and photos from 6.3
million users of their portals well
exposed vulnerable stolen and out on the
interweb and generally speaking I hate
the whole life the children we must
protect the children motivation for
security I don't beat on that drum
seriously the data in this case was
basically from portals from kids
accounts with like kids photos and stuff
Lee tact went on to say this is the
interesting part VTech went on to say
like they they they've they've hired a
security company and and they're looking
at this this attack which was
coordinated and sophisticated remember
that phrase coordinated and
sophisticated that's what VTech said it
was a single person acting alone and in
the words of security researcher Troy
Hunt quote the level of sophistication
involved here is being able to count
that sounds funny but you need to take a
look at the article that mr. hunt wrote
know VTech cannot simply absolve itself
of security responsibility he inside the
article he pretty much enumerates the
major flaws in v-tex portals for its
children's products and to call out
VTech on its new Terms of Service which
states in all caps all caps people that
means shouting on the internet you
acknowledge and agree that any
information you said or received during
your use of the site may not be secure
and may be intercepted or later acquired
by unauthorized parties
our security sucks we may or may not do
something about it but if you use our
products deal with it oh wow so what
makes this really awesome is this week
VTech pretty much announced that its
buying leapfrog the other craptastic
children's toy manufacturer I don't buy
toys for these companies for my kids
because for the most part they're pretty
mediocre you shouldn't either and if you
do do yourself a favor do not use their
online storage or services unless you
feel that exposing your information to
the Internet is okay
would you look a lot around here about
Jeff Bezos using Shannon's echo to
listen in to the sounds of Shannon
folding laundry at least I do but in
reality it's really doubtful that Amazon
pays attention to anything that an echo
here so it doesn't have the Alexa in
front of it and I'm just gonna say that
Alexa one more time cuz I know everyone
out there within Alexa it's gonna be
really irritated and then this morning I
see that US Director of National
Intelligence James clapper told the
Senate this week I think it's just this
is great cuz I'm not even wearing my
tinfoil hat quote in the future
intelligence services might use the
Internet of Things for identification
surveillance monitoring location
tracking and targeting for recruitment
or to gain access to networks or user
credentials I'll just let that sit there
and if you're wondering what's open
check out the most excellent search
engine known as show Dan dot IO that's
the search engine for Internet connected
devices
oh boy webcams you say that's not new
well take a look at some of the other
stuff that's on there and then
contemplate what a well-funded
three-letter agency could get access to
if it wanted think of all those nest
thermostats out there like the one I
just pulled off the wall of my house all
those children's toys I mean heck VTech
will probably just put it into the Terms
of Service right hey there's a great
read up on consumers comm it's called
dig net neutrality killed broadband
investment like Comcast AT&amp;amp;T nice look
at telecom broadband industry claims the
idea was that the FCC's open Internet
order aka net neutrality would end end
investment industry why and the internet
would stall because they wouldn't spend
any more money and while you might argue
if the telecom and Internet industries
we're business as usual while they fight
net you try
and they are fighting it tooth and nail
in the courts and with lobbyists and
with yeah astroturf agency it's a mess
right basically everybody who sells
Internet access does not want net
neutrality because they look at the
opportunity to make players pay to get
access to you as something they should
be able to do because they want all the
money so great example AT&amp;amp;T says they're
dropping twenty two billion on capital
spending in 26 2016
they spent 21 billion last year and by
the way the 21 billion they spent last
year doesn't even include the forty nine
billion they spent on Direct TV
all the while claiming that neutrality
was a quote war on infrastructure
investments to Majan what they would
have spend or might have spent this year
if there wasn't net neutrality huh it's
good read go check it out and while I'm
talking about billions of dollars
somebody get me a cat to pet Tuesday
this week President Obama dropped a
nineteen billion dollar price tag on
improving government and private
cybersecurity known as the cybersecurity
National Action Plan it includes a
commission on enhancing national
cybersecurity what do we need to do to
fix the internet comprised and this is a
good of top strategic business and
technical thinkers from outside of
government including members to be
designated by the bipartisan
congressional leadership it proposes 3.1
billion dollars from modernizing
government IT along with a new federal
chief information security officer a
focus on multi-factor authentication
that's gonna be part of the new national
cybersecurity awareness campaign no
mention of say good back to our free
encryption for the public but I'm sure
they're gonna get around to that because
anybody that comes from the private
sector and is talking to the government
right now thinks that actually not
putting backdoors and encryption is a
positive thing for actually the economy
the people security national security
infrastructure yeah encryption we should
we should definitely look into that a
featured comment today comes from
Marquis Richardson who in response to
stingray surveillance in California that
was in last week's threat wire says
threat wire a shell almost as electric
as snub sees hair this time around
preventing surveillance is impossible
unless those whom you communicate with
have the same goal tell friends to use
encrypted communication apps and they
ask why that I ask to see their phone so
I can browse through their messages
which they always respond
so if only people knew using encryption
is the same as keeping your information
to yourself and preventing snoops not
just government's from browsing your
messages thanks for the comment Marquis
and by the way Shannon says yes her hair
is electric hey if you have any thoughts
in today's stories do me a favor leave
them right below I don't want to thank
each and every one of you that supports
threat wire on patreon patreon comm
slash threat wire makes this show
possible
because we want to do it without ads
because if we're doing ads then we walk
for the man and you know what Darren
hates working for the man and so does
Shannon a9 which is why we try to work
for ourselves that's a whole long
conversation but seriously if you find
value from this and you can spare a few
cents in episode please become a patron
at patreon.com slash threat wire and if
you do we may even feature your adorable
fur babies like these ones less that's

for answering that call for your
favorite Ethernet port and/or piece of
hardware ladies and gentlemen we love
doing this show for you keep watching
