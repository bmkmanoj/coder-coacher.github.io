5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop com
welcome the hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and 19 ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're checking
out melty goes in our face because
there's so much going on now you've
already run your first data mine right
if you've watched my last episode which
you better have if you haven't go back
and watch it and then come back to this
one but today I wanted to show you some
more information about how the interface
itself works ie
how to get around how to select items
and what everything actually means
instead of just clicking and not knowing
what the heck we're doing so first off
that entity that you had dragged and
dropped into your graph previously and
if you want to see me do it again I'll
just choose domain and drop it over here
that's called the node you can have
multiple nodes on a graph if you want to
and you can select as many as you want
by dragging your mouse around on them so
if I had patter become on there as
domain I can also do this DNS name so I
can click here I can click there if you
want to choose separate ones or I can
also drag my mouse to choose both of
them at the same time I can also shift
and left-click to pick and choose
similar to using a file directory in
kind of a way you can also pan by
right-clicking and moving your mouse in
a direction so if I right click down on
my mouse green and then I can just move
around on my mouse pad I can move around
like this this is very handy if you have
a huge graph going on with tons and tons
of different nodes to look at and you
can also use your arrow keys to select
one node than another than another if
you wanted to so I can choose the DNS
name node and then I can hit my arrow
key and choose the next one to the left
or the right and go back and forth in
between them with just the arrow keys
now I can also move around in the
overview tab with the left Mouse the
overview tab is this nice little window
up here it's very small but if I left
click and then I move my mouse around I
can easily get around my graph like that
as well and I can choose to focus
centered on separate ones by clicking on
my mouse on the different notes and that
will move the graph back and forth to
center whichever note I want to look at
if you go to all transforms you can see
these little icons next to them so
transforms again that's how you're going
to run your data mine you'll right-click
on your note go to one run transforms
click all-trans flower forms and then
you'll see a list of all the ones
available that you can run so next to
these you'll see these nice little icons
so one is for changing the options for a
transform and the other is a link to an
online wiki help page so for example I
have a question about let's see I'll
choose DNS names so first off we have
this one that's going to give me a nice
little blue highlighted informational
button next to it so it says this
transform will try to discover various
common DNS domains in a domain so that's
cool
I can click on that and I can get a
whole bunch of different options that I
can go through it's very very very
descriptive as well so take some time in
there to learn about all the different
transforms that you have and then if I
go back here to all transforms and
choose another one so I'll choose email
addresses who is info I can click on the
globe and that'll bring up a nice little
wiki page yeah yeah yeah so I'm able to
pull up this nice little wiki page that
gives me information on that transform
called domain to email address so
another easy way to read all about all
the different transforms that you can
get you also see more info if you just
hover over the transform you get that
little blue box that gives you a
description and when you run a transform
a little progress bar is going to appear
at the bottom and it disappears when
it's completed if you want to see what
that looks like I'll choose this one
I'll run a transform let's see
okay so pay attention down here along
this gray bar and you'll see it appear
because it might go kind of quick so I'm
going to hit that there's the progress
bar when it's completed it just
disappears and you get whatever your
node ends up being now I'm going to show
you more after the break as far as what
this interface means and all those
strange little windows and buttons and
things but first
take a quick break the hat shop is hak5
s premier store for all of your
pentesting needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard it can type scripts into
a computer crazy crazy fast like this
week's favorite from Mira div we
couldn't do the show without your
support and we love the scripts that you
guys share in our hak5 forums like this
pineapple auto-connect script of course
we couldn't do it without your support
again so we would like to thank you with
something special use the coupon code
snugs
with any order from the hack shop for
your very own signed hacked tip stickers
thank you so much for supporting the
show we are back with more melty go so
let's go ahead and move on to a button
at the top that sounds really exciting
right it's this weird little steampunky
button up in the left left sidebar this
is called the melty go application
button so you're going to notice a lot
of average options under this menu
including new open save all those fun
things you can also save graphs if you
want to and share them with your peers
and that is a dot MTG X is what it saves
as you can also import and export graphs
if you get them from other people and if
you export all the data from a multi go
collection it'll convert into an empty Z
file and then you can share that with
other multi go users as well you can hit
that little options button next to that
and that is down here hit options and
that's going to bring up a whole bunch
of different options for you
specifically for your multi go account
so you can change everything in here
from different proxies you can set up a
default browser if you want to I can
also mess with my files choose Java
options which is pretty interesting
there's audio options if you want to
listen to the sounds that melt ego makes
transforms you can change options for
those your display is customizable and
then you can choose to set your updates
to do automatically or not automatically
as well if you want there's a couple of
there are other options up at the top as
well in that toolbar but most of them
are pretty obvious you know you've seen
them before so I'm not going to go
through
all those different ones that's pretty
much it for this week I think I talked
enough about the melty go interface but
I'll talk more about the different
panels and whatnot
later on next week so let me know what
