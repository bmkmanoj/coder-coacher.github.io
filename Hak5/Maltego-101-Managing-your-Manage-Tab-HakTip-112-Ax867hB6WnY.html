5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're checking
out more of mal teego's interface
specifically the manage tab so this tab
and if I go over to it real quick BAM
right there so you get a whole bunch of
options in here they are full of ways to
manage and work with the separate
windows on your multi go platform so
starting from the right side this time
not the left but the right and
specifically mal t go three point four
point one is this whole section called
windows
so you'll see close all documents close
other documents overview pallet
properties detail view output and
machines over here if you want to close
or minimize all of your windows such as
this where I can hit close other
documents it will specifically close
whatever graphs that you have open that
you haven't been using that art on the
top screen right now so since I haven't
saved the snubs graph yet it'll ask me
if I want to save before closing I can
hit cancel yes or no obviously so that
one's pretty easy to use you can also
choose to maximize any window with this
section as well for example if I wanted
to let's see I have a whole bunch of
windows over here on the corner and if
you look way over on the right side you
can see overview property view and
detail view so previously you have seen
each of these as a separate window over
on the right side all very small now if
I want to I can close one with a little
X or I can make it minimized again with
the little arrows but I can also
maximize it by choosing one of those up
here so right now I have detailed
property view open so for example if I
wanted to I could open over view so I
can click on overview
there we go so I can click on overview
and then I'll get that graph that you
have seen previously as well so you can
play with all these different windows
selections to see what each one does and
I'll go into further detail in a future
segment but moving on there's also a
little section all about transforms so
that one is right over on the left side
you have discover transforms manage
transforms and local transforms each of
these do something different if you
click on discover transforms first off
you get discover transforms advanced in
background so I'm just gonna click on
regular discover transforms and I'll let
this run for a second
so this is gonna let melty go look
through various seeds for new transforms
that you can then add to your list it'll
let you update then you can just restart
melty go and you'll have brand new
transforms that you can use you can also
just manually add them if you want to or
you can just run this in the background
as a background update as well so manage
transforms on al-quaeda and click cancel
on that manage chant transforms is going
to let you manage known transforms
available and add them to your list if
any were publicly made by the community
for example you may have to accept a
disclaimer to be able to use them and
the disclaimer pretty much says like
we're not liable for anything that might
break on your computer obviously so for
example let's choose this one right here
so it's very very hard to see but in
blue in the status section it will say
disclaimer if there is a disclaimer that
you need to accept or it'll say bready
if you've already chosen to accept it so
I'm going to click on this domain to DNS
schema down here in this section you'll
find more information about that you can
click view disclaimer and accept the
disclaimer whatever it means and then
click close definitely read those
disclaimer saying you know what in the
world you're doing this is also going to
list out everything that you want to see
as far as the status the location of
each one the default set input in output
availability as well and if you want to
you can sort by each of these so you can
look at each thing now that's just one
tab in here there
also transform servers over here this is
going to show you the servers used to
run your specific transforms and then
lastly we have sets so sets are pretty
interesting this lets you group
transforms based on name description and
pretty much whatever else you want to so
under here if I wanted to I could create
a new set and I can name it whatever I
want so down on the list of sets over
here I've created Shannon's phase and
what I can do is just like drag and drop
whichever ones are my favorite so for
example I could say mirror email address
I really like that one I can add it to
this list and then I can just grow my
list over time and find each transform
that I want to based on those separate
lists pretty cool now I'll be right back
with some more information about the
manage tab in just a moment the hack
shop is hack fives premier store for all
of your pen testing needs including one
of my favorites the USB rubber ducky
which looks like a flash drive and it
types like a keyboard it can type
scripts into a computer ridiculously
quickly like this week's favorite from I
asked Yvonne I think that's how you
spell it
it's a script that basically adds a
printer to the target machine so this
could be crazy useful if you have to add
printers to several machines and like an
eight-hour time period at your job hey
there you go so of course we gonna do
the show without your support so we
would like to thank you with something
special you can use the coupon code
snubs with any order for your very own
signed hacked tip stickers and again
thank you so so much for supporting the
show all right we're back and we're
still on the manage tab so I also wanted
to mention the entities section so this
is found way over on the left hand side
way over there and it's very similar to
the transform section you can also
create new entities just like you can
with new transforms so I'm gonna click
new entity type so let's let's you
choose new entity type or you can also
choose advanced now I'm going to run
through this exactly how to use it in a
future episode but just so you know
exists that's where you can find it
managing also lets you import and export
and create new ones and you can also
edit pre-existing ones if you want to
manage you just click on the middle icon
right over here on that select section
choose import/export create your new one
or I can go down here and I can click
those three little dots and I can
basically edit to my heart's content I
can change the name description I can
also add a different icon if I really
hate that icon showing up for my node or
whatever I want if you have created new
ones new notes anything like that and
I'll close out of here you can find
notes over in the center right here you
can also show additional labels and you
can show custom link labels transform
leak labels and you can also choose to
show property effect appearances there's
a ton more information available as well
under melty go if you go to patter bus'
website for this but that's basically
how the manage tab works so it's very
very useful especially if you want to
use those tabs over on the corner all
those different smaller panes like the
overview section the detail view detail
view is really really fun it's one of my
favorites let me show you one thing I
really like to do so I can click on
detail view and let's choose hak5 org
and then I will choose two I'm gonna
minimize these other to you so you can
really see the detail view okay so I can
choose relationships outgoing that's
pretty cool alright let's go down to
something a little bit more interesting
how about hak5 org server so this shows
you little snippets from the website so
I can see everything from there we go so
this is going to show me the
relationships of hak5 org snubs at hak5
org is another note that I've included
in this graph if I scroll down a little
bit though you'll see all these cool
little snippets from the actual website
so it lists a ton of information
straight from the website that you can
basically pick up and do whatever you
want with and then way down at the
bottom you get generated details so this
is going to show you basically when you
created the transform the generation
date what the actual transform was that
generated it
and any kind of sources so where it's
coming from as far as its parent node
you can also get a second source if you
have multiple ones going to the same
child so I thought that was pretty
interesting and I felt it it was really
useful especially if you have a huge
graph so lots and lots of information
coming back and forth let me know what
you guys think below you can send me a
comment below or you can email us tips

sister show as well hack 5 for more
