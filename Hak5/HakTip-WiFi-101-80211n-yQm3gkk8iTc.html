carbonite
welcome to hack tip show where we break
down the concept tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Aaron kitchen and today we're
following up on our discussion a few
weeks back about 802 that 11 standards
with today's latest and greatest that's
right it's 802 11 N or to be more
correct
all right triply 802 11 n track 2009
yeah it's the latest generation wireless
networking standard and it incorporates
so many vast improvements over the
previous 802 that 11 a and G standards
the most substantial of which is an
increase from 54 megabits per second to
a whopping theoretical maximum of 600
megabits per second so to achieve this
though it uses the technique known as
MIMO which combines up to four channels
using four separate antennas
and as opposed to the previous 802 2.11
protocols and can actually use 40
megahertz wide channels in both 2.4 and
5 gigahertz bands now my most stands for
multiple-input and multiple-output and
it's a technology that allows you know
multiple antennas to transmit and
receive simultaneously that's the really
cool part so the math gets a bit complex
but suffice it to say an access point
with two transmitters and two receivers
isn't going to have the theoretical
throughput as say one that has three and
three now my mo also uses such
technologies as precoding spatial
multiplexing and diversity coding which
is a wonderful rathole that leads into
beamforming which is super super cool
but in space time coding and I promise I
won't take a left turn at Albuquerque
here maybe we'll come back to that stuff
later but in short my mo rocks and it's
the reason why your Wi-Fi n gear has
multiple antennas and it's you know
while it's heritage goes all the way
back to the 70s it's a relatively new
technology for wireless communications I
mean the first commercial system wasn't
developed until 2001 and
then in 2005 and 2006 several companies
started building my mo OFDM devices
you remember OFDM from the last hack tip
right anyway
that's what's led to the Wi-Fi Alliance
officially certifying devices based on a
draft spec in 2007 until finally after
11 drafts the 802 dot 11 standard was
actually approved in 2009 and thankfully
you and I don't have to throw away all
our old gear because it's backwards
compatible with the previous standards
much like 802 11 G was with 802 at 11 B
now in just a bit we're going to find
out how a to 2.11 n stacks up against
the previous standards and this week's
giveaway first let's take a quick break
computer disasters eventually happen to
everyone your computer crashes gets
infected the virus you drop it there's
fire theft alien abduction but we get
carbonite online backup before your
disaster then no need to worry because
your files will be backed up
automatically and safely off-site and
it's really easy to get them back plus
you can get to them anytime anywhere
just access your files from a computer
or on your smartphone or iPad with a
free Carbonite app with Carbonite
unlimited backups for your PC or Mac is
just $59 a year that's less than five
dollars a month but when you use the
offer code hak5 to start your free 15
day trial you get two months free if you
decide to buy all the details or over at
carbonite.com and remember to use the
coupon code hak5 to get two months free
with purchase so how does 802 dot 11 n
stack up against the previous standards
well between the use of 2.4 and 5
gigahertz frequencies 20 and 40
megahertz of bandwidth and data rates
between 7.2 and oh yeah 150 megabits per
second I'd say it's quite standard I
mean the for my most streams alone make
it incredibly sexy and coupled with the
same robust modulation technology as a
two 2.11 a it's able to attain
approximately twice the range of the
previous lettered standards and that's
really interesting to see you know how
802 1011 has grown since like 1997 with
the legacy one right and and the
beautiful thing in here is it doesn't
even end there right there's plenty more
standard
under development like ADA 2.11 AC which
would provide even higher throughput
with up to 8 my most spatial streams 80
and 160 megahertz channels and even
better modulation techniques so
theoretical maximum at one six point
nine three gigabits per second yeah
we'll see when that comes along that'd
be nice anyway all right so now it's
time for the giveaway last week I asked
what a two 2.11 standard enables high
powered Wi-Fi equipment to operate with
license in the United States on the
three point six gigahertz spectrum and
the answer is 802 11 why I mean I told
you there's plenty of those standards to
go around right now the standard debuted
in 2007 and allows Wi-Fi gear up to 20
watts and it's mainly used for backhauls
or last mile kind of broadband stuff a
lot of enterprise network stuff anyway
this week what I'd like to know is what
draft started as a study group of I
Triple E 802 11 in 2003 defined how
wireless devices can create static or
ad-hoc mesh networks enter in the
comments and be randomly selected to
receive this year radio that is used
here on hat tip and as always we value
your feedback and suggestions so if
you've got a tip share with me email
tips at hack 5 org and be sure to check
out our sister show hack 5 I'll be there
reminding you to trust your tech no less
welcome to hack chip the show where we
break down the concepts tools and
techniques to go into some of those
great Hollywood films</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
