feed
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're typing
less with keyboard shortcuts now once
you think you've learned the easiest way
to input a command or a control there
seems to always be a new way my goal is
to never need to use my mouse but that
might take a little bit of time so here
are a few tips that can help first off
moving your cursor around so let's go
ahead and pull up one of my old
functions
let's see chmod what did I do earlier
there we go so I had this one running
earlier if I hit control a e F or B I
can move the cursor around from the
beginning the end forward one character
or backwards one character so if I try
this out starting in the middle ctrl a
ctrl E and then go back to the middle
ctrl F move back and B to move forward
to the beginning of the line again
pretty cool and you can also use clear
CLE AR to clear out all of the
information now another really easy one
to do is using these different keyboard
shortcuts to edit the text in your
command you can use ctrl D and T to
delete or exchange the characters at
your cursors location so if I hit ctrl D
I can delete or T to exchange moving it
around
so cool yay a keyboard shortcuts and
there's a whole a couple of different
ones that you can use with alt for
example you can use alt L and alt you to
convert characters to lowercase or
convert them to uppercase so if I try
this out on my example command I hit I
can hit ctrl L and everything is
lowercase and control you
to make everything uppercase now if I go
back to the beginning of that word if I
hit ctrl L again or alt L it'll make
them all lowercase again very cool and
there's this thing called cutting and
pasting which I love this is also for
some reason called killing and yanking I
have no clue where they got that from if
you guys do there's probably some
interesting historical aspect to that so
let me know if feedback a head fight
that orga if you could now killing and
yanking you can use ctrl K and you to
kill the text from the cursor to the end
of the line or from the cursor to the
beginning of the lines so if I hit ctrl
ok it'll erase everything from the end
and then control you to erase everything
to the beginning very cool you can also
use alt D and backspace to kill the text
from the cursor to the end of the word
or from the cursor to the beginning of
the word and control Y to take text that
has been cut and insert it at the cursor
location now tune in after the break to

alt question mark to show a list of
completions that you can use in all
asterisk to insert all of those
possibilities now first off all question
