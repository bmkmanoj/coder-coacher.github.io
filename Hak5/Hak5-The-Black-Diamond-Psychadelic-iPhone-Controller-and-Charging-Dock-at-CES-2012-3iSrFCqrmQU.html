for hak5 i'm darren kitchen at CES 2012
and now for something completely
different we're taking a look at the
black diamond and black diamond to these
right here are iphone chargers but
there's something really cool about them
what you're noticing here are some
psychedelic colors and this orb here if
I slip it into will amplify those
psychedelic colors if i push it down
it'll click and actually becomes a
passive speaker through the table right
there charging my phone that what's
really interesting about this in
addition to discharging it and making
some cool whip Keller's is that it will
change the color based on the events
happening so it'll pulse a different
color if it's charging it'll pulse when
it's finished charging it'll glow green
if I've if I'm receiving a call and say
I have my phone on mute it'll actually
start flashing in blue or if I miss the
call little pulse and slow blue so that
I know that I have voicemail or
something like that waiting for me and I
just love just the fun quirkiness of it
because you were going to have a charger
by your bedside why go with just a
standard plug that everybody else has
when you could have something like this
now the Black Diamond one is available
now it's forty nine dollars you can find
it on Amazon the Black Diamond two is
coming out for $59 well you know I just
touched it here this is so cool when you
touch it you can actually make it go to
the next track which come on like that's
just nifty and to turn it on and off you
just simply plug your phone in and out
of it and it will turn on and off and
this is really a nifty so go ahead and
you know just Google up the Black
Diamond bi yan touch and for continued
coverage of CES 2012 button head over to
revision 3.com / CES and of course we
want to thank Ford for powering our CES
coverage no one likes the difficulty and
the precision needed when parallel
parking but when you use the active park
assist feature found on the focus you
remove the stress by using ultrasonic
sensors to identify an open parking spot
pair this with the rear view camera and
the car practically parks itself for you
whoa okay that was awesome thanks to
Ford for powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
