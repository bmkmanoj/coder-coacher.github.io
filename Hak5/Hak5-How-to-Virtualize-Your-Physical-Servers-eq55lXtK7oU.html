by go daddy
Squarespace Gamefly and viewers like you
hey everybody welcome this week's
episode of hack 5 I'm Matt let's talk
i'm darren kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse
and we are here to bring you your weekly
dose of Technol us because that's how we
do it here exactly a little thing we've
you know kind of patented stole from
somewhere else but we've patented it
that's how we roll
0.75 we stole it but anyway we're not
keeping track no good to be back yeah so
you know been a while it's kind of been
you know damn near a month since I've
been inside the the premises that I said
you were gone for two episodes which in
an Internet land means like a decade I
understand but still you know yeah so
they haven't written you off yet we kept
your user account on forms Thank You Man
a problem that's I was logging into IRC
from home oh really yeah
so how how was your trip up north oh it
was good
you know just real quick my father
passed away yeah it sucks but um you
know he and I got to say what we needed
to say and so my sister got married in
front of him at the hospital was real
nice Wow
so there was a wedding - yeah I got
there Wednesday she got married Thursday
and he passed the next Wednesday so he's
kind of waiting for that kind of kind of
stuff but yeah anyway I started bring
down the show but it's good it's good
we've all been there yeah I've been
there and well so uh today I have
brought a sexy back
yes you have and I'm looking forward to
diving right in because you're bringing
up a topic that is near and dear to my
heart as I am trying to figure out how
far along are you oh I'm pretty far
along now I've got I've got quite a few
things where I'm about I've used about
40% of my my RAM and my disk really oh
yeah good machines you got six really
yeah you're not fully migrated yet oh no
and I'm not fully migrated but I'm
making sure that like how I had it
before was I had like three servers to
work with right so I
having everything to do like triple duty
I had like a domain controller also
running as an exchange server also
running as you know lots of different
things I mean I might as well made my
you know secondary to main controller on
the same TV series yeah I was doing
crazy that you're not supposed to
do exact so I'm segmenting it all out
and making it the way that it's supposed
to be so I mean what can you do well
yeah not a whole lot but but what we're
gonna be talking about today is physical
to virtual I touched on this and did a
brief segment for you guys if you were
going to be doing you know the the whole
like workstation kind of thing VMware
Workstation and stuff like that but now
we're actually going to be connecting
and taking this machine and dumping it
on to the ESXi server yeah which is nice
because we don't have to worry about
transitioning files and stuff like that
and adding the inventory it doesn't all
automatically I totally would have done
that with my existing infrastructure if
my bits were not borked you know I'm
saying
I know exactly there's something nice
about having a press start and then also
virtual physical so we can go back you
just need a little bit more horse power
we're gonna we're going to do some bsd
jails no no that's not a friend of the
open source that's what i'm gonna be
talking about tomcat here we're talking
to patchy love good open source
foundation stuff and java because it
still exists it turns out and a lot of
enterprises needs to run software and so
if you're in a situation where you need
to support that kind of stuff it's the
only game in town we're gonna talk about
the fun scenic way to do it and it's
laying the foundation for some stuff i'm
gonna do next episode with some happy
good open source fun this is the thing
that we're gonna start doing is you know
series cuz I like the whole series I
didn't have enough I didn't have to
think I'm sorry that I mean like the
last two episode where like the episode
it was it was talking about disk
encryption and then we're talking about
the cold boot and then talking about
analyzing the memory - I mean and it all
is driven by the the the feedback from
the viewers and it's all just driven by
what we're doing day to day so no I mean
it's yeah there's a series I mean if you
watch
there's arcs and whatever yes I sit down
on those episodes man I don't watch half
of them nerely
Paul doesn't either Paul have you ever
watched an episode of hack 5 Wednesday
that a boy he went the first three years
never watching an episode that does not
surprise me yeah and then watch them all
after the third season he goes this is
horrible anyway why is my name is
sociated this alright we're rambling on
and off so let's go ahead and find out
how you guys can join us in Williamsburg
Virginia at Busch Gardens we are
celebrating our four year anniversary as
well as the sixth season of hak5 by
doing our very first Meetup
finally it's on August 15th at Busch
Gardens Williamsburg and you can find
all the info over at hack 5 meetup
squarespace.com it's open to all ages
obviously it's a theme park and there's
going to be fear and hacking and
rollercoasters and more beer and more
rollercoasters so join us make sure to
RSVP we are so excited we can't wait and

next up matt is taking one of these and
turning it into one of these but first
we're going to take a break
alright guys so I am back here in the
studio it's good to be back it's a
little warm but you know we can deal
with that and today I'm bringing sxi
conversation back after a number of
emails that I got from you guys some of
you have asked how do I take a physical
server that I already have deployed and
move that over to my ESXi box so that I
can redeploy a server somewhere else or
use that for an ESX I box well it's
pretty easy and the tour we're going to
use is VMware vSphere converter a lot of
these a lot of C's yeah we know actually
1c mm-hmm and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna downloaded vmware.com
install it if you're don't have a
problem you know running it on the
machine it doesn't make a whole lot of
changes you can undersell the software
after we actually get done with this
that's fine but basically what we're
gonna do is we're going to take a
running machine and we're going to
transition it to a virtual machine on
our ESXi server now how we're going to
do that so we've already got the server
the service installed we're gonna go
over here to convert or standalone
client this is gonna launch here but
once it's done we're gonna be a hit with
a very simplistic interface a couple
buttons at the top convert machine
configure machine things like that so
we're going to convert machine ok now
here is where we get hit with our first
options the source type is going to be a
powered on machine ok now this machine
is powered on we're using it we've
installed converter onto it and we're
going to take an image of this and
transition it over there what I would
recommend is you stops equal instances
exchange server FTP web any service that
isn't critical to the system go ahead
and stop it just in case you know
real-time transaction logs and things
like that tend to have an issue when
taking you know over time block level
you get the point
so the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to say this local machine
now if you have another machine that you
need to take a look at you can actually
point it at at there okay so now we're
presented with our next screen which is
specify our destination our destination
is going to be our newly created ESXi
server that is happy humming along doing
its thing with no issues our IP address
just happens to be 1010 0.55 our user
name is root and our password is hak5
now remember to if you're running
multiple hosts and you have vSphere you
know the virtual Center whatever they
call it now you would connect to that
and then push it out from there but
because we're just running a single host
of ESXi we're actually going to connect
directly to the host so just make sure
you remember your credentials when
you've set them up we're gonna click
Next and here we can actually now see
our list of servers that are installed
on the ESXi server so we've got FreeNAS
on there already and that is the only
server that is currently on the ESXi
host we're gonna select datastore one
which has more free space this is a
seventy-five gigabyte total disk source
size and the virtual machine name is
going to be Lenovo netbook okay and then
we're gonna click Next and here we can
actually take a look at all the options
that the system presents us with so here
we see well we don't have customization
tools installed these are really only
useful if you guys are going to deploy a
large number of Windows 2000 2003-2008
servers there's different instructions
for installing the sisters on the
Virtual Mission are on the guest host
physical server at this point so that
you can actually customize the internals
of the machine we don't really need to
do that like we said we've already shut
our stuff down there's no
reconfiguration needed this is going to
handle everything that we need to do so
we're gonna come up back over here and
on post-conversion power state now we'll
leave it off post conversion processing
we can reconfigure the destination
virtual machine you probably don't want
to do that because your problem
one or two sign two processors four
processors one processor and adjust the
amount of memory because you're in a
virtual environment now you also have
the option to install the VMware tools
on the imported machine after the
conversion is done however I like doing
it manually I don't know why that's just
me so we're gonna click Next and here is
our review one more time this is what's
gonna happen it's gonna preserve the NIC
count we've got three necks in the
system monolithic flat disk going to
datastore one it's not going to install
the VMware tools and reconfigure the
virtual machine and we're gonna click
finish now once this is actually done
processing it's going to validate the
task and it's gonna send the commands
over to the ESXi server so here we can
see this local machine the destination
is ten to ten dot dot 55 slash Lenovo
and the status is it's running so it's
now taking our virtual excuse me our
physical machine and it's taking the
image of the physical machine and
converting it over pushing it in real
time over to the ESXi server so we don't
have to worry about creating images
transferring them adding them to the
inventory this is doing everything that
you need to do like I said if you really
wanted to you can go through the process
and install this on a bunch of different
ones and actually brought a server
client on your desktop or your laptop at
the office and convert a bunch of
different machines one by one or you can
do them in batch whatever play with it
it's not really going to harm anything
if you you know fail on a conversion
delete the virtual machine off the ESX
server and try again that's really how
I've learned all of this stuff is just
trial and error you hit a button you get
up and you
oops do it again so if you have any
questions hit me up man at hak5 org or
hit the forums at forums dot hat 5 org
and we're gonna take a look at trivia
and then after that Darren has some
tommcatt lovin I'm going to tell him why
I don't like Tomcat but maybe he has a
better reason I don't know

so you guys know from a couple weeks ago
we've been having a cool contest going
on from episode 519 and that is build
your own white box server $2,000 what
can you guys come up with and we've seen
some really creative stuff in the forums
so now it's time that Matt's back and
we've had a chance to go over some of
the results and come up with our winner
that we'll be receiving the awesome hack
5 swag bag along with good shot glass
you know so you can play the act by
drinking game at home
and I thought we'd go through a couple
of these really cool ones leading up to
the winner now first of all I have to
mention sted 77s awesome entry he put
together an 8 core system right so dual
quad-core with 16 gigs of ram a 3-way
raid 4 terabytes of disk for $1,700
using a pimped-out Dell Precision 490
workstation so basically getting a cheap
Dell you know Google processor machine
throwing out the dual cores or in it
putting some quad cores in hooking up
the RAM hooking up the disk I thought
that was kind of a unique way to go
about it and then mr. Evan kind of came
up with a neat solution using both an
ESX I server and a nice fuzzy target
using really cheap cases like $20 cases
just throwing decent components in there
but it's all on a Gigabit LAN so he's
actually got like a switch in there and
then you know you've got your ESXi
server mounting your I scuzzy targets
love it sounds really cool but we've got
to give it up to dodo dodo put together
a really neat solution using a for you
case that's a 24 Bay rack mount
enclosure 12 gigs of ram and he says up
to 11 terabytes of disk with the $2,000
option and he did want to go for
software raid which is the one thing
that made Matt noggin
right because the board itself only has
eight SATA over like dude it's so like
you know with the play money because he
only got it up to that point said you
know like are a couple options right
where I'm thinking is man throw three
where in there maybe get like just to
five or six drives right 24 I mean this
thing is sick looking alright alright
yeah yeah this is quite a crazy case so
I'm totally digging the creativity there
and I got to give a shout out and thank
you to everybody that participated and
just seeing some really neat stuff in
the forms we love that so we will be
hooking up dodo
thanks so much for participating in this
contest and we're gonna be back next
week with a new one but first it's time
to talk about some crazy cool
open-source goodness lamp stuff right
some thing to myself dude it's about
time we talk about some lamp on the show
right no not one of these I'm talking
about Linux Apache my sequel PHP the
good stuff right say I mean right how
about instead a lamp we do Linux and
then Apache Tomcat and you're like what
I'm cat right it's like yeah the Apache
foundation takes more than just Apache
they go well bunch of cool open-source
projects and this is really one of these
things that I kind of came across
because in my day job as assistant man I
I just you know talk about on the show
what we're doing day to day and it's
been on my mind because I've been
implementing some really boring
accounting systems with it there's a lot
of crazy stupid crap written in Java and
what we will talk about the downsides
for a little bit right here and and
we're getting the chatroom scrolling
right now and all the hate for Tomcat
and I understand that right it's really
the only game in town right
it's Tomcat and it's Jai run and Jai run
is I forget who originally made it but
it's been like you know it's been
changing hands it was like this one
company and there's Macromedia and then
when you know Macromedia and then adobe
and then adobe said no seven you know
that's it for forge a run and it's like
so if you're gonna run you know if
you're gonna run Tomcat in the
enterprise you don't have a choice it's
like open source right and I think
that's really really cool and I'm not
crazy I'm
you guys I'm not crazy about job you
guys know that I'm like in love with PHP
and I will learn some other languages
here soon but but I thought that we
could maybe take the scenic route and
set up our own our own linux apache
tomcat server and and it's kind of one
of these things that applies to many
other things when it comes to setting up
linux servers and you know something
that i'm doing a lot of now with my sexy
so let's go ahead and dive in shall we
all right here we are logged into our
Ubuntu server yes I am going to go ahead
and just use an Ubuntu server because
you know why not I love Ubuntu and I
don't care you could play me for it
doesn't matter it's a linux distro and
it works right back into it
basically we're going to go ahead and W
get the latest version of Apache Tomcat
and once we've got that we're going to
go ahead and on tar it and now we're
just going to move it to a happy place
so in this case the happy place is going
to be user local Tomcat it's just gonna
make things easy for us so let's go
ahead and sudo 2mv that now that we have
a download and move to a tapi place
we're just going to go ahead and make
sure that we actually have a Java JDK
and if we don't we'll go ahead and
install it so for that let's just run
Java - version and we can see we don't
have it so it's simply on Debian let's
just go ahead and apt-get install Sun
Java 6 and we want the JDK
so we've got the JDK installed the
Tomcat actually needs an environment
variable so happy fun stuff let's go
ahead and add that to our bash RC and
all we need to do is come down here and
insert a little export Java underscore
home equals where it is and it's in for
us in user Lib JVM Sun six Java now we
just need to come up with a couple of
startup scripts that's going to tell
Tomcat how to start and restart and stop
on all that fun stuff it's pretty easy
all we have to do is create a new file
and we're going to sudo vai in et Cie
and it D and make the file Tomcat and
we're just going to go ahead and give it
some metadata up here and call it and
there we go it's just a matter of
defining start stop and restart to
actually hit the Sh files appropriately
and the /bin and we go ahead and save
that and then last but not least we have
to actually give it a little bit execute
action so for that schmata it or chmod
it seven five five for the win and you
have to be su root to do that so there
we go and that's done hooray and since
we're going to want Tom catch actually
boot up when the server boots up let's
go ahead and add a couple of sim links
there to make that happen so in that
case we're gonna link that file that we
just created and it D Tomcat to e.t.c RC
1 dot d I'm going to make this k99
Tomcat and let's do it again but this
time our C to D and we're going to call
it s 99 Tomcat oops
and I will clean that mistake up later
so there we go we have a tomcat server
running so let's go ahead and see if it
works an issue UTC init.d
Tomcat and tell it start and hooray it
has started so let's actually find out
if this is working and for that I need
to figure out the IP address here and
we've got 10 1000 135 so get out of my
virtual box here and let's pull up
Chrome my favorite browser and head over
to 10.10 ODOT 135 on port 8080 that's
where it is by default there we go we've
got our admin panel it's got the cute
little kitty and we're ready to go now
we do need to actually add a manager
interface to this so that we can
actually go into the Tomcat manager so
adding more files and we'll be talking a
lot more about that in the next part of
this segment but for right now let's go
ahead and create that account so we can
lay this finish laying this groundwork
so back to our VirtualBox it's just a
matter of coming over to use or local
Tomcat where we were right and you can
see we get a nice little comp holder
here so let's go into content as you
might imagine here are all the
configuration files who would have
figured and let's sudo vai Tomcat users
XML because if you don't do this you
can't actually have access to any of the
fun stuff that you just installed it's
pretty easy to add a user
there's XML that's already in here you
could uncomment some stuff but we're
just going to go ahead and add a new
user with the manager role so for that
I'm just going to come into here within
the Tomcat user's part of the XML and I
am going to add I'm gonna add what it
tells me to I'm gonna click Tomcat
manager it's gonna say hey login and I'm
going to say no cancel because I don't
have a login and it's going to tell me
what to do and I'm gonna say great
that's exactly what I wanted to do I
want to add role manager oops
role role name equals manager and user
username equals Tomcat that'll be fine
and then password will make it something
stupid
and then we'll give it the manager role
and that's pretty much it we'll go ahead
and save that file and when we come over
to our chrome again we should actually
be able to log in to our newly installed
Tomcat server Tomcat and that crappy
password that we just created oh did I
forget to mention that we have to
restart the service that would probably
be a good idea come back over to here
and just as we'd created that startup
script that's going to allow us to start
and stop and whatnot
we'll just issue again / at c / unity /
tomcat and restart hooray for the when
it's restarted and we should be able to
log in back to the kitty tomcat manager
and there we go we are logged into the
back-end of apache tomcat and this is
where we can start installing fun little
servlet happy goodness and we're just
going to go ahead and stop here because
it's a lot of crazy stuff and let's get
Matt back in here so that he can
ridicule me for using Java and
open-source and it will be fun and like
I said laying the groundwork next week
we're gonna do some fun happy
open-source goodness from my favorite
place source for you of course so let's
take a quick break and we'll be wrapping
this up just a moment
I want to let everybody know that
Gamefly is an amazing service they are
the largest online video game rental

a game if you fall in love with it
they'll send you the box and the manual
for nominal fee head on over to
gamefly.com slash hack five to get two
week free trial membership gamefly.com
slash hack alright guys so Darren just
talk to you about Tomcat and the semi
usefulness of the server itself however
I do want to let you guys know that
unless you have an experienced Tomcat
admin much like those of you who need to
run net applications on Linux who need a
dedicated mono admin if you do not
secure your server properly and stay up
to date you will be in for a world of
hurt right there yeah you don't want to
leave Tomcat open to the world you want
to put that behind a bunch of layers of
Defense's and make sure that the patch
Nala did it's just a bad idea yeah yeah
I'm not a huge fan of Tomcat to be
honest with you guys I don't run Tomcat
or mono on public facing yeah services
it's just a really I mean like I said
unless you have an admin who's
experienced with those you know servers
you're you're you're in first you know
surprise when you get a call from your
ISP saying hey why are there hundreds of
thousands of connections I'm coming from
it's not good no not at all and I mean
I'm gonna say like yes I'm not a fan of
Tomcat but I am showing it on here on
the show and why well because I don't
want to be the nine million podcast to
do a lamp install and because the things
that we just talked about here are
pretty much the same whether it's going
to be a Python or a pearl or
Ruby or whatever you go with and I just
you know the great symbols are this way
right and if you haven't gotten your
feet wet and trust me I'm the Linux
gurus but you know okay two reasons
right so you're going so why would you
want to run Tomcat no you wouldn't but
if you have to yes go ahead and run it
on Linux cuz it's gonna make it a little
bit easier it's gonna be a lot less
expensive and it's you know really the
only game in town remembers that big
raise only if you have to yeah and then
you don't need a public-facing tomcat
server anymore no I got openvpn yeah
we'll talk about that later good stuff
so so yeah that is that is our
disclaimer there but we're doing it
anyway cuz yeah oh oh that and in at
least an ubuntu 9.0 fourth I'm actually
running this in it's got this nice happy
little interface when you go to install
the server and it says hey you want this
to be a lamp from server or a tomcat
server you just check a little boxing
don't have to do any of that but you
know and that would make for fun yeah
like bash prompts to exact okay oh I'm
just gonna take a pill but stick it
right now
I do have some feedback on some some
recent questions and that is disabled
quick boot if you're concerned about the
cold boot attack because in a lot of
cases when you actually disable quick
boot it actually counts the RAM when you
boot up and you're like oh my gosh do
you remember your like 46 and it'll be
like counting your 16 Meg's of RAM
minutes on forever and you disabled that
stuff because it took forever right
imagine gonna take with like four gigs
of RAM I had a 46 with 16 Meg's of RAM
you were oh dude no love on that I mean
uh I had I had a penny new system with
eight things I ran Duke Nukem 3d for the
win anyway oh and yes TPM with BitLocker
yeah that's gonna cause problem with old
boot yeah just throw that out there I
had something to and your it'll come
back I think it will anything else we
need to talk about the store which is
finally back up and running
yes my apologies we were getting
denial of service yeah so went ahead and
put some countermeasures in and so that
we can track exactly which service is
doing what and script is running as who
we implemented a new protection scheme
and it jacked up the old store which
self-admittedly was it was a busy

yeah so the stores back up head on over
