by domain.com hello welcome back by my
name is darren kitchen my name is
shannon moory it's your weekly dose of
technol us yay this has been happening
lately yes it has this weekend was
amazing the party party was amazing
fabulous I'm I am unlike cloud nine that
still to this day that we are well one
finally even able to talk about this
thing that for the last like oh oh so
long wanted we keeping it so quiet it's
just been too much fun at develop oh did
you hear on macrumors that apparently it
was supposed to be running Android or
something oh I don't know where you got
that room works I heard that it was
actually going to be based on an IT neum
chip really yeah I heard it was gonna
have like six USB ports yeah and two of
them were gonna be pink oh that's right
I remember you're reading about
obviously the tram this is just we are
like ecstatic I mean as you guys know
we've been working on the pineapple
project for quite a while now to be able
to do something like this on like the
hak5 level is just insane so we are so
super proud of this and we're going to
have a whole bunch more coming up here
soon about some of the advanced wireless
attacks that having this kind of
formidable hardware allows us to do by
the way we should probably mention that
it's called the Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5
oh yeah this thing that we keep on doing
that we waiting that like see it was so
much fun we even got to do industrial
design and stuff you did a great awesome
I like it router that we throw in a box
in the router box not solid so pretty
now yes I'm actually what i love is uh
what was that line from that dual core
song get your wife i tackled by hak5
pine yes and yet with the elite it's
like the y-pipe tackle box oh that's
cute get your Wi-Fi tackle oh damn it to
my door well today I have a pretty
awesome segment for us whoa yeah we show
this is ridiculous I can't wait to get
my hands on one I'm so serious that this
is probably one of the more revenue
generic kinds of like piece of gaming
here I've seen in the last 10 years yeah
I'm riveted this is cool this is
omgwtfbbq this didn't exist until now
more on that later we are so excited to
introduce it's called the cast a are so
so so cool like a star okay yarn cool
well I'm gonna let you get into that and
then I'll see you at the end of the show
alright alright peace i'm here with rick
johnson from technical illusions now
this year you guys are coming out with
this really cool project i can't wait to
get my hands on it seriously i'm super
excited after demoing it I was just like
oh so this is called the cast a are
correct correct and you are the guy
that's behind all the software correct
correct so how did you get started in
this so originally I was working at
valve software and jeri ellsworth was
also working in valves hardware she was
hired to create the hardware lab so that
valve can begin experiments in that area
she was working late one night on a
particular vision project and stumbled
across a an odd side effect of a
material that was sitting off in the
distance that had the super bright
reflective property and so she went to
investigate it and determine it was a
piece of retro trail which is this okay
and that upon doing some more
experiments it was a great technique for
doing augmented reality so she started
to experiment and create a prototype
headset I learned about it and I decided
to start writing some software to help
realize how augmented reality works what
type of games we can do what doesn't
work experiments and just learn about
the space so what's your history with
software development so I've been in the
video game in Sioux for about 23 years I
was one of the four people that started
Raven Software stayed there for about 17
years worked for gearbox for a little
bit and then worked for valve for about
four and a half years so fun okay now we
have a very very geeky audience and I
really want to introduce them to the
idea of software development for the
class they are is it open source is Kim
people develop their own games for this
so the internal guts won't be open
source because there's some lasing
material that prevents us from releasing
that aspect
there'll be a very low level SDK that
will give you access to the hardware the
raw tracking data of the RFID
information so that they have a custom
engine in the custom game they can talk
to that and hook it up very quickly the
other thing we're offering is a
high-level su ke and so all the demos we
shown in the Kickstarter video are
running under unity and within about
five minutes you can take any existing
game and get it going in our space all
unity yes oh that's super easy i think
pretty much everybody is familiar with
that you needs been a great platform
they have it one of the best features is
the asset store and for us as
independent developers we can buy assets
and showcase our space really well right
now can you tell me a little bit about
how the software works the software
works by getting data from the head
tracking camera it's very efficient of
what the hardware is doing it's only
about seventy two bites a frame that's
coming down to the computer really
really and from there we take the the
data and compare figure out where you
are in the physical space and return
renting parameters to view origin
matrices all that kind of stuff from
there you just plug it into your engine
and you have a nice rendering display
wow that's fun I'm so excited to get my
hands on this I can't wait now i really
want to check out the hardware as well
do you think we can get a Jerry over
here we might be able to convince her to
come on alright cool well thank you Rick
for letting me know a little bit about
the software I can't wait to actually
see it for myself and right after the
break we're going to speak with Jerry I
was worth about the hardware side of
kast'ar
budding entrepreneurs startups and
innovators are all turning their ideas
into realities backed by the strength of
a dotnet domain and you guys know dot
nets are globally known they're one of
the most popular domain extensions
online they inject your business with

welcome back and it is now time for the
trivia question of the week now last

now this week's trivia question and it
