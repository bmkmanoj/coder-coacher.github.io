by Toyota I'm Shannon Morse from CES
2014 and I have found one of my favorite
booths ever 3d systems and I'm here with
Keith Keith how are you hey good to see
you
good to see you I'm so excited to talk
to you again and you were here with 3d
systems you guys have some brand-new
products to show off this year I'm super
excited about these because I personally
love making 3d printing easier for
consumers tell me about your new systems
yeah you know it's awesome this year
because we released the cube 3 it's a
sub $1000 3d printer that prints in two
colors dual materials has an insta load
cartridge that you can just has an
integrated nozzle in it so no more
clogging of nozzles
no more leveling of the platform its
factory leveled I mean this is a simple
machine for your home to empower your
creativity it's awesome really I've had
that problem with nozzles actually you
know totally screwing up on me with my
own 3d printer at home do you have to
build this or does it come all
pre-installed and ready to go so this is
fully assembled
for under $1000 you're gonna have a
fully assembled machine just out of the
box plug and play with features that
your customer with your other device it
with your other with other products on
the market so like mobility so you can
use your iPhone or your Android device
to print from our website integrates a
shelf that you can save your objects on
or a design feed where you can print
straight to the cube I mean it's awesome
so Cuba fly comm is gonna have all these
features that integrate with the cue and
what kind of filament does this use the
same stuff that we've seen before yeah
so the common film it is PLA and abs and
this can print both types of material
but it has two nozzle so you can print
two colors or all the materials as well
oh that's so fun I love it now when is
this one gonna be about available it's
gonna be in on q2 so yeah so I'll be out
pretty soon yeah we're really excited
about that and then we have this big one
it's called the cube Pro which is a
prosumer machine that has the same
features same kind of UI UI touch screen
color touch screen works with your
mobile device
but you can print things that are large
way larger how big how big size of a
basketball yeah yeah so really really
big so I could actually print my own
basketball
it might not bounce but I could totally
do that in in three colors so this has
up to three colors you can do and yeah
and this also has Wi-Fi Bluetooth just
like the cube so yeah great features but
for your home or your office yeah so
your market here is definitely for
consumers what are you envisioning that
they create with these well you know it
like this past year we started releasing
our printers and we're selling them at
places like Staples selling on Amazon
you know it so you there it actually is
hit the consumer market this is
mainstream now so my goal is to make
these machines easy to use the hobby is
no longer tinkering with the machine
it's just plug and play this is just
like any other device it's really I want
to make things and I want to make them
easy and keep it simple so for the for
the mainstream audience I think this is
a machine they're gonna want they're
just gonna have fun and enjoy creating
and you can spend the time modeling and
creating things and then that's what
this actually does for you I'm super
excited about the price of the cube but
now how much is the cube this is going
to be sub 5000 depending on which model
you get so there's you get one two or
three print jets on it so it will be
below that but it's more of a robust
machine they both printed 75 micron
thinness I don't see yeah so once they
thick this anymore four layer height so
is it's actually finished 75 micron is
amazing the cue Pro actually has another
you can print up to 350 if you want to
do like a fast draft mode we actually
have that too so there's some options
the cue Pro also has a build chamber so
it's a controls temperature in there so
you can get some really nice large
prints and the website still works just
as it usually did it's super easy to use
for the consumers it's a brand new
website we just launched a new Cuba fly
2.0 this is a brand new website it's a
way for people to co-create with their
brands it's more of a digital 3d
printing lifestyle so there's different
categories like fashion decor so when
you go there you can explore where you
fit into this 3d printing world
where I'm looking and what do I make or
what you you could actually co-create
with your favorite brands we have
friends like Nuka wait this is a new
kawatche that's 3d printed yeah so we
have some some really cool fashion
brands like shoes that are 3d printing
lighting fixtures so we have home things
for your home like home decor and also
three systems has a huge portfolio you
know we invented 3d printing 30 years
ago we go beyond these home machines we
can print in ceramics we can print in
sugar we can print in metal and all
these products you can you can purchase
in all these great and great materials
online through qfi comm so yeah if the
revolution has begun the revolution is
totally begun and I'm so excited to see
this coming to the mainstream and it's
about time that we can start making
things for ourselves Keith thank you so
much for speaking to me today about
everything that's involved with 3d
systems where can people find out more
well if you go to Cuba Phi comm you can
find everything you want to know how it
fits in your 3d printing lifestyle yes
wonderful thank you so much and if you
guys want to check out more 3d systems
you can go over to revision three.com
