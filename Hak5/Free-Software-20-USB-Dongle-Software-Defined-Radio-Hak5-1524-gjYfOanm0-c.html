by domain.com hello welcome back 5 my
name is darren kitchen i'm shannon ward
thank your weekly dose of Jack tell us
yes we missed each other's I missed you
guys too
it was freezing there I heard also did
you get snowed in uh no what nor did I
meet snowed in I don't think he's going
hi I'm so glad you got that really just
18 Edward didn't know what they were all
talking about one people like Team
Edward that they're saying like super
Snowden no yeah yeah what yep I heard he
was a vampire that's why yoga the high
five my name is daryun kitchen this is
supposedly a tech show and Shannon has
found the whiffy aliens
what are those oh you want to hear it
yeah sure aliens these freaking aliens
I'm telling you they're trying to speak
to us look look at that look at that
hello you know you're at 48 I don't know
where you went
I don't know she was at 2.4 gigahertz a
moment before now she's far off she
found a $20 dongle and now it's bring
her so much fun I stepped in something
anyway we'll get into the later Shin
starting a series on software-defined
radio I've got more awesome stuff from
shmoocon we have some cool projects in
the works involved in involving
birdhouses and radio frequencies it
works when you're polarized vertically
oh okay
anyway though that we should probably
just go ahead and get into the show yeah
let's do it let's do it
today I'm going to be taking a look at
SDR and I'm going to be having a lot of
fun this is so exciting
basically SDR is a software-defined
radio and I'm also going to be checking
out a Windows application that will let
you receive data with a super simple
setup so first off what is SDR it's a
software-defined radio which is
basically a radio communication system
that takes what you usually find in
hardware and implements it into a
software application on a PC so you
don't have to pay for any kind of crazy
expensive setup so the PC has to be
equipped with a sound card or an analog
to digital converter and then some kind
of RF front end the signal processing is
done via the processor and airwaves are
converted from analog into digital on
the PC so the SDR dongle for example
this little guy is my RF front end that
is going to be converting the airwaves
for my software to make sense of so this
can be used as an am/fm radio you can
check out police scanners air traffic
control you can listen to that kind of
stuff you can even listen to like what's
going on out out on the water if you
live near a bay or something you can
listen to what buoys are transmitting
all sorts of data is flowing and you can
listen all of it it's really exciting
it's really cool I even think I picked
up some aliens when I was checking it
out earlier but who knows
so you're basically packet sniffing with
radio is kind of a way to look at it and
you don't need any kind of license
because it doesn't transmit so in this
case I'm only receiving data that's it
so tada now you have your own little SDR
setup with less than 20 bucks instead of
some crazy hardware product that can
only do AM and FM so let's go ahead and
set this up on Windows I'm just using
one program to start it off for today so
I can kind of learn and get the gist of
what I'm doing with SDR so I'm using a
program called SDR sharp that's SDR
pound if you're googling it so first off
you want to download this very automated
installation from rtl-sdr org slash
software windows I'll put that in the
show notes below and then you just open
the program so if you take a look at my
computer over here it's going to look
well kind of weird to be honest
at the top you're going to see a whole
bunch of blue lines and once we get
started all these waves are going to be
transmitting different frequencies and
we'll be able to pass between them and
kind of figure out what's going on in
each of them sometimes you can hear
people talking it's hilarious down at
the bottom you can see what kind of data
is transmitting so down here you can see
a whole bunch of lines of data it kind
of looks like music right that's because
it is sometimes you'll see just brief
little spurts of dark red data going on
down here and usually that is somebody
talking for example or if you just see
nothing but blue or nothing but yellow
that means nothing's going on so it's a
completely blank frequency nothing's
going on in those and then over on the
side this is where you get all your
settings so first off at the top you
have radio and that's going to be where
you choose what kind of frequency you
want to listen on so wide FM is over
here we have a m CW raw raw frequency
that's fun and then n FM so that's where
you get your like weather stations
people that are listening in if they're
you know on a boat and they need to find
out what the waves are like in Bodega
Bay or something like that that's where
they would listen in on that most of the
other information down here you want to
keep just as it is you don't want to
mess with too much or you start screwing
up everything if you go down a little
bit to audio you'll see AF gain so this
is going to help you gain a little bit
on your frequency and listen a little
bit better the static will get a little
bit louder but also well the voices and
then you can also go up here to
configure things so let me close this
real quick and I'll show you where my
dongle shows up
so my SDR dongle once I have installed
everything correctly you should see it
show up in this little drop-down so
rtl-sdr slash USB is the dongle that I'm
going to be using and then you can hit
configure and you can make sure that all
of this is set to what it is on my
computer screen down here on RF gain you
can pull it up or down and I'll show you
in just a second what that does so let's
close this and let's go ahead and start
hitting play now just warning you
beforehand and might get a little loud
so
turn down your speakers if you're
listening to me really really high
volume so three two one you ready let's
hit play okay so like I said lots of
static you can hear tons of static going
on if I turn down AF gain gets very
quiet but then I won't be able to hear
the voices that in the background the
music in the background so I'm going to
keep this right about here for now and
if I scroll up so I'm going to stick on
WFMU right now so I can see a lot of
Peaks going on over here a lot of the
wave frequencies so you can see where
different FM channels are and you can
listen in on those if you just hold down
on the mouse and scroll back and forth
okay so I found a radio station super
easy so I can listen to it pretty
clearly if I want to mess with a little
bit of my own bandwidth I can turn this
down it might get a little clearer it
might get a little more crisp for you to
listen to in this case it gets a little
foggy so I'll open up the bandwidth a
bit more so I'm getting pretty much the
full channel down here now I'm going to
scroll back the other way here's one
that's a lot louder let's go over this
one so in this case so this is
interesting on this one we have the
center bandwidth going on which is the
music or the talking the news channel
whatever that station is and then on the
outside on both of the sides we have
some kind of data going on so in this
case what you'll see up at the top above
all the blue wavelengths is the name of
the radio station so it's kay Fox four
seven seven one and in the radio station
actual channel 102.1
and 98.5 Kay Fox so when a song is
playing this is pretty cool it'll
actually show you the name of the song
so that's pretty awesome I like that now
if you find that most of the things down
at the bottom are in red you can lower
the contrast this will give you a little
bit more contrast will be a little bit
easier to find whatever stations you
want to listen to and up at the top I
can also zoom in a little bit closer so
you'll notice in this case I'm not
exactly Center on it the center is
bright
here so if I can't click on that what I
can do is go to configure and change my
frequency correction so these things
they're mass-produced so you're going to
find you know some of these might not
have the best frequency on them but you
can change those by going into the
software and choosing frequency
correction so I'm going to correct my
frequency by I'll do negative five and
that'll move it over just a little bit
yeah we don't care about you 18 T so
after a few seconds you'll notice that
it'll move over a little bit closer to
the center of the block of the bandwidth
now I'm going to zoom back out and let's
go ahead and choose something else I
found some pretty interesting stations
that I can listen and on on the n FM
radio station so again this is where you
find you know your weather station for
boats and captain's and whatnot so I'm
going to click n FM you'll notice that
it totally screws up what I was
listening to on the radio station I
wrote down a couple of stations I wanted
to check out with you guys today and
these were up in the 163 rain so one six
zero range so I'm going to go up here
and change this to seven five change
that to three and one six three so okay
so we got that set I'm going to zoom in
a little bit so you can see what happens
when I do this bring that up just a
little okay so you can't hear anything
just yet but you will in just a few
seconds this one's pretty interesting it
doesn't it's no music no talking or
whatever
but you hear some data so you might
wonder what the heck is that
oh it's aliens of course obviously well
that might be it might be a buoys
sending out some kind of signal about
the waves that are increasing or
decreasing in height or it might be a
weather balloon or something like that
so you know don't really know exactly
what it is but there are ways to process
process that information in the future
I'm hoping that I can figure that out
soon enough
let's see I'll also check out let's do
another one let's do one six one point
six eight seven
so I'll start on the lower end okay one
six seven and that's one there we go
oops sorry six eight seven six eight I
can't read today okay so this is really
staticky zoom in a little bit
so changing my bandwidth will help me
listen to this a little bit clearer it's
hard to make out but they're basically
giving you the wetter weather patterns
and different information about the
waves on a certain harbor which is kind
of cool especially if you're you know
hanging out very close to there you can
listen to what's going on in different
parts of your neighborhood it's really
awesome I just love listening to this
stuff I could totally geek out all day
let's see I will turn down the volume on
this one a little bit so we can get that
out of the way let's try one six 2.38
7.5 okay so this one is talking about a
forecast in the South Bay that's so cool
I love it it's awesome huh that's so
cool
alright so that's pretty interesting
right you would think that if you're
listening to like FM radio station or
whether it's n FM or FM or AM there's
there are certain wavelengths that
you're going to find each of these on so
you're not going to see a whole bunch of
FM radio stations or if you're down in
the 20s or if you're up in the you know
200s or something like that this is kind
of cool so I was looking around I was
scrolling through a whole bunch of
different frequencies and I found this
one that I can share with you this is
one 26.8 zero zero so I'm going to
change the station
okay 26.8 hundred doesn't sound like
much let's go ahead and zoom out here
and I'm going to configure this add a
little bit of game it doesn't look like
anything's going on yet subtract that
frequency correction and I'm going to
change over to well I guess it
disappeared where did it go
interesting so there was music on this
frequency earlier today it was so cool I
was listening to music on 26.8 or
whatever cephalus it's kind of weird you
want to think you find FM music on that
channel but somebody was transmitting
something it was kind of cool okay so
I'm going to go ahead and turn this down
but you you can see how if you have a
day off work you could just sit here and
listen to you know W FM stations for the
entire day trying to pick out different
things and there's so many different
places I swear I heard a dog barking on
one of these stations and I was like
what's going on so it's really cool to
listen to it's so interesting and I
can't wait to find more stations like
this I mean heck Darin found one that
can show you flight patterns and you can
actually like see where planes are
coming over you and then you can
actually see there like different
heights that they are at it's so cool
anyway I'm going to geek out way too
much about this if I continue so let me
know if you use any SDR applications on
your own computers this is just one for
Windows but there's plenty more for
Windows and Linux as well and I'm
thinking I need to check out more of
them because I think I just found
something that I really enjoy so coming
up soon we'll check out more awesomeness
but first let's go ahead and take a
break it doesn't matter whether you're a
syn and AK or a syn ACK when you have
that killer idea need to snag a domain
name and the web hosting fast and with
domain coms quick domain discovery
system and they're easy checkout process
we're going to be live with your website
in no time I mean I love domain.com
because they're affordable they're
reliable they're easy to use plus domain
coms awesome active social media
presence I mean it really just makes it
a fun place to do business we've been
doing business with them for so long the
guys over at domain.com are huge fans of
hack 5 and they want to hook you up so
get this use the coupon code hak5 at
checkout to get an extra 15% off when
you think domain names think domain.com
and now it's time for the trivia
question of the week now first last
week's trivia question was what is the
oldest known analog computer in the
world and the answer was and I'll
probably pronounce this wrong antique
feel Antikythera mechanism this week's
question is the USB and USB cable stands
for one and that is a very easy one now
answer that over at hak5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack five goodies so Johnny its
MOOC on hackers for charity in full
force as usual of course I can't get
away from silicon without hearing the
latest from you on what's new with
hackers charity yeah it's good to see
you thanks for coming by and all your
support one of the big things that we're
really talking about this year is kind
of our education initiative for longest
time you guys know I've been working in
Africa and trying a bunch of different
programs and one thing that we realized
from the beginning was how important it
was to give educational opportunities to
folks in Uganda now with the cafe yeah
so the training like our training center
for example is still in action you know
we're still doing computer training
courses things like that but it's that's
only 24 machines you know we bring
people in we do as much training as we
can but there's a lot more people that
could benefit from the training so you
can take a hacker punch either like hey
you just want do a paralyzed operation
right that's it and so basically what we
thought is well if we can put the tools
in the hands of educators that are kind
of all they're already all over the
country you know we can get this stuff
in a lot more hands you get a lot more
students as well so how do we put the
the information what is the information
how to get it in their hands so there's
there's kind of a core group of software
the the biggest is Khan Academy
everybody knows about Khan Academy and
you know how it's got these great videos
and you know this YouTube stuff and all
that well the bandwidth over there isn't
going to support that so we started with
a core of Khan Academy with the folks at
rachael that made an offline version of
it we've also got Wikipedia and C k12
and Project Gutenberg and all sorts of
educational materials as a software core
and the issue became well how do we put
it in the hands of people that might not
have any
connectivity and how can we put in a
ruggedized package it doesn't require a
lot of power and that's where the
Pelican pie comes in and Sam was the one
that kind of put that together alright
Sam can you walk me through the Pelican
Pie sure no problem
the Pelican is a based upon a pelican
case it's 1120 case the root of it is a
raspberry pie and the raspberry pie is a
the B model it runs the 64 gig card
that's hosting all the content that
Johnny talked about within that it runs
an Apache server and Jeanette server and
an access point so the students
themselves or the teachers can access
the data by accessing the access point
and we control all the content so on the
device we have power that comes in
through an Adafruit solar charge
controller it has ability to take solar
power in our 110 220 mains power or run
from the battery we have a 26 amp power
battery that lasts for about 28 to 30
hours so from the power it goes to a
voltage regulator that increases the
voltage up to 5 and 0.4 volts roughly
from there it goes to an ATX rasp I made
by low power Labs and those guys did a
really good job one good gentleman
actually put it did a really good job at
building the device that provides power
to the Raspberry Pi but also provides
the ability to use a button and send a
proper shutdown script one of the
problems we came across was that the
Raspberry Pi has a low voltage or low
power USB port so we had to have a
higher power going to it plus we had to
have a stable voltage going to it has
caused some of our issues so the ATX Raz
5 you push the button and hold it for 4
seconds it'll actually send a shutdown
script the R a spot Raspberry Pi will
shut down and what we found was that the
Raspberry Pi doesn't completely shut
down and enters a low-power state and
still draws 100 milliamps so that device
will recognize that and completely shut
the power cutting off the battery which
keeps a longer battery life on it from
there it goes to the Raspberry Pi and
that's pretty much the guts in the glory
of it all and so this requires internet
doesn't require internet how do you
deploy it we have just started with an
experimenting with two versions so what
we found was yes the original version
was a completely offline content provide
call light was the basis for that and so
it uses all the Khan Academy videos and
provides a mechanism to track students
for teachers to track those students and
then for administrative staff if this
does get plugged in it'll sync up and
administrative staff can monitor a whole
bunch of different schools remote
schools as they log in every once in a
while
other than that they don't have to
connect at all they can host all the
content locally we also recognize that
there's a need for because of the
popularity of 3G to have a way to do
low-power or a low bandwidth type
connection so it would be an online
connection and we'd utilize the power of
the Khan Academy developers with all
their money in backing they're
constantly updating providing some
really cool aspects and training
capability to students and so we want to
enable that so when we're doing the
research and Johnny was experimenting
out there most of the bandwidth is
sucked up in the videos we already hosts
the videos so if we can redirect just
the video portion now we have a really
cool cool way to host both offline
completely offline content or a
partially online like a low bandwidth
version of it so what is the the end
what is the end user experience here and
how are you getting it into the the
hands of these students uh yeah so
basically this is a while it's a
wireless web server you know the battery
and it's ruggedized and all that
obviously any clients so you can use any
kind of smartphone any existing
computers that they might have we can
plug in Ethernet we can have a hub so
other even old computers with any kind
of web browser really can get access to
the basic content but we recommend
though is the Chromebook and we use an
Acer c720 play a laptop you don't have
to worry about configuration changes the
students using it we use it in guest
mode so when they log out all that stuff
goes away the students can't mess it up
and it's also got a modern web browser
it's got a you know it's Chrome OS with
a Chrome web browser so it's the perfect
platform and at 200 bucks we can also
add an SD card
for 25 bucks and load all that content
locally onto the laptop so you have the
ability to use the laptop on its own but
you can also connect to the PI and get
dynamic content like Sam was talking
about the tracking and all of that
there's a benefit there's actually a
double benefit there because you have
the ability to host a server with
multiple clients connected to it with
the pelican Pi that we have but if you
wanted to do a one-off or he had an
orphanage that only needed two computers
it's not quite the best solution to
bring on a whole server to support that
so it might be better just to host it
locally on that device itself which is
what he's referring to that's cool what
is the reception been with the
powers-that-be
well it's been very interesting in the
past couple months the reception has
been pretty dramatic one of our one of
our colleagues is moving around with one
of these things all over East Africa and
showing them to various various
government officials two days into his
tour around East Africa the Rwandan
Minister of Education was like give me a
hundred of these so we realized that
there's there's potential that there's
interest in this thing but at the same
time we realize this is grassroots its
prototype it's very maker ish we night
we might not be able to scale this thing
to the level that it's it that people
are asking for it so we're kind of
looking we had some great conversations
with you about you know your what you
learned when you were doing the the
pineapple and the things that you
learned kind of paved the way for us and
we're kind of going well we might be
able to follow in your footsteps partner
with you guys a little bit learn from
what you did and maybe make something
that's more you know marketable from a
product standpoint yeah it needs to be
compact it needs to be rugged and used
to be something that we can put in the
field and is not as expensive to repair
or place it needs to be easy for the
end-user because we're not going to be
in all these locations and we have to
have the ability to send something to
somebody have them put it into practice
and have it last well I absolutely agree
any way we can help it's a noble goal
and how can you know our viewers how can
the hackers of the world get together
and help out hackers for charity so all
basically all of this information is on
our website hackers for charity org
slash education we have all the build
diagrams the parts list is on there you
can order all of these parts and bill
Jeron you know and and play around with
this thing or donate it to a school
there's lots of options there but the
biggest thing is kind of keep up with
that page as this thing evolves you know
and as always just getting the word out
makes it makes a huge difference so we
really appreciate the chance to talk to
you guys and you know your support
through the years has just been great
thanks thanks Donny Cheers
and now it is time for the Technol is
photo of the week and this one is from
mr. Jason he sent us a photo of his evil
home server and he said it's evil
because he runs myth TV and randomly
decides to not record Family Guy that's
definitely evil and it randomly deletes
his kids pokeo episodes yeah not cool
I'm sure the kids were upset about that
thank you Jason for sending in that
photo it looks very similar to our own
evil server you can send your photos if
you want to feed back at hak5 org
definitely cinnamon we haven't had many
lately I want to see what you guys are
doing out there and add the subject line
technology can find them really easily
because we get a lot of emails not
necessarily pictures oh so send me
pictures well that just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack 5 with
Shannon I must say you opened Pandora's
box
you have no idea I can't tell you how I
haven't seen her as excited as she is
right now since she discovered netcat
with hash or 3d printing or 3d or that's
always fun to you yes no this is so cool
I'm having so much fun with this and I
can I show you something yes hit me
would you oh my god okay so watch this
okay pull pull
I'm taking off my my microphone but I'm
not turning it off I'm going to set it a
little bit closer to the antenna look at
this now watch this whoa check that out
oh is that us coming back that's us
that's awesome so you can basically
stand outside the hak5 studio and that's
a weird idea that is super freaky it's
so weird I was just browsing and I was
like wait do I hear an echo wait what is
that oh that's me
and then he freaks out and he's like oh
there's a bug of course um I would say I
went down this road last year or with my
cosmic class who Mike Osman does the
uber tooth and the hack RF did it does a
fantastic class on that kind of stuff
I'm going to have to give you all my
notes from that it's awesome that you're
finally getting around to that because
I've been meaning to for quite a while
and haven't but I will say you have
opened Pandora's box that's a lot of
emails you're about to get on a bit of
technology that you've messed up but
it's cool I'm loving to watch you like
dive into this and learning yes fine I
think it's apt that Shannon Morse is
getting into the stuff next time I'll be
doing CW oh I get it
yeah laws yeah nice one yes see what you
did there ah ha ha ha oh um so I'm
starting a new show I should mention
that your second show and it's fun
oh it's called you're holding 101 hey
you love coding ya twit dot TV slash
code maybe I think cool
no put token situs but there's a promo
up on the website you're learning you're
gonna sit with some Python yeah we're
gonna learn Python c-sharp C++ Java Ruby
we're gonna delve into all sorts of
different ones over the course of the
show and so so that everybody gets you
know something that they enjoy it's not
just one code one programming language
spiffy yeah it's gonna be foolin away
something go tune in also I would like
to remind you that we value your
feedback so if you would let to if you
would like to let Shannon know all sorts
of awesome open-source utilities she
should be using with her rtl-sdr
go ahead and hit up feedback at hack 5
org I'll be there too cuz I'm playing
with a DSP right now and it's like and
I'm playing with ninja stars there you
go
there's that too it doesn't work that
well
you should boys check out a check a shop
comm that's where you can support us
