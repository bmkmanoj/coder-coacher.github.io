updates a few updates on the crack
attack and a new IOT botnet has already
infected millions all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
October 24th 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is the best way to support the show and
it will help us reach our next goal a
quick reminder as well don't miss out on
my giveaway of the NES classic over at
youtube.com slash tech thing I'll put a
link in the show notes so you can find
it real easy just comment on the newest
episode over there and hit subscribe to
hear the winner announcement and now
onto the news so first off and this is
good news Google has been working hard
lately to increase privacy and security
of their users most notably is a new
feature called advanced protection for
your Google account and this would be
useful for journalists celebrities
political figures victims of harassment
or other people who may be targeted in
an attack now while Google already has
two-factor authentication you to F key
acceptance and login alerts they are now
adding additional layers of security on
top of that too if you enable advanced
protection on a Google account an
attacker would need much more than just
your password to log in to set account
you will need to physical security keys
with the phyto Alliance Universal second
factor you would probably need one that
is Bluetooth so that it would work with
your phone or tablet and then you would
probably need one USB key to work with a
computer whenever you log in one of
these keys would be used to plug in or
pressed to signify that you own and have
access to both of those devices
alongside this only Google Apps would be
allowed third-party access and if you
lose those keys you would be required to
go through a much more rigorous process
to prove your identity before getting
back info on your account obviously this
step is taking security much more
seriously but it also detracts from
consumers convenience which is why
Google is marketing this towards a
smaller percentage of users the advance
protection program is only available to
consumer Google accounts for the
I'm being but they've also had decided
to implement some new security features
for all users as well so if you use
Chrome browser there's this thing called
chrome cleanup which is built into
Chrome and it will now identify and
prompt you to remove any malware that is
detected in chrome or any software that
has made changes to Chrome without your
consent
Google teamed up with security company
ESET or ESET to make this happen now
chrome also has a built-in restoration
setting that will alert you if an
extension has modified your settings
without your consent it'll allow you to
revert the changes back to your defaults
and each of these chrome changes has
started rolling out as of last week to
Windows users and from Dessie matrix on
patreon just a quick reminder to if you
are a patreon you can share your
favorite news stories in the community
tab over there he sent in this story
about Google they are also testing a new
feature for Android devices called DNS
over TLS that will encrypt DNS requests
on Android devices sounds a little weird
but let's get into it so encrypting DNS
over TLS means that your ISP for example
would not know the domain name of sites
that you are visiting but they could
probably still see the IP address DNS
requests are usually done in plaintext
via other protocols like UDP or TCP so
using this with a trusted VPN would be
extremely helpful HTTPS traffic
obviously could still have observable
unencrypted DNS requests sent by the
user so adding that additional layer
security on top of that is very
important and it's a really good move by
Google if it does get released as an
update to consumers it is now time for
some updates on crack which sounds
awkward but I reported on this early
last week crack is the Wi-Fi handshake
series of attacks that can cause
headaches for any wpa2 secured wireless
network since the news broke last week
many different companies have already
posted updates in response Microsoft
updates started rolling out on October
10th Apple and Google will be releasing
updates in the next few weeks and Amazon
for example is currently reviewing which
devices are affected several different
AP and wireless router manufacturers
including Netgear ero Linksys Belkin
d-link and tp-link have already started
implementing patches for their devices
more consumer devices manufacturers are
also on the way I also got a few
comments on the last episode regarding
Mac filtering and if that would help and
Mac filtering does not help
unfortunately because not only can MAC
addresses be spoofed so obviously would
not help in that occasion but also
because crack attacks the protocol
itself on any devices using wireless
including APs
I also saw a question about access
points and whether or not they would be
affected straight from the source
quote what if there are no security
updates for my router our main attack is
against the 4-way handshake and does not
exploit access points but instead
targets clients so it might be that your
router does not require security updates
we strongly advise you to contact your
vendor for me details in general though
you can try to mitigate attacks against
routers and access points by disabling
client functionality which is for
example used in repeater modes and
disabling 802 11 are fast roaming for
ordinary home users your priority should
be updating clients such as laptops and
smartphones so the router can be
attacked as well though not by their
main crack attack but it does require
authenticated devices there are a slew
of routers that support 802 11 R as well
so if an update is available for yours
just go ahead and update it since
routers are prone to not receiving
updates this is why professionals are
recommending updates to your devices
because those are more commonly going to
be receiving those updates but since
many IOT devices won't receive an update
at all I'm also recommending go ahead
and patch your router as well it's not
gonna hurt the thing that way all known
possible entries for crack are hopefully
mitigated keep in mind crack is a series
of attacks against wireless protocols
not just one attack it would be wise to
err on the side of caution and update
your access points when those updates
are made available a new IOT attacking
malware thread has been making its way
into networks across the globe infecting
1 million networks so far and Counting
the malware called Reaper or IOT Troup
comes one year after Mir died botnet
attacked machines and is using some of
Mira's code to work the difference in
Reaper is
uses actual vulnerabilities in the code
of IOT devices to infect them instead of
just looking for default passwords which
is what Mirai did
Reaper affects routers from d-link
Netgear and Linksys as well as IOT
devices from vac Ron go ahead and AV
Tech just to name a few of the affected
ones - security research firms
checkpoint and net lab 360 posted about
the botnet on Friday so far Reaper has
not been used on a large-scale attack
but it could potentially face a real
threat if used for a botnet in the
coming months checkpoints intrusion
detection system detected the malware on
several different networks and noticed a
rapid increase of infections in the past
two weeks the malware would open up a
net cat reverse shell - an attackers IP
and the infected machines would also
look for other devices to infect as well
60% of the corporate networks that
checkpoint watches were shown to include
the malware that's a little scary the
malware has not been ddossing anybody
yet but it is continuously being updated
with new vulnerabilities so it can
continue attacking targets checkpoint
listed the device manufacturers for
products that are vulnerable to reaper
so if an update is available for those
devices update them ASAP otherwise
factory resetting the device could also
remove the malware at least for a short
amount of time thank you again to all of
the wonderful people who contribute to
patreon.com/lenguin
you new x' every single week we're on
the way to our next goal which just so
happens to allow me to upgrade some of
our equipment so it turns out I'm gonna
have to budget out a little bit money
for a light apparently and it will also
open up a live video Q&amp;amp;A just for
patrons each and every month any little
bit helps us grow the show and in return
you will get access to a bunch of extras
on patreon we might even free to your
adorable furry baby in an upcoming
episode just like these ones and
remember to check out the perk levels on
patreon and thank you again for helping
us keep the show coming completely
independent and of course if you cannot
donate you can hit that subscribe
you can share this episode on your
favorite social media and use that
hashtag threat wire so that we see it
and with that I'm Shannon Morris and I
will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
