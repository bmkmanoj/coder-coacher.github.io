you at risk WordPress fixes a rather big
problem and what's up introduces
two-step verification all that coming up
now on threat wire greetings I am
Shannon Morrison this is threat wire for
Tuesday February 14th 2017 happy
Valentine's Day this is your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom this show is now on
iTunes as well as your favorite
podcasting apps thanks to our patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat wire so
make sure to subscribe and now on to the
news first off valve steam is an online
gaming community with 125 million active
accounts recently a cross-site scripting
attack was found on malicious profiles
that could Spence the market funds which
is actual money make malicious changes
to a user's profile or redirect the user
to an attack site the problem was first
made public via a reddit post called
warning regarding a steam profile
related exploit that states the issue
happens when you simply view or open a
profile page of another user or you open
your own activity feed when a user does
this if javascript is embedded in the
profile it can then attack the viewer
some users on reddit reported scheme
market funds being used to make
purchases without their consent
Ars Technica reported that the
javascript cross-site scripting was
currently being used to redirect the
user to a site that prompted for a
download of an unknown file and another
user posted a youtube feed of his
profile trolling which I kind of found
to be humorous
so we linked it below as of six days ago
this steam problem has been fixed and
profiles can be viewed safely again with
that said this is not the first time
that steam has had a big bug problem so
if you are a steam user we recommend
that you change your password
turn on two-factor authentication and be
authorized any computers that are
currently logged in to your steam
account for sure you should also run
malware or antivirus just in case and
lastly check website URLs in case you
are redirected to a phishing page and in
the steam settings you can actually
enable display steam URL address bar
when available so that you can see any
changes in the
On January 26 WordPress made version
four point seven point two available as
a security release for all websites
using the WordPress back-end this fixed
the critical content injection
vulnerability a cross-site scripting
vulnerability and an unauthenticated
privilege escalation in the REST API the
researchers who disclosed the
vulnerabilities to WordPress work at
security or secure eyes security and
they also reported that four different
campaigns have been attacking sites that
still haven't been updated and patched
the campaign's will defaced websites
with mass scans looking and finding
websites that are still unpatched they
have so far defaced over 66,000 web
pages running on wordpress now while
water press first received this
disclosure from the researchers they
waited a whole week until disclosing the
problem publicly so that the update
would be silently patching millions of
websites during that time most sites
leave automatic updating on and if you
have a wordpress site doing that then
you're probably fine but as an admin a
wordpress site can turn off this auto
update leaving their site vulnerable to
hacks an attack started appearing only
48 hours after disclosure all you have
to do to protect your site from the
attacks is to simply update it to
WordPress four point seven point two if
you use what's up they've been in the
news quite a bit lately you will notice
a new update heading your way if it
hasn't already
whatsapp the popular messaging app that
was built using the signal protocol for
encryption just announced that they have
begun rolling out 2-step verification
for their app in iOS Android and Windows
devices now there is a big caveat here
this is not two-factor authentication it
is 2-step verification so this two-step
verification process does not use a
rolling code that is generated in an app
like Google Authenticator or offi this
is a memorized six digit PIN code that
you have to enter to verify your
whatsapp account if you forget your code
you can also make whatsapp send you a
link to disable 2-step verification via
email and then hopefully your email has
two-factor authentication turned on also
if you forget your six digit passcode
and you didn't use a backup email
address then you won't be able to Rivera
Phi your phone number on whatsapp for up
to seven days
on Rivera fiying all of your old
messages will be erased but if you want
to set this up you can go over to
settings account 2-step verification
click enable and then just follow the
on-screen instructions luckily it's
