domain.com hello and welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse zoo weekly does Sutekh
plus and it's awesome thanks for joining
us guys welcome back we have a CES
hangover he does we all do I had
caffeine so I'm not feeling that bad but
you know what actually my throat is a
little sore am I too yeah you got it we
probably had the CES flu but I'm trying
to survive by drinking lots and lots of
hot tea so I don't notice it as much
nothing I say on a little bit like a man
but asparagus and broccoli and spinach
see that'll do the trick it sounds very
healthy it's good stuff CES was fun we
got tons and tons of segments I feel
very productive I think the whole week
was very organized and it was it was
really good this year I had a good time
it was fun we survived it we did i cant
IM you mean a nap of course i am a Vegas
limit you know 60 yeah this is horrible
I know what you mean we're back to the
regular technol us so hooray for that
and I'm glad that we can float or see
our q1 on this and and keep bringing you
guys the awesome stuff yeah you know
that's what's up um we have a new set we
do I really like what you guys did so
apparently the guys were up until like
four a.m. yesterday building this new
set and I gotta say it looks really nice
oh it doesn't cute are completely
finished yet so I'm assuming this is
like a beta yeah it's kind of like um
you remember an empire strikes back it
was like it was mostly functional yeah
it's just little bits and pieces weren't
there so we're working on it and love to
hear your suggestions this is I think
like the seventh or eighth iteration of
the set since 2005's I'd love to see a
compilation of images from each set you
just to see the growth from season one
all the way to season whatever we're on
now well most 11 Wow we actually
speaking of which this is
so season 10 episode 21 I don't care
what the file you download no I don't
care what the file you downloaded says
in the file name this is season 10
episode 21 we're on a 26-episode release
cycle the season ends on februari 22nd
2012 that's to 22 12 right and it's just
a crazy conversation and it would have
to have with our network so we're just
gonna pretend like those crazy numbers
that you're seeing didn't happen it like
it is continue on okay we'll just we'll
just continue our numbers nobody is
worried so um one of the my favorite
things about so yeah sorry I had such a
good time is the fact that when you go
you get all sorts of really cool schwag
as people just kind of like stand in the
lanes of the football field rose and
they hand you stuff and you're just like
thanks I guess so flashlight cool
another screen wiper awesome but one of
the things we get is like USB flash
drives yeah we pretty much stock up on
thumb drives for the year because you
know with all the linux distros and
crazy stuff we're always trying we
always need like spare drives to flash
yes and it's nice because you ain't
enough these little one and two gigs
with a press kits on them so that you
can they're the perfect size for like
bootable linux distros i have to say uh
you know I noticed something about it I
got like this isn't all of them was
given some away already but it's like we
got a ton here yeah I got um these i'm
saying and i think my you like my
favorite one is a Chewbacca right see
that's super cute it's not adorable you
know the thing I've noticed though is uh
I got this one from gorilla glass yeah
yeah I got one this one from x300
there's there's another one from hzl
listeners my worm hco and oh no
something about all the carmen yeah
garmin oh those look just right guys are
trains trying so hard to stay relevant
here's here's another one another one in
11 our dedication yeah this is the exact
this is a rubber ducky inside of this
it's the exact same thing these and how
wonderful is that this makes me wonder
mm-hmm if we just happen to go to see
es with a whole bunch of rubber duckies
with some kind of payload installed we
just started handing them out how many
people would go home and plug them into
your at their machines think you know
how cool press kit probably every
journalist that goes to the show which
already knows and insecure and you know
why we don't do this is because remember
what happened to gizmodo when they sent
a journalist to CES with a TV begun work
at conferences no pineapples no duckies
yeah we're not gonna pull that stuff
revision3 would hate us if we got them
kicked out of CES but that would be so
bad so bad yeah but you know what will
little ass anyway well it's not our mo I
don't necessarily need so many for for
myself so many of these USB flash drive
so I'm gonna give give away some of
these as like trivia winners and stuff
like that and I promised someone put any
payloads on them you're giving away the
the frog frog yeah well my cat got bored
of it and I was like maybe somebody
would like it okay yay let's move on to
gifts from a fan yay so we did get a
gift I like gifts it's a cool gift too
well I wouldn't know actually have you
looked at it I haven't no idea what this
is I'm might have I think that's already
