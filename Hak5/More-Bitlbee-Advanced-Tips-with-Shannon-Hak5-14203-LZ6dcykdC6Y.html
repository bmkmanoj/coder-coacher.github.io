techniques this segment of hak5 is
brought to you by Podio last week I give
you some of my favorite advanced
techniques inside of spittle beads the
IRC / chat room client now you can also
use this for a whole bunch of other cool
techniques that I'm going to talk about
now including encryption and well a
couple of different things especially if
you wanted to for example delete your
account all esso go into that now first
off let's go ahead and start with
encryption you can add encryption to a
specified user with this thing called
OTR connect Nick which is typed out
looks like this OTR connect and then
their nickname so if I wanted to talk to
I as akhtar I would just type in I as
akhtar and you can press tab to actually
autofill in his whole name now this
means off the record encryption and
encryption can also be D established or
reestablished with OTR disconnect or OTR
reconnect that's also very easy OTR
disconnect or reconnect which looks just
like that now this can be really handy
especially in a day and age like now
because not all of your IRC and all of
your different chats are going to be
encryption on encrypted automatically
now if you want to use it you can you
can type in OTR SP and then a person's
nickname and a secret for them to answer
this is going to authenticate a user's
active fingerprint with SMP as a P
stands for socialists millionaires
protocol yeah it's kind of weird and you
can also create a private OT our key
with OTR key gen and then whatever your
account number might be now all of it
sounds really confusing but once you
actually get into it actually pretty
easy and of course always remember to
save with safe which is very simple now
if a chat module ever wants you to say
yes or no to any kind of question it's
very easy as well you just have to type
in yes and then the account number for
me for a gmail at zero or you can type
in 0 0 and this is going to answer the
very first known question in the
entire route list so if you have a whole
bunch of questions lined up and you're
trying to answer the very last one keep
that in mind so if I want to see what
questions have not been answered yet I
can go to cue list and it's going to
give me the account number zero gtalk
and then the user this person wants me
to add him or her to his buddy list so
for this example I'm going to type who
is that I don't know who they are but
I'm going to say yes 0 and then you can
use yes or no commands to accept or
reject this request accepted your
authorization request and of course keep
in mind if there are several questions
it's only going to answer the first one
so you'll have to do it again and again
and again now let's say that you're a
little bit tired of betel beef and
you're ready to delete your entire
account this is going to delete
everything so use it just know that it
for future acknowledgement this is very
easy as well you just type in drop and
then your password so for my example
what is my password great day off I'm
going to say it's a game and I would hit
enter it'll ask me to delete and it'll
delete my entire account of course I
don't really want to do that right now
now I want to list all of my different
buddies that i'm using in biddle be for
a specific client or specific
specifically I want to see if they're
online or offline at this time for this
example I can use a command called B
list and this is going to list all my
different buddies be list and all use
online and this is going to give me a
listing of every single person that is
currently online now another really
handy thing you can do in Biddle be is
transferring files although currently
there's only two commands that are
available basically you can only do
anything with files that are being
transferred to you you can either
transfer cancel with the account number
which will cancel transfer and it looks
like this transfer cancel and for gtalk
for myself it'd be 0 and it's going to
say no pending transfers because i'm
currently not transferring
files or another thing you can do is
reject a file completely by typing and
transfer reject and this will reject any
incoming file transfers whatsoever and
that just looks like transfer reject and
of course it says no pain pending
transfers again you can also create a
channel to separate all of your
different IDs because hopefully by this
time using Biddle be you're using it for
a whole bunch of different clients now
you can do this very simply by typing
and /join and then whatever the channel
is whether that's msn gtalk or what have
you so if I wanted to join the msn one
if I had msn on here and type in /join
ampersand msn and it would create an msn
channel and this is going to give me
just a single channel for everything
going on in msn which is nice because
it's going to separate out all the
craziness that's going on in route if
you haven't ignored that yet now this is
going to automatically include all of
your msn contacts as well into that new
channel so keep that in mind now let's
have some fun with away statuses now
these are kind of interesting the way
that they work is you can type in / away
and then busy BRB phone lunch whatever
invisible hidden and this is going to
show any kind of extra info to all your
clients or it'll choose the most notable
client information so for example for
msn if you've used it in the past you
know that if you type in away food or a
way that has to do with any kind of
lunch it'll say out to lunch no matter
what so if i typed in let me go back to
route / away and i'm going to say i'm
just busy this is going to set my away
status too busy and of course if i had
msn going right now it would also put me
too busy or if i said lunch it would put
me as out to lunch if you want to start
a group chat with several different
people and they all have to be set from
the same client so all from msn are all
from jeep talk or what have you first
what you want to do is chat
with just one person to do that you're
going to type in chat with and then
whoever the name is so i'll type in chat
with hak5 darren and it's going to tell
me you can't open a group chat with hak5
darren basically just because he's not
online right now but it'll open up a
client or a separate separate channel
for hak5 darren and then you can use the
IRC command / invite to invite all the
other people that you want to into that
chat room so you have your own special
chat room for all of your BFFs now if
you get bored of your name you can
always change that with / Nick very
similar to IRC you also need to register
or read register your new nickname with
all your new information or I can also
type in identify tak no load which looks
like that and this is basically going to
re identify yourself under the new
nickname but techno load tells the
command to verify you but not load any
kind of new settings so while you're
changing your nickname you're still
going to be logged in to all of your
same kamiya or all your different same
chat clients msn gtalk whatever they
might be now last but not least is one
of my favorite things back in like the
early 2000s I used to get on msn and use
all sorts of these cute little icons in
parentheses and you would type them out
and they be adorable to all your friends
well surprisingly you can do this in
Biddle be too if you want to do all
sorts of msn Smiley's such as like k4
kiss or little parentheses with the 84
music or the little carrot for a
birthday cake it's very easily all you
have to do is type in whatever you
wanted to say in msn and then type in
whatever you had now in msn wherever
your friends see it it's going to turn
into a little kissy face isn't that cute
now that's it for my advanced tutorial
as far as Biddle biko's it's pretty fun
I like this chat client it's very easy
to use it's simple although it does have
a few broken bits and pieces here and
there
but of course i always do want to know
what your alternatives are or if you
found something really cool about bittle
be that i didn't necessarily mention
definitely let me know feedback at hak5
org and i'll see you on the other side
hey guys so I'm on a little layover here
across America very excited because i
was just up in old gosh I was up in
portland and seattle i went to Medford
and Eugene I've been down to San Diego
and Los Angeles now and it's really cool
to see you know just the weird weird
like awesome loops that have made here
and it's really based on you guys I keep
getting this question like oh are you
coming to XYZ and it's not it's not
about you know am i coming to your town
and are you gonna be there but it's
about like who signs up and it's really
cool because i am using Podio to manage
all of this it's so great it's like
having your own internal social network
I'm actually checking it out here on my
phone I love this they've got an android
and iphone app and I just you know got a
new sign up here from pyro dog in
Minneapolis who wants to show me his
awesome hackerspace I can't wait to get
out to the Twin Cities so that's why you
know i'll be going to minneapolis
because somebody signed up and so a lot
of people also you know they may not be
you know representative of a hackerspace
or something like that and you know i'm
not limiting myself in that way so i set
up a separate form over on hack across
America com we're now if you just want
to say hey I'm voting for my town just
entering your postcode or your zip code
and your email address and then that way
I can know where there's interest
because basically what I'm doing with
this whole map cuz I'm just playing a
big game of connect the dots it's so
great i love that podio is allowing me
to take all of this data in and actually
make some sense of it because it's got
such great no filtering and sorting it's
so much better let me tell you it in
2010 when i did this is just a
spreadsheet that's not the way you want
to do it and so I love this I've got but
we started using it internally a hack
five so we've got Santa Shannon and
Sarah and Paul in it now so I can assign
tasks delegate stuff manage projects
you know stuff comes in on the hack shop
we're using it for quotes and for
support and stuff like that it's so
great it integrates you don't even
realize you're using it you've been
using Podio if you signed up for hack
across america or if you've used the
hack shop it's all in there i love it so
i just thought i'd make mention that we
do have that new one on there if you go
to hack across America com you see right
there at the top you just give us your
zip code and your email address and that
way I can gauge where there's interest
so if there's like 50 people in Wichita
I'm going to Wichita you know how cool
is that so thanks PO do for hooking me
up with the software to make this happen
maybe it's of interest to you guys
especially in the corporate environments
I remember when I was assisted men being
asked to develop some sort of similar
thing and at the point at the at that
point we're using like SharePoint and
it's it's not the right thing so anyway
I'm very stoked about this stuff because
it's like having your own social network
so yeah check it out over at po do calm
and I will see you guys on hack across
America
this week in the hack shop we're having
a special on antennas you can get five
dollars off your antenna purchase for
