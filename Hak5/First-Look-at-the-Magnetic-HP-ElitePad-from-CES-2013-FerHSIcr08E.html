by domain.com with hak5 I'm Shannon
Morse coming to you from show stoppers
at CES 2013 and I found HP and they have
some excellent new tablets Mike tell me
all about this why is this so cool and
why do I want one of these well Shannon
this is the HP elitepad 900 first thing
you know this is a real cool sleek
device so why don't we start on the back
machined aluminum so very very rich look
with that the metal you flip it over
it's got gorilla glass 2 9 millimeters
stand 1.5 pounds as you felt it before
very very very super light I like that
it's a really sleek tablet running
Windows 8 it's got the atom processor
it's got a 10.1 inch screen what that
means it's compatible with x86
applications so this is what's the
resolution of this guy like is a 720p
the equivalent of 720p it's a 16 x 10
aspect ratio which allows you to do a
lot of form filling so as i mentioned
before not only can it is it a touch pad
pad you can also use pan and we mart
jack us a little bit later it has a
keyboard attachment as well very thin
very light but you know it's a tablet
but there's so much more than that so
let's talk a little bit about the smart
jacket so on the surface this will get
about data why don't you hold it for me
that gets about 9 to 10 hours of battery
life is this a great battery life but
there are times you're going to want
more batteries so we've it designed a
jack a system called the smart jock and
this is just one of them this is the
expansion jacket so I can put a battery
right here and it works very simple well
it's kind of take the jacket slide it in
here we'll put this just like this now
all of a sudden we've got to tab with
over 18 hours of battery life you'll
also see us has increased expansion for
so a couple of USB HDMI we also have st
an SD card as well so greatly expanded
the capability of the talent we also
have a jacket that has the same constant
you put it in and a keyboard flops out
so it gives you a key but gives you the
keyboard option and when it's like that
it's more like a notebook right so it's
got a keyboard like a regular notebook
so do you think that this would be a
good desktop replacement for some people
it's not necessary a desktop replacement
for some people they could use there's
desktop replacement that's a great segue
to the docking solution right so I can
put it in a dock and as you see on the
back
there are a lot of different ports on
there so this could be used for some
people it could be used as the main pc
with a larger monitor so you've got the
desktop mode you've got the notebook
mode and we talked a little bit about
the tablet mode as well one of the other
features you'll notice the design
there's not a single screw on here so
again this is designed for large
enterprises and they may have thousands
of these and while this passes all the
mil spec testing what I mean by that we
drop this from a height of thirty six
inches 30 plus times we bake it down to
you know and you know 25 below zero we
heat it telling me this thing didn't
break it didn't so it passes what we
call the mil spec testing so it's very
very durable but in real life we know
that you know hey if it drops from if
you put leave it on the roof of your car
run over it you might crack the screen
something like that but anyway my point
is that we have a tool for self-service
self servicers and because there's no
screws on here and everything is held in
place by magnets you put it in you lock
it in and because Magnus you put the
opposite polarization there will you
just take the suction cup and you can
replace the screen you can replace the
wireless module in there and then you
basically snap it back into place so
it's kind of geeky but really really
cool and really important for for large
corporations and self maintained errs
and this is why I'm in love with this
new tablet I think it's beautiful and
the fact that you can replace your own
screen is not only going to save a lot
of money for your consumers but it's
also really cool for the geeks at heart
it is I do want to be clear it's not you
know the ones these twos these people
are not going to get this is for its
fertile corporations there have a
thousands of these but again it's a
great feature starting price 649 for the
32 gigabyte version 699 for the 64
gigabyte version the HP elitepad 900 and
is this going to be running on 3G or
just Wi-Fi it does hey why fine adjust
have 3g network availability to I don't
have the pricing for that if you go on
online HP com you can order right now
you better see the pricing with those
bertha the prices i called you for the
Wi-Fi versions wonderful thank you so
