in out I protect my netbook from konbu
with full disk encryption and Aaron
shows off hidden volumes and key files
all that and more this episode of hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by go daddy
Squarespace Gamefly and viewers like you
hey everybody welcome this week's
episode of hack 5 I'm Matt last doc I'm
Shannon Morse and Darren is doing what
Darren goes best where did he go I don't
know
Wow doesn't matter it's our episode
today today we're gonna be talking to
you guys about Drive Encryption now what
is driving Christian well you've all had
the nightmares about your laptop up and
disappearing in the middle of the night
yeah your car something like that to the
point where it be bad if you were in a
high profile position like say a Paul or
you know somebody works at a company
that is crazy
a bantul a bank that data needs to be
protected yeah it does
so real quick give you an example here
Ernst &amp;amp; Young lost data on a laptop that
was stolen from a car that's it was just
stolen right out of a car and there goes
all your security right out of the
backseat and you know it contains Social
Security numbers your address your name
your date of birth this is all the the
key ingredients that identity thieves
need to destroy your life that's all
they need yeah and make your life a
living hell that will take way more
money than you could possibly ever have
to try and fix so real quick let's give
you an example of how easy it is to
actually bypass the quote unquote
security of a Windows machine which is
deployed and you know what is it eight
nine out of ten business it's it's super
super easy I'm gonna show it off on
Darren's laptop I'm using this thing
called calm boot which I showed off um
two episodes prior so I just have to
press enter at the boot screen once it
gets to the Kryptos logic menu I just
press ENTER and we got some cute little
ASCII art I just press ENTER again okay
so all I've done so far is press ENTER
just a couple of times and then once it
gets to the windows login screen which
looks completely normal all I have to do
is push in you know I don't I don't know
the password I'll just put earrings a
dumb night
Hunter oh look at that I'm in this
machine whatever you just typed and
definitely wasn't this password cuz I
know it's for a test machine so all it
takes is one of these that's it to
bypass cute little ISO file that's all
you need
oh god my bed alright so so we've got
the machine and this could have all been
prevented if we would have installed
encryption on hard drive but we didn't
so now Darren's life has just been
destroyed because I'm sure he's got some
really sensitive data on the credit
cards basically this I could basically
you know I could probably clone credit
cards if he had you know the information
on there create my own credit cards so
yeah just just to let you guys know
we're gonna show you how to protect
against this talk about both in the
corporate environment and doing it
yourself but first we want to talk to
you about the hack 5 meetup which I'm
stoked about because I actually get to
attend it go to camp bad there boom fist
bump take away yeah that's right guys I
am super stoked because we are having

until July 8th all right we'll be back
in just a moment
alright guys so here we are we're gonna
actually show you how to protect your
data
unfortunately the tool that we're use I
can't use in a corporate environment
there's no centralized management
console there's no recovery you know
single recovery system that we can
actually use for support personnel but
on a corporate environment you do have
options there are solutions from the
caffee encryption plus hard disk
encryption I think is from Guardian edge
and then there's also one from RSA which
you know they do some windows password
syncing if you want to and stuff like
that and you know centralized recovery
consoles so makes assists in men's life
a whole lot easier what you actually
have to to work around these things but
what we're talking about today is open
source
it's TrueCrypt yeah TrueCrypt is
completely free it's open source to
anybody that needs to use it it's an
incredibly fast download which is really
nice you can do everything from
encrypting your entire hard drive to
just certain pieces of data pretty much
anything that you want to you but today
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
encrypt your entire hard drive yes so
there's a couple of choices on the front
first screen you can do encrypt system
partition or drive or you can just go to
create volume I like just create volume
because it's one little button it's
wonderful and I'm encrypting the system
partition or the entire system drive so
we're going encrypt the whole drive
instead of just the windows system
partition right and it's gonna say hey
if this petition is not acceptable you
can go back and choose to encrypt only a
system partition instead blah blah you
just press ok with that host protected
area certain netbooks have a host
protected area and they use this to
store everything from tools to data for
raid all sorts of different things
basically it's like your recovery
partition kind of thing yeah it was a
cell wall to make your life easier if
you screw up your computer royally so
from what I've heard online from the
different tutorials that I've read about
this is you shouldn't encrypt your host
protected area just to be on the safe
side so I'll choose no on that single
boot multi boot that's
yes mm-hmm I'm a single bleeder oops
next one is encryption options this is
all your standard encryption options yes
yes serpent twin fish right fish so I'll
just stick with AES and then you choose
your password this is pretty cool
because if you choose a password that's
under 20 characters it's gonna come up
and say hey it's a lot easier to break a
20 character password than it is
something over 20 characters and it'll
keep on saying that until you get
something that's over 20 so I'll put in
let's see oh and you also have to do
capitalization and numbers this is kind
of interesting and weird all at the same
time so it says you're supposed to move
your mouse around for a long time just
to get a very very randomized amount of
keys it's very magical in my opinion
basically what it is is it's taking your
cursor position and translating that
into key values so that it can generate
okay based on completely random
coordinates that's what it's done so I
move it around for like a minute or two
and then press next and you see I have
my header key and my master key press
next again now this is the part that
kind of screwed me up when I was doing
this on my netbook the thing with my
netbook is it doesn't have a cd-rom
drive with encryption on your full disk
drive it's going to tell you that you
have to make a rescue disk okay via a CD
you have to so I'm going to go to browse
and I'm just gonna create this thing
called rescue disk die so ok I'm gonna
save that and then I press next and then
it says it's been created and it's been
stored so that's good and then I press
next again see it's going to tell me you
haven't burned a diskette so you can't
go on yet you have to create this rescue
disk just in case so basically the the
actual application is looking out for
you yes it is it's protecting you just
in case because you need a rescue does
okay so how do we get by this on a
netbook which obviously doesn't have a
cd-rom drive this is what I googled I
found this really cool program called
win CD EMU it's an emulator you
basically just install
it you you run it and then you create CD
emulations on your computer so you can
turn little flash drives a little ste
cards and make those work as if they are
CDs so complete your ISO on there and
you can skip this part and it will let
you go ahead together basically we use
something like daemon tools or power is
oh just to mount the ISO have it scan it
and then say if we wanted to live
dangerously that is just basically any
heart any ISIL mounting utility that
makes it look like a cd-rom drive yes
exactly exactly that's what it's doing
that's exactly what you're going for is
making it look like it's a cd-rom gotcha
you're basically tricking true crypts so
you can get around this part if you
don't have to shoot yourself in the foot
later on yeah yeah might hurt very much
don't come bitching to me okay so after
that you get to the next screen which is
basically just um telling you to do a
test run so you choose to do the test
run you press ok and it restarts your
computer and once it gets to the restart
screen you're gonna see combo TrueCrypt
boot up on your screen and it's going to
ask you for the password that you just
created so you're gonna type that in
okay so it boots up back into the screen
back into Windows and then once it gets
back to your login you log in just like
you usually do with your usual password
and everything and then TrueCrypt
automatically pops back up and it says
your your test run is completely done
and then you can say ok you can encrypt
now so you choose encrypt and then it
takes a good two hours to encrypt your I
Drive independent if you guys are
running on a netbook
obviously the Atom processor it's not so
yeah mine took a long time to encrypt to
go 2 to 3 hours depending on the hard
drive speed of spindle speed as well as
the processor speed inside of the
machine that you're doing it on will all
dictate how long your Drive Encryption
actually takes great and once it's
completely done it says your encryption
is complete yeah and you are good to go
so what are some of the caveats of
running full disk encryption one thing
about this doing the whole
full encryption thing is that you might
notice a 1 to 2 percent full system
performance hit it if your unlike a
Pentium 2 it might slow you down but if
you're on one of the newer modern models
of PCs and netbooks you're probably not
going to notice the difference ok and
now where do we go we do also if you

hack this my friends is a situation you
never want to be in what is the password
to the encrypted file I will never tell
you it's loaded so you really want to
die no I'm not that much of a wheat hard
by passwords goldfish 45 thank you can
now have my picture of myself as a
monkey encrypted in my TrueCrypt volume
geez that was yeah but no it's not I
mean this is this is the coolest most
amazing feature the splendiferous nosov
TrueCrypt right open source goodness
with plausible deniability you know what
that means that means that I got the
folder full of you know financial stuff
here right and maybe I'm Enron so I got
another folder full of financial stuff
and I have a volume within a volume and
you don't know that there's a volume
inside the volume let me break it down
it's really cool open source goodness
basically plausible deniability means
that I can I can like I said hide
something within something and have two
passwords to a volume but one of the
passwords opens what may look like you
know the embarrassing photos me as a
monkey or something anyway and then the
other one has the actual secret data and
you can never tell that the hidden
volume exists within the outer volume
and that is a photo of
you as a as a chihuahua or something on
a roller coaster I mean it happens right
but it's super secret data and I want to
make sure that it's secure so let's go
ahead and doing charlie I don't you
access it without them knowing it's that
it's easy man let me show you check this
out right so we pull up TrueCrypt just
like we would in - as Jenna to show you
- you to create up you know a entire
hard drive daily hard drive encryption
and we're gonna create a new volume here
and I'm gonna create an cryptid file
container and I'm gonna create a hidden
volume right and we're gonna do it
normal node so we're gonna create both
the both the regular encrypted volume
and then the hidden one inside of it so
I'm gonna go next right and we are going
to select a file we're gonna create a
new file in so you come back switch temp
3 because I'm old-school and we're gonna
call it hidden volume cuz I'm not very
creative dot tc4 TrueCrypt right and
we're gonna go next and just like we
would we're going to yeah we're gonna go
AES cuz that's cool and we're gonna make
it a hundred megabyte file here right
okay and we're gonna give it a password
that's pretty lame okay I'm actually
gonna make this a little bit cooler and
check this box here this is use key
files check this out right so you say
use key files right and I go and add a
key file here and back in temp 3 I
actually have a key file here if I
preview it for you you're gonna
understand what I'm talking right that's
a picture of Paul our Associate Producer
getting his head shaved like a spool now
so anyway we're going to use that as our
key file what that means is that
whenever we want to unencrypt this
partition this volume if you will we are
actually going to need that file present
which is cool because it's two-factor
authentication it's not just something I
know like a password it's something I
have like a file and this file could
live on a USB Drive they have a safety
deposit box and then really cool stuff
with you know mini coopers and
explosions so let's just go ahead and
format this fat and it's all good all
right
so now it's time to create some outer
volume contents so we're going to open
the outer volume so this right here my Z
Drive is that encrypted volume that we
just create
it's 100 megabytes big and I'm gonna put
this file here secret JPEG it's got a
picture of you know the D monkey right
I'm gonna throw that in there great so
we've got some content in there this is
to say that if you had a gun pointed to
me that wasn't just a we zapper and I
gave you this password you would see
that there's actually some embarrassing
documents or some financial data or
whatever you put some screwball stuff in
there that you would potentially one or
more fancified falsify totally right
just like your birth certificate so what
we're gonna do next is go next in this
wizard here and we are finally going to
create the hidden volume within right so
we're gonna give you a EES just like the
other one we could do something crazy
like serpent to fish a yes but you know
yes is good right and here's the thing
it has determined that the maximal
maximum possible hidden volume size is
ninety eight point nine one megabytes
right because we have the existing
hundred Meg container we've got a file
inside of it has to be smaller and
here's something very important to to
understand if we made this this this
hidden volume inside nine hundred or
ninety eight point 91 Meg's and then we
later on added something else to this
outer volume it would overwrite our
existing ball our hidden volume within
so you know what it's just a little JPEG
I want to actually keep really really
hidden so I'm gonna make this like a two
Meg right so we'll go ahead go ahead and
make that a two Meg hidden we're gonna
give it a super secret password and
we're going to use a key file again and
let's go ahead and add that file which
just happens to be a photo of you lookin
pretty dumb anyway go imagine that and
we're gonna hit okay and next and again
format it fat and boom there we go and a
little warning about hey don't overwrite
the stuff it's gonna be bad right so
here we go we've gone ahead and created
a outer volume that is secret and then a
hidden volume within that's only two
Meg's that's super secret okay so all we
have to do to actually load this up and
be able to get to our super secret cool
stuff here is select a file and remember
we made that in temp three and we call
it it hidden volume got TC and we're
going to go ahead and mount that on our
Z Drive and here's the cool thing right
we could put you either password in here
right now now we know that the pitch
Geron monkey is in the original volume
the outer volume but the super-secret
one that we really want the juicy stuff
is in the hidden one so let's go ahead
and enter that password okay and let's
use a key file choose the key file and
remember this is a USB Drive that we
left inside of our drywall at the first
house we ever lived in in like the
sub-basement or something like that and
okay and now if it just double-click on
the Z drive here I have my volume that I
can go ahead and put my super-secret
data and now it is totally super secure
and nobody will be messing with my
picture of you on a roller coaster at
Busch Gardens Williamsburg as a dog or
something it just happens right
excellent
I really wish this was real in an
alternate universe in which gamers are
Pro and Leeds and uber it is well I mean
well I mean the thing about it is you
know people are aged nowadays we don't
keep paper records right right so you
know it obviously you're gonna have the
store away your birth certificate in
your social security number for driver's
licenses and passports and stuff like
that that's all well and good but bank
information you know credit card
information you know account information
for your home equity whatever we're just
personal stuff yeah you know they like
you keep a audio video diary something
so alright and we just dump it in either
to see the my docks or some folder that
we created under you know one of them
and it gets to the point where you're
like oh what's that
you know so it's better than putting
your porn in windows system32 backslash
oh wow killer right whoa
I just what anyway just and you would
know about this why oh no reason I'm
just saying that like I have read on the
Internet's which from what I understand
is for porn that this could happen and
we would love to hear what you guys
think of you know
what no never mind I was let's say tell
us what you used true crypt for on the
forums that's not gonna happen anyway
you guys can imagine a million different
reasons why you would want to do this
Shanna's freaked out by a spider so I
think we should wrap this up so I can
kill him yeah yeah cuz pretend it's
really bad we want to let you guys know
that we encourage your feedback feedback
at hak5 org is where you can get in
touch with us we'd like to hear what you
think about the episodes especially when
we're playing around with formats and
tweak and stuff and just having a good
time yeah anything else I have gotten
everybody's we did have the ESX white
box stuff that we've been taking a look
at the forum's up next week I've been
getting ridiculous amount of email I am
reading in every single one even if I'm
