Equifax falls for phishing techniques a
car tracking service leaks data and iron
lights on security cameras could spill
confidential information all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I am
Shannon Morrison this is threat wire for
September 26 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon yet please do so we have
lots that we want to do for the show but
we can't do it without your support
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support threat wire and the
link is in the show notes so first off
on Wednesday of last week
Cisco talos posted updated information
on their blog about research they were
doing into the ccleaner malware debacle
Cisco Telus determined upon further
research that the command and control
server that the ccleaner malware was
calling back to was actually trying to
send a second stage payload to 18
different companies possibly more where
several different machines were further
infected the companies included scene
tell HTC Samsung and Sony VMware Intel
Microsoft Cisco themselves Linksys and
d-link
just to name a few Cisco believes this
targeted attack was to steal
intellectual property and intended for
industrial espionage some of these
companies had more than one computer
compromised and in total the dragnet of
computers infected included over 700,000
pcs now while this is less than the
initial number of two point two seven
million that Avast said it is still
substantial and it speaks volumes to
problems with supply chain attacks cisco
has alerted the companies that were
compromised the company also found code
in the malware that was leaked to a
hacking group called group 72 or axiom
known to work with the Chinese
government but they also explained that
this is not enough proof for attribution
this hacking group has been around for
over a decade and they have been running
high-profile attacks against industry
and political organizations themselves
Avast went further and they updated
their blog to indicate that at least 40
companies at those big big brand tech
companies
we're infected with the second-stage
payload and alerted the companies as
well to the issue now in this case the
code used anti debugging and anti
emulation to hide itself along with a
third-stage payload that hit the
computer's memory this means that the
malware is never written to a storage
medium which also makes it really hard
to trace and research a vest also
released public data on which companies
had infected computers and how many in
each of those brands unfortunately
though it seems that Cisco could have
had even more information on the attacks
if the attackers had not been saving
data to a low-end server so according to
a vast information saved by attacks
before September 12 about machines that
were attacked was corrupted and it ran
out of space so it was deleted entirely
by the attackers instead of them just
going in and fixing it now because of
the seriousness experts are now
recommending that affected machines
revert back to a backup version of your
machine from before installation of the
infected ccleaner version if you're
unsure if yours was infected or not
check my last episode a threat wire
where I explained exactly which versions
and which kind of computers were
infected oh equifax in a report
published by the Wall Street Journal a
confidential note sent by fireEye to
some Equifax customers stated that
attackers had first interacted with the
network on March 10th four months before
the intrusion was detected and a half a
year before it was publicly disclosed
this does make sense given that the
Apache struts flaw was also being
exploited around that time mandiant
which is owned by fire I detected 35 IP
addresses tied to the attackers and
determined that they were using around
30 web shells to gain administrative
privileges on targeted machines it
sounds like this is part of the current
attack it is separate from the
previously reported hack in which
Equifax is tall X payroll division was
hacked between April 2016 and March 2017
now furthermore a security researcher
created a fake Equifax site called
security Equifax 2017 comm which is not
Equifax security 2017 dot-com and then
they trick the Equifax Twitter account
into posting it so the security
researcher did this to show how easy it
is to trick a company into
on an imposter site Nick's weeding the
security researcher and the site's
creator used it as an example of
phishing which we all know very well now
while we previously reported that the
Canadian office of the Privacy
Commissioner was planning on some
recourse it seems that they cannot do
much because they can only take a
reactive approach to investigations and
make recommendations the OPC cannot
currently regulate privacy in Canada as
such the OPC stated in their annual
report that they need to be able to
enforce legislation for Canadians
including fines and audits and lastly in
relation to Equifax users finally
started receiving a sign-up link for
trusted ID via email but the link
available in the email was flagged as a
phishing site on some browsers when it
started showing up potentially because
it was so new the site was being called
trusted ID premier comm and
unfortunately Equifax had also
registered trusted ID comm and as such
the email looks super obviously like a
phishing scam now since trusted ID is a
child company of Equifax it has its own
Terms of Service and its policies so the
signup could not be hosted on the same
Equifax comm site if you do choose to
sign up with the trusted ID credit lock
or fraud alert service take the
additional step to freeze your credit as
well which will stop any potential
attacks from opening new lines of credit
in your name is nothing safe well no not
when a company is storing data on a
publicly available Amazon s3 server hmm
tale as old as time
yeah so chrome Tech Security Center
discovered a repository of data on over
500,000 accounts that included ID
numbers license plates VIN numbers
emails hash passwords IMEI numbers and
more this belonged to SBR tracking which
is a company that monitors and recovers
vehicles for customers via GPS devices
attached to cars these devices obtain
information for a location via satellite
and then they send it to the users
account over the web it can obviously be
used to monitor where your car is at any
given time but it can also be used to
recover it if it gets stolen the device
location on the physical car was also
included for some strange reason in the
day
as well sv are tracking tracks cars for
the last 120 days which could have some
really dire privacy consequences for
users
now if the hashed password part makes it
sound like it could have saved the day
it actually didn't yeah
passwords were hashed using sha-1 which
is old and it's easily correct the
company secured the private data on the
server but they have not released a
statement and it is not clear whether or
not the data was accessed by attackers
security researchers at ben-gurion
university posted findings in a detailed
report explaining how malware called
air jumper could be used to infiltrate
air-gapped networks and send data in and
out via security cameras and infrared
LED lights this would allow an attacker
access to data on internal networks
covertly air jumper would already need
to be installed on the target computer
potentially by a USB flash drive for
example with the malware hidden on it
and the target would need to be within
range of an internet facing security
camera on the network now if those
conditions were met the malware targets
the cameras API to send data over led
via these little blinking patterns the
data is turned into ones and zeros which
are then turned into flashes of light
which then can be decoded to the
original data
now since IR LEDs are not viewable to
the human eye without some kind of
technical device like your phone it
would be simple to send this data
without being caught the researchers
also gave an example of an attacker
sending a tire LED data back to the
security camera which would then send
data to the network compromising any
devices on said network they suggested
being able to do this from a mile away
now luckily it would require very
specific conditions to be met to
actually work but if you are worried a
company could set up detection for
malware on their IR LED cameras or they
could also do detection at the network
level monitoring traffic from those
surveillance cameras I want to send huge
thanks and a huge shout-out to Michael
Eric Corey and the Cascadian beer
podcast which I checked out your podcast
it's super cool they are also on patreon

sitting in your stories via the patreon
community tab for this week I really
appreciate the links and while I was
able to get to all of the different
stories on this episode I think that
it's great that we have a place where we
can share news related to security and
privacy thanks again to everyone who
