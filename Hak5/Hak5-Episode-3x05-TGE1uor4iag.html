we've got a bunch of really good things
for you what's up baby thing goes in
speedy thing comes out right on yeah so
Simon Jake ish tells us about the xenos
wool coppola he does some evdo card
hacking Chris Grayling's here to talk to
us about the nokia n 770 it's the
ultimate hacking companion not like the
cube I'm going to show you some really
cool near infrared camera stuff and of
course I will tell you about some one
click remote assistant stuff that's
going to save your holidays nice okay so
that and a whole lot more on this
episode of how hak5
in the past power plants produced energy
at any cost now we're not only producing
energy but we're producing less Lutins
it's better for the community it's going
to be better for generations to come
joining us today is simon j cash from
xenos to show us some network management
systems Simon thanks so much for coming
down hi everyone gotta ask what's a
network management system um yeah
basically it's you know it allows you to
see your network and all the devices
connected to the network and like a
single point you know web interface
essentially so you can you know check on
the toner and check on the hard drive
space and do all these kinds of things
and like you know one cycle asks that we
run around the name exactly instead of
running around and going to an
individual machine you just have it
there in one single view okay so it's a
management or monitoring package that
let's be a little bit more proactive
about your network exactly yes I so what
are the kind of like underlying
technologies that make this work well we
utilize a lot of open source because
obviously we're an open source project
so we use you know python and soap and
so on so forth but to retrieve the data
from the individual devices we use SNMP
which stands for simple network
management protocol okay well for
somebody that's not very familiar with
SNMP can you maybe just break that down
what exactly does SNMP do for us so you
know basically the idea is that you you
have an SNMP agent on a device and you
know windows comes with one if it's not
installed it comes on my windows XP CD
as an extra or you know all the UNIX
system like Linux and so on so for you
can install them on there as well and so
this agent provides information to you
so you can ask it like how is your CPU
utilize it or how is the cpu utilization
of this device and it will answer you
back right so all right so what we're
looking at is the Zener software running
on like Fedora CentOS or any of your
favorite linux distribution here and a
vm player but to actually talk to it we
do all that through the web yeah that's
right so you know you can see this here
and this is you know not very exciting
as you can see lots of numbers and so on
so forth but basically the system is
just put it up but now you can interact
through it with the browser so when you
first enter in as a login screen and the
login is admins and us and then you get
presented with this dashboard as you can
see you know you need to enter you need
to get a google maps api key there's
already a local host which is basically
the vm virtual machine it's already pre
set up for you and it does this on the
first boot up and then you can really go
already into the details so you know it
will already have detected some of your
networks and then you can essentially go
and autodiscover devices on your network
ok so what happens when you oughter
discovered devices on the network
basically what Dennis will do is it just
will icmp pink sweet your entire subnet
of the you know of your network and
we'll see which device responds back and
we'll see which device is actually
responding to SNMP requests a little bit
like and nap you know you know exactly
it's essentially a little like nmap were
in you know in in the way that you know
it goes through your network and then
once you run the discovery on your
network you get actually you know this
output which you know will give you
information about you know how many of
these devices has then I discovered you
know how many active ip's on a network
which which type of ips are there and
then it will also inform you about the
devices whether or not they're actually
running as an MP or not so you know you
can use this kind of like I to do list
you know I need to still install these
SNMP agent omni's machine bother it's
found 11 in our active in our
environment here at the hack house
exactly most of them don't have SNMP
running must be more windows boxes it's
a real simple thing to go ahead and you
know send out with group policies or
just turn on on each machine absolutely
yeah iceboxx in the config it comes on
the windows XP CD and it you know
doesn't take more than you know 23
minutes you can even go to our website
we have how to's on how to do this and
then but we've actually set up SNMP on
one of the market machines which is the
set-top box right I was set box and
basically once you know once that device
is then recognized Zeno's then adds it
to its inventory of devices so you can
see
this in here and you can see okay set
box you know this is the hostname and
it's actually in the discovered category
so what we need to do in order to
further categorize or help Zen us
understand what type of device that is
we basically need to take the device and
we need to move it into a device class
okay and once that process is done
Dennis will you know go and and model a
device so it will go and discover more
information as a seer any windows would
find information about see like the
software that's running or its disk
space or CPU or stuff whereas if we told
it that it was in a pressure class that
would go and find information like you
know dinner and exactly exactly and the
way to do this essentially the way this
is done is by either automatically sent
us will go and model the devices you
know every 12 hours every six hours or
what or you can actually go and force
the modeling of a device through the GUI
interface as well so it's kind of like
tagging those specific devices that we
can build kind of a map exactly exactly
and then once the device is modeled you
get you actually get all kinds of
interesting information more or less
interesting information so you get
information about you know general OS
information for example the interfaces
that are running on this particular
machine so we can actually see that you
know there is a VMware virtual ethernet
adapters and NVIDIA networking adapter
there's information about which type
what type of routes are set up on this
device there's information about
information about what type of IP
services are running on a device so like
ntp on that bias or whatnot and you can
then switch on monitoring from there you
also get information about as you
mentioned before software so you get
information you know oh great so here's
all thi this is leigh driver installed
and you know all kinds of other
information and it will actually go and
not only do this for this machine but
when you click on let's say this
security update you had another machine
that had the same security update you
would get a list of machines that have
the same type of software installed on
them
sounds good so that's so it's already
discovered our network so this is zenas
being used on our tiny little network
here at the hack house now when we come
back we're going to take a look at zenos
being used in a much larger environment
and maybe get into some of the
management functions that yep so stick
around we'll be back to this minute

time for trivia last trivia question
asked was in 1983 and then excuse me in
the nineteen eighty-three film wargames
lead character David Lightman played by
Matthew Broderick is introduced while
playing galaga and what Seattle arcade
there was bonus points for catching the
high score the answer is 20 grand palace
was the arcade and the high score was 58
thousand two hundred and sixty which is
correctly answered by shock dude now the
funny thing about that whole high score
thing was Matthew project was actually
setting the high score as that went on
just as a kind of interesting trivia
note too that was that during the film's
production actually sent him a Gallagher
machine to practice on really home and
he got really good at it huh so so he
really was setting the high score he
owns noobs nice in Galaga well little
tiny aliens right anyway so this month's
trivia question just wants trib you a
question time division multiplexing and
frequency division multiplexing are
examples of fixed link sharing
technologies what variable multiplexing
alternative is stated to be used in the
next revision of evdo sounds camp
complicated and fun well if you find it
i'm sure you're into a lot of fun and
geeky reading if you find fun reading
multiplexing i think it in for today you
should be really would bring pulse
amplitude modulation kind of fun too
anyway so as always send your answers to
trivia at act 5 org and now a word from
our sponsors
the generation coming up can't go learn
like I learn it just can't do it it's
out later that's done we get it okay so
I'm here doing a mod segment that I
didn't do right on so uh long story
short real quick this is my buddy will
how you doing hey nice to have you on
buddy thank you very much and so uh you
did your own sweet little mod here with
an evdo modem right ok so now real quick
for anybody that doesn't know what a
video is a video is what evolution
evolution data optimize do something
like aster data only whenever you yeah
which is really just a big marketing
blah blah blah bridgie yeah 3G cellular
data transfers cellular internet
connection connection through cdma
technology right ok if you don't know
what cdma is night their detection
multiple access Wow all right yeah I'm
on a llama bowl so anyway what now the
the whole story behind this thing is the
fact that you live out in the sticks yes
bfv for the people don't know where it
is that's a 2 306 110 miles outside of
efe anyway and so you don't have any
kind of broadband availability no DSL no
cable no not okay i can get dialogue bed
yeah it was that yeah so so then you
decided to go ahead and get the cvd el
modem and or this you can call it with
you yeah evdo modem and then discovered
that you have no cellular service out
there not at all we're very very minimal
um you can barely just get one bar okay
yeah if you want to put it in terms of
bars so what you decide to do is now
make your own antenna for the evdo modem
the skirt and boost your reception I
wouldn't say boosted but optimize my
incoming signal yes optimize your
incoming signals going with the whole
optimization alkalization cells
okay so let's break it down real quick
this is an evdo modem right that is
correct okay and this is the inside of
it this is where all the fun stuff
happens but this is what we're worried
about right here is this little gold
connector and that is the antenna
connection right external turn the
Commission user okay and don't call me
sir try to so and then that is where
this would normally connect to that is
correct it connects ranked this gold or
silver colored part right here on the
side mm-hmm that nice the connection for
the built in a factory antenna which
this is this is the original antenna now
and this would be these three pieces
here and we'll put them all together in
just a second but these make up your
antenna right it's great there's a
single pole element into the single pole
element antenna now exactly what does a
what does that mean what makes it a
single pole element antenna basically
this one piece here which is three and a
half inches long is cut specifically to
the 800 megahertz frequency that Verizon
uses to transfer data okay so the length
dictates its frequency reception that's
correct you don't have to insensitivity
you don't have to actually bend it like
you would see 4802 dot11 where you take
the screw and then wrap the copper wire
around or anything and sort this is just
a single pole kind of three and a half
inches okay and that's the actual
important part right that is correct so
what what do these do it serves us two
purposes one purpose is a ground plane
and connects to the outside the
connector which gives it the negative
signal and a structural support for the
internal antenna this is actual element
itself it actually hold itself up right
okay so once you go ahead and put these
all together for us should show us the
dealy chubbies there you go slide that
in there like that now I'd imagine if
the copper wire is both support and
touching the ground that these that the
copper and your actual element cannot
touch that's correct that I have a
rubber gaskets in here to stop them from
shorting out so to say
and that that shorting out would
actually just completely kill your sick
right you would have me over gotcha it
would be back in the Stone Age that
little thing he plugs into the connector
there no copyright on there and that's
now we're good all right verizon gives
you a wonderful cable so you can have it
external but i actually plugged into the
USB yeah because then you run that risk
of it snapping off yeah they're messing
up your USB connection so if your mobile
all the time it's a good idea to keep it
on the lanyard here right as just got to
14 power 14 data yep EV you even got
your spiffy you velcro on the back yeah
I gotta had that I wanted to actually
mod that into my laptop case here now
that would be cool okay it's going to
detect it because we had just put it in
mm-hmm and this is windows yes I do have
the scripts for linux so if you do have
an e video card which is the USB 720 you
can get it working in linux mmhmm yeah
you normally use this in lenox but this
the reason we decided to use it in
windows this time is because windows
offers the ability we can see how much
signal strength we have and you have
some monitoring tools here that will
show us exactly how much throughput
we're actually getting correct now if
you notice i connected into the Rev a
reversion a which is the the new hotness
for e video yes it's very much sweet so
I have two bars and I'm at 93 decibels
okay which is respectable and I'm not
using the factory antenna that is yours
in fact without antenna right now there
would be no signal and have no
connection mm-hmm and every time I do a
connection I get to give ID address i
get a nice little speed test out of it
yeah let's do a speed test and see how
you're actually doing and we're going to
come up to 55 40's which is not bad for
being inside of the house and we're a
lot a lot electronic equipment mostly
and then this pretend the hak5 studios
tend to be a dead zone for cellular
signal anyway so there was your yet you
met you peeked out at 602 kilobits down
there's no food and you're coming up on
about 165 kilobits up not not bad you're
not going to be doing a whole lot of
uploading I don't actually you sacrifice
your uploads because the verizon uses
two frequencies it uses 800 megahertz to
receive and it uses 1900 megahertz to
sin ok and I made them manufactured in
10 of the dual band and all that stuff I
would have a great upload speed but
because i was only strictly concerned
about my download speeds i did it 800
megahertz which is three a half inches
for the single element gotcha ok that
makes sense that me know 602 kilobits
per second 165 kilobits per second it's
not bad mm-hmm I was seeing the hell
that hak5 house earlier and the highest
I peak so far was 1272 kilobits per
second download 257 upload and that was
with your antenna correct just sitting
less than five feet away from the spot
on that occasion now just real quick
good can we put the factory antenna on
order then beacon you can totally use
that while using the external antenna it
cancels it out the only reason I took it
out Liz just for the fact that proving
that it's not the internal antenna
that's doing any work here is strictly
my antenna right now I mean how hard
would it be for us to put this in right
now and do a real quick speed test just
to see if just that one myself matter of
seconds ok so let's get let's go ahead
and try that real quick now I'm not
showing any reversion a network I'm not
showing anything but national access
currently with the single element or the
end of it removed with the factory yeah
this is the factory antenna let's see if
we're even going to get any cellular
service right now I say yes connecting
or connected national access which you
can already see now you can already see
now that there's almost no signal we had
two bars with your antenna right i'm
showing 113 111 decibels are 12 right
which is not good night at all and i
will do a speed test just to prove that
yes it does work see how we do
preparing download test and we're
probably going to sit here and waiting
because it's probably like a 26-6 right
now you really think that we're down
there like a 26-6 connection almost
guaranteed Wow yeah we're already seeing
this is already like a proof yeah we've
excited that we got a 06 12 20 28 Wow 36
40 50 now it will burst up to like 120
the most if we're looking yeah look at
that's that's that's a noticeable
difference like very noticeable by
five-fold really easily you're not even
consider broadband if you're pulling 127
kilobits no okay and then it's gonna
check on the upload yes totally going to
choke it's going to pull white two or
three ok so what we've proven that the
the antenna is actually doing something
so the science behind it obviously is
that that it has to be three and a half
inches long for the 800 megahertz go to
screw and then this is just kind of
acting as a ground in the support the
copper wire here right if you're
actually inside a vehicle it kind of
uses the vehicle as an Intendant also oh
well theoretically is supposed to have
been at not actually right now if I had
a magnetic base and stuck it on top the
car with a single pole element yes I
could use the surface of the car as a
ground plane gotcha and that would be
performance-wise would be better but
having its own ground plane built in one
hundred percent right now is there
anywhere people can go to find out more
about you or your kind of like lying low
out of it um you can go to DJ surreal
calm and do a lot of stuff on there
music wise get into contact with me
there hak5 IRC as always okay so thanks
a lot otherwise all the information will
be on the show notes and links to
relevant articles yep if you're looking
for the Serie or the scripts to make it
work in linux i got it i'll post a look
we'll put those in the show notes also
excellent thanks a lot well daily
variation joining us today is their
special guest Chris curling from Chris
Grayling calm you're going to show us
the nokia n 770 yes so what is the No
can 770 it's a internet tablet has based
on debian linux and so it ships with the
linux operating system you can get it
for about 150 bucks right now that's
really ashamed for something like this
inexpensive he's been expensive and from
what I understand this is like the
ultimate hacker tool kit along with some
USB goodies it is it is very useful if
you have a lot of little hacker tools on
here because it's linux so anything that
can be compiled for an arm so you say
arm we're talking about like a risc
processor yes that's the beautiful thing
about linux i guess is it will run on
anything so it actually comes with a
debian linux mhm but and it's 150 bucks
mm-hmm and what kind of hardware specs
loudly is a 250 megahertz ARM processor
it's got 64 megabytes of ddr ram and it
comes with a hundred twenty-eight megs
of internal flash memory and army would
expand that you can expand that there's
an MMSE mobile media card or something
that it's not the old nmc okay that's
lucky card sits but you know it's a
little itty bitty card so it comes with
linux and out of the box you can do some
pretty fun stuff with it but you're
saying that you don't actually get root
with it no the beginning don't get rude
with it that's got some pain yeah so
how'd you get root with it there's a
there's actually a guide well and we'll
have the whole thing in the show notes
here's what it here there's a Internet
Tablet Talk there's a humongous forum
posting in fact that it's replicated
elsewhere too there's probably a wiki
somewhere that has the same stuff in it
it tells you how to install all these
programs and flash me at your pc and you
basically kind of change the form around
a little bit and put a think it's called
game roo gain root game road and become
rude or the two things that you use to i
want to become root for every system
yeah that would be nice gain root off
come in i'm in and from there you what I
did there's a couple ways to do it you
can just give yourself root or you can
go a little further and make it boot
from the media cart that's right and it
makes it faster snappier and there are
other distribution for this as well no
well there's only two that'll work with
this there's the 2006 version of the
internet tablet OS and a
7 version which is very unstable they
call it on the wiki's and stuff the
hacker Edition because it's very I mean
it's usually it's great for it's great
for people like us to mess around but
you know if you're gonna give this to
your uncle that just check is you know
whatever with well we don't want to just
check around we want to do some more
photos we don't know one of the things
with it once we've got root on this once
we've got all hacked up what do we what
kind of software dude we're looking at
um I have aircrack-ng on it kismat we
cannot show you kismet because it'll
kill our in fact we have this is
actually pretty cool the reason that you
can even see the screen that we have
here is because it has a VNC server
built in and using our laptop here we
can actually show you exactly what it
looks like on the screen without having
to point a camera at the device itself
yeah that would be not too fun so there
you go it's all touch screen you know
you can play with it good load webpages
bring so this is long mobile Mozilla
right yeah this right here this is
called minimo and it's just a little
mini version of Firefox let's we're on
the heck five site here and you can
click you can click links and stuff like
that and it'll play media but I wouldn't
know about these days for media
capabilities well it does um I don't
remember all the formats off here am I
know it'll do WMV I think in a vis but I
run like VLC or I think you can install
VLC on it okay I don't have it on here
right now but there's a whole repository
posit ori and you can just select any
application you want so okay and we also
have some like web server stuff that we
could do with it if you really want to I
really wanted to run wordpress or a web
server off it I think they have XM was
it xma PP or whatever that's called
we're right where it comes with Apache
you could be my skin you can you can go
ahead and do it but it's not going to be
very uh you know say hey cool i did it
but it's not really useful okay you know
it might make it on slashdot like these
might make them on a slide without and
one thing will just explode and melt and
the crater in your house down so okay
well i guess before we get going I think
it's amazing that you can you know carry
around things like you know kismet and
aircrack and
have to you know boot up your laptop and
we've seen things like that on the show
before for example the nintendo DS that
we impact so that you can use like des
blue to actually you know fund other
access points around and one of the
coolest things that it was able to do
and so is the ipod that that Paul
cracked was run doom yes so here it is
and here's all the games that I did
install so chess all this all these
other things tux puck nice so here's do
them and it loads pretty quick it
probably will take a little bit longer
on the laptop display because it's a
pretty cool theme to the matrix they
have like it's combined like I had a
matrix theme and the L cars theme which
I can change too oh so you can actually
run this without cars you can okay save
your Star Trek geek like maybe it's your
advice this will look like you're just
like the captain I know it's the 24th
century but here's the duty roster I
mean I'd email it to you but you know
it's more fun to handle exactly okay too
there we go so here are and you can
either you can actually control it via
the VNC client if you want to which it's
not going to look that great because if
you've ever tried to play a video game
over VNC it's nicer probably what you
would expect yeah it looks it's but all
really beautiful i get to say it's very
normal out here you can use the it's
probably around a little bit slow on
here because i've got so many things
running but so it is kind of like the
nintendo DS where you have this yeah
this one hand you can clearly move
around and shoot you know with your with
your button so good stuff and i can move
forward i think we can find a little bad
guy up here somewhere yeah try not to
look back i don't they won't they won't
subject you guys this was a good person
to it yeah so let me exit out of this
well Chris sounds like a very fun device
isn't very inexpensive I mean if you're
looking for something fun to hack of the
holidays and joy it's very equipment and
aircrack just in your pocket mmm so
we'll have links in the show notes you
have the places where you can find all
the you know all your relationship to
get your route on on the n 770 Chris
thanks so much for coming down we're
back we'll find more of your work
more my work yeah my websites kind of in
hiatus but Chris growling calm doesn't
work I'm gonna have another one up
pretty shortly though with it actually
has all the stuff I do onyx I've been
really lacks about that stuff lately so
sounds good so Chris gerling calm for
him and of course you can find the rest
of the stuff that we've talked about
here on the show notes hak5 org ok so
I'm back in front of the camera again
and I've got a pretty sweet mod for you
now it's all about kind of like
voyeurism and playing with light and
physics I don't encourage voyeurism but
it can be used for that now what I've
got here is just a simple little digital
video camera from radioshack that right
here it was less than a hundred bucks
it's a USB it uh I'm either it's nothing
fancy but it's a purely digital video
camera and I've alright you can already
see here that I've ripped it apart and
this is why cameras can see infrared
light you probably have seen it before
when you take it like a remote control
or something that emits infrared light
and shoot it back at a video camera you
see a little white pulse now there's
also another kind of light called
near-infrared light that the human eye
can still perceive now it gets washed
out by the rest of white light but we
can still perceive it and this is and
the properties of this near-infrared
light are really cool and really unique
now what you have to understand about
light is light is nothing more than an
energy wave and what we perceive as
white light is all different colors of
light blended together moving together
and in like all their different
waveforms and this is why we see
rainbows rainbows are nothing more than
the light being bent out into its
individual colors red orange yellow
green blue indigo and violet an order of
intensity now you've heard of UV light
which is our black light switch over
here past violet outside of our
perception but it's very high-energy
light and then you get down to infrared
light which people use a lot for heat
like a lot of your heat cameras are
infrared and we can't see that either
and the difference between all these
different waves of light and what makes
them
more or less powerful is wavelength how
far it is from peek of wave to peek of
wave in for our ultra violet in violet
light high intensities light have a very
short wavelength they're very very
powerful and they actually get bent more
when they're refracted whereas on the
low end red and infrared and
near-infrared have very long wavelengths
so they don't get bent as much and they
tend to pass through things a lot better
that's why light coming through glass
creates heat the waves come in and the
energy gets transferred from light to
heat now this is where near infrared
helps us out a lot is everything that
filters out visible light will not
filter out infra red and near-infrared
light and the first thing you need to do
is get a camera like this one right here
I just rip this apart real quick and
this is just a regular USB webcam then
when I take the front of it off here you
look inside here that's the actual image
sensor on the inside there that little
shiny piece right there for anybody
that's never seen one before see there
you go that's the actual image sensor
but over here on what we would think is
the lens side you see a little red dot
that red dot is an IR filter it's an
infrared filter so that the lens doesn't
get overpowered by it so what we'd like
to do is rip that out there and we
replace it with a piece of develop- it
has to be a dark piece of develop- I'm
sorry I don't have a piece with me but
you would like to take a picture of
something black and then go have the
negative developed and cut that out you
would rip the infrared filter out and
replace it with that piece of film which
I've already done with this camera right
here and that that lens that new filter
that we put in there is now going to
block out every kind of visible light
and this is what happens when
near-infrared is allowed to pass through
let me Kemp let my camera boot up here
and now this you probably know what it
is but it's a tasty carbonated beverage
that the recipe has been kept secret for
over a century and it's good for
cleaning battery terminals and you all
know the color is this dark dark black
color you cannot see through this if we
get a close-up over here and you just
can't see my fingers through here right
now if we look at my little camera over
here as soon as it comes back over to go
no I don't want to power off a piece
technical difficulties I'm sorry I have
no display where's my display there it
is thank you now look if you see here
yoo-hoo you can see my fingers it's
clear you have clear carbonated beverage
which you would normally see now also
will take a lot of the green room over
here and you see why is my video keep
flaking out there it goes okay if you
look over here there's Darren and
there's will getting ready to do their
segments and picture-in-picture look
they have dark shirts on but that
near-infrared light is being reflected
back and is perceived as white check
that out and one more thing if I can
shoot past Chris here you dip out of the
way and i'll come over here if you look
way back here hooray for digital zoom
see that those are those are infrared
lights coming from a wee bar now what's
good about this is you can definitely
use it in certain types of
reconnaissance say say you were in the
situation that you needed to see you
thought somebody was in camouflage and
you needed to see him fabrics reflect
infrared near-infrared light differently
than vegetation does so they would stick
out like a sore thumb also lighter
weight fabrics especially dark ones like
dark black shirts at a real
you can actually see through them
because this long wavelength doesn't get
filtered out very easily and so it'll
pass straight through so something you
see is opaque or you trying to not
transparent will become translucent
through an IR filter like this it's
really quick it's really easy it
completely depends it's completely
dependent upon your camera the what made
this really popular was the Sony night
shot the Sony night shot had a night
mode in it that you can force on during
the daylight and you got this exact same
effect but this way you can do with any
kind of camera by simply just getting
down to the image sensor and the
infrared filter taking it out and
replacing it with this piece of
developed negative so that's all there
really is to it questions comments email
me I'll I'll make sure our right show
notes about it and it'll be really well
documented for you and I'll also have
links for any kind of pertinent
information thanks a lot hey once again
Darren here for a fun little hack and
I've got to say sorry I don't have
anything neat that can see through stuff
but we're going to be doing something
spiffing anyway imagine this scene your
home for the holidays the wreath looks
great smells good in the kitchen and you
know on Uncle the other relatives and
whatnot say hey I'm having this
interesting problem with my computer
every time I uh-huh right and then you
get sucked into it than four hours later
you're digging through the windows
registry because somebody lost their cat
wallpaper yeah we've all been there and
it sucks so let's enjoy the holidays
this year and there's really only one
thing you need to do and that is set up
a one-click VNC remote assistance for
your family I don't know if you've ever
tried to use the remote assistance
that's built into Windows XP it looks
like this and it is just about the most
horrible remote assistance thing ever
built on the planet and we based on
Terminal Services which is tried and
true it's proven it's great but the
implementation in Windows XP is
absolutely horrible okay because you
have to go through this convoluted setup
where you invite someone and then you
have to either email them a setup file
or you have to get on messenger and
there's all these crazy or you just save
the Potters your desktop and find
someone to get to them
someone threw that is a pain so what
I've kind of created is I found this
really spiffy one-click VNC utility
that'll allow you to send out just a
real quick installer package to whoever
it may be they double click on it they
open it from your web server and they're
good to go on your server so let's just
go ahead and dive right into it and see
what's involved in setting up all right
first thing we're going to need and this
is the first thing in a lot of my
projects here is a dime DNS set up so if
you don't have one of these already you
might want to hit up the show notes for
more information on setting up this but
basically dime dns is a solution that
allow you to get a dns name pointed to
your IP address at home okay so if you
have like a dynamic IP address like we
do here with our cable modem it always
be going to the right place so that's
first next thing we need to do is go
into our firewall and we're going to
have to portforward tcp port 5500 that's
to allow VNC listen client to accept the
the VNC one-click server we're going to
set up and easily in smooth wall just
set up your IP address here 5500 tcp
it'll show up here on the list all fun
and dandy once that's done we're going
to need a copy of bodies text one-click
VNC solution now this is something that
I found a couple of years ago when I was
looking for a better solution than this
window is help and support remote
assistance crap and I stumbled across
this in a forum post and it's really
like one of those fun little gems of the
internet that is once again gone you
know just like when we talked about on I
think the first episode of hak5 the help
or was it light Exe that allowed you to
turn on and off your lights and then as
soon as the episode broadcast it's
nowhere to be found this is one of those
as well what happens is this this
awesome code monkey lock ourselves right
a network administrator has come up with
this 50 little implementation of the
tight VNC I'm sorry the ultra VNC one
click and one click VNC server and he
posted on his website VNC scan calm and
now when you go there oh look at this
pricing you know a thousand dollars for
a site license well you know what
thankfully I kept a copy and it's
available at hak5
work in the show notes so we're going to
go through the setup because it makes
everything super happy basically the
one-click VNC setup is just to
executables we've got a remote
assistance executable here we've got the
settings ini file we open up the
settings on I file is just one line it's
your IP address in this case it's hak5
no IP org or your home server I'm DNS
org or whatever your you know IP address
to your home network maybe DNS
preferably so all we have to do is send
those two files to the parental units
they double click and we're on their
computer as long as we have the port
forward going and as long as we have a
VNC listen server so I go ahead and use
the tight VNC implementation I find it
pretty good it's just VNC viewer in
listen mode okay and you just open that
it sits here in the task tray and as
soon as someone who connects it just
pops up on your screen and you can move
the mouse and get all the they're happy
Lowell caps back on their desktop so
anyway one of the interesting problems
that we have once we have this solution
though is now we need to get you both
files and you need it doesn't sound like
a hard problem for us right I'm just
going to zip these both up I'm going to
send you a zip or aurora an Ace or
whatever we use these days and you're
just going to extract them and double
click on the remote assistance and
that's where we lose them because I
don't know why it's so difficult unzip
stuff but we're talking about el users
here so let's go ahead and create a
installation package now there's a
couple of different ways to do this and
the way that I find most convenient is
to use this program called packet
builder ok packet builder is just one of
many windows installation package
creators it just you know it doesn't
create I don't know exactly but creates
msi files like we may be used to with
group policies and stuff but basically
it'll create one executable that will
extract your stuff that will install a
program files icon create a desktop icon
if we want that will run the program
after setup and it's really easy to use
so we just start a packet builder and
I'm in the project file right now and we
can go into about your project and I
call it remote assistance here and we
click on manage files to compress we
just
drag over our files into here as I've
already done so those are the files that
are going to be in the package and then
we can set up the destination folder I
just did an absolute link you might want
to use some some environment variables
here but I just set it to install to see
backslash one-click VNC we can set up
the interface we can get all spiffy on
the welcome screen here and we can type
some cool stuff like hey it's darren
you're you know loving you know son
sibling cousin whatever here to help you
with the computer and we can do all
sorts of fun stuff in here but basically
just get the package files in there go
to functionality and you know here we
can like add registry entries and all
sorts of fun stuff if you know talking
about but what we really want to focus
on is the manage custom actions okay so
once we've told it here's the files that
I want to be in my package we just need
to say manage these custom actions after
file extraction is what we want to do
we're going to add a sequence as you see
we have a lot of different things to
choose from we can ask users things we
create shortcuts when you delete folders
we delete we can create an uninstaller
do registry fun stuff we want to do
execute a program file okay we've
already set that up here so I'll take a
look is going to open up in a normal
window and it's just going to run c
backslash one-click VNC backslash remote
assistance Exe so as soon as the
installation package is done it'll go
ahead and open up that remote assistance
so you don't have to say okay just
download this file and run it and then
go to program files and then you lose on
my end so so it'll just go ahead and run
that so we'll just come down here to
build and set the package file name will
say compile and it creates this happy
little help me executable that I have
here on my desktop so all I have to do
now is put that on Darren kitchenette /
help me I XE I get the column like oh
really oh that's terrible i would hate
for you to lose your you know tuna
noodle casserole recipe well let's let's
take a look Darren kitchenette / help me
exe click run digital signature so I
click run again and then we're prompted
with this one click V&amp;amp;C we say click
Next
oh I've already installed so yes tell
okay and another instance is already
ringing okay because I'm already running
this anyway what happens is you double
click it it installs to the directory of
your choosing and then pops this up and
this is the boztek one click VNC
solution and it's pretty silly is at
this point everything's already done
okay it's already connected to your
whatever you set up in your settings
Diane I file to connect to and you know
you may have to tell them to click on
block on if they have the windows
firewall but it's going to prompt them
after you've already connected so you
can at that point just take control of
your mouse and get everything back in
order and hopefully you'll be able to
enjoy the holidays and you know all the
fun food and presents and stuff like
that and not have to be digging through
the registry for a couple hours so and
we hope you guys enjoy that i know that
i glossed over a whole lot of that but
there are there's a walkthrough in the
show notes at hak5 org earlier in the
show we took a look at the design of
server on just our little hack house
network here with just a few machines
but now we're going to take a look at
zenos server being used on a production
environment with much more fun stuff in
the network back in Simon thanks so much
again so what are we looking at here
zenoss well basically this is our you
know internal network that you know we
use it and we set it up and so on and so
forth so this is how it looks when you
have sounds been when zenoss has been
running for a couple of days or months
or weeks or whatnot so you get a lot of
information about this so you know this
is available under the Perth tab and
this is available you know this is
pretty much starts automatically
monitoring all kinds of information so
you get cpu idle information and you get
information about you know how is my
swap space doing you get information
about available memory you get
information about all kinds of things
basically great so that's you know it
could be very useful to see potentially
machines that need upgrades yeah this
ocean has been pegging out it's running
out of disk space it's time to give it
to more room absolutely a disk space or
you know you notice that more and more
users are using
XYZ or you know maybe your machine in
the downstairs and you need to have more
CPU or something like that so it's kind
of interesting and watch this overtime
you're also showing me a feature where
we can take a look at servers across the
world that we have yeah and actually
this is what basically something
available that we've just released in
2.1 and this is essentially a mash-up
with Google Maps and what this will show
you is if you have servers in different
locations and you you know you basically
set up these locations and there's
actual network connections between these
servers then these will be visualized
and all put on to this google map so you
can actually you know zoom in on an area
and you can and you know see what
exactly is going on in the environment
these are the two locations that happen
to be over oh I headquarters and you can
then find out what's going on so these
don't necessarily have to be on the same
land area these connected through VPN
tunnels well that's working in this case
these are set up in our case these are
set up through VPN tunnels but
essentially what happens is there's
routing between these two devices so
like device a can talk to devise be
device a is in Chicago device B is in
Houston okay so that's why it's a
noticeable they look for me where I have
you know I've got the lamb here at the
hack house but I also have you know our
our web servers through dreamhost and
other IRC servers and she'll servers and
other such servers that are you know
part of the hak5 network that aren't
necessarily on the same land through VPN
or anything like that is there a way for
me to manage those as well yeah so if
you have set up with openvpn let's say
you can log into these machines then
xenos will also present them this way
and basically you will be able to
monitor them and so on so forth so yes
that's not so there are ways even if
it's not as enemy even if it's not SNMP
you can go and utilize SSH for example
you know probably might not show up
because there's no routing but you could
use ssh to log into said machine and
then retrieve information and get it
back to zina so yeah totally cool
another thing that you want it i wanted
to show here is you know the
capabilities
you know is that us because as we talked
about it has a view and has all the the
routing information of your devices
because it discovers is automatically so
you can actually get a view of your
network so this looks very chaotic
because of the resolution but you can
actually get you know filter out devices
so you could you know if you just wanted
to see a certain set of devices you
could select Windows machines for
example and then get a view of only your
Windows machines and you can see the
halo around each machine will actually
show you how the state of the machine is
how I say so and you can actually go and
you can also walk the network so for
example if you wanted to find out you
know which gateway or which router is
actually connected to which part of of
your network you can simply do that by
double clicking and then it will show
you the clouds and its various networks
that exist within it's a very visual
network map and it looks very powerful
with the way that you can filter yeah
and then one thing that we also wanted
to talk about is actually the management
capabilities that Dennis has as well so
for example once you have a variety of
machines set up in your environment you
can actually issue commands against all
of them and so these commands all fully
configurable right this can be done
through the web interface as well and if
I wanted to I could you know do lumen
SNMP walk or a trice route it's just a
simple ping against the devices that
I've selected this can also be combined
with Windows devices so if you know
building in my and all this kind of
stuff you could like so W am I being
kind of like a throw like a very beefed
up batch scripting system for Windows
exact computers on networks I could use
to I don't know if say go ahead and you
know empty the recycling bin on all my
machines were back them up to this
certain driver you know the exact one
different committees exactly exactly and
this would be allowed this would allow
you to do so who's this for and what
makes it so awesome well I mean you know
a poise is so awesome for for our
viewers well this is really cool because
software like this has been you know in
the past years cost you know millions of
dollars literally and so we for the
first time make this available to
anybody to
use for free if they wanted to so it's
an extremely powerful system that even
like a small person you know like a
regular person you know if you have a
server in the basement and you want to
watch CPU and hard drive space on that
server and get an alarm when something
happens on it totally this is you know
we can set up filters and rules that
would send us emails exactly here your
network attached storage one of the raid
drives went down and get me an email
exactly what's filling up you know you
should do something about that or you
could watch the throughput on your
network you know like your cable modem
or something like that and detect you
know behaviors or stuff like that
obviously it's also interesting to
anybody that will get wants to be in to
you know go into IT management or I
becomes an IT professional right I'm
sure a lot of our audience are either
Network professionals I could use this
to you know with their bosses or
up-and-coming IT professionals they
could you know play around with this on
their home network and then make
themselves a lot more marketable when
they you know enter in the job market
and say hey you know not just your
run-of-the-mill windows admit I can I
can show you at news eNOS to manage the
whole thing exactly that's the idea so
it's you know it's an extremely powerful
system if you know you know the system
and and and how it works and you can set
it out you you will be very values open
source so you can't cover hooks and
really cool things together I guess okay
so work in our audience go to get more
information on it to get their hands on
it play with it well they can go to
community Don Santos calm or just as an
asst comm there's information we have
very active forums extremely active as a
matter of fact that you can download and
read documentation and it's very easy to
get started you know you can just get
the grab that the mr player and be going
in about half an hour and play with it
and explore it wow this stuff has really
come a long way since the last time I
looked at this sort of stuff years and
years ago I guess a this really makes it
very easy to just you know get right in
and they're playing with thanks so much
for coming to have no problem and
showing this to us and we'll be looking
into it more in the future I guess cool
thanks so much that that just about
wraps up this episode of pack 5 thanks
for making it this far we've had a lot
of fun I think we've all learned
something especially about Wes here and
I think before we get going we need to
avoid good white house cleaning and one
of the things that we need to talk about
is uh is little geeks it's a non-profit
charity put on by a good friend andy
walker you may know of him from the
podcast lab rats thank you and it's a
great charity that basically gets
internet enabled computers to kids in
need so no Reverend children exactly
they're looking for some donations to
make this year a great year for all the
little ones and this being the time
forgiving and you guys all being geeks
probably realize that it's pretty good
idea it kind of hits home you know we
started young we really got into it so
we'd like to see that propagated the new
younger generations they need to get
into and they need to know what's going
on and have a bunch of little heckling
joining around it'll be great o qu
through the h word thanks oh I did yeah
for megahertz what are you for megahertz
I start on 286 okay that's anyway so up
next now you'll notice that we didn't
talk about the hak5 land earlier in the
episode and that is because the hak5
land is going to be going on at ECL the
East Coast land check it out at East
Coast land calm it is one of the bigger
lands on the East Coast hence the name I
imagine that and as a matter of fact
we'll be there will be live streaming
and it will be sponsored by evil lands
yes so calm down to Pembroke in Virginia
Beach get your Fraggle on go to East
Coast land calm for the details and come
down with your PC will be there or in
your rig getting the bring your gay game
you know just just ready to have a good
time when we'll be doing a hack 5 live
on December 15th from the event so you
know tune into that because gonna be a
lot of fun mm-hmm all right and as
always dreamhost dreamhost our wonderful
early webhost you still have websites
hosted by dreamhost hak5 live is hosted
by dreamhost in fact i just upgraded the
WordPress over there and it was so easy
i just logged in on the one click
installs the one not only one click
installs but one click upgrades so you
don't have to go through the trouble of
actually downloading packages uploading
stuff running scripts crossing your
fingers yep didn't databases you can
always find him at dream
is calm and use the coupon code hak5
that's hak5 for twenty five dollars off
your purchase and that contributes to
the show helps us bring the technical us
to you which we hope that you all have a
very safe and happy techno lyst filled
holiday yes as always so with all that
said I think we're pretty much done oh
one more thing if you're home with it
yeah yeah if you come to the east Kyle
and yes silly me um be sure to stay hey
hey hey you're that guy hey you're that
guy Wes hey and you know what we will
totally bless you with with some schwag
the schwag and Dragons you've always
wanted when we said but we're going to
send up goody bags for the people that
win trivia and stuff and yet that's
here's a sampling of the goodie bag the
button the shot glass double shot glass
trust your technol ascend a little bit
of heck bottle of here you can't have
this is ours no that's our cock you can
I throw the car with all of that said
huh I'm Wes I'm Darren and we're both
reminding you to trust your techno lust
you see me i know there's snags o'clock
there's all about the cock
hound include me or not H yes alive to
disk system will allow us to go for
hours and hours without having to worry
about switching tape bad idea we're good
two terabytes that we filled up a new
episode all that and a whole lot more
this time I'm hack Wi-Fi point point I
forgot what I know yeah and in the
deepest circle of hell on top of that
I've already been there it was called
nt4 upset pretty much wraps up this
episode of act 5 we I really think it
was like informative I thought it was a
really good episode and it was really
great living be enthusiastic cuz you're
like f this i'm out yeah sure haha
welcome to hack 5 on this very special
episode we're joining our guest West
