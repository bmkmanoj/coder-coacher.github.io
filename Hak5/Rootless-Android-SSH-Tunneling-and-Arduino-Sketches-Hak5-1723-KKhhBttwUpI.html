by domain.com hello welcome back by my
name is Gerren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
your weekly dose technically one losses
please no wrong and treats not gonna
wrong there's still texting on the right
there wait all right
I did not you're right we're sharing a
set it's like you know it's like we're
dorm mates or something so I was
thinking because we have all this room
back here and we have our new set
somewhat like halfway built we should
hang a couple of cool skateboards
well it's speaking of that we've got a
really cool skateboard on the way give
it away but there's cool stuff in the
works on that front we need to go just
sticker the crap we could have people
send in stickers oh that's a great idea
that will feature your stickers or
something I don't know that's a cute
idea you know it'll be like when we
invited everybody to send us their you
waste and then we ended up with dot
matrix printers every now and then cool
stuff though thank you for the Palm
Pilots those were rad so I have been
crazy busy like getting tech thing I'll
start it up and everything but I've also
been working with Arduino some more for
my segments on hack 5 to read lots and
lots of fun what have you been up to I
have been working on pineapple goodness
and also some drone stuff ooh I should
probably show you a photo let's see I
have a way to do that a photo this isn't
a photo okay so it's a this is a tiny
tiny video because it was made for
Instagram but this is me flowing under a
bridge up in Amador City I'm gonna show
you guys the quadcopter right oh I've
yeah I've been having a lot of fun with
that quadcopter there's some I'm
bringing fun toys syrup for hack across
Europe so hack across Europe calm get
signed up let us know let go and visit
backer spaces and they will flag
quadcopters through your space and/or
country let's see how many air spaces we
can violate through multiple countries
um so yeah there was that going on and
then I guess the other big thing was our
friend Jason he hasn't been on the show
in a while but you remember this guy he
just helped me
put a thing in a thing and yes that's
that's Josette that's Jason on Josette
in the van why because she was that
needed a new home and now she's out this
door this is a door right here there's
Josette it's barely see her but anyway
it has a new home so that that's kind of
what's going on with me that's awesome I
will be you know what we got some
fantastic feedback on that CH routing
with crouton on your handbook setting up
Linux I will say my hopes and dreams and
desires deep within me are to adventure
around the world with one tiny two pound
laptop that is that HP Chromebook 11
because it's so lightweight and powers
off the micro USB which means I can run
off the same battery packs
that's recharging my quad copters and
recharging my pineapple and phone and
everything else and then I was crushed
why should I tell you over the weekend
when it was great getting beautiful
videography up in dry town Amador City
and Sutter Creek fun gold country up in
California and it turns out there is no
good way to edit on Chrome there's
there's basically we video I want to say
thank you can edit through the YouTube
interface but the problem with all of
these editors is you have to upload your
footage first so I'm like great I got
like five gigs a GoPro footage of which
I'm going to use like the cool
ten-second clip of me like you know
flying through orange groves or whatever
it is so I try to open shot and I'm sure
open shot is a fantastic open source
nonlinear editor for Linux however I
think I hit the wall when it comes to
Linux on an ARM processor so I will say
that that there's there's no chance to
survive if you want to edit video on a
Chromebook
no rent per thing Lenovo's man ripped
it's a pretty heavy laptop yeah I want
to take that with me anywhere
I don't know I don't know what the
answer is you could try something like
this the answer couldn't even the the
answer could be you know what we were
talking about this on D TNS the other
day there is finally a half-decent video
editor for Android it's called kinematic
a ine master
however it does require a $5 month
subscription to render out in HD without
their little bug in the corner which is
really annoying I think it's also just
$40 a year if you're really hardcore
user I've played with it and I like it
so maybe I'll do some more with that but
it's very particular about the video
formats that it supports I think so you
may it may just be more hassle than it's
worth
ah adobe just make premiere for linux
anyway that would save the long times i
should point this out though based on
all of that awesome feedback that we got
on the linux on your Chromebook i wanted
to point out everybody sent me this kali
linux you you love Kelly Lewis and she
loves Kali Linux and it gets really
recursive and now you can put it on your
Chromebook and everybody sent me over to
this which is installing Kali Linux on
your Chromebook with crouton it's
basically the same steps that we went
through except what you want to do is
use tack our Kali tack T KDE tack and
Kali and that right there will get you
going
that's calm as opposed to just
installing the boom - you can get your
Kalyan with KDE cuz it's cool I still
prefer xfce but you know whatever it's
just one day manager oh what a lemon
tree OS sorry yes to everybody out there
that's been telling us yes okay I'm firm
believer now in the elementary OS I've
heard and it sounds awesome
I'm striking I might need to turn she's
right I bit the bullet and I I got
elementary OS is my base he asked me
what I did over the weekend sorry I'm
still going and then popped I hate to
say this but because Adobe doesn't just
sell premier yeah for it were the whole
Creative Suite like I live in Premiere
and illustrator and Photoshop
I'm sorry like I know GIMP you're great
and and you know Inkscape your okay an
open shot
good luck I can't help breaking this I'm
like I'm an Adobe guy I can't help it
right and so since I've already bitten
the bullet what it's like okay fine I'm
gonna buy proprietary software because
it just works well then I'm gonna have
to run into proprietary OS either
Windows or Linux and when it comes to
virtualization when is it just easier so
I'm just like whatever at least you know
if I virtualized windows at least if I
virtualized Windows I can just you know
have a fresh copy of it right because
then it can snapshot and keep reloading
there who are you what did you do with
you what we're gonna run that
virtualized on top of elementary OS and
I'm like haha see least on the
underlying it's said that sub has been
like me for the longest time about this
and I'm telling I'm like dude you can't
edit an open shot or at least not in the
way that I need to if you saw that that
new Wi-Fi pineapple video explaining PI
ap you'll understand David yes you know
I need a master effect it's pretty
awesome way to go on that by the way
thank you everything I did this weekend
that was awesome was I went to the
California Academy of Sciences you
finally met place is so cool
I went during the day so I didn't do the
whole nightlife thing but it was awesome
if you're ever in the San Francisco Bay
Area people are always asking if we got
to hit up a lot when like people come
here on vacation they're like let's hang
out we should probably met mention that
we're actually not in San Francisco
we're just across the bay but you know
and if you're looking for some fun cool
geeky thing to do and you happen to be
here on a Thursday night every Thursday
night the California Academy of Sciences
does like a nightlife thing it's 21 and
up and they've got DJs and a different
theme every week and there's a bunch of
bars that pop up and you get to science
while you drink cocktails and nap and go
with other cool nerds can you go the
roof during the night yes you can
awesome and then you can see the moon
they've got the telescopes out and
everything really oh I like them because
it's made of cheese well duh it's it
actually has a rabbit on it but you know
you have to watch the documentary to
actually know about that part
moving on I don't think everybody came
here
to actually watch us talk about what we
did over the weekends why don't we get
into it huh yes let's get into it
in a bit I am gonna be talking about SSH
tunnels for your Android because I'm
going across borders and that means I
get really paranoid every year when I go
through this so we'll be locking down
our smartphones cuz last year we talked
about all the ways to lock down your
laptop so I'll be focusing on that front
suite I'm going to be doing some an
Arduino stuff so I almost an Android so
why don't we do that
Android we know interesting yeah let's
get into it you stay here because this
is kind of cool and I want to show you
how this works
so you remember last time that I was on
here with my Arduino and my little
breadboard and all I had to do was I
pressed a button and it turned on and
then when I release the button it just
turned off get some blood it's just it's
simple logic see there's not much to
it's it's C so it's very easy to write
but it's kind of boring and why would
you want to keep your finger there on
the button for a long time to keep a
light on right okay so so thank you so
leveled up yeah so I leveled up I built
on top of that I included another
resistor thank you everybody for you
know telling me to add all the resistors
all the time
so I add another resistor and I included
the same LED but this time I made it so
I actually wrote two scripts so I'm good
so surely show us the sketches okay walk
us through the code on my computer
here's the first one so this is just to
push the button so it turns on and then
when you push the button again it just
turns off so I got the LED it's on to a
pin 9 the button is pin 7 and then I'll
show you those on the board
the so that's just setting it up just
yeah there's all there's all of our
variables
yeah this is all setup and then I have
my comments over there I can also upload
this if anybody wants me to I guess
github or somewhere and then down here
starting right here I have the set up so
I have the LED is going to be the output
the button is going to be the input
which means that the button is going to
trigger the LED right something I love
that about how Android sketches they
make it so easy with those phones yeah
where they can just like set a mode as
an inner and out exactly and then down
here we actually do the loop so first
off we want to read the button value and
we want to store it to whatever it is so
if it's high that means on and if it's
low that means that it's off so whenever
you
actually look at the button whenever it
triggers the actual code it's gonna see
okay is it currently on or is it
currently off and then it'll do the
action based on that so you just got an
if you've just got a loop with an if
statement so if the value is high and
the old value is low then we're gonna do
state equals one minus state so this
means that it's going to change the
state of the button from on to off or
off to on vice versa so we go back to
that did you create a function for state
is that what you did yeah exactly
state equals state for 30 and then what
do we do and then the delay is 30 so
that means that it's going to wait 30
seconds between the time you turned it
took your butt or took your finger off
of it so that it understands that you
actually took your finger off it off of
it as opposed to just reading it like
halfway through your button press okay
because if you don't include a delay
what the Arduino will do it'll look at
that button press and it'll read it the
entire time you're pressing it down so
it'll try to trigger that oh so this
this means that it'll stay on for 30
seconds it'll stay on it'll read it
it'll read the button press and then a
wait 30 milliseconds until it reads in
another breath milliseconds there we go
yeah 30 seconds this is gonna be a
really slow no and then down here we
just store the old value of the button
and then we have another if-else
statement down here so if the state
equals one right otherwise do the
inverse yes so we have high and then
else it'll be low so that means it's off
so when I actually compile this and put
it on my breadboard and hopefully you
can see this in the big screen right
here I press the button once hold this
up for you thank you don't destroy my
wires so I press it once and the LED
comes on press it again the LED goes off
and I press it slowly down and it still
stays on instead of triggering it the
entire time I'm pressing it down because
it's waiting that 30 milliseconds press
it again and I do it slowly this still
goes off cuz it's waiting 30
milliseconds you weren't just satisfied
with it just going on oh I wasn't I was
like okay that's cool but I know LEDs
can do more than that so you know I can
make it flash a billion times or I can
make it fade so let's make it fade let's
make it fade that sounds great so this
is the other code for this one I called
it push button food because
that's duh this is just where I'm
setting it up I have the same led equals
9 button equals pin 7 the same value
equals 0 and the old value equals 0 up
here I have state equals 0 and this one
so brightness so brightness on an LED
can be from 0 all the way up to 255 255
is going to be the value of your LED it
can be the highest yes so we do the same
thing on the Wi-Fi pineapple when it
comes to GPIO which is general purpose
input and output and in that case 0 is
low and 255 is high and we use it as
like an on/off you know we can trigger
two different things and we can we don't
actually have the ability to say on the
mark 5 to kind of like vary the
intensity of the leds leds could only be
either 255 or zero but it's rad that
you're actually able to do that and
actually vary the voltage for it and say
128 would be halfway in between off
fully on and say it's winning what I
don't know 3 volts you're giving it one
and a half right so if I if I just press
it once it's just gonna trigger it at
brightness of 128 so it's just gonna be
in the middle regular brightness of an
LED if I hold it down the point of this
code is to make it fade from 0 all the
way up to 255 and then wait a few
milliseconds and then restart that loop
again and go all the way up go back down
to zero all the way up again so it
should do that as long as I'm holding
down on the button now I do the set up
right here
so usually the output button input
scroll down a little bit and then we
have our first loop so this one looks a
little bit more complicated but most of
it is just
oops most of it's just comments let me
get back down there okay so first we
have our digital read button so this
means that it's just going to read the
button value whatever it's going to be
yep and if the value is high if the
value is higher Lauren and the old one
is off then we do the same
multiplication so state equals 1 minus
state which changes the button from on
to off or vice versa this new start time
yeah start time equals milliseconds what
is that so this is passed since the
board has reset the code okay so it's
gonna restart the entire code and the
delay is going to be 30 milliseconds in
between each time it does that loop down
here we say if
the value is high and the old value is
high then we're going to do state equals
one and also the milliseconds minus the
start time if it's greater than 500 so
more than 500 milliseconds then you want
to increase the brightness by one plus
means plus one and then there's gonna be
a delay of 10 milliseconds in between
each increment of 0 to 255 so it doesn't
get bright so it's gonna loop through
that and it's gonna be like incurred so
you're gonna go from brightness zero to
brightness 1 yes and then after 10
milliseconds 2 to 3 all the way up to 5
and then of course if the brightness
hits 255 it's greater than 255 max
brightness then it goes back down and
you're not gonna like overwriting these
hold the brightness to go to 256
wouldn't do anything and won't do
anything cuz the LED can't so once it
goes higher than that then you're like
okay and did you just say when it gets
to 255 just go back to 0 yes okay cuz I
was about to say you know you could just
loop through again just like you had
done before but instead of brightness
Plus yeah I could do brightness - I
think it's minus 1 no it would just be
minus - okay yeah I can do that or you
could do brightness all the way up and
they go all the way down it would fade
back and forth really cool I want to see
you do it because this is one LED I want
to see you do a Cylon yeah that's what I
want to do yes I was like oh so then at
the very end the last part of my clip
code says if the state equals on then
you want to turn the LED on at its
current brightness so if this is just
pressing it and then else if the LED
equals zero then you just turn it off
right so now let me verify this code and
this will take a little bit so let's
just fast forward this and then we want
to hit upload and we'll upload the code
over to the Arduino Uno you know when
you upload it compiles as well does it
yeah yeah I guess ok so now I've gotten
my LED mm-hmm even hold ya shake hold
that for you you got it okay so
hopefully you can see it that's just
present
and that's just pressing again and it
turns off now if I hold it it'll go from
zero to totally see it doing that it'll
wait a few milliseconds start over and
it increments by 10 milliseconds in
between each value pretty cool right it
is cool hey Paul can you can you happen
to get that in this camera right here
yeah we can get a little close-up
yeah and that great can you see ya
holdin it down there it goes there we go
okay ha we can see it now you see that
that cool and I'll get a close-up
picture so you can see exactly where I
put my resistors and where I put all my
different wires so that they're in the
correct pins and I have the resistor
going from ground over to the actual LED
I also wanted to mention I learned
something new about LEDs on the ground
side if you already have it plugged into
your breadboard there's a flat end to it
on the bottom part of your LED there's a
flat edge right here and that means that
it's ground on the other side it's
circular as usual but the site is flat
in that cool I didn't know that yeah I
didn't know that either but you know how
are you unplug your LED you can just
touch the side of it and see if one of
the sides is flat you know the way that
I've always done it to know the
difference between the anode and the
cathode is the length of the wires
coming off of it oh yeah but then again
once you have your recycling from a
different project right yeah then
soldered it from some other board and so
that way you can just it's not gonna be
on surface mount one that's still pretty
low I want to build a Cylon and this is
where we all die yes
what that's skinjobs take us over but I
thought it was pretty cool good way to
get started on Arduino nice little like
halfway point sure starting to build
ideas on top of the different components
I love it cool well with that we're
gonna take a quick break and when we get
back we're gonna get our SSH tunnel in
right into your heart commander
it doesn't matter if you're an anode or
a cathode when that killer idea hits
you're gonna need to snag it yourself a
domain name and web hosting fast you're
like Shh reel it in and with domain.com
they've got a quick tool mean discovery
system and an easy checkout process and
what that means is your website will be
up and running in like no time they've
got like a time warp system where the
domain is and they're happy immediately
something like that and I told you guys
how much I love domain comm I mean
mainly because they're affordable
reliable and easy to use but mostly and
you'll know if you tweet them at
domain.com you'll find out it's really
just a fun place to do business the guys
are awesome and they are huge fans of
hook hak5 and they want to hook you up
they're huge fans of hook 5 and they
want to hack you up either way you do it
they've got a coupon code called hak5
that you can use at checkout to get
yourself an extra 15% off so when you
think domain names think domain.com
it is time for the trivia question of
the week last week's trivia question was
and this is probably pretty easy for
some of you guys is the wavelength of
infrared light too long or too short to
be seen by humans and the answer is too
long
this week's question it is what science
fiction writer wrote the Three Laws of
Robotics you can answer that at hak5 org
slash trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack five beauties SSH tunneling
your traffic we have talked about it
numerous times in the past it is a very
convenient way to make your internet
traffic go through an SSH pipe over to
your other end where you've got like a
server say in a cloud on a virtual
private server or even just at your home
and what that does is it encapsulates
very similar to a VPN all of your
traffic through what we call socks proxy
and it makes it so that it if anybody's
sniffing your traffic is kind of just
garbage to them it encrypts it with all
the good stuff we love it we've used it
on our laptops whether it's using Linux
and drop bear and open SSH or even
windows with plink and putty but what
about Android and we got just that
question on Twitter from wing who asked
got any recommendations for SSH
tunneling apps for Android and yes I do
in fact I have two awesome ways to do
this today we're going to go through the
first way on our brand new set here
where I can show you cool Android e
stuff talking about ways to do just
browsing through SSH proxies without
root and then we're going to build on
top of that next week and do it with
root for everything on our phone this is
something that's also like something I'm
really concerned with considering I'm
about to be traveling internationally
and I always get super paranoid when it
comes to that kind of stuff so it's time
to encrypt all the things and let's
start with the simplest way first this
way when we do it the hard way they like
build character so first off we're going
to need two apps you can just get these
from the Play Store first is connect bot
it is kind of like an old standby
I prefer juice SSH but that's that's
just me but connect bot a lot of people
swear by this it is essentially a
terminal that does SSH and it's rad
right and then the other thing we're
going to need is Firefox which I should
not have to explain because it's fire
Vox so we're going to go ahead here and
pop open our fresh install here of
Connect bot and we can just quickly
connect to a machine by doing and in
this case I'm using a really bad example
of logging in as root don't do that
we've talked about that in the past but
considering for this example I was not
going through the trouble of setting up
any users we're gonna go ahead and just
do it this way so I have a VPS setup at
one six two little throwaway server 220
there we go
and so what you'll do is enter in your
username at your host so that host
happens to be an ssh server running on
your home machine this will be your
public IP assuming that you've port
forwarded port 22 otherwise you know
whatever server you have in the cloud I
mean shells are cheap so you should
definitely have one I'm gonna go ahead
and hit done and we will connect to that
the font is extremely small we're
presented with our key fingerprint just
like we would normally on Linux and it
matches what I'm expecting so I'm going
to go ahead and say yes and at this
point I'm going to go ahead and enter in
a terrible password and hit done and I'm
there we go I'm all set now what I'll
want to do in this case is actually
increase this font size by pulling down
the keyboard and hitting the Menu key
and saying force size add 80 by 25
that's a great size I'm going to go
ahead and resize that and now if I
rotate this it doesn't want to rotate
okay it looks a lot better so here we
are we're ssh into our server I can LS I
can see all the little files and all the
goodies that I have going on here what I
want to do at this point is set up a
port forward so quite simply we lower
our keyboard hit the little three dots
in the bottom right the little Menu key
or if you have a hardware menu key and
go into port forwards okay so we're not
going to see any port forward so again
we'll hit that Menu key and we'll add
port forward we can call this whatever
sure I'll call it Sox because we're
creating a socks proxy under your type
you'll want not local but you'll want
dynamic socks so this is very similar to
using SSH with attack capital D option
and then we'll need a source port this
port just has to be over 1024 8080 is a
very common one to be used I'm going to
use a source port of one three three
seven because I'm feeling kind of leet
today and I'm gonna create my port
forward and there we go that's it if you
tap it it will cross it out saying no
we're not using that if we untap it
there we go our port forward is
happening and everything is good to go
my session is still live so let's go
over to Firefox and we're just going to
need to make a little configuration
change here and that is to go to about
colon config once we're about config
hang on if I could spell config conf IG
this is where all of the underlying
goodies are within the Firefox for
Android it's very similar to what you
would find on a desktop as well and what
we'll do here is thankfully there's a
search feature in the top right where we
can just go ahead and enter in just the
kind of settings that we're looking for
it's kind of like your Windows registry
actually so in this case we're looking
for Network dot proxy dot Sox we enter
that in and we can see here we've got no
value for any of this stuff we'll want
to set our network top proxy Sox to go
ahead and change that to one to seven
come here keyboard to 127.0.0.1 that is
our localhost the port just as we had
configured previously is one three three
seven and then right here where says
proxy Sox remote DNS we definitely want
to toggle this to true what that is
saying essentially is that if we're
making DNS requests which we do every
time we try to
look up say you know fubar comm - the IP
address it is we want to do those
requests through the SSH tunnel
otherwise while no one could you know
sniffing your traffic see the contents
of the data they would see where your
resolving DNS queries and and kind of
know where your browsing and that's not
fun so we'll definitely set that to true
we'll leave the network proxy Sox
version at five that's the default and
that's the Sox kind of proxy we have and
then one last thing here is to go over
to network proxy dot type and in that
case what we want to do is change this
from five to one okay so that's going to
use that for all of our stuff and at
this point let me just switch back over
to connect bot yep and connect back to
our server
and make sure that we have our port
forwards going yep Sox is going and if I
now in say Firefox I could browse
anywhere here I am browsing over to the
marketplace and it's going through the
proxy I can tell it is by if I do a
search here for what is my IP and hit
Google yes you can just do a Google
search for what is my IP I'm going to
see here 6:162 228 162 217 and that is
the same ip address as the socks proxy
the virtual private server that we set
up in the cloud and there we go
sure it's a lot of steps sure it's a
manual process but I want to kind of
show you that is possible on Android
without root first before we step into
the let's make it do all the things
because at this point only our Firefox
browsing session is going to go through
that proxy we're going to be able to
expand on this a lot more I'm really
thankful for the question and I'm
looking forward to your feedback you can
