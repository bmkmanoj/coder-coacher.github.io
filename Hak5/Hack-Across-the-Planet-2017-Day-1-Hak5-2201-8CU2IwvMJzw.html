get overseas this guy at check I just
told me that I'm the only person he's
ever seen that carries their passport
around because it's a part of my wallet
can shake me to the airport
let's go and don't need all right and
now a millionaire an eighth millionaire
actually because my $700 just became 8
million all the people I run into in the
middle of this airport because Jason is
that kind of guy oh yeah like more than
10 minutes but we got no more campaigns
because why not
it's all very nice my text in my first
time flying a Minnesota but with the top
rating of this guy yeah yeah who's that
engine the turn or passenger swim yes I
go little it down anyways a lot thanks
guys I uh discussing foreign I've got a
lounge for make my traveling
internationally over the last decades
the thing that's in the most
disappointing is probably just the fact
that no matter where I go with me feels
the theme everywhere has an H&amp;amp;M
globalization and it is like really I'm
looking for the unique culture the
different gospel yet I owe it so it's
all bauxite
I'm Democrat many Incirlik
rehearsals like what is this odd Linux
distribution in near to log out and
quite apparent
my point exactly
looks like an airbus a320 of course
ignores tell by the nose and that window
the only call it you can open windows
in the garden
we're recording into like it's a custom
easy taxis more difficult
if you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain comm with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick media
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time
my guys over at domain.com or syntax
five bands which is why hak5 will save
you an extra 20% at domain.com or just
send the tweet and say thanks according
hex levels easier so when you think
domain names think domain.com the part
of the episode where is going to put a
tutorial on - money but instead I'm
going to the hospitals because it's hack
side tradition I go to the hospital
I really hope it or not malaria hot
right now think you're not going
according to plan
so as it turns out I'm going to be okay
and I am super grateful for modern
medicine and I'm reminded in fact for
something that's minted Burton call back
to the a block on that awesome
flight on that Dreamliner the 787 from
San Francisco to Singapore United flight
one was like so cool sorry geeking out a
bit but um like seventeen and a half
hours second or third longest in the
world point is pointed that halfway
through the flight I'm like Wragge and
I'm looking around for some water and I
run into my flight attendant and she's
crying and suddenly that whole like
relationship between flight attendant
and passenger like breaks down and
suddenly were just human and it occurs
to me like okay well I just told her
this mantra that was told to me which is
fantastic and it's quite simply
everything is going to be okay it has to
be and I want to share that with all of
you now as well as a takeaway rather
than bash this week I guess so yeah she
asked me to write that down on a
postcard so anyway thank you for giving
me that and and to the rest of you I
will see you next week as we continue
the regular programming I'm sure I'll
feel better in a few days and as we
typically do Oh
sign up hack across America comm support
us directly a chicken shop calm and
feedback and outside the org anything
else oh right that thing we say trust
your techno
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
