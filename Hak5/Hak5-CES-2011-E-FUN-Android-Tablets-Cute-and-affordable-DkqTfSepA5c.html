by dice com the career hub for tech from
hak5 I'm Shannon Morse coming to you
from show stoppers at CES 2011 and I
found some awesome cute looking tablets
over here that I haven't heard about yet
so tell me about these alright so this
right here is the next five it's
manufactured by E fun it's an android
tablet and it runs on operating system
2.1 it's not out to the public yet but
we'll be launching sometime around q2 so
if you want to get it that's when you
can get your hands on it it's really
cute it has everything built in so you
can access the android market from here
and it also has the borders ereader
built into it so if you want to read a
book you can go right to it yes I am a
big fan of the borders ebooks now what
does this one down here because this
looks pretty cool too alright so this is
the next five this is actually a hybrid
between an android tab which also runs
on 2.1 and our digital pen so the idea
is you can easily write on this piece of
paper and it'll digitally drawn here so
you can edit photos text anything save
it as a PDF and you can upload it
anywhere you want well that's really
handy especially for taking notes like
when you're a student in a classroom or
something like oh definitely now what
does this last one over here and last
monster is the next four it runs on
android 2.2 so it's going to be kind of
an upgrade from the other ones has a
very nice display screen and just like
everything else that comes with quarters
already built in and you can get access
to the android so if you want to get
angry birds as we have here you can
easily do that and i'm sure all of our
viewers want Angry Birds on there oh who
doesn't exactly now do you know when
these are coming out yet or how much
they'll cost this one right here the
next five we know will be out around
April the other ones are kind of up in
the air right now and they're gonna cost
anywhere from 149 to around three
hundred dollars oh well yeah that's
that's not bad at all and what was your
