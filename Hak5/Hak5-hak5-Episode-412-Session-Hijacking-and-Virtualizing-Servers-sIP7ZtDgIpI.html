by rap star Go Daddy Netflix and rent a
noob because in this economy it's hard
to own a noob and this time on hak5 is
wpa broken ikea clusters session
hijacking virtualizing servers
screencasting and canvas technol us yeah
it's just one two three one two three
Rock step okay forget ain't enough to
show you
hello and welcome to hack 5 this is your
weekly dose technol 'used and we are
your IT ninjas I'm ninja Darren I'm
ninja man I'm pirate Shannon we are
awesome fun stuff going on this week
right you are getting into some VMware
stuff ya what I'm gonna be doing is
starting a multi-episode arc on virtual
infrastructures so basically starting to
process off by converting physical
machines to virtual machines I'll
actually get into all that and at the
final stage exerci you guys centralized
storage using some free tools so that
you know it's not going to cost you now
I'm gonna like virtualization is a lot
of fun it is the other day I was uh
trying to put together the new set cam
box and I was up in my room and I'm like
oh what am I gonna use to build this
thing I just need like I don't know it
crappy windows box I'll throw two
webcams on and throw it down stairs and
you know shoot the whole downstairs to
be awesome right and I'm and then I
opened up VMware server started to build
a machine until I realized I actually
needed a physical machine to sit down
here yeah that was a very sad can you do
some virtualization to physical server
for me um well you can pretty much do
what I'm gonna show you and transfer the
image over and I'm talking about like us
you want me to basically create a box
out of my you know my ass you're gonna
be like oh there it is one of those like
3d printer dealies like make me a server
yeah uh we're advanced we're not that
advanced cool well maybe on episode like
20 x 12 or something we'll talk about
that there are no X's it anymore
remember I you know I still put the exes
in the yeah for a mess what's going on
over there Shannon like having way too
much fun with that window oh um
it's raining out yes it is sorry I'd
your office laughing hold on let me get
that cool well while you're doing that
what do you got um I've got I have to
not just one two pineapples one is a
deadly router and the other one is a
tasty concoction now I thought we were
gonna be doing people have people have
said mm-hmm that they wonder when
Darren's going to come up with something
new mm-hmm besides Yas occur now well
what you're actually doing isn't like no
we engineer Yasser you utilizing yoskar
i'm using the version 2 point 0 of yas
occur but that's the whole idea of the
oscar project was it was a found oh my
god that a kajal worry about it later I
think I'm totally build on for future
presentations hacks whatever and so I'm
going to be talking about session
hijacking and to do that of course
easiest way I can think of to get a nice
little man in the middle going would be
with the pineapple yeah but but I mean
that that's just a tool right so I'm
gonna be talking about session hijacking
cookies and ways to steal them and log
into your it'll be fun dope sauce
what are you drinking I'm having a thing
called a bondage no problem it's vodka
rum gin triple sec once you scram berry
juice and pineapple juice it's good okay
Oh grenadine to granted him yeah most
important of the clinical it's just a
splash attack so you hear about the WPI
stuff you're getting scared no so for
those have been we don't live in really
a real target rich environment all
better it's an interesting
proof-of-concept thing right it's like
the first time that WEP was cracked and
it was like okay so we all knew WEP was
busted from notable from the very
beginning from the very beginning dude
you were so skeptical of wireless you
were like oh my god yeah can you knew
you were all right you're gonna like oh
I gotta make Christian going on and then
you're like really okay okay yeah but
interesting stuff coming out of pack
sack in Tokyo and there's actually a
proof of concept tool they can get over
aircrack-ng i'll have the link shown us
and whatnot it's not fully functional at
the moment but there's actually proof of
concept tool that you can play around
with to put together your own little you
know it's basically taking the stuff
that was in the research paper the
practical practical attack against wpa
and wpa2 turning it into something that
you can play with it's not super hey
just I don't think it's ready for
primetime so 11 know what I like about
what I'm working is it everything's
going I mean they've got one way working
right and
is only on wpa using tkip so if you're
using AES totally mad chill wpa2 dub
sauce and all that I think we should
show people how to because wireless
range you know anymore and you remember
when a came out there like oh this is
going to be the complete corporate
enterprise solution ready on the 5
gigahertz band it didn't work for
and you couldn't use it through like
thick walls or concrete or whatever I
think we should for a segment idea that
we should show people how to link
wireless routers together like WDS is
because we got something similar going
on up in here and now that oh now that
have fixed the eights are here turned
out it wasn't our access point it was
the drivers and now I'm getting like six
megabits off the so he has been bugging
me for the last month month and a half
ever since I put in the new wireless
router running dd-wrt which is really
nice by the way your extras point sucks
man are you crib speeds meanwhile there
is the only one that's having a problem
from we're updating a driver later who
woulda thunk it speaking of which
doesn't somebody else need to install
the same drivers she does well seeing
that my birthday was yesterday I had to
think about that for a second whoo time
warp here uh Darren actually bought me a
present he got me an acer aspire one and
the best part is it's pink it's my what
did you call it Matt it's the Malibu
laptop the Barbie it's not be bored the
Barbie cord yeah it mines a Tonka toy
then hers is a tell'em Italian yeah yeah
hey you know you're gonna be Fisher so
you've got while know his fisher-price
is the ASOS and then that is yeah it's
Tonka toy I I don't actually barbie
board Barbie I don't understand I got
Jesus tubing I mean like they're cheap
and they're good like I could I could
only understand if I needed one if I had
like a 17 inch mm-hmm but I mean a 15 I
can reliably put it on a plane mm-hmm no
space issues even if I'm in coach mm-hmm
which wear whatever happens
more but yeah it did the last five
live's I bluegrass left but I mean it's
there's plenty of room for me to do my
stuff even in coach I don't need and you
know it's like I don't go to coffee
shops I don't know and the guy I like
coffee but I don't like the weird inches
that crackheads that go to coffee for
the I let it ah we're gonna digress from
here yeah I'm gonna tell you real quick
we got a note from one of our viewers
when we're talking about the clustering
I should pointed out to us the story of
Homer it's a linux cluster inside of an
ikea cabinet and it's very interesting
read the the first homer was done i
think with like eight or six was done
with six boards quadra wars in forty
eight gigs ram its corner in 86
gigaflops did you see helmer to like the
the patel mer three and it just starts
making you dude i want a helmet three
yeah I don't know what I do with it but
I'm take down small country why I mean
you know it's it's good because you
thinking outside of the box yeah we
think of clusters in your life no
 boring but I honestly think
of like those uh this rack CC and
restaurants like those boring shelves I
would just like lined with mine with
motherboards that's what I see I can do
that I I don't think about cooling
though so my cluster would probably
catch on by her you always should do
should start taking donations of
people's old ass hardware that they've
got in their basement no don't don't
don't no don't don't we should move on
from here no and uh the 0 x 6 no no no
don't lose nothing yeah shut up we are
we're gonna start talking about the land
party so we can get attic here thank you
I like it LAN party what's going on
Jenny well well I did want to mention
though that you know my birthday was
yesterday but we have a birthday coming
up on friday i think it's friday oh
that's right yeah yeah don't walk away
yeah come back talking about Bo bike
6002 ones rajindra 2 3 188 send send
your luvin to Mack yeah I have no idea
what you're talking in the prior
I thought it was 12 yeah something like
that hmm so yes that's gonna be a lot of
fun he's gonna be old enough to get
owned in the hak5 LAN party Shay yeah
this I think it's next week we have a
LAN party coming up it's November 29th
that saturday at game hak5 org of course
you guys probably know that website by
now that server we're playing unreal
tournament classic and for what I hear
Darren's pretty good at that game but I
don't know I've owned him a couple of
times so I can't say right or wrong on
that anyway if you feel like playing
against him in this game check it out
come play with us yeah there's a thread
up on the forums under the gaming
section at hak5 dot org where you can go
ahead and sign up for a little 1v1 and
it's just my gift to you to you know let
you get dominated it'll be fun oh oh
please i'm pretty sure if we play
against each other um Darren vs aizen
yes you know that's only no words yeah
i'll own you just saying just gonna put
that out there just throwing down the
pit in the ban hammer dude she's gonna
you know ban hammer all right Jesus was
on my side have your costume she's got
Jesus uh you're serious I have my own
personal Jesus on my side with a little
spring too I will bring action Jesus
alright well it's hopping Jesus let's
get though yes yes yeah GTFO STFU ok
that's my part now let me tell you about

to you guys
have your dreams of owning a new been
shattered by our poor economy today
countless noobs are left on owned by
though it's struggling to find financing
a trenta noob we can help
with no deposits credit checks and low
monthly payments you can finally have a
new of your own to take to school
starting at 299 per month you can make a
difference in a noob's life with shame
find out more about our fortune
recertified noobs a trenta noob calm
alright guys well in the comments of
episode 4 11 we had a user by the name
of mnemonic ask us Darren you created
this fun you and Robin and muaks and
everybody else associated with it so
what are we going to do with it well I
mean the idea was to build on this
throughout the rest of the season as a
platform for talking about a lot of
different stuff and the thing is a lot
of the fun stuff really relies on being
a man in the middle right we talked
about that in the first season we've
shown you how to do things like our
cache poisoning to get man-in-the-middle
using windows tools linux tools whatever
it's nice because it's a simple piece of
hardware that you can take with you on
your hacking adventures and everybody
just kind of gets sucked into it and it
does its own thing so there's no real
setup required on your end yeah to go
ahead and you know become okay now I got
to run this tool in this tool in this
tool in this pool and we can just have
people connect and and then the rest of
the state and that just takes the whole
leg work out of it so now it's just come
to me my precious all right and we can
start having some fun so um talking
about fun let's talk about session
hijacking let's talk about stealing
those oh-so-important cookies so you
know when you log into websites they
keep your session throughout you know as
you okay you log in to this page and
then you got to go to that page and that
page in that page but your it's still on
the system when you're logged in right
your session with a little cookie right
so not now you're doing it speaking of
even the most secure websites on earth
mmm use sessions and what we're gonna
show or what you're gonna show is how to
love your cookies oh okay yeah because
check this out right this cookies got a
unique identifier that says okay cool
you've got this cookie you must be you
we're feeding you the right information
right right I'm sniffing any of your
thing in between you're connected to me
through my faun I'm in between you and
you know the internet so i can see that
cookie so i can take that cookie and i
can like with a firefox plugin like like
cookie edit you can inject it manually
and then go to the same website if
you're like sitting there what I
wireshark or with another tool you can
actually make this a little bit more
easy a little bit more automated to
hijack these coach cookies hijack these
sessions and so the idea is you go to a
website you login I notice it I go to
the same website I'm not logged in as
you now more in the same session more
importantly everything that we've done
has shown the fun as you know hooking up
to a wired you know computer or you know
wireless network that you know it's
already you know next to or something
like that you've actually got it set up
so that and this is running car
jobseeker version 2 yes so that it's
actually connected through your phone
correct yeah and i'll go ahead and show
you what's going on here karma if you
haven't played with the oscar version 2
definitely check it out it was just
recently released its up on the hak5
forums ads and a couple of nice features
like for example the w land light lights
up when karma is activated and some some
under the hood stuff that makes it
pretty so if you take a look at my
screen here this national access
broadband the this guy right here this
is actually my this is my connection
with myself and you see i got a ton of
packets going on through here that's
totally cool because people are using my
cell phone as you can see over here it's
just a simple direct connection USB
cable to my blackberry and i get online
I could do this through bluetooth but I
like the bandwidth with the US right and
I'm just doing this in windows because
it's super simple i'm using ICS internet
connection sharing which on my on my
blackberry interface on my interface to
my evdo modem I basically share out that
connection to my wired connection I
could do the same thing with my wireless
you do this with Bluetooth and wireless
then you've got a fawn in your one
pocket and cell phone in another pocket
and a laptop here and people you know
what
look at you weird I think we need to
sell have five branded yah sugar fanny
pack what was the thing that Chewbacca
had a little family bandelier we're
little hacking bandolier might be what
we need so the biggest issue with a lot
of people getting set up with this is
okay great people associate to my to my
fon here to my Oscar my little pineapple
if you will and it's but then they need
an IP address and they need and
connection to the internet so for me on
Windows I just ICS my cell phone they go
through that and then here's the trick I
set up a dhcp server not on the bond I
set up the font dhcp mode using the web
interface and going through in there and
it to do an ollie there's a quickie
thing is it's nothing really complicated
just go into networking you said it to
dhcp given an IP and whatnot but I've
got it physically connected with an
ethernet cable here over to my laptop
and then i set this interface up as a
dhcp server in Windows I mean if I was
running Windows Server 2003 this would
be a snap rise it's just built in I'm
running XP here nothing special so I
need a dhcp server and one of the best
ones and i think is kind of overlooked
is actually tftp d yes tftp d which is
for you know the forget the stands for
all send of blanking but rebel is that
what it is like so okay cool because you
use it we don't quote me all right what
is it we use tftp when we want to do
things like pxe boots and a network boot
stuff like that or writing where exactly
yeah it's actually this this beautiful
little program here for windows has a
dhcp server built n I assume that's as
part of the whole pxe booting thing
right and I'm using that in conjunction
with ICS to you know Cola heard tickle
the people in my that is sucked into the
black hole that is y'all's and assign
them and IP assigned them an IP address
share my internet connection through my
cell phone so I'm at the coffee shop
being one of those pedantic noobs that
you keep talking about and I'm having a
lot of fun if you look right here i
actually have way more IP
is assigned then are in our current test
environment so I'm not really sure who
those other people are but I've got it
fired up in who I don't know who they
are I was getting TGI Fridays earlier
that was kind of interesting cause I
just down the road as a word of note TGI
Fridays is about half a mile down the
road so on the comfort inn lobby I mean
that's like that hotels like a mile away
I don't understand this this it's a
little fun that good but here is the one
I want to show you okay so we've got DX
s inter external right so that is a an
SSID that's connected with this MAC
address and by and the end of it is 6500
write a check over here the one with
6500 has been the assigned to the IP
address of 1 &amp;amp; 2 168 1 dot 103 my faun
is assigned one dot 250 I'm connected to
it myself over wireless 2 i'm just using
the open wrt you could make it some
other SSID i'm connected to that over
121 so we're really not sure who these
wool 102 these 104 and there's 100
people are but regardless you are now
connected to the internet through the
fon fon goes to my computer computers on
to dhcp and gives you the Gateway of my
cell phone it's just a matter of telling
telling the tftp d program in the dhcp
configuration what IP address to use as
the default router right signs it to you
you do an ipconfig over there on your
your victim mark will just call you the
mark I'm the mark you're the mark yeah
your IP so I'm connected to Wow I'm
connected to DX s as external yeah which
is like you know 15 miles away yes which
is my office is external yeah barliss
connection but I've got an IP address
here and it's in it's the 1 103 like I
thought yeah and and you can see your
default gateway is the 1 1 0 1 which is
my ethernet interface here so now that
we've got packets all flowing it's time
to
start sniffing okay now I can do
something as easy as just firing up
wireshark here and we've talked about
this inex in you know excess with crisp
and if I go ahead and do that and you
like browse still some webpages command
in it because it's uh let's see good
capture interfaces choose my wired go
ahead and start that okay we ready yeah
go ahead and there we go you know i can
i can actually it's way too much as you
can see here it's like just go it's just
going and going and going and i can
follow this tcp stream i can go over
here and follow tcp stream and i can
actually watch you know as the HTML
coombs through i'm looking at some CSS
right now we come down here it's mainly
just CSS nice the hak5 forums Oh is the
hak5 form yeah i'm watching our CSS yeah
and nothing too exciting I think we're
missing a semicolon there oh well I'll
to fix ah looking for the lady in the
red dress even as we've talked with
Chris in the past about setting up
filters and and setting up colors and
whatnot nothing is easier than a tool
that just totally automates the whole
process of hijacking our sessions or
stealing cookies and all right other fun
stuff like that so for that not only do
we have a so we start with a pineapple
and now the next two tools are a ferret
and a hamster and you could search on
youtube for these two things but you're
not going to end up with hacking videos
no you are not no no but I did you go
ahead and do the search anyway because
she'll go fuzzy hamster food the one on
the piano with the popcorn is awesome
priceless yes so I'm gonna get out of
Wireshark here and show you these two
tools that's it so what are we gonna
fire up first okay so first thing we're
gonna fire up my command prompt do you
have them already open already yeah I've
got them open but let me show you how to
use the first one and so these are from
these tools are from errata security
okay you can go ahead and get these at
their blog I've got everything in the
show notes for this and the technique
this is something that they demonstrated
at Def Con and technique is called side
jacking okay sounds like fun so we go
ahead
and grab this tool it's a witness tool
and first thing you want to do is go
ahead and fire up ferret with the
command line option dash capital W okay
that's going to list all of your
interfaces okay I've got a buncha I've
got six interfaces on this machine
because I get like VMware and like
dial-up connection very tough but if I
look closely here connection number five
is my real tech 10 100 gigabit ethernet
so it's your wired Newark that's my wire
Nick that's the one I want to use so
then I just run it with dash lowercase I
and the number five to tell it hey I
want to use that interface and I've
already got a running here and show you
what it looks like okay this is it okay
so this is ferret I know it's just it's
just raw packets right it's it's really
just a it's a specialized kind of kind
of packet sniffer that's just looking
for one thing it's looking for sessions
looking for cookies so we can clone them
and we can you know hijack your session
the next the this next part of this the
ferret is should never get here I should
restart ferret ok so we're sorry I am
sir thank you I called for a cocktail
yes it does mmm Cheers I know I'm going
really fast it's all in the show notes
promise so I'm going to go ahead and
fire up hamster here right hamsters
hijacking tool great what this guy does
is he is it sets up a beautiful little
interface for me so that I can fire up
my firefox here and the trick is after
you've run ferret okay so I've got you
connected through me I got fair looking
out just for the good stuff and then I
run hamster what does hamster do well I
come over here and check out my tools
and options in Firefox and under
advanced network I want to go to my
settings and I want to change it so that
I I use a proxy and I want to use my
local proxy because what hamsters done
is a set up a local proxy on you know
127 001 or local right on port 3128 okay
go ahead and use that for everything and
and once you do that you can head over
to the sweet little interface over at
HTTP colon slash slash hamster there we
go the hamster one point O side jacking
tool great right and look at this 192
168 1 dot 103 hey that's me yeah exactly
because if i look at yas occur I've got
the excess internal I've got your mac
address here all that looks good a look
at the tftp d and hey looks and mac
address for one at 103 and if I fire up
wireshark if I fire up can enable do a
mac address sniff I can you know see you
know everybody that's here so here you
are and and so you are the mark on my
eeepc yes okay so I'm at the coffee shop
yes and I think you've got some extra
keys there with the whole spilling yeah
about that um so what I'm doing is I'm
here at the coffee shop and you know
because I've got nothing better to do
all I want to do is check myspace of
course awesome so I'm gonna go ahead and
login to myspace and where am I getting
tubes from I'm getting them from you yes
but I don't know that no of course
because you think you're on your work
access point know why you would be on
your work access point at the coffee
shop is beyond me but here's the thing
who's who's gonna I mean people are dumb
yes let's just put it out in there
people are not people are dumb I know
this is totally some malicious there's a
good there's a good side there's
actually a teaching side there is a so
I'm logged into myspace okay so you get
on your myspace I look over here at my
hamster tool and I'm like hey look at
this one dot 103 and I go ahead and
click over and I get these beautiful
list of all of these places that I have
cookies from them make this list a
little bit easier to read here and oh
hey look at this we got the hak5 forms
we got home myspace com I'm going to go
ahead and click on this myspace one and
look at that I'm now logged in as well
you logged in as my account but right
but it's because I because ferrets found
it hamsters mirrored it and now I'm in
Firefox using and you can you check
whatever you want from me now I can go
and edit your
file and be like you know I like
biscuits I could put that all of your
home page and be like Darren kitchen
likes biscuits next time you log in like
what though I don't like biscuits
personally I love biscuits but you know
what that's just me now okay that being
said we've had comments and questions
about how do we protect ourselves
against yah so here how do we protect
ourselves against this okay I can give
you a much longer an in-depth just give
me the five second version the five
second version is if you're at the
coffee shop and you see work access
point that's not your work access point
to if you know anything about your
network like this one assigns you an IP
address of 192 168 right blah if you're
expecting a 10-10 to something that's
not your you know products to you might
be a little suspicious you might also
consider some of the other devices on
the network so if I'm at the hack house
I know that if I hit 10 to 10 20 30 1 I
should see Audrey the computer upstairs
or you know 12-5 our openfiler but
exactly we have certain characteristics
so what we'll talk about this in a
little bit more detail but there's
something that you can do excuse me even
if you are connected through a pint I
just turn off cookies yeah and and
welcome to web Oh point one nah dude
that here's what you need to do you just
need to tunnel your yeah it's
pretty much what it comes down to we've
talked about it again and again it's
really just the most secure method and I
think it deserves a much longer an
in-depth explanation of ways that you
can set up your own home tunneling
system whether it's using SSH because
it's got a lot easier oh dude it's
gotten a hell of a lot easier I mean
even if you just use something like
logmein com to you know log into your
home computer and then do your browsing
through there everything's like 256-bit
AES I mean it's gonna take a long
probably longer than yours in there
drinking up cafe latte ah no how about
the margarita indeed so I know there's a
lot of stuff but that gives you kind of
an idea of what is capable once people
are flowing through year so we so we've
taken the proof of concept as of the
auger and we've actually put it
real world situation and shown you okay
here's what you've got with it now
here's what we can do with yeah that's
that's what you need to watch out for is
because if you if you're on shady access
points you need to worry about people
stealing your cookies because once here
once I'm logged in I could change your
password it could be my session yeah and
a scary part that's a scary I mean
myspace he put biscuits all over my
homepage you're gonna be a little upset
but you get into and it's you know
typically the same exact technology so
think about it this way I mean banks I
mean you can initiate wire transfers
from the web nowadays so that's scary so
that being said we will you know yes I
have some ideas for its ferritin hamster
with a pineapple awesome all right you
know what else I like what's that such
an easy throw I love trivia you know who
else likes trivia I like trivia to last
week's trivia was by mid nineteen forty
what craft littered London in the
hundreds with the task of defending
against dive bombers in the occasional
v1 flying bomb this was correctly
answered by Miss art well on the hak5
forums so we're gonna send him sahat
five stickers in a pro nobis sed this
week we have a different prize for you
not only we do we have the stickers but
we also have a WYSIWYG comic its volume
one called freak by ed pissed score see
Donna I love it it's a really good comic
book and I think you'll like it too this
week's trivia is what German aircraft
was so large that it required passengers
to move to either side of the fuselage
in order to make turns if you're the
first one to answer this right in the
hacked by forums while you know the
prize are ready and we'll send that to
you I'll send you out a PM for your
address and I'll send you some nice
prizes and I also wanted to mention the
dev five group we need some volunteers
for this to do some small coding
challenges you can check this out at
hak5 org slash forums and last but not
least I wanted to mention our sponsor
for the trivia thank you so much next
netflix for sponsoring the show with
Netflix you can rent over 90,000 titles
online including lots of blu-ray titles
with free shipping both ways to your
home
they now have over 40 shipping centers
so almost all deliveries happen in just
one business day Netflix plans start
from four dollars and ninety-nine cents
and as a new member you can get a no
whisk two week free trial membership
check it out at netflix.com slash hak5
and please remember to type the ww when
using this code next I'm going to throw
to Matt take it away dude oh sorry yeah
I was enthralled in the WYSIWYG we
actually got to sign one of these and I
read it the whole way through so guys
spend some time on the trivia vol 2 is
coming out okay the first one is freak
and it talks about a lot of the stuff
about like you know you got your kevin
Mitnick stuff you've got your you know
basically the history of this stuff like
stub Wozniak and jobs and the blue box
so very cool its history in a comic book
and volume 2 is coming out I am super
excited to see the next one that is
hacking oh yeah we make special Paris uh
I think where do we fail and I'm not
positive so we'll see when that comes on
but all right okay there we go i'm going
to show you guys a tool that vmware
distributes for free now the reason i
say vmware is because i use vmware in
the infrastructure and if you're going
to be doing virtualization yeah let's
take a step back so you're talking
vmware's that aren't aware
virtualization so taking phys taking
servers and making them run and happy
mode on a single server so we've got one
machine doing double duty triple duty
whatever right my in calculations and
you know research has been done that
stating you know if you have a physical
machine in your infrastructure it's
probably only beating utilized to about
thirty percent of its potential oh
that's thirty percent used to my
exchange server do I mean exchange and
Active Directory things like that both
idols if you've got you know uh backing
up thirty percent utilization sir
obviously the whole green movement so on
and so forth and also reducing server
room costs cooling costs all that goes
into calculations for reasons to
virtualize virtualize so we use VMware
in our infrastructure yeah easy to we
use a vmware ESX server which is the
corporate ESX server
allows you to do things like storage
vmotion which you can actually if you've
got multiple boxes and you've got a
controller it allows you to shut off a
machine and turn it back on in like half
a millisecond dude yeah you're five
milliseconds okay use me five
milliseconds yeah happy milliseconds
pretty fast yeah a little bit that's
pretty cool though I show and there's
lots of these products I mean that's not
just VMware like oh there's talked about
Microsoft old pc in the past well
virtual pc has now been replaced by well
for virtual pc is a desktop application
sure well we're gonna be talking about
is the server version of these
virtualization products microsoft in
their 2008 product line for server
actually has virtualization built-in and
if you're worried about virtualization
licensing costs with microsoft products
and mads you can run five copies
virtualized copies of a single license
for microsoft love that so you can buy
one server 2008 license and run five
virtual copies of an eye I nal but that
sounds very cool exactly all right so
what we're going to do is we're going to
prep your environment for virtualization
what we're going to do is we're going to
take all your existing physical servers
and we're going to convert them to
virtual servers now there's two ways to
do this you could set up like a
multihomed ghost solution where you kick
off the in the install and it pushes it
out to another box here we're going to
basically convert the machine on the
local machine so what we're going to do
is we're going to download the vmware
converter which is freely available to
everybody okay and we're going to
install it you guys not install software
not going to go into that with you we're
going to click convert machine great so
this is like a wizard that it that it
walks you through exactly and then this
is going to take a physical piece of
iron right here and turn it into a
couple of bits that we can run on
another machine because we're like you
you're not good enough for the iron
exactly what we're gonna do is this this
segment we're going to show you how to
dump a physical machine to a virtual
machine so we're gonna click Next and
we're gonna say we want to convert a
physical computer click Next okay
because we're gonna do it on the local
machine we're going to select local
machine next they need a hang at hand
you say since we're gonna do it on a
local machine what are we gonna do one
the local machine we're going to do is
we're going to take all of the
configuration on this machine
okay basically make an image of it all
right and instead of making an image of
it we're going to create a virtual
machine based on that image okay and
that image will be saved to wear to this
to the local machine correct to okay so
how does this differ from something like
microsoft windows NT back up where I do
like a system state image I do that that
fun phantom backup stuff where I can
just what this is going to do this is
going to create the virtual machine
container as well as the disk oh ok so
what we can do is we can then take this
image put it on a flash drive all right
throw it into our brand new server all
right and automatically import that
machine start it up as just as a so I'm
going to take my machine and I'm going
to make a basically a copy of it and
save that copy in a single or a couple
of files on that own machine yes what
kind of considerations do I have to take
into account here as far as the disk is
concerned you know I mean as far as the
discus concern if you've got okay if
your disk is pretty much full you had
you realize before I deleted my my SQL
backups I'd like 30 gigs yeah transact
so if you don't have enough room on your
drive to actually store the image we
have to set up a multiple copy a
multiple install of vmware converter to
actually source this out you can feed it
over the network exact okay but we're
gonna do it locally so given that you
know on our 160 gig scuzzy here we've
got like you know over half of it free
we can make a file but is the dry
exactly and we can do this while the
operating system is running yes okay so
we don't have to reboot or anything
crazy like that no boot disks nothing
well I mean as far as the boot disk is
concerned it basically takes this and it
says okay I'm going to take this and I'm
gonna restart the machine its gonna do
it's thing it's gonna do like a ghost
session okay and it's going to push it
out and it doesn't really restart
machine yes okay cool so what we're
going to do is we're going to type the
virtual machine name and in this case
it's going to be qu and the location is
you know but on the we'll put it on the
C Drive now this isn't recursive so when
we load up to well we see this also
inside of the sea
chu I'm you know saying like I know
basically basically what it's going to
do is it's just going to create a file
so after that the after it's done
creating its image and you've copied it
off site of this machine you could
delete it great ok cool and then I have
this physical machine in a file yes I
have reduced you to a shell script I
love this I know okay that's how I roll
alright so it gives us it gives us a
warning saying that the selected
destination is the same as the source
machine what do we have no space to do
this well you delete five years of
transaction logs on a sequel server you
might yeah so we're gonna say yes and we
can split it into two gig files if we
want to because of ntfs or fat32 Oh
fat32 file restrictions so on and so
forth yeah we're gonna allow the virtual
disks to expand which instead of
creating a massive 30 gig drive hmm
obviously we don't have the room to do
that yeah so we will go ahead and we
will allow it to expand and only use
what an inexact I love that so tons of
fish and click Next and we go ahead and
we set up the networks okay so so what
do you mean when you say set up the
network so well interface is like in in
VMware there's difference between bridge
net and host only okay so obviously for
a you know a dedicated server
environment or running server you're
probably gonna want to use bridged all
right so we'll go ahead and use bridge
and we'll turn it off at power-on okay
just so we can finalize some settings
after we bring machines back log into
this once we've got it going and then
we'll tweak our network settings is we
need exactly environment can adjust how
many nicks there are from one to fifth
so if our physical machine only actually
had one Nick before we can now make it a
two home to three hundy whatever you
want as far as networks and
customization goes now we can
automatically install VMware tools a
VMware tools are going to allow you guys
to utilize the mouse the you know custom
video settings and all that good stuff
that goes along with running everybody
it makes it a lot easier to manage so
you don't have to hit ctrl + alt to get
out of thing you can customize the
identity machine we could change the
name we could change the UID beautiful
roll out exact sit here and
and wow okay so and we can also and this
is a free product yes and we can also
remove which is critical all system
restore checkpoints because all system
restore checkpoints are going to be
based on old hardware right that is now
not compatible what I want to ask you
about is ok so VMware you can pretty
much identify a virtual machine based on
the characteristics of the hardware
because hardware isn't real it's being
emulated personalized whatever you want
to say so if we take like I don't know
like a dell poweredge 2900 right and we
turn that into a virtual machine it's
not going to have the same Intel Nick
that I had before it's not going to have
the same nvidia graphics card i had
before what is this going to do to the
operating system in order to make it
like the new hardware and are there any
other concerns as far as drives and and
and bathes and stuff like that as far as
drives and stuff like that goes
basically vmware is looking inside the
machine and it's saying ok I've got a
seed drive of 60 gigs I've got addie of
120 and so on and so forth you can
actually select each one that you want
and each one that you don't to actually
be ported over into this virtual machine
now okay what what converter is going to
do is it's actually going to pre install
all the drivers that are required so
that when you boot this thing up it's
not going to blue screen on you're not
gonna feed my cat freaked out where's
the hardware exact change to put a XP
hard to bring another computer and then
the motherboard is like what the hell
the reason windows blue screens is it
because it sees something that it
doesn't know oh so you've injected the
drivers you could totally boot it
exactly and that's what this is going to
do that leads to another segment for
another time exactly so now here we've
got our conversion summary great the
type the disk options the volume the
destination so on and so forth we click
finish and oh look there it goes so now
it's creating a snapshot of the volume
it's creating a virtual machine based
off that snap shot and it's actually
dumping it on to our C Drive you know
what I'm thinking snubz is about to
upgrade her machine from a a plan based
system to a dual core system and
wouldn't it be great because we've done
the whole like did you make sure you got
your firefox bookmarks make sure you got
here you know your your profiles for
outlook all that little stuff right
let me all awesome to just go ahead and
virtualize her physical machine right
before you rebuild it and then BAM you
know if you ever want to go back to the
old school vmware server and just import
the machine sweet so we've got it
exporting to a file you're going to show
us next time how to bring this into the
infrastructure bring it into her well
first what we're going to show you is
how to actually prepa system for the
importation process and actually
installing ESX on it and calling all
that other stuff so you vote out of
civilization man so my truck or today
you know save us some money and you know
keep the power bill down because I've
got us some servers that just sit there
looking for somebody to get an IP
address and then assign them one and
then it sits there thinking it did a
good job so real quick finishing up we
can actually go into the directory and
see and it's got a lock file that it's
got the vm x which is the virtual
machine and it's got the vm decays now
the vm decays are all two gigs you know
basically it's created all the vm decays
that's created everything to us all you
have to do it's not done yet but it
creates the files all you have to do is
then copy this to like an ass and then
once you've got your virtual server
setup copy it back over and voted on
this works for more than just so if
you're not in a VMware environment that
this converter will do will convert your
virtual machine to other sorts of file
containers if they're there is an open
standard for virtual containers it's not
a hundred percent but it does work so if
you want you can use the citrix client
and stuff like that and that there's a
whole bunch of different it's
interesting that VMware would release a
free tool like this that would be you
know work with their competitors so do
they have like is there an enterprise
version of this is there some sort of
like money making thing there is that
allows you to create a bootable CD boot
into it and then just copy out a machine
without it having to be on so I mean
that that gets into a whole nother love
and its employment system thousand
dollars worth licensing fees for your
home stuff this sounds a really cool way
exactly but if it's just like a snapshot
dealy right okay go very cool awesome so
if you guys have virtualization
questions definitely hit up Matt
because he is the master of that stuff
and I understand you're going to be
doing some more this on the show yeah
the next one is going to be do you need
virtualization and I've got some
calculations for BTU output wattage seer
rating as far as air conditioning goes
all kind of calculations that go into
your monthly usage in your server room
and we can actually go ahead and convert
that into do you need virtualization so
much for that next time on the show rock
on go cool okay well then I think at
this point we're just going to wrap up
the show so if there aren't any other
questions let's go ahead and ask shannon
this week our question comes from virus
1337 fireworks wat rights what is your
recommendation for a monitor recording
program or do you use a hardware device
on a pci or something i wanted to make a
youtube video but nothing seems so great
but your video looks incredible that's
right there are a couple of ways to do
this namely the hardware solutions that
you don't really want to do the ones
that we did top of this CM with a scan
converter which essentially takes a vga
from your pc and then turns it into a
composite or s-video got a pipe it back
into something something analog you
probably want to do that we've done to
something more digital and that's why
our is looking sweet and for that we're
using scalars in hdmi and some high-end
mac stuff if you're looking for
something a little bit more readily
available there are three different
software ways that we recommend and then
i'll give you a little hard wood one
after this so first up if you're looking
for a free and open-source way the way
that we did it in I guess the first two
seasons was using this program called
camstudio you can find it camstudio org
it is a source for which project it is
open source and it is awesome I know
okay so it installs in your system and
it will capture your screen to a flash
file or like your favorite encoding
codec whatever your a VI whatnot and
it's pretty high quality but i will let
you know it can be a little bit
processor intensive there so you may and
if you're doing like 3d gaming it's
probably not the thing for you but if
you want to
something that's open source that's
something free to just get your like to
do a little screencast this is a great
way to go and it's the way that we did
it for the first two years yeah the the
one solution that I've used in the past
is called fraps fr aps calm the nice
thing about this is it takes directx
video both nine and ten and dumps it
into a file that you can then upload to
your youtubes or in your timelines for
your editing software if memory serves
me correctly it's only about 30 bucks to
buy 37 okay but the great thing about it
is is darren mentioned that camstudio
was not the best for 3 gaming that this
is really designed for your 3d gaming it
can run in the background you can dump
it to half size full size set all kind
of hot keys for recording and stuff like
that and it really nice small file sizes
and it isn't going to chew up your your
processors nice and another one that I
do want to recommend because I have been
playing with like a beta copy it's
pretty old but I've been checking out
the new version and it's called Camtasia
Studio the guys up in Canada or friends
lab rats Annie Walker Shawn crathers
turned me on to this and basically it is
like camstudio but like way more built
out this is it's got its own timeline
thing you can do your own narrations you
can do fixed sizes you can do the whole
screen you can scale it and then it's
got like ways to export it out into
several defiled containers file formats
and whatnot so or direct lip load to
their site so if you're doing something
like a screencast where you want to show
off a program do a little tutorial
action it's a little pricey but it is
probably the most in-depth solution oh
my god yeah the solutions that we
mentioned here guys are all windows Paul
made mention of VLC in the most recent
version now instituting where you can
dump footage he says that it's a little
hard to get tweaked correctly but if you
want to check it out if you're on a Mac
or Linux go ahead and check it out VLC
yeah video land is for hardware solution
here's the most beautiful and all we've
been talking about our software ways to
capture what's on the screen and put it
in a file which is gonna you know or
your video or your hard drive or I
processor so beautiful if you can just
clone your desktop pop in a little
EGA whoever you've got a got a video
card that supports like in composite or
in this video out and you have a camera
or some other sort of recording device
that can take that footage n right ah we
used in the first season when we needed
to record the game flooded stuff like
that it's beautiful because it's not
going to tax your PC whatsoever so you
clone your desktop if you have a camera
that can accept those something that you
can send it out whether it's you know
HDMI on the high end or even if it's
just composite this video it's great for
game stuff because then you don't need
to worry about your processor yeah yeah
taking a hit so I hope that answers your
questions and for your question to be
answered on the show feedback at hak5
org or just go ahead and use the contact
form on hak5 door the homepage yeah one
thing we do want to let you guys know
about is we finally got all of our
itunes issues fixed with RSS feeds and
so on and so forth so if you guys are
not currently subscribed to the show go

of the page so go ahead subscribe to
itunes and always make sure that you're
on top of the latest technical
assessment to keep up with us and we got
a big photo ther a big a big picture
thing yeah thing to talk about but first
I want to tell you the RAF star thing
that we talked about last week is still
going so if you head over to our a
double f starcom that is the place to be
if you are interested in winning a hack
five awesome swag bag we got your hack 5
t-shirt we got your shot glasses we got
some butter to sticker on the front
right on the front page there's the hak5
prize bundle and autographed copy of
Superman issue 6 48 which we were so
awesomely featured in so this I
understand that it is not eligible for
our global audiences religious for our
us viewers yeah for our global ones tune
in next week we're going to do something
a little on our own to make a move that
something
malur for you guys since we feel bad
about you being left out on this but I
do if you are in the US check out rap
star ra the left starcom and it's
basically you don't have to pay anything
it's not one of these like winter free
ipod gimmick things it's a it's really a
site that draws interests to a lot of
charities our charity of choice is the
Electronic Frontier Foundation the eff
who's going back to awesome hackers like
ourselves and and and in addition to
bringing light to those charities they
raffle off awesome cool stuff so you can
get stuff like you know in addition to
the hak5 awesome prize bundle they get
things like xbox 360 coach bag and get
gift certificates to all sorts of
different places so you know you don't
have to pay anything you just sign up
for a free account you can you know get
as many tickets on all these different
one sign up for all the ones you want
and basically just one big and find out
about awesome charities that could you
know use a little bit of lovin yeah so
we want to thank rap star and guys make
sure you check it out the website and
get a ticket there's ten days left yeah
well not time in short when that's how
ever many guys but yeah the last thing
that we want to do is we want to thank
nikki cox Nikki Cole yes I know her oh
yeah yeah dimple boy dimple boy we on
the on the wall there's a three pain
hand-painting a shade that she did in
binary and shading and shadowing of a
hak5 logo so we met Nikki in Tennessee
yes and we have to absolutely thank her
she said that you know I want to do
something special for you guys love the
show but I love the show man yeah I mean
it sits prominently displayed right in
our living room and Nikki we can't thank
you enough dude I you know like was one
of those things where like just like the
kitchen to kind of forgot about and like
him done like you know yeah and um and I
keep seeing it and be like whoa well you
know that it's nice that it's like the
centerpiece of our living room it's the
centerpiece of our lives it's it's the
four of us living in a hack house doing
the show together
and it's so cool that you could you know
share your technol us with us in canvas
and oils very very cool yeah I mean but
you know at when I first took it out i
mean i was like blown away the fact that
i mean a she made it two dimensions that
we wanted and she did it all on her cell
she she's like okay what colors do you
want we're like ahh these ones and she's
like Touche here's your painting I was
like yeah but but yeah so we want to
thank Nikki and everybody else who wants
to sit that's good I love that so I'll
further ado I think that's pretty much
it guys thanks for tuning in this week
and we hope to catch you next week until
next time shannon trust your technical s
hello and welcome to hack five this is
your daily dose of your weekly dose of
your let's start it over ready beep this
episode of don't need it hahaha open up
notepad and start squishing the keys can
I have another margarita yeah what oh no
what you man um wow I really wish you
would've gone first yeah okay I'm a
on my shoulder at school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
