printer and an enclosure all that and
more this time on hack five hello
everybody and welcome to this episode of
hack 5 my name is Shannon Morse
I'm David Randolph and this is your
weekly dose of Technol s as you can see
I am joined yet again by my friend David
Randolph over at printed solid calm
super excited to have you back again No
thank you thank you stop come back yeah
thank you so much for joining me again
so I'm really excited about today
because we're going to build this baby
right here it's just super exciting but
first I do have a couple of
announcements to make of the 30 day
security challenge that I was doing over
at Tech thing comm I should be on
vacation right now as long as I actually
made it to Japan but you can check out
that 30 day security challenge I'm so
proud of it
youtube.com slash tech thing for that
we're also continuing our hack 5 contest
that's over at hack 5 org slash contest
if you haven't checked it out yet please
do so and last off Metasploit minute is
going to be coming back which I'm super
excited about so we're gonna have mu
bik's in town that's over at youtube.com
slash hack 5 if you aren't subscribed
already definitely check it out so this
week we are building that has six so
first off we should probably get a
little bit of history out of the way so
what is the TAS --ax well the test 6 is
a the current printer is being sold by a
lulzbot ok company out of Colorado and
it's completely open-source and they've
had the test six to five to four the
three the two had to a oh one okay so
they've had quite a few printers this is
their most current iteration so this is
the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano of the 3d
printers from Louis Bob but as you can
tell by the box is definitely not nano
no they do have a mini one I wanna click
called the mini Oh surprise surprise so
how much does this one cost for
everybody out there retails 2500 on
these okay wow that's a little expensive
I feel like I should not break it but
we're actually going to be talking to
Ben from lulzbot tomorrow in studio on
the show so we're gonna ask him all
about like running a company that's
fully open source and everything I'm
super excited about that
episode as well but I was really
interested in building another 3d
printer on the show because the last
time I actually got one in hand was four
or five years ago and it was the
Printrbot it was the kit so you had to
build it all yourself it was made out of
wood and you already told us about like
wood in 3d printers in their previous
episodes and definitely evolves yeah
it's definitely evolved so if you want
to check out those previous ones I did
about the Printrbot you can check those
over at youtube.com slash hack 5 but
today we are going to build one that is
a lot more friendly for consumers and
along the way David is going to be
giving us some information about the
anatomy of a 3d printer because I feel
like it's so important to understand the
theory behind it as you build it so you
understand all those pieces and why they
are important
exactly and we'll talk about the
structure we'll talk about some of the
key components in them and kind of what
to look for in 3d printers when you're
getting one totally all right well let's
get back into it
all right so how should I get this out
of the box is it's awful huge well as
with anything you can actually pull out
their whole getting started package and
they have lots of instructions about the
proper way to pull all this out and in
case you haven't guessed I've probably
done more of these than I probably
should have yeah you probably have so I
can help you kind of get the stuff out
really quick and then we'll work on
assembly okay for this cool cuz uh I
don't think hak5 is more of a you know
unboxing show it's more of a how-to show
it definitely is yeah so people are
interested in the build process so let's
go ahead and get this out we'll get
everything out of this oh it's really
finished it's put together for me this
is very different from what I'm used to
with the Printrbot the kit I had to do
everything from taking all these
different components and screwing them
in together and then I had to do the
calibration like everything so it looks
like most of my job is already done here
by far and that's all we're gonna have
to do is attach the table or the y-axis
on this really yeah and that's it so
it's pretty simple cool alright so I
guess we need to take off the foam
we hope you want to lay it on its side
before you do all of that because we're
gonna slide the y-axis
they store it inside here just for
shipping reasons okay good to know now
one nice thing about this is that you
didn't notice the printers and most of
the components are actually 3d printed
oh really so well obviously not the like
piece how can metal piece but if you
look inside here you'll see like these
green pieces are all 3d printed over
here which is pretty awesome so you'll
get the materials like over here you'll
see there's some green pieces here this
entire gantry here is all 3d printed
parts as well Wow
and they actually 3d print all of these
in their Factory on other lulzbot
machines Cyrill which is kind of fun so
it's very self-replicating that's
hilarious and these little yellow pieces
these look like they're 3d printed as
well they're all 3d printed and lulzbot
green beautiful they have their own
little green which I love it makes sense
and then a bunch of parts on even this
bed here that's 3d printed that's 3d
printed all the motor mounts are 3d
printed Wow so I know all of those parts
are all 3d printed that's so interesting
so and for a professional company to
actually 3d print their parts I think is
fascinating because it allows them to do
lots of revisions really fast so you can
get at a 6 if you had a test 6 from a
year ago yeah there are some changes to
it that they've made since then but they
still get to call it a test 6 so and
because lulzbot does the whole
open-source thing like if something
breaks and you don't have time to like
reorder apart or anything like that you
could 3d print it your 3d printer in
fact you can just go download all the
parts from them that's so cool and if
you think you can do a better job design
inch you can go download it change the
files and make your own do mine as well
to do oh I'm sure it's maker community
yes it is very much ok so what's next
alright well you got to put this in here
ok and what you want to do is have a
motor towards the back and we're gonna
remove these four little screws here you
set it in between the bolts yep oh ok
that was easy and if you push that all
the way forward all we're doing is
lining up those bolt holes here with
this little bolt we're
okay and we'll just tighten that down
that's super easy and yeah we're doing
pretty good so far I mean we're about
halfway done already with this how long
it take you on that one build you did um
probably six hours and that's actually a
pretty decent amount of time to spend on
a build anyway that's actually pretty
good
yeah no people have taken a lot more for
that and I think it was mostly just
because like I read the directions
before I got into it oh that's crazy
talk RTFM guys okay the next thing is is
that we have a few things we have to
attach because the bed was here all
right so this motor of course we have to
attach that and there's only one cable
for and there's only one direction
before I'm gonna guess it's this one
yeah okay
so we'll plug that into that motor oh I
see it right there now the next one is
is that we have the heat bed here right
now one of the things your printer
bought didn't have this one has it's
actually auto bed leveling so it will
use these four nuts on here or these
four washers on here to set its level
Wow and this is the whole heated bed its
build volume is 280 by 280 by 250 that's
pretty big but there's a little secret
because since they have these little
corners here they couldn't actually go
all the way out to the limit but if you
go into the software and you change your
settings to 293 by 293 by 1850 ah as
long as you aren't trying to go all the
way to the corner it'll still work oh no
hack for you little hack for you nice
okay so oh you got all of them okay and
that is all the connections for the bed
so three looks like one two or three
different connections so you got one you
got one for the power you got one for of
the thermistor which is what measures
the temperature for the bed and I have
one for all the switches and buttons and
contacts okay and if you look over here
you'll see all those connections and
then all we're going to do for this very
complicated rigging is we're going to
just push this up into 3d printed part
which is designed to snap it and now
it's done well that's easy look at that
some people might put a zip tie through
so they even put little holes to do a
zip tie but I find this not even in
you to worry about yeah you don't have
to worry about it cool okay so we got
everything now we have the the Y going
we have the x-axis all the directions of
the printer going and the only thing
left to do is install the extruder on
this and we are done we do need an
extruder so in those boxes there one's
gonna have the extruder and I believe it
is the box - okay so box wine has
toolkit power cable USB SD card blah
blah blah all the accessories as it were
the accessories and this one is just the
lulzbot has single extruder tool head
cool okay so the extruder is where your
filament comes out of that's my very
technical definition of annex ya
independently talk to it the extruder is
actually kind of a huge kind of
conglomerate of parts so you have the
hot end which is actually talked about
if you get the GoPro here you have a hot
end which is usually going to be this
whole assembly which is the kind of
metal callers got fins on and then you
actually have the hot in here and then
you have the nozzle okay and then
there's a thermistor in there that
measures the temperature for everything
yeah and then what you have is you have
parts cooling fans this is when you're
printing with PLA or softer materials
there's this fans just for doing that
that's cool this is your heater your
extruder cooler which this is always on
this is what keeps the extruder cool
while it's printing okay and then this
whole assembly up here that was 3d
printed to all of us was 3d printed and
it's actually based off of a waves
extruder is what they call this one this
particular style which is a giant
herringbone gear here that's gorgeous
drives everything and gives you a lot of
torque when you do your 3d prints okay
and oh yeah I remember these little
parts all the little filaments and stuff
yep but here's a neat thing that I like
about this is that every extruder needs
to get calibrated and know the exact
steps for it right and when you get the
extruder from Lowe's ball to actually
right on the back of it how many steps
you need to have for that particular
extruder that's so cool so it's it's
very finely calibrated yeah and then
wait a personal touch and with a lot of
3d printers you can imagine all those
components require a lot of wiring and
make it so it's just one wire set to
plug
everything up Thank You lulzbot for
doing that and every single little one
of those pins when you have to plug
those in I hate that and get the order
wrong and everything like that
everything so what we do is that in
their actual extra box of goodies oh
look at that they throw a cute little
tool bag here which I need an Allen
wrench bones so you get the lulzbot
allen wrenches and all the tools you
need to run everything they get you up
and go and ready to go that's really
nice
even brand little allen wrenches I know
I love that so that's great a little
overkill and what we're gonna do here is
we're going to remove just this one bolt
on the front this one bolt is what holds
the whole extruder head in okay and
we'll take that out and now the
complicated process of dropping the
extruder on is they actually have a V
slot groove on the front here and you
literally just drop it into that that's
it and put the nest on put the bolt back
on and it's good to go yep now an
interesting thing that they do which i
think is really kind of cool is that
they have different types of extruders
you can draw up on for this okay so you
need a different extruder for let's say
flexible filaments and my personal
favorite extruder that they make is
called the Moore's true der mo AR okay
and it's got a really big nozzle and
prints really big prints really fast
very low resolution so a print I might
take sixty hours with this type of
extruder will take about six hours with
that extruder that's a big difference
but it won't have as good of a
resolution but if you like the layer
lines and you like the aesthetics of it
so what do you need to do if you need to
replace it with that other nozzle
well you literally just pull out that
one bolt and that's it drop in that
whole assembly they make for this and
then plug into one cable and you're done
okay so they take care of it they even
make a dual extruder end for this as
well you kids are so lucky in this day
and age with your 3d printers you don't
have to cut together
with parts and manually level everything
I had you know but if you're ever
wondering why I haven't touched a 3d
printer in like four to five years
that's why that's why I thought that
they were still like that
and I was like oh it's so complicated
but gosh this is way easier they have
over simplified stuff which I love now
they even have a spool holder on the
side to hold your filament all that cute
stuff it's nice and sturdy that's good
and you can even do extra accessories
like they have this what is that this is
pretty simple what this says is it snaps
on here and when you do your filament it
keeps your filament from rubbing against
the machine because your filament will
run through this - some people refer to
this accidentally as a boat in tube this
is not a true boat in style tube a bonus
tube is when it's permanently attached
here and it keeps the back pressure of
the filament going into the nozzle GOC
and that's a whole other printer yep
okay cool
this is just to keep it clear of any
moving parts on your so it doesn't get
snagged or anything like that or grind
or anything
it keeps the path pretty clean that's
nice and if I turn this all the way
around for your camera here whoa
the backside of this has a lot of really
interesting label I can't turn it this
way so you can see it with your camera
but they actually do the little
engraving so you actually know every
individual thing and if you get their
head that actually has two extruders on
it yeah they have it so it's just a
quick connect right there and you're
done nice cool so they definitely over
engineered this well that's that's great
though what I love they're trying to
make it easy for people and I think of
all the possibilities that you might
want it for they want to run right out
of the box okay
and in fact we'll get it powered on here
and have you printing and it won't even
be an hour since you open the box yeah
I'm so excited about that okay cool
so now we have power cable of course USB
cable if we need it oh that they
actually printed on this printer to
prove to you this this is actually
shipped this one with a working
Princeton oh that's really cool that's
super shiny Wow
and that is the Lowell pot filament
it's very smooth on the bottom - it
looks like it took nothing to get it off
of the the heat bed
cakes not gonna get off the heat bed
that's because the heat bed is built out
of a Pei material which is my personal
favorite material to print with right
now
very nice what I like about the task 6
compared to like even or many as it'll
print directly from an SD so we don't
have to have a computer hooked up for
this so they sent an SD card with it and
so and that actually has that file for a
little octopus on it come on
and that's how you prove that it's all
working and everything's good so once we
have this up and running we can just
plug this in and test it with the same
octopus printing exactly and then after
that then you launch your software and
figure out how you want to print the
next item you would print and so on and
so forth that's definitely useful for
problem-solving because you know
immediately that your your printer is
set up correctly so you don't have to
wait until your software is ready on
your computer to find out if something's
wrong exactly that's great great
thinking Louis Bob okay great thing all
righty
next next we got to plug it in and we'll
turn it on here alright and give it a
second to power up and it's got its own
screen cool my ready to go so it's
running Marlin on there it's running
Marlin which is of course completely
open-source in the same tradition we'll
be learning more about Marlin very soon
so now what we'll do is we'll just plug
our little SD card right in okay and for
now what we'll do is we actually take
the screen here and we're gonna go down
to temperature and we'll bring the
nozzle up to temperature so we can
remove the old filaments and for the
start we're gonna bring this up to about
205 that's a good start temperature 205
305 okay that is what I kind of tell
everyone start with PLA and that's the
good temperature cool we'll get it right
around 205 206 is close enough sounds
good to me and now if I go all the way
back out you'll see it's sitting at 206
and we're just waiting for it to warm up
here yeah now take a little minute okay
we'll pull the old filament out put a
new filament in and then we'll hit
prints sweet okay by the way in case you
didn't notice the reason why it has old
filaments in there still left in the
nozzle right
is because that's the filament they
actually use to print that octopus with
ah so they leave it in there to prove
that you know this is what they actually
printed with great and it all works okay
so now that it's at temperature I guess
we should pull out this old extruder
filament so just you know kind of like
take that off temporarily and what the
extruder it's just blur to pop it up and
it falls apart right and now we'll just
pull out the old filament oh that was
very similar to what I used to have to
do and it's pretty changed there and now
what we'll do
you'll notice by the way this filaments
here is actually pretty thick compared
to probably what you were and then yeah
that's because it's a 3.85 millimeter
filament versus a 1.75 okay in the
industry there's a lot of differences
but like the higher-end manufacturers
most of them are using 285 still okay
good to know and all we're gonna do is
just loosely throw it up the tube here
cuz it's a very short amount right so
doesn't have to be overly pretty okay
let me just push it through the tube
until it comes in okay and then what
we'll do here is we're just going to if
you look down the little hole here
there's a little hole that you've got to
feed the filament through and it's just
next to the gear and we'll sit there and
I'll push that and if you look down here
underneath it you'll actually see a
little bit of plastic start to come out
and so I know that's good and now I'll
pinch the top back to put the close the
top back up okay so now it's all closed
and back we got new filament loaded
perfect well go in there and grab my
fingers and pull that all don't touch
that with your fingers because it's hot
yeah it's very hot now you'll notice we
haven't done any calibration or anything
to this printer no we haven't we haven't
even like sprayed this with hairspray
yet that's right that's cuz this is all
Pei surface which we don't have to worry
about that with so it's a great Pei is
kind of third there's definitely
something that they love putting on
their printers and I love it too it's
one of my favorite print surfaces and
doesn't require any sort of treatment
for PLA some of the other materials you
might have to put something on it but
for most normal printing you don't have
to treat it you just need to keep it
really clean Wow
okay so just wipe it down now and
wipe it down if you get your
fingerprints on it wipe it down because
your fingerprint is enough to actually
dirty it up so we put a little card in
there and I'll make you hip go on the
print on this okay and what you'll
notice on air is there's a print from SD
at the very bottom yeah you click on
that okay and then you'll see all your
little test prints they include with it
software sample prints so I go in to
sample print that's correct okay
and then you can go down to the
novelties and my story and it's moving
now you'll notice at the end of it they
actually said engine as there are a
format of choice yes which should be
close enough for us to get this print
out of we also have a spool of an engine
as well okay but that should be enough
to get us started in this case but it's
gonna take a minute here it's gonna warm
up yeah and on the screen is telling you
the temperatures everything's gonna get
the bed up to about 85 degrees okay
that's engines temperature engine likes
a little bit hotter we're actually gonna
do a whole episode on Gephart materials
and how hot to get stuff and things like
that
and it's a 24 volt bed okay they're one
of the few printer companies that
actually do 24 volts for their entire
system Wow which will help it actually
heat a lot faster for everything so you
don't have to wait as long
cool and once it gets up to temperature
it'll go around and actually do its own
auto leveling oh my gosh so much easier
than trying to level things with
yourself and your balls on the bed here
they have a bunch of switches so there's
a switch there yeah and then there's
these washers yeah so it's gonna do its
very first pass where it actually will
come down and hit that little switch OH
and that says okay I that's the bottom
ok knows I go that's the bottom okay and
then it'll actually will come down and
hit every single one of the washers in
all four corners to decide it knows it's
like axises well it's not it's to see
how level the plate is because sometimes
a plate might be a little bit rocky yeah
we're on a folding table here so it
could distort the frames ever so
slightly yeah we're talking paper
thickness Distortion
yeah
so and it will measure that before each
print and create this kind of
three-dimensional mesh of the bed and
then level before it actually prints
everything so it does that before every
single print that you do exactly that's
nice just in case we move this or if
there's an earthquake in California you
might want to recap where the
temperature changes in the room and
actually causes certain things to expand
and contract that's a good point
so there's a lot of little subtle
variances that can actually cause your
printer to move around that's great okay
and interesting thing is that you know
we talk about open source and all that
stuff all their prints are open source
but all the components are open source
as well they're actually using a lot of
open source hardware for all of this and
the board inside of it's also open
source is actually a Rambo board which
they call it Rambo it's actually based
off the ramps board but it's made by a
company in Tennessee the Ultima scene
company ok that makes that board and
it's completely open-source as well and
it's very popular for a lot of printer
companies to use that or high-end
printer companies that use kind of a
quality board is that in Arduino type
board it is an Arduino type board it's
actually it's based off the 2560 arduino
mega board yes and most 3d printers have
that and we're actually going to talk
about that in episode we're gonna talk
about the firmware they use and how
simple it can be with it and yay how you
can build your own oh it's moving now
what it's doing is it's going around and
it's checking all the actually it's
doing its little wipe so it has this
cute little pad here and it's wiping off
the nozzle before it starts to print
that's what that soft pad is for about
that and it's to make sure it's really
clean before it starts to level and so
now it's gonna go touch the washer
touches at once and then it slowly goes
and touches it's again to get us precise
as it can to know exactly where it is oh
my gosh and so now it's gonna just touch
it and now it's gonna move over to the
next washer oh wow that was really fast
and then it's gonna sit down there
touches it fast and he goes touches it
slow again very slow and it goes slow so
there's no bounce so it doesn't actually
over push it or
go too far before it actually senses it
right so it does its first touch to go I
know about where I'm going and then it
goes the second touch ago I know exactly
where I'm going cool
the funny thing one thing I love is that
they have in their little firmware the
way that every time it hits each point
on the bed if you're some reason it
doesn't sense it or there's a problem it
will go back rewind Ã¶zil and try again
so it was good it'll do it multiple
times until it finally gets it to work
for you there's never an issue and it's
ready to go that's amazing and now it's
done its measurements it's gonna go up
here and it's gonna Park for a minute
and it's gonna bring the nozzle up to
final temp okay and then start a sprint
great alright so it takes a little bit
of time to warm up the machine but then
after that it's off and running perfect
okay it always sounds like it's playing
a song mm-hmm well know what there is
g-code for that in fact I have I've done
a few or take the old floppy drives out
of old computers did that oh man that
was so funny too and you know it's good
use for those old three-and-a-half inch
drives but there's there's people have
done with their 3d printers because you
can actually get the home down and all
that stuff if you're feeling ambitious
but now it's actually printing it's off
and running now if you look at it you'll
see this that's already got the good
first layer and you probably remember
from your bill that you probably spend a
bunch of times trying i had strings all
over the place I had it trying to pull
away from the heat bed all sorts of
things and that's that's where printers
have really come finished printers now
when you buy them and they get shipped
to you you you know poor UPS and FedEx
to throw these things like you know
they're nothing yeah
this thing arrived on the dock we built
it out and it's already up in printing
and we didn't do any calibration and we
didn't do any extra leveling or anything
like that and that's kind of where
printers have come to I'm just I'm kind
of speechless at the fact that it's so
easy nowadays
and the prices haven't changed that much
not really I mean well back then you'd
spend $2,500 he would actually kind of
get the machine you had to build and
tweak into now you're spending 2,500
you're getting more of a finished
machine yeah it's much more
plug-and-play now it's a lot more
plug-and-play and then there's actually
a lot of innovation coming relatively
soon I mean within the next five years
this mark is gonna definitely explode
with even more stuff than the
auto-leveling and the filament and this
type of quality print that comes off of
the printer now have you ever had an
issue with these kind of printers where
it does like end up pulling away from
the heat bed or getting stringy or
anything like that there's always issues
with that and you have to worry about
you know sometimes you have to tell it
you know hey you're printing - hi you're
not printing tool oh yeah you don't have
to overly worry about if it's like out
of out of sync or caddywhompus okay it's
a great term nice terminology but
there's everyone smile there's some jams
or there's things that are still
traditional to traditional printers and
these yeah and I've seen some printers
that are trying to negate even those
problems these days and well over the
next you know several years we'll see a
lot more of those printers come in the
market that can detect if they're being
jammed logged or if they're not printing
at the right temperatures sample the
filaments do even finer bed mesh lovely
and imagine if you will this one only
did four points I've seen some that can
do 20 30 40 points on the bed and make
this extremely micro leveling that's
cool you know and we're coming along
yeah no kidding all right well I'm gonna
vote that we wait for this print to go
ahead and finish up and while it's
working its way why don't we throw to to
a sponsor sounds like a plan to me
Darren take it away you've got a great
idea you should do what Shannon and I do
and head over to domain.com and register

it's just between the unite all right
tell anyone okay when you think domain
names think domain.com
okay we're back and we decided to go
ahead and move the 3d printer into the
warehouse so that wall that is running
and we're doing a time-lapse video of
our print we're going to go ahead and
build our enclosure which is a whole
bunch of acrylic pieces from printed
solid so let's go ahead and get started
with this and enjoy
here's what I like about my brackets
they were designed to actually keep
everything together while you assembly
because we are removing some of the
actual structural bolts from it okay but
we're not removing all four the way the
back is actually designed on this is
that you leave two bolts alone and
replace the two outer bolts on the
printer so that you're not actually
taking the whole printer apart what
you're doing that's good okay cool so
what I do so that's nice that they
supply those little what are they called
allen wrenches Helen range is for you so
we'll remove this bolt here okay
there goes and now there's a little nut
that's in the t-slot behind it and I
just want to make sure that nut doesn't
slide around there's also a nut here
that slides up and down a little bit
so if I pull that bolt out it's going to
get it's gonna fall all the way to the
bottom and I have to adjust it but if
you take the print of solid sticker
that's included with it and pinch it in
there oh nice yes pinch it in there
while you're printing or while you take
that nut out then the nut won't fall
down that's funny so put this in here
also use a zip tie but hey you got an
extra sticker for the interim
I'm glad you would supply the sticker
that's useful and that will hold it in
the slot okay and so now we'll take our
little bolts here put the bolt in put
the bracket on and that is it cool and
we'll wash rinse and repeat and do this
for all the corners okay so in case you
notice the design of my things actually
mirror the design of their corner
brackets yeah trying to be aesthetically
the same and not take up any more build
volume than what's necessary that's cool
so that's all good we can take a sticker
out okay now since we have the sticker
here go ahead and hand that to me
because I will tell you an interesting
secret of the sticker
it fits amazingly well right here nice
I'm not saying anything nice so nice one
David the next thing is we're gonna take
the SD card out okay and we're gonna
stand it up on this end Oh God
we take the SD card out because that's
how it can get damaged okay and now
we're going to slide the side piece on
okay so we got this one on this side so
now what it is is that we actually can
take it off for now because that I just
wanted to show you how it's gonna go in
okay but what we're gonna do I'm gonna
take this piece here and put the four
bolts in and put the four nuts in but do
it very loosely okay yeah we got all
four oh and I would just tighten them
down my hand nice and those are nice and
hand tight now we take the printer set
it back up okay we can put our little
spool holder out to the side I'll put
that on there and actually before you
put that on let's put the lid on mmm
I include two lids okay and if you're
using a standard side one you're gonna
have to put it all the way through and
normally would do this without filament
on it okay
since I have filaments oh that's easy
wow it fits perfectly the reason why
fits personally is because since lulzbot
publishes all our design files I was
able to get all the contours directly
from their design files that's great how
handy and then this one sits in the same
spot but has room to leave these rails
exposed yeah there's a lot of users that
like to mount
top mounted spool holders cool okay
that's all there is to it okay and now
that's a hundred percent done so now all
you had to do was take the front piece
and the mirroring back piece and set
them on top of the two bullets right
here little mounts the nubs do you have
to screw anything down or it's not done
it's designed to be easily lifted off
because if you need to go work on a
machine I'll come in here and just like
you know what I need to come in here
pull that off and now I can pull my
prints off I can get in there it's tuned
cool okay and it's because I didn't
think doors were a good way to go with
this because if I put a door here you're
reaching in there and it's not very
comfortable and you have more chance of
damaging your enclosure itself yeah
that's a great point so this just
literally lifts on and off and makes us
so you can get access to it cool and get
to whatever you need to work on nicely
done I love it okay so now that we have
everything done I do have a curious
question for you okay when I built my
first printer the reason why I was
thinking about having an enclosure was
just to like dissipate heat correctly is
that the right reason that's one of the
reasons but it really depends on the
material you're working with okay
most the time like materials that are
PLA base are in a true PLA yeah which is
what the most common fulminate is out
there you don't really need an enclosure
for it okay the only time a pill a
person might really want an enclosure is
if they have cats oh yeah that's a good
point
I have two cats at home so you don't
want them playing with the printer
getting stuck in there or you have
toddlers and things like that that's a
good point if you're working with more
exotic filaments you definitely should
consider an enclosure okay and it
doesn't have to be fancy a lot of people
think it needs to be these heated build
chambers and all of that yeah I'll be
honest with you I love my enclosures I
think they're aesthetically pleasing we
sell them we love them they're great but
a cardboard box works just as well
you can look through it and make sure
that your print is going well it looks
good and it works good and cardboard
burns a lot easier oh that's a good
point
so these enclosures and all of our
designs that we work on their secret is
is that we keep all of the electronics
outside of the enclosure
so they don't electronics get really
worn out if they're exposed to heat this
keeps them all all the electronics
outside the building and you're an
engineer so I'm not surprised
Electrical so that's the big difference
for us and that's why it's such a
complicated design is very cool I try to
keep as much outside as possible the
holes are intentional by the way all the
little holes and Assizes
it's intentially it'll let enough heat
out of there that it's not going to no
matter what temperature you run it out
none of your parts are going to mill
remember the 3d printers built out of
plastic parts yeah yeah so it's designed
to literally leak out extra heat that's
a great point and you are offering a
coupon code for people to on the website
right yes we are offering to keep on a
code for all of our premium filaments
10% off everything cool
they haven't guessed yet it's hack five
oh no way so on check out yep nice okay
that's easy peasy
thank you for that I know you didn't
have to do that for our viewers or
anything so really appreciate it my
pleasure you know I'm a fan boy of yours
thank you pretty sure I watched you on
what was it attack of the show pack of
the show in high school I'm pretty sure
I did my memory is a little foggy of
that time but pretty sure I did those g4
days yes so we're gonna go ahead and end
it here but we're gonna have David back
in a couple of episodes and we're gonna
do a review with the lulzbot guys to
talk more about Lal spots open source
platform for their business model which
is super interesting and I can't wait to
learn more about all the materials that
go into 3d printing cuz it's really
really fascinating to me and I'm I think
I'm kind of behind the times on it but
I'm glad I'm finally learning all the
components the way I should have the
first time well get you involved in 3d
printing again I really appreciate it
I'm so excited so if you want to learn
more you can email us feedback at hak5
org don't forget to check out hack shop
comm where you can support us directly
we really appreciate it and that's where
you can check out all of our different
products and it just so happens a lot of
people have made 3d printed cases for
our products as well which is super cool
and you can also check out hack 5 org
for all the things that we are doing I'm
going to be having a meet-up if I
haven't done it already
in Tokyo November 18 I think this might
be coming out after that but if you were
there it was nice to meet you
so that's about it thank you so much

well runner prints at prints all on
twitter we're also on facebook and
instagram and all the other fun places
we're very social so you can find them
there and you can find all of us over at
hack 5 thank you so much
