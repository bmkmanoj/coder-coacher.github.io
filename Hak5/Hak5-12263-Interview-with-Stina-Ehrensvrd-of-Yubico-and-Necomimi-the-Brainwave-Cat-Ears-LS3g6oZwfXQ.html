by go to assist okay I kind of have a
thing for cats I love kitties I have two
of them at home and whenever somebody
tells me that I can dress up without it
being halloween I get really excited and
these read my brain waves they do yes is
it that amazing they are really cute but
I know how do they read your brain so
they have a cousin like the matrix where
they like kind of chop your head off and
like stick yes let's making these stick
sensors inside your brain there's a
couple of things on the back of my head
and they they stick into my brain it's
kind of painful the first time but after
that they they just make imaginary we
get used to it yeah it kind of itches
sometimes but you know it's like having
dandruff or something infections much
Japan yeah at that kind of sex I know
how do they really would all right so
it's got a sensor up here at all right
though let's get your clothes up yeah
and then it's got a second sensor which
is on the ear and it clips on like a
little clip on earring I'm sure you love
that don't you Paul that just sounds
painful to have it is yeah it's good
irritating after a while but but you
know once it's numb okay you can't feel
it anymore cuz I like the head of
battery or so like when you get your
ears pierced you like no thanks yes like
don't touch it now so um they're called
necomimi cat brainwave ears and neck Oh
me me in japanese means cat here so
Nicolini it's kind of a perfect
combination of english japanese words
and they use this technology inside of
them called neuro sky and this is a
company that makes a proprietary
platform that measures all sorts of
brainwaves and it can be used with
applications for anything from gaming to
medical they have ones that can be used
for education even like meditation and
it can track your meditations mine
there's different styles or is it just
made for each one yeah so this one's
just like a specific style that they
have that you can buy on the website and
these are like 70 bucks on the website
but they also have a couple of other
headsets to that are kyle called mine
mine wave headsets and those are
development platforms so cool thing
about them is that they're open source
and you
develop your own applications to work
with the headsets oh wow yeah it's
really really cool so what kind of like
applications are have you seen so far
and so I looked up one it was a
meditation one where you can sit down
and wear the headset where the mine wave
headset and you can track via bluetooth
through a little RF sensor that you plug
into your computer what's going on
during your meditation you can see how
much activity your brain is using and
you can play music through the through
the software all sorts of things like
that they also have a couple for
education I didn't really take the check
out those much because they cost a lot
of money to buy I actually have to buy
some of the app yeah some of the apps
are like 15 bucks or 20 even like super
expensive like 40 50 bucks but it kind
of depends on what you're using it for
whether that's medical or just like a
video game and they do have video game
ones too like there's a point and shoot
one but it's kind of like it uses your
activity to shoot things very cool yeah
and they're all available on their
website and the nice thing about this is
that they they accurately measure the
mental states like not only meditation
and attention but and it's not your
actual thought so they're not like
collecting information about what you're
thinking the whole time so if I'm really
calm it doesn't know that I'm actually
thinking about my family while I'm calm
it just knows that I'm very calm inside
my head at that time and specifically
the mine wave headsets the ones that are
like they're around hundred bucks or so
they measure brain waves EEG spectrums
they the processes that the neuro sky a
chipset these e sense meters what it's
called for all the attention and
meditation that you're doing in your
head and then the little ear clip right
here that's the ground electrode so
that's kind of grounding everything for
you that's why if I take it off they
after a couple of seconds they'll stop
moving and then the eg eg electrode is
the one that's up here and of course it
does take batteries so they do have the
operating system or they work with a
bunch of different operating systems
which is really nice it can connect via
bluetooth of course like I said to your
computer but it can also you be used
with Android and iOS so you can take
these on the ghosts
it's their battery and you could you
know play video games on iOS or you know
download apps for Android whatever you
want pretty much so like when you say
like connected to Android is it like
have you seen any examples of that is it
not me personally not yet yeah not yet
but according to their website they do
have development kits that are available
for iOS Android Windows OS X and there's
also some more open source versions for
linux too so if you want to develop your
own applications on Linux you can do so
the actual development platform is kind
of confusing for me because I'm not much
of a coder per se the only thing I've
really messed with is Java so to develop
you first of all have to buy the headset
and then download the developer tools
which of course are free because kind of
like training software to get you
figuring out how to do it but you also
need a visual studio or a visual c c++
and i don't know how to use those so
i've never done it before but i'm kind
of considering buying my own just
because i'm really excited about it and
i think it's a really really cool
development platform it's so neat that
this technology is out there in the
world and it's under 100 bucks so that
people like me and you can buy this
stuff and be able to learn from it and
be able to you know grow and understand
our mind waves a little bit more isn't
that cool that's nothing very cool on
its don't you want to buy one for your
girlfriend oh my you get a little you
get used to it but it's kind of creepy
at first yeah especially cuz it's like
constantly making noise what yeah they
yeah you can hear the motor and then if
I'm sure that's just kind of like a few
rides away from getting there we go like
so they'll calibrate for like 30 seconds
my little quieter motors like they use
in cameras or something like that so
yeah I would like to see an upgraded
version that does have the quieter motor
motors but if you just want to do
development you don't really care about
wearing cat ears around you can just get
the regular headset that looks like a
headset with a weird thing that's
sticking on your on your forehead right
there but I think they're really cool
and I've gotten used to these over the
past few days when I've been messing
them to the point where i've been able
to figure out like what i need to think
about or what i need to focus on to make
them like perk up just like that did you
see that and I cool but also time
they're kind of like there between the
relaxed and interest in states so they
move back and forth and they're kind of
and then i pirkled just maybe could also
like work with other sensors did they
say anything about that like where you
can use in Lex's part of the program
have it pick up other kind of
information oh that's interesting you
know I didn't delve far enough into it
to know about that but I don't see why
not cuz I know that it already tracks
your brainwaves and they do mention a
couple of either other spectrums that I
can work with so okay hmm so I feel like
you're walking around like maybe you can
get it to start picking up like wife I'm
like it kind of tweaked oh my god like
bills little antennas inside the ears
and find Wi-Fi and just like perk up and
go high five that way that'll be awesome
okay now we have to make that into a
segment and develop it for ourselves oh
yeah that would be great for ingress I
could just walk around with my my new
Nexus 4 and find all the little portals
everywhere and just use them to connect
myself to Wi-Fi it could be my own
little Wi-Fi hotspot oh no i'll have to
check the whole specs on what he can
actually program yes i'm so excited but
what you got coming up so next up we
have part two of Darren's interview with
stina she's so sweet I'm so sad I wasn't
here when she was here the last time you

hope you brought the proper type of
clothes for the weather in Geneva this
is Geneva in the mountains um yeah well
isn't it we're like James went for like
some kind of meeting at a big building
like with his own little propeller plane
and the propeller plane also this funny
of hills and all that kind of stuff so
it's a pretty scenic city as far as
everybody's okay when I imagine Geneva
which I've never been to and I probably
sound super stupid right now mirka yeah
I imagine like this strange place where
some kind of conference goes on in the
middle of nowhere in the middle of like
huge snowy mountains but that's probably
completely off like it's like some sort
of secret like a layer for eagle
henchmen
agency conventions like it's a blizzard
like the only way up is some sort of
like you have to tell you lift no you
have to take a plane to go there's not
even a ski lift okay all right nothing i
imagining of geneva so our technol us
photo of the week is from oh it's from a
bunch of people it's a series a whole
bunch of hack pack sticker pictures so
the first ones from james he sent a
photo of his laptop and pc wriggle
swagged out ye Hal sends us a pic of his
androids and the hack pack sticker and
then Johnathan sends a pic from his
favorite watering hole which is super
cool and Miguel sends a photo of his
throwing star land tap and his laptop
all ready to go and you can send your
own photos over to feedback at hak5 org
with the subject line techno last time
for the trivia what do we have shame you
trivia when did Skynet become self aware
that was the one from last week and the
answer was on August twenty-ninth 1997
wow I was I was 13 12 12 or 13 that year
97 no I was 12 because it was earlier
that I'm just thinking about what kind
of computers we had back then god jeez
wait if I was 13 we would have been
living in indiana so i would have had i
had the one with the switches on the
bottom you had to switch all the eternal
sure that was like an actual computer
not just the power strip that
essentially they made for the school's
computer favorite well when i was 12 i
had no clue what I was doing I remember
seeing a lot of those things it's like
yeah yeah they flip everything because
he had needed one for the Mars one floor
like the hard drive one for the flop he
wants a second floppy one for the
printer 14 and I was your light somebody
like solitaire because my dad taught me
how to play that and I was using his big
his bigger airplane rig to play fury 3
Yuri 3i game wow you play the old Star
Wars game no the TIE fighter with
admiral inman now I never played that
one long with us man so much fun 1997
good times oh by the way hold on I lost
control okay
I'm back in control he's back in control
but what is that thing um this is just a
logitech gear is it the TV 730 I've had
it for a little while um I kind of use
it on it's supposed to be like for the
google TV uh oh what is it bluetooth
yeah well no it uses their little
logitech proprietary RF thing all right
but what i've been using it for is like
connecting to my playstation but i've
also been using in the office here
essentially while i'm like setting up
all the cameras yeah i need to be able
to switch them and since I'm the only
switcher so you can switch back in five
set up the software so that whenever I
press a button I can walk around switch
and that's what I've been doing the day
so if the cuts are a little off I've
been like wanna watch us which button do
you press how do you know 1 through 3 1
through 3 okay so one is ok so that's my
thinking too is you and 3 is me okay so
three all right so the question of this
week is an emerging micro cooling
solution that operates similarly to
