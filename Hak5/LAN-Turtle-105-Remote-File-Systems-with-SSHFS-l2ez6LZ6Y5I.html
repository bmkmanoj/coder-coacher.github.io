basics and in today's lesson we're going
to start expanding on the land turtle
storage using a little thing called
sshfs and as you might imagine what that
means is we're going to mount a remote
filesystem over SSH
this of course building on the previous
session where we set up Auto SSH and
we're going to go ahead and dive right
in so on a my left I have a little
Windows machine that's directly
connected to the land turtle over USB
I'm connected to the turtle shell
through putty and on the right I'm
connected to a virtual private server
that I have up in the cloud and I can
see that I actually have a session with
it if I go ahead and do well I could do
it either way I can go to over modules
over here and you'll notice that I
should have a check mark I have a check
mark right next to Auto SSH letting me
know that that connection has been
established and likewise over here I can
do SSH
to route at local host on port 2 2 2 2
and now I'm on my land turtle fantastic
so let's go ahead and exit out of this
SSH session here and set up SSH FS down
here we'll find sshfs and we'll want to
configure this and we'll need to provide
it with a host a user a port and a path
so in this case the host is in fact our
server up here up in the cloud which if
I recall is this IP address we'll just
paste this here for reference and that
is 104 the port is 22 the user is turtle
and in this case the path is slash home
slash turtle
I'm going to go ahead and submit and I
want to start that so as to say HFS has
started so what does that actually mean
well if I LS this as I did before slash
home slash turtle you'll see there
aren't any files there right now let's
go ahead and exit the turtle shell
if I go over to slash sshfs and LS I'll
notice that there's nothing there as
well but if I create a new file by say
using echo hello world and I pipe that
into hello dot txt and now over here I
do the same thing I LS again I'll notice
that that hello dot txt is there and I
can likewise view that file so what
actually happened here is we have
mounted remotely the file system over on
in this case our virtual private server
in the cloud that's the home directory
for the turtle is now local to the
turtle as slash sshfs which means that
any program running on the land turtle
can treat that directory slash sshfs as
it would any other directory and then
store it instead of storing it locally
on the land turtle it's actually being
stored through that tunnel securely
through that tunnel on our virtual
private server and this is gonna come in
handy in just a bit as we build on this
in the next session but you can find as
well as me over at land turtlecom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
