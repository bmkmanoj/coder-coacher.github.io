crypt or one a cry Microsoft criticizes
government agencies a keylogger is found
on HP machines and Trump's new
cybersecurity measures all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for May 16 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon yet please do so we have
lots that we want to do for the show but
we can't do it without your support my
next goal is to add a monthly Q&amp;amp;A
exclusively just for our patrons and we
are going to upgrade our threat wire set
super looking forward to that
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support the show and the link
is down there in the show notes let's
talk about one a crypt also known as W
cry or wanna cry deci matrix on patreon
first link to the story way back last
week one a crypt is a new form of
ransomware that hit the news late last
week when it was first detected by Talos
Cisco's threat intelligence team at 9:00
a.m. on may 12 just like any other
ransomware this one encrypts your data
and then asked you to pay up in Bitcoin
and I will take a moment to praise the
sound reasoning behind having backups of
your files
remember kids it's three to one three
backups to different types of media and
then one off-site so for example I have
a local mass backup a hidden external
hard disk drive I don't know why I hide
it I don't really have anybody robbing
me or anything but whatever I hide it in
a spider oak cloud backup of data plus
the original files on my PC yes it might
be overkill but I have never lost a file
most folks don't do this so they end up
paying the ransom to get their files
back in the case of one occur if the
attacker asked for $300 in Bitcoin
within three days or it doubles up to
600 bucks after a week the files
supposedly get deleted it affects
Windows XP up through Windows Server
2012 but Windows 10 is not affected
according to Krebs on security as of May
13th one crypt had only made $26,000 in
Bitcoin for the attackers and that
number is increasing up to 59 thousand
when I
or does this episode the malware spreads
through the SMB file sharing protocol
which also means that if one infected PC
has access to other machines on a
network they too are at risk of being
infected since it uses SMB to spread
ports one three nine and four four five
would need to be open to the Internet
and the at-risk PC would be listening
for inbound connections if that machine
got infected while others on the network
were connected to it it could still
infect them if they are not updated the
vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft's
Patch Tuesday way back in March under
the name MS 1701 oh so users have two
months to patch their machines against
this problem until it actually happened
last week but as we all know lots of
critical infrastructure still runs on
old PCs take the UK's National Health
Service or European train stations or
Spain's telefónica or more they were
all hit almost immediately with other
countries following suit in the layer
hours as a Saturday a hundred and fifty
countries were hit along with two
hundred and thirty seven thousand
computers in the case of one occur if
the attacker used a randomly generated
web domain to make the malware continue
to propagate but once a security
researcher who goes by the Twitter name
malware tech registered the domain name
and the malware communicated with it it
just happened to stop the attack hence
it's called a kill switch and that's
what everybody in the media is calling
it no one knows why this kill switch
existed but future copies of one a crip
will most likely definitely not include
it so patching is a must
malware tech suspects it is for sandbox
testing of the malware before
distribution and the kill switch just
happened to be left in the code
unfortunately though over the weekend
other variances of one a cry or one a
crypt whatever you want to call it were
found either with different kill
switches or with no kill switch at all
if it was found though researchers are
registering the kill switch domain names
to think any other infections but over
the course of the next few days and
months we can expect to see a lot more
variances pop up and infect PCs and we
are already starting to see some new
variances so how did it first get into
those risky computers well nobody
actually knows for sure
at time of recording some suspect that
it could be a malware infested
attachment in an email but that hasn't
necessarily been confirmed so how do you
keep this from happening to you well if
you don't need SMB enable/disable it
using the steps on Microsoft's site turn
on automatic updates make sure to have
multiple backups of your files don't
click on suspicious links or files an
evil a firewall in use antivirus
although detection may not work out with
antivirus if they haven't updated and
make sure to block any open ports now
bleeping computers forum offers helpful
tutorials for ransomware including
removal steps and no more ransom project
has a tool available to find a free
Decrypter if one is available both of
these are linked below microsoft also
released an emergency patch for XP Vista
Windows 8 Server 2003 and 2008 machines
on the 13th even though those are not
supported anymore by Microsoft so good
on you guys Microsoft I never thought I
would say that if you do get infected
InfoSec researcher at hacker fantastic
on twitter recommends not paying up
because a human operator must activate
the decryption from @ or c 2 now if an
SMB vulnerability sounds familiar that
is because well it is familiar i
reported on this way last month in
regards to shadow brokers in their
leaked of the NSA tool called eternal
blue which was an exploit for SMB
version 2 1 a cry is based off of this
so on one hand yeah
patch your systems as soon as you can on
the other hand government agencies are
keeping these exploits secret these
tools get leaked and then ransomware is
found in the wild hitting critical
systems because they weren't updated
it's a never-ending cycle currently in
manhunt is happening in search of the
criminals who started the spread of the
malware by the Europol European
cybercrime centre researchers at
Kaspersky Lab suspect North Korean
actors due to one in cries variants
being very similar to code distributed
by Lazarus group which has ties to the
North Korean government Symantec also
found the instances but they would not
confirm or deny a tie to North Korea of
course it could have just been copied
from earlier code and not tied to a
state-sponsored group at all
all after all it did hit over a hundred
countries and all sorts of boxes got
popped
it seems timed to me not targeted
nevertheless so while one a cry is
similar to lots of ransomware that we
see all the time it's a tack vector has
been huge and it was very sudden no one
knows why it was suddenly popping boxes
on Friday nor who is behind it all we
can do right now is try to protect
ourselves by being offensive not
reactive after the fest WikiLeaks
unveiled yet another CIA hacking tool in
their never-ending list of docs for the
vault seven leaks on Friday they
introduced after midnight and assassin
both of which are CIA malware frameworks
for Windows operating systems both of
these work kind of the same the malware
monitors a target machine then reports
back any kind of details the attacker
once as well as allows for CIA access to
the target computer after midnight is a
persistent DLL that executes what they
call gremlins which i think is super
cute which are basically payloads that
are hidden on a target machine and can
do stuff like exfiltrate data allow an
attacker to run commands and provide
information on the target assassin works
similarly to this in an automated
fashion providing data collection and
allowing for performing tasks now while
the actual code and malware is not
included in the release of data there is
a user guide for both of these tools
which explain installation deployment
configuration commands in the user
interface data collection and a lot more
if confirmed this is more evidence of
the CIA withholding vulnerability
information from technology companies
which Microsoft criticized the
government agencies on in a blog posted
this week Microsoft explained that quote
this attack provides yet another example
of why the stockpiling of
vulnerabilities by government is such a
problem with CIA stockpiles of
vulnerabilities on WikiLeaks to the
NSA's tools stolen and used in the real
world they pose a real problem to
consumers government and companies and
the dangers should come as a wake-up
call to everyone a keylogger has been
found on over two dozen types of HP
laptops and tablets that has been in
circulation since late 2015
mah zero
switzerland-based security consulting
firm first reported on the keylogger on
thursday in an article published to
their site the key logger is found in
audio chip drivers by a company called
convent convent connaissance one of
those which comes default on lots of HP
devices the driver includes an
executable that logs key presses from
the keyboard and saves into a log file
on the C Drive it's completely
unencrypted - so pretty much anybody can
read it the log file is written over
every single time the computer reboots
but it would not be very hard for a
criminal to script some code that backs
them up the file includes everything
literally everything that you would type
in including passwords usernames bank
information private messages and so on
and so forth mod zero recommends
checking your C Drive for the executable
in deleting any pertinent info but so
far neither HP nor the company has
responded to the vulnerability lastly
real quick I did want to go over some
changes happening in the privacy Front
in Washington DC first off FBI director
James Comey was fired right in the
middle of his investigation into ties
between Trump's administration and
Russia Trump's reasoning for this
departure was due to a need for
regaining public trust in the FBI lots
of rumors are currently flying about
about the real reason for his departure
and I have my own judgments which I will
not share here while there is an interim
presiding over the FBI in the meantime
we can expect some major changes to come
from a new director and threat wire will
be watching during the same week two
runs signed an executive order to
strengthen u.s. cyber security by
protecting federal networks and critical
infrastructure along with implementing
the NIST framework and upgrading
antiquated systems thanks again to all
the fine people who contribute to
