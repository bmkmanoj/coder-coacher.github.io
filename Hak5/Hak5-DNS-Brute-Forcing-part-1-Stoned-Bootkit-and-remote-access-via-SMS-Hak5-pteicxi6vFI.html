part 1 the stone boot kit controlling
your computer via SMS with a little
google voice in Java code plus mini-itx
power supplies Pelican cases and
shannon's of penguin all that more this
time on hack five pack is not even this
episode of hak5 is brought to you by go
to assist express support smarter with
go to assist express domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com and Jackthreads hello
and welcome to hack five my name is
darren kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of technol us and we have a
fantastic show for you guys this week
Jason's going to be joining us a little
later on to talk about some SMS fun
stuff you can do with your computer and
Shannon's coming on to talk about the
stone boot kit which is well it's a boot
kit it's fun not really a 420 reference
I don't really know actually you want to
go references it's episode 8 08 so this
one goes out to you Roland in fact if
you're kind of into that scene check out
prono bozo calm in fact there's a
torrent yeah that's what's up so you
know techno music aside I figured let's
just go ahead and dive in its kind of a
heavy a block because as you remember
from last week we are now talking about
a little fun thing called DNS
brute-forcing and I realized as I was
putting together this segment that we
kind of need to lay a foundation here
because essentially what we're doing is
is this is a kind of a bigger arc as I
set up a whole bunch of virtual machines
on wall mounted server here to be our
targets to start demoing things like
numeration man-in-the-middle attacks
exploiting services stuff like that we
should probably talk about some
high-level networking stuff so that it
all kind of makes sense so I figured I'd
try something new and you guys are just
going to have to send me some feedback
and let me know how this goes for you
and if you enjoy this sort of thing
if that works out then then we might use
this some more but I figured hey it's
act 5 to my show I do it over a one
let's experiment give it a shot right so
let's go ahead and start talking about
DNS or the domain name system so that
next week when we start brute forcing it
we can have a better understanding of
why things are working the way they're
working and why it's important why is it
important I mean you got here right
you're either watching on like youtube
or revision3 or hak5 you're at the
website right and typed it into Google
you typed it into address bar somehow
you got from typing in some human
readable name like hak5 org to you know
an address on the internet a computer
that's just as well you know that this
computer is like I'm 66 at 11 22 27 to
124 you know but you're not going to
remember that you remember hak5 every
Wednesday because you get Tecna list so
the domain name system is what makes
that all pretty and happy for us it's
what allows us to remember those names
and not have to remember those numbers
computers just do it all for us but they
have to keep a record of what is what
and so let's just take a look so the
domain name system well let's take for
example and will write this backwards o
our G now it'd be hak5 dot and then www
so we've got www hak5 org well what is
this well actually there's a dot at the
end a little dot at the end is the root
it's not really important but we're just
going to leave it there and we've got
our first zone in this then this address
here that we remember org organization
this is our TLD or our top level domain
there's lots of these you've probably
seen comm net edu as well as a whole
bunch of other ones for different
countries like UK or dot d e4
Deutschland and that's just one of those
zones that would be the first zone here
the next one
would actually be hak5 and that's
actually our domain and then lastly ww
now that's actually our sub domain so
what that breaks down to is a series of
zones that when we put it into a web
browser it translates to an IP address
in our instance it is 66 dot11 about 227
dot 124 and living on that computer
there is an Apache web server that's
going to go ahead and load up your web
page that you asked for because it's WWE
world wide web service that is expecting
it to be there but it's not the only sub
domain at my domain hak5 org so let's
take a look at subdomains so we've
talked about your typical ww it might
also be for example sm t p dot org or
pop the hak5 org or IMAP hak5 dot org so
far these are all mail servers how about
IRC the hak5 dot org now each of these
subdomains indicates a different service
WWE world wide web service running on
your standard port 80 smtp would be
running on your standard port oops
that's backwards 25 pop would be 110 and
IMAP would be 143 IRC would be 66 69 as
well as others now each of these
subdomains may point to different
computers entirely in fact they might
all have different domain name records
so let's go ahead and break down domain
name records now ww is an a record or in
an address record and an a record
translates to an IP version 4 address
whereas a quadruple a would be an IP
version 6 address
we're not going to talk too much about
ip6 but suffice it to say those are both
just address records at points to say
hey there's an IP hear that that
translates to there's computer over
there go find your web service whatever
it may be so this ww1 that's an a record
our smtp at tenaya record with gonna
record you again a record here there's
also other records there are for example
an MX record it might be a that's a mail
exchanger and we might even have aliases
to other DNS names completely so for
example a cname is an alias and that's
actually what I are through that hack
five dot org is it doesn't even resolve
to an IP address it actually resolves to
a completely different domain name
whether that be you know
irc.freenode.net whatever it may be of
the IRC service of the month we also
have txt records or just txt now this is
a record I could be used to put
something human readable for example if
we had some clues or something at like
dark net dot hak5 org port 1337 and that
would be a txt now each of the
subdomains in this example would
indicate that they're all running a
specific service our smtp our pop or
imap for a male you know what there's no
reason why all of those couldn't just be
the single domain mail and responding to
port 25 110 and 143 and we could use a
tool like nmap to do the same thing and
scan male Dayak 5 org and see what ports
are open what it responds to in fact
there's no reason why we would even need
to go to WWI org we just go to hack 5
org take us to the same place if you go
and scan it you'll find that on port 80
there's Apache running a web service and
while you could scan hak5 that word for
all of the different ports here that are
listed you may
not necessarily know that the sub domain
darknet even exists and that's what
we're going to be doing a little bit
more next week as far as breaking that
down to find out what subdomains even
exist on a domain and how we can use
things like zone transfers and tools
like dig or if you want to go ahead and
do some homework now fierce and then of
course our old favorite and map which is
going to help us with these guys the
ports so I hope that lays somewhat of a
foundation of what this all means so
that next week we can have a lot of fun
with another fun record the NS record
which is our name server it's usually
come in pairs your master and slave and
that's why we're going to be having fun
with these tools right here to find out
what other services a domain might be
running so that we can then go ahead and
scan them for what what services like
for example like i said apache on port
80 we might have microsoft exchange for
male Dayak 50 or we might have the
hybrid 7 IRC service over at I receita
hak5 org so let me know what you guys
think if you're a network engineer and
this is boring you to tears or I've lost
over an important fact or if you're just
getting started and I'm moving too
quickly I don't know hit me up feedback
at hak5 org of course next week we're
going to dive into the practical have
fun with the tools on a virtual network
and yeah until then let's just go ahead
and kick it over to Shannon and find out
about this week's trivia last week's
trivia question was eight keeper is the
computer security software and what kind
of cliche and personal favorites hacker
movie of mine and the answer was the net
with Sandra Bullock yeah I love
that movie don't judge me if you want to
win some hak5 swag this week answer this
question over at hacked by org slash
trivia incorporated in california since
nineteen sixty eight the Silicon Valley
company is also known as
integrated electronics we'll be right
back up after a brief word with our
sponsor if you've got a creative idea or
want to start a new business I recommend
getting a domain name and web hosting
from domain com domain com has the main
you want fast easy and inexpensive with
free domain tools including URL and
email forwarding DNS management and
transfer lock their linux powered
hosting plans are dependable flexible
and affordable too with free setup and
no commitment required the deluxe
hosting offers unlimited bandwidth and
site builder pages at a mere 8 75 a
month they even make it dead simple to
get started with plenty of free software
like wordpress joomla drupal and more
all installed in just a few clicks and
as a hack five you or you get an extra
fifteen percent off your order when you
checkout with coupon code hak5 got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com so a little while ago
we did a segment on java and google
voice to get a little SMS action you
know to have that auto response well i'm
going to take it a step further day and
control your computer over SMS using
google voice let's check it out so it's
pretty simple all i'm going to do is
send the command calc because it's a
straight translation i have set up to my
SMS so it's now sitting in my inbox
sending a message and that all i'm going
to do is run the script here just hit
run some simple java and look at that
calculator pops right up let's take a
look at how what the code was to get
that going first of all you're going to
need a few things you're going to be the
JSON library and you're going to need
the google the java google voice api
which people have created an open source
on google code links in the show notes
so let's take a look at the exact code
here all you're doing is creating a new
voice object going ahead and passing
your username the password which is nice
and blurry right here and then this is
your unique key from while ago we talked
about you know unique key it could
literally be anything it's allowing the
google api to say hey this action came
from this so we could put you know SMS
hak5 program
anything you know it really doesn't
matter I'm gonna leave it blank for the
purposes and then you have this unique
key which you can get from the google
voice code itself so when you know right
click view source you can actually find
the rnr number which is this secret key
here it's just unique identifier that
allows the this bit of code to do some
screen scraping and login then what I'm
going to do is get voice get SMS which
all it's going to do is retrieve the
code from the SMS page of google voice
and then i'm doing a little bit of very
primitive scraping you can go in and
parse this until your heart's content I
actually stuck with a very
straightforward approach of just
grabbing the first message header so
this only works in the first message
header you gotta clear a lot of things
out but you know this is really just a
proof-of-concept you can really take
this a lot further and like I said I'm
just scraping this out and I got the
command calc and then i'm using the
common system interface which is java's
way of interacting with common systems
which kind of a self-explanatory what I
mean common systems I mean Lennox mac or
pc what you can do is execute commands
as if you were typing them into the
command line so like I rain calc on the
phone it popped up the calculator you
could do you know anything you want any
common command and you can even put
shell scripts in those interfaces or in
those systems and then run them it's
pretty straightforward it's like just
using a command prompt and it just
execute and that's pretty much it really
really straightforward great project to
get into with you know especially with
us doing garage door openers you could
definitely link these together so that
you could open your garage door via SMS
the sky is the limit you know what I'd
love to see what you guys come up with
so we mailed me Jason and hak5 or or
check out our show notes for anything
else you tuned in today show we all know
that most guys hate shopping for clothes
you gotta leave the house go to the
store and look all over the place to
find one or two things that are cool
luckily that era is over now that those
Jackthreads Jackthreads is a members
only online shopping club that does the
dirty work for you and Suzy you a
buttload of cash each day Jeff thread
serves up the hottest new indie brands
huge discount prices we're talking up to
eighty percent off what you pay in a
store and they've got amazing brands
like kidrobot the hundreds in american
apparel for way less than what you'd
find anywhere else now objector it's is
a private club but luckily hack fives
got the hook-up to get access to these
awesome deals just go over to jack
threads.com slash hak5 and you'll get to
skip the waitlist and become a member
right away oh and did we mention it's
free to join hit up jack threads.com
slash hak5 and you'll instantly start
saving up to eighty percent without
having to leave the house when it comes
to goodies that boot up with your
machine and do nefarious stuff we turn
to another under than Shannon Morse
what's up girl I'm lovely how are you
having fun in this totally snapped ninja
set here not hear what I hear speaking
of other things that aren't here you've
got some fun goodies for us yes I found
another boot kit but this one is called
stoned boot kit well man this is a
stolen oh yeah stone might sound kind of
similar mmm cuz it was named after a old
virus from 1987 alright so there's got
to be some heritage here what what is it
that draws the similarity why is this
different what's unique about this this
one attacks a bunch of different
operating systems it goes from windows
2000 all the way up to windows 7 plus it
can also attack truecrypt okay so what's
the special sauce okay so instead of
going into like the windows kernel like
a lot of stuff does it goes into your up
here yeah it goes into the little
itty-bitty piece called the Master Boot
Record and hence the 1987 virus the
stone virus said is named after be his
man Master Boot Record viruses we
haven't seen those in like ages yeah you
know people don't even look for this
kind of stuff now the Master Boot Record
for anybody that's not familiar is like
the first 512 bytes of your hard disk
that you know after your GPU and your
BIOS boot up that's what tells it how to
do with the rest of the machine it's
kind of very low level and typically
protected by your BIOS in those
circumstances now this was made by a guy
named Peter Kleiss naresh inul and he
first showed this off at Def Con I think
my year ago at blaka blaka
okay so I mean it's that black hat so
the first thing you got to remember is
this isn't for you know just running
around recreationally right this is
playing around on that no it's not in
fact this isn't really even a practical
segment as much as this is very academic
and we figured that we'd share this it's
a guy's a proof of concept exactly
because we asked it's a free stuff all
the time figured okay fine we'll share
some interesting stuff and what's
particularly sexy about this is since
it's loaded as part of the Master Boot
Record it can run silently and have
access to all of the memories so rather
than like as a windows program that only
has access to certain bits of memory in
some parts of memory that it just can't
touch this thing's got like full access
hmm yeah which means that you do have to
have administration privileges right
yeah you can't use a computer so to
install this you need windows admin
privileges in the first place so this
isn't even about popping a box no I'm
this with when you put this on a machine
every time the user restarts their
computer you know cuts it back on it's
already going to be installed since you
had those administration privileges so
you're not going to have to redo this
redo the install again and again again
just already there in the Master Boot
Record it's all just about maintaining
control of that box right yeah yeah I
love those concepts so who is this for
this is well you know it's not
recreational it's for your black hats
your law enforcement your IT
professionals people who want to get
really really down and dirty into this
because it's it's a framework exactly so
what could we do with the other than
attacking you know like okay sure we can
get some code to to run on a Windows
2000 to Windows 7 machine we're going to
hack truecrypt yes but what else makes
it unique and you mentioning framework
here it has plugins okay so like if I
wanted to make a plug-in that maybe does
keystroke logging right yeah right this
into that so it's not more of a vehicle
for you to take yeah it lets you start
it gives you the possibility to do
whatever you want with it man I wish
that I was leet enough to write some
some code yeah so if you're watching
this and you understand like anything
that we're talking about you're probably
been really in
I'm a good let me be we can get Jason to
right of these are resident programmer
get 80 back on here it's not some sexy
code yeah exactly but that is very cool
and again just enforcing the idea that
you know physical security all bets are
off we're not saying that this is gonna
pop a box but once you have there's
always something maintaining silent
control I love the idea that cuz this
has so been out of fashion so NBR's back
again who'd have thought yeah it's
really interesting and you can find so
much information about this peter has
put he's put on his presentation there's
a whole video of it there's a whole
paper that he did a research report on
you can read the entire paper you can do
check on the slideshow plugins yes
everything you would find them all of
this information over at stone Vienna
calm and he pretty much answers any
questions that you have right there on
that website wait so if this is your
forte you want to share some goodies
with us on that just go ahead and email
feedback at hak5 org we've got some
excellent stuff coming up a little later
in the program but first let's just go
ahead and take it take a nice little MBR
breather here we're gonna thank one of
our excellent sponsors and we'll see you
guys after the Rick
go to assist Express brought to you by
Citrix lets you easily resolve computer
issues in real time or after hours while
your customers are away from their
computers allowing you to be more
productive in fact on average go to
assist Express users report a forty
percent increase in productivity that's
like getting two extra work days back a
week hak5 viewers can try go to assist
express free for 30 days for this
special offer visit go to assist calm /
hak5 that's go to assist calm / hak5 for
a free trial that just about wraps up
this episode of hak5 and in just a
minute we're going to be checking out
your technol us photos maybe it's you
but first Shannon we got some more
feedback this week didn't we oh we might
we always get feedback and we've picked
some prime ones anyway we got awesome
feedback over at feedback at hak5 org
feedback feedback feedback we read them
all we don't reply to all of them but we
take some pic ones just for the show yes
we did cup selectively yeah we did
select a few for this episode and the
first one is I am really interested in
picking up a mini ITX board and building
a custom case so i can mail it in my
kitchen however I in his kitchen
interesting that's where we've got our
home router oh yeah that's true however
I am I'm having a hard time finding the
DC power connector that you guys use in
your episode most of the power supplies
I saw we're not external DC units do you
have any suggestions that's from Arthur
sure if you're not lucky enough to have
yourself like a prize or something like
that this is just a DC to dt z ATX power
supply these guys are great because they
provide all the 12 volts and all the 5
volts you would need they've even got a
PCI backplane so that you can just plug
a little DC jack into the back of your
PC it's got the regular you know ATX
connector to go into your motherboard
but this way you don't have a big
pumpkin power supply there's no fans
which I love but you've got to keep in
mind that this is only I think this
one's is 110 wat 150 watts so you're not
really going to find like a really BP
one that's not going to be for a gaming
rig from mini ITX I think it's the way
to go let's fans the better and a lot of
those mini ITX you can get completely
fanless it's the way to do it so thank
you for sending that in well our next
question is I am heading to
it's the East Coast in the next week or
so and I'm wondering if you have a hack
five house in New York or nearby that I
could visit or meetups planned or
anything where I could get a chance to
meet you guys and that's from Marshall
Marshall unfortunately we don't have a
hack five house on the east coast
anymore but we do go up there pretty
often Lisa I do best way to do it that
is to just follow us on Twitter and see
where we're at because as we go through
our travels web meetups all the time
yeah but sorry we're on the west coast
now yeah we're down to San Francisco I'm
in Missouri at the moment living back at
home until I can move out here to SF
myself but in the meantime I have done a
lot of traveling over to the east coast
so I've had a couple of little teeny
friend meetups and stuff but um yeah I
need to have like a tweetup yeah it's
all about just following us on the
Facebook and the Twitter and all that
don't only follow me on Twitter cuz i
always mention whenever I'm going out
there that way so just follow us and our
last question is darian which parent
Pelican case do you use for your laptop
it looks like it's the perfect size and
that's from Scott right this is the
Pelican case that I used on the back of
my motorcycle as I hacked across America
great way to keep your stuff secure
especially when it's got the pick and
pluck film so that you can just you know
carve out the perfect size for your you
know your theros Wi-Fi gear and your
laptop and all of your different goodies
I used the Pelican 1410 case Pelican has
some amazing cases highly recommend them
I know patrick norton does as well and
they're fun because you can just throw
on that stuff it's like an it's like one
of those nokia candybar phones you can
just throw it it's tough and it doesn't
break wow that's awesome yeah sounds
like fun yeah well you're throwing
electronics on throwing things oh we
could use a catapult oh oh I'm going
crazy yeah trubbish a will get pageant
involved this could be good have a
friend with it put some put some Pelican
cases to the test all right work will
put your iPad in it I need this for work
oh yeah there wasn't guys as we let you
know that you can follow us on Facebook
Twitter subscribe on youtube or itunes
to get your hack five episodes delivered
to automatically it's the free and easy
way to support the show or if you want
to you know support with your wallet you
can head over to hack 5 org slash store
where you can get yourself clothed in
technol s like this awesome
stickers yeah and Wi-Fi pineapple good
stuff over there hoodie and hat check it
out you could look as cool as me
actually no like that was yeah I I
object i think i look cooler that the
evil server shirt myself this is true
this is why you my opinion anyway we all
know who is a good-looking one here with
all that said we're uh we're reminding
you that I'm during kitchen and I have a
technol us photo for this week right
sorry I'm like I'm like I've embarrassed
myself so I'm just like trying to GTFO
what's her technicals okay well I didn't
want to forget about our good friend GSC
8 he made the sweet carp car amp plate
that says technol estan it nicer like
carved in it looks great it's cool
thanks for sending that by GSA you can
send your stuff by to trivia feedback at
hak5 org and oh just protect most in the
subject line and you'd think that I've
done 150 of these episodes right now I'm
toast yeah so with all that said I'm
during kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
remember to trust your tiny hole all
right we gotta dance cuz there's a big
tekzilla promo right now oh yeah all
right wow
check in with your feedback over at our
email boxes makinji we move their mics
just making sure that audio is good I'm
a little high I'm on left bringing
myself down just a bit shin and what you
got I'm a bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
