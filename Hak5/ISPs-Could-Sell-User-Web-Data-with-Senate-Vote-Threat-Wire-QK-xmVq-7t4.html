on Google's chopping block the Senate
votes to allow ISPs to cell web search
data WikiLeaks says the CIA targets
Apple devices and John Deere tractors
are being hacked all that coming up now
on threat wire hello everyone I am
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for March 28th 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom first off a special
thanks to our patrons for supporting the
show each and every month if you want
access to extras make sure to hit up
patreon.com slash threat wire for more
information so moving on to our first
story extended validation certificates
yeah they sound kind of weird they are
certificates that are used on HTTPS
websites that show the legal entity of
the website in a little header in the
address bar obtaining an extended
validation certificate has to go through
a certificate authority and for example
if you are using Chrome you would know
that it's legit if there's a little
green block icon it says secure or a
company name and it's labeled HTTPS
instead of HTTP now since January 19th
Symantec Corporation has been under
investigation by the google chrome team
for improperly validating at least
30,000 certificates over the course of
several years yeah not just 2016 or 2017
years this problem can allow attackers
to impersonate legitimate websites steal
user credentials and monitor
communications from the legitimate
servers due to the malpractice google
chrome doesn't have confidence in the
security of these Symantec certificates
so they are proposing a few steps first
off reducing the validity period for new
Symantec certificates from nine months
to less second slowly revalidating and
replacing all currently trusted Symantec
issued certificates and third removing
that extended validation status for the
certificates for no less than one year
basically chrome is putting Symantec in
timeout in downgrading their trusted
relationship they are breaking up very
very slowly
Symantec issues a good 30 percent or
more of
certificates on the web right now so
it's a pretty big chunk in a really big
problem for Symantec according to
Symantec though the post by Google is
misleading and exaggerated and the
actual number of misuse certificates was
only 127 that's a way big difference
from 30,000 both companies are in an
ongoing discussion to continue their
relationship but also assess possible
risk to web users in our biggest story
this week the United States Senate voted
to eliminate FCC privacy rules and by
doing so could allow ISPs to sell your
browsing history to advertisers in the
near future the Senate voted 50 all
Republican 248 all Democrat headed by
Republican Senator Jeff Flake
of Arizona to eliminate rules created by
the FCC which would block an ISP from
selling web browsing history to
advertisers without your consent or
permission since the vote is now going
to the US House of Representatives and
it's expected to pass there as well this
means that Comcast Verizon charter any
other ISP in the US could collect all
sorts of information about you including
sites that you frequent where you shop
online what dating sites you check what
banking sites you use if you're in the
market to buy a home and more and sell
it off for profit these regulations were
originally passed by the FCC last year
explicitly ruling that the ISPs would
need consumer consent to sell web
browsing data and they were to go into
effect on March 2nd now when the new
chairman agita was appointed he stayed
those privacy rules which we had
previously reported on the Senate used
something called a congressional review
Act or CRA for short which not only
voids the FCC rules but it also removes
their ability to make a rule just like
that are very similar in the future
which means if it passes we don't have
any protections since more and more
sites are switching to HTTPS your
traffic would still be encrypted but the
ISP would still know what domain you
have visited and they can most likely
guess certain data about you based on
the sites that you frequent private
information such as sexual orientation
political views where you bank again
could all be shared without your consent
along with this the e FF put together a
list of
isps could potentially do such as
hijacking and redirecting your search
queries to sites that pay them a fee
inserting additional ads based on your
traffic pre-installing phone software
that tracks your URL visits and
injecting traffic cookies into HTTP
traffic so with all this known how do
you keep your browsing history secure
and private then well since we have
discussed the pros and cons of each on
the previous episodes of threat wire
hack 5 and tech thing which are my other
two shows I am NOT going to get into a
debate here on the pros and cons of
these but basically consider learning
more about how to use VPNs how to choose
one downloading and using tor instead of
your current browser and using HTTPS
Everywhere if you do use your current
browser to help you browse an encrypted
protocol instead of just simply http
which is unencrypted and lastly call
your representatives if enough people
rally against the votes we could end it
when it gets to the house on March 23rd
2017 WikiLeaks published a new set of
documents pertaining to the CIA of
course in Apple devices dubbing the
leaked dark matter according to the
documents the CIA's embedded development
branch EDB for short created malware
that could infect Apple's Macs and
iPhones firmware some tools they use
include the sonic screwdriver obvious
Doctor Who reference which would embed
malicious code onto a thunderbolt to
Ethernet adapter and would work even if
there is a firmware password in the
devices just booting up dark sea skies
is an EFI firmware malware that works on
a MacBook Air and another dubbed Triton
is malware used on Mac OS 10 all of
these tools are from several years ago
some are from 2008 all the way up to
2013 now according to Apple the iPhone
vulnerabilities were fixed back in 2009
in the Mac vulnerability in 2013 sonic
screwdrivers specifically was patched in
2015 but if you are still worried about
the CIA hacking your iPhone or your Mac
make sure that it is updated to the
current operating system use very strong
passwords or pass codes and lock your
devices and never ever ever even if
you're a Starbucks and you need to go to
the bathroom or something leave your
device in a place where somebody could
access to it that's the most important
part lastly for today is a quick
headline from patreon desi matrix over
on patreon.com slash threat wire
according to an article on motherboard
farmers have been using european cracked
firmware that's traded on invite-only
forums to hack their John Deere tractors
due to manufacturing rules that do not
allow for unauthorized repairs farmers
fear that tractors would break down and
threaten their livelihood because they
kind of need them to work so in many
cases it's faster to fix a problem
themselves especially when it requires a
firmware update or change instead they
would have to wait for somebody to come
and fix it for them which could take a
very long time due to a licensing
agreement between John Deere and farmers
only licensed and authorized repair
shops or technicians can update or
change firmware and since they charge
hundreds of dollars for the service
technicians are using black-market
firmware instead since the librarian of
Congress approved exemptions to the DMCA
for land vehicles including tractors
like John Deere in 2015 this is not
necessarily illegal but since farmers
have to sign a licensing agreement with
the company John Deere could sue for
violations but it wouldn't be a federal
crime right to repair advocates want
John Deere to open up software for any
technicians obviously but John Deere
stands by their contract saying that
software modifications are an increased
risk to equipment as well as users
