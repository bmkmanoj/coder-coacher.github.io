Merritt heading into downtown Oakland
one of our first days of the new office
check it out so I'm gonna penny which I
wouldn't say is exactly my favorite in
terms of the commuter board but it is
super light and small I just wish it had
a little bit more stopping power
supposedly when that one back there
completed it's gonna be the tallest
building in Oakland I don't know maybe I
should get like a lawnmower or something
it's not really my speed though
especially look yeah yeah Shannon's
gonna murder me cuz I haven't gotten to
archives out I'm a little late but I was
sick so I can't I can't we found a good
copy
the sweet aroma of a Roma cafe again
physical shot oh that's right what's the
capital of djibouti djibouti doves
oh yes DJ I know that's where they make
the drones oh really
yeah yeah they make all those drones in
Djibouti yeah they're just flying out of
Djibouti we just I'm gonna make a play
for prime minister of Djibouti 2020
nothing that you know what the capital
is I'm gonna be like my people I know
where the capital is right
what what Chanin say yeah well we'll
figure it out so these are the lights
and this is the grid by the way this is
the new studio welcome that look good
there's a Pew or Perrin and there's a
studio and this is the giant rack and
then the edit rig and now everything is
a mess
but I mean what else is new so today
we're gonna put together the lighting
this place is gonna get lit all right
come on come on that was good that was
that was pretty bad
right but then you've got a little bit
of shadow on your left side now you got
your key and fill like before except
that edge light above you it's giving
you a nice little glow all around here
so you kind of pop out from the
background so next step it's good some
background lights
Edge's doing a little halo and it's
purple yeah that's something
all right so we got basically everything
and I Anna and Patrick can come in on
Monday morning and just boom you're
holding it wrong man oh there you go

microphone positioning how you can
directly go Michael and improve the
quality of your audio Sarah so
