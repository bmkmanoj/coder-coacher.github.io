d'amours from hack five again coming to
you from CES 2012 and I have found one
of my favorite companies in the world
MakerBot yeah so what's up Bri how's it
going thank you for joining me
hey great to have you over here oh we
got some cool stuff to show you
yeah so I heard you have a brand new
robot program over here this little guy
but first tell me what is MakerBot cuz a
lot of people haven't heard of you guys
yet so what is it okay let me break it
on down my MakerBot ism is a machine
that can make you anything you need so
if you need if you break something you
can fix it by making a replacement on
your MakerBot or you can make toys never
buy another Christmas present or
birthday present again and give it you
know give it to your kids and they'll be
able to have better jobs in the future
because they'll have the the the tools
of tomorrow okay so next time my
boyfriend or my birthday is coming up my
boyfriend just has to buy me like he
just has to get me one of these guys and
I can make my own necklace instead of
having him buy me a new one from the
jewelry store yes exactly and this is
the machine to do it it's we've got
we're just so excited cuz this machine
has three things that are awesome it can
make giant things like this companion
cube which is like you can make things
the size of a loaf of bread with this
machine this is square so it's a little
shorter than a loaf of bread what are
the full dimensions of it that it can
make it's nine by six by six it's about
nine by six by six inches so boom and
then the other big thing is you can make
things in color so we've got you can
make things with two colors and then the
other big deal for us is up until now
when you're gonna make her Bhat you have
to put it together no more now you when
you're gonna make her Bhat it comes to
you with just little minimal assembly
you pop on the extruder it snaps on and
bam you're ready to start printing I
don't have to make my MakerBot I just it
just comes out of the box and it's ready
to go
yeah and for us this is kind of a big
step for us because our community has
been really focused on the DIY
you know kind of Heathkit style
community and now we're breaking out
we've got a consumer device that you
know your grandma can get and and know
and actually be able to use so how easy
is it for me to build say I want to do
like a unicorn model is are there
downloadable models that I can use so
you go to Thingiverse comm which is
where our community shares their digital
designs and you search unicorn and I
think there's a couple unicorns on
Thingiverse there might be another kind
of a corn as well but and then you just
cooked it you click on the file name you
download it you load it into our
software replicator G and you press Co
and the Machine leaps into life and
starts and starts drawing a picture and
plastic and lifts up and draws another
one and layer by layer it'll build up
your unicorn for you now how much do
like the applications and the software
cost well all free
we're open-source we're in fact all the
designs for the machine are available as
well so if you're the kind of person who
likes hacking or improving things you
just do it give it back to the community
and everybody benefits is exactly what
our audience loves and strives and needs
they love things that are do-it-yourself
hacking and modding and even like the
models that's perfect I'm gonna give
this back to you so are these recyclable
or anything like that so ABS is
recyclable and PLA which is what this is
made of is actually biodegradable so I
would never put this I would never put
this in a compost pile because I it's my
companion cube but if you if you for
some reason hated your companion cube
and wanted to put it you could put it in
the compost pile and it would eventually
become plant food well hopefully nobody
does that to this one because okay I'll
leave it with you you can keep it
now one less question how much does it
cost and what is it coming out so we
launched on Monday so we took started
taking orders on Monday we've got about
we said six weekly time we're gonna try
and beat that and
17:49 for the single extruder kit so if
you're just going to put in one color
you can get that if you want printing to
colors it's $19.99 for the dual
extrusion model so for under two
thousand bucks I can get my own MakerBot
do it get it today
you know the apocalypse is coming you
got to be ready that's true it is 2012
and I'm coming to you from CES 2012 you
can find all of our revision3 coverage
including the MakerBot over at
revision3.com slash CES hey where can
