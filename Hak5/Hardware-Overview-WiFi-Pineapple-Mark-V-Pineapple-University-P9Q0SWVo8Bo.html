by hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at H ake a shop comm
hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and in
this video series we're going to show
you the concepts to effectively use your
Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5
everything from unboxing it for the very
first time to capturing packets and
advanced network auditing but before we
even begin us all of us here at hack 5
we want to thank you for supporting us
for supporting the Wi-Fi pineapple I
want to personally welcome you to this
community because this project has been
evolving since 2008 and hundreds of
people around the world have all come
together to really help make this a
simple affordable and super versatile
platform so from all of us here at hack
5 and the azúcar team thank you now
let's go ahead and get started and open
the box now as you can see this right
here is the unit that we are so super
proud of it is very exciting to be doing
our first bit of you know custom
hardware here so let's just pop this guy
open maybe appreciate a little bit of
that action and see first thing you'll
notice is your full-color manual with
all sorts of information here on how to
get set up and started as well as our
decals I personally love the stickers
but you could always leave it blank if
you'd like as well as it's very
important for more flashing card and
stay tuned for another video on the
firmware here in just a bit moving on we
have our main unit here I'm just going
to slip that guy out and so this is the
pineapple and let's go ahead and see
around the edges here we have what we
should be very familiar with a 10100
Ethernet USB 2 port a very versatile
power as well as an expansion slot here
I'm going to go ahead and open this
little hatch and this just pops right
off there to reveal underneath we have
some pins we'll get into that in a bit
when we talk about hardware expansion we
have dip switches here for boot modes an
SMA connector for our first radio we
have a user accessible serial TTL and
that's a little
you are there as well as the SMA
connector for our second radio the micro
SD card slot and finally our LED
indicators across the top going on
inside of the box we will also find our
power cable this right here is for us as
well as we have the adapters here for
different locales so go ahead and use
them one appropriate for your location
and finally we have cat5 cable will e
thir net as well as our antennas so just
to talk about real briefly the radios we
put two very powerful radios infamous
radios in fact within the hacking
community inside of here we actually
have the atheros AR 9330 one running our
radio zero or W LAN zero and that serves
as our access point it's a very high
gain very versatile unlocked radio as
well as an unlocked Realtek RTL eighty
187 as radio one or W LAN one and that's
useful for connecting to other access
points in client mode in a sniffing
traffic in monitor mode or for you know
advanced attacks using raw frame
injection now about these antennas these
right here are SMA antennas they're not
our PSMA which you may be used to these
are actually very high gain these are
actually only six DVI but they
outperform the nine DB is on the mark
mark for the previous generation
there's no pigtail here there's a really
nice solid connection right onto the
board I mention this because if you
notice when you go ahead to screw this
on you'll see that it is in fact the
antenna that has the pin inside of it
and not the connector so I'll go ahead
and get that guy screwed on if you have
existing antennas like for instance if
you have say one from a previous
pineapple or other consumer Wi-Fi gear I
just point this out because since we
went with the professional SMA antennas
you will need to if you would like to
use those antennas
need to use a small adapter these are
real simple they just screw right in to
your antenna of choice and then right
into the pineapple I just mentioned that
so that you know if you need additional
antennas or adapters hack shop and a
simple way to kind of keep in mind which
one is which here is that your AR for AR
ninety three thirty one is on the right
and your RTL eighty one eighty seven is
on the left alright
now a quick word on power we spent a lot
of time ensuring that we have a highly
robust power supply in here and it
actually accepts anywhere between five
volts and 12 volts which can be really
convenient of course the included power
supply provides nine something a little
bit in the middle the DC barrel here is
a two point one millimeter internal
diameter and a five and a half
millimeter external diameter it is
Center positive and we of course have
our pineapple juice battery packs
offering you know battery life runtime
in the way of well between twelve hours
and seventy four so you could actually
deploy your pineapple and manage it
remotely for a day for multiple days
which is really convenient and also for
convenience we have the USB to DC plug
and this is great for if se you want to
plug your pineapple into your laptop a
lot of laptops nowadays have USB 3 which
is able to provide up to 900 milliamps
of power there's also a lot of battery
packs on the market that will say if it
says it will charge an iPad that means
that it is a capable of supplying 2 amps
of power and that will go ahead and
power your pineapple the only thing that
I'll mention here as far as USB power is
that keep in mind that while most of the
times it will be sufficient for just
your pineapple if you start plugging
into its USB 2 port very power-hungry
devices you could run into stability
issues so this is why we absolutely
recommend using something like a 12 volt
pack ok now boot modes these are huge
and very excited about this these
switches over here on the right side of
the device
these 5s dip switches here allow you to
customize what the pineapple does
without having to login to the web
interface so from left to right we have
switches one through five switch number
one and switch number five so the very
leftmost in the very rightmost our
actually reserved for system functions
the three in the middle are absolutely
configurable by you now the microSD slot
here allows you to upgrade the memory on
the pineapple which is fantastic we
actually provide a two gigabyte micro SD
card here with the firmware files
pre-installed we're actually going to
get into flashing the firmware in the
next video and if you'd like you can
actually upgrade your SD card all the
way up to 32 gigabytes after you've done
that first boot flashing procedure we
support EXT as well as FAT FAT may be
convenient for Windows users as you
don't have to have any additional
software to be able to read it on a
Windows box as well as you have the
option to format right from the web UI
which also partitions the drive so you
have swap space which is great for
running more concurrent applications
most importantly though I point out that
this micro SD card slot is essential you
have to have a micro SD card in here to
be able to boot now the expansion Bay I
guess all I'm going to say here in this
first video is don't touch it for right
now it is highly sensitive I mean even a
inexpensive multimeter could potentially
short things out don't start hooking up
LEDs to it to find out we actually have
a hardware development kit in the works
right now so please wait for the hdk
which will allow us to you know develop
some really cool upgrades that we're
calling pineapple slices to add features
like bluetooth gps accelerometers
displays other fun stuff like that and
finally we have our serial TTL this is a
user-accessible UART so you don't
actually have to open the device to get
access to the console from left to right
here we have ground rx TX and 3.3 volt
now I want to mention here please do not
use that 3.3 volt we're actually going
to get into accessing the console from
serial in a later video but I just want
to point out that you don't want to plug
into the 3.3 volt just a fair warning
okay so that's the Wi-Fi pineapple mark
5 unboxing
that's the hardware setup in the next
video we're going to go ahead and load
the firmware and complete the setup on
our computer and I highly encourage you
all right now to go ahead and get
involved in the Wi-Fi pineapple
community so your homework assignment
today is to head over to uni dot Wi-Fi
pineapple comm to find more videos and
lessons and exercises as well as of
course the Wi-Fi pineapple forums and
chat I will see you there
