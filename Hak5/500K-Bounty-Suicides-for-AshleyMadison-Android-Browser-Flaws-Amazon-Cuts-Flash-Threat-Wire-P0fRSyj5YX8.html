dressed for cyber crimes amazon cuts
flash and Android browsers are
compromised all that coming up now on
threat wire good Monday morning
everybody I'm Patrick Norton this is a
threat wire for August twenty four
twenty fifteen your summary are the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom speaking of privacy it
is an ugly ugly week for Ashley Madison
and its users the hacking group impact
team as promised on the 30-day deadline
dropped a bomb last week on a fair
facilitator ashleymadison.com its owners
avid life media and of course it's tens
of millions of customers it started last
Tuesday when the first ten gigabytes of
emails and user account information were
dumped online along with a message for
avid life media CEO Noel Biderman hey
Noel you can admit it's real now oh yeah
because another 32 gigabytes of data got
dropped on Thursday that data was
quickly converted into searchable
databases online and while some
reporters argue that you couldn't
necessarily prove that the data was
accurate a lot of people who apparently
were on the affair site confirmed the
tenant looked pretty accurate Gawker out
a television star and professional
hypocrite Josh Duggar for using the site
and the US military began looking for
military addresses as adultery is a
punishable crime under military code and
soon after pretty much on the heels of
the data release extortionist started
working the data mining asking of course
for payments in Bitcoin Krebs on
security has a really good read on how
at least one of the extortionists work
and then this morning Monday several
days later security week reports that
two suicides in Toronto may be linked to
the hacking that news came at a Toronto
police press conference at that same
event Krebs on security reports Toronto
police staff superintendent price Evans
appealed to the public and white hat
hackers and announced that Ashley
Madison is offering a quote $500,000
reward for information leading to the
arrest and prosecution of the individual
or group of people responsible for
leaking highly personal information on
the company's more than 30 million users
the code name for the investigation
project unicorn superintendent Evans
notes that quote the ripple effect of
the impact teams actions
has and will continue to have a
long-term social and economic impacts
and they have already sparked spin-offs
of crimes and further victimization no
kidding by the way maybe an Ashley
Madison and actually deleted the data
they were charging money for none of
this would have happened hmm security
it's important people and somewhat
lighter news digiday says that Amazon as
of September will no longer accept flash
ads on amazon.com or on Amazon
advertising platform which lets
advertisers target amazon shoppers on
amazon sites and across the web and
quote not a big surprise because back in
july yahoo was hit with a major malvert
izing attack that used flash to attack
yahoo users ugly ugly summer for adobe
flash 15,000 arrests were made in china
last week reports reuters for crimes
that jeopardized internet security well
security is a phrase that has different
meanings to different nations this is
part of a six-month program code-named
cleaning the internet not much of a
sense of humor unlike Toronto Reuters
was told the investigation targeted
websites providing quote illegal and
harmful information besides
advertisements for pornography
explosives and firearms and gambling
it's an odd combination in total the
police said they investigated 66,000
websites look it's really obvious
China's lockdown on the Internet is
getting tighter and there were no
mention of arrests on the US OPM hacking
case made during the announcement what a
shock threat post says the surgeon
neutrino exploit kit traffic last week
was due to a quote rash of compromise
WordPress websites zscaler quote spotted
attacks against sites running older
versions of the content management
system for dot 2 and earlier the back
doored sites were used to insert crypto
wall 3.0 ransomware ow keep WordPress
updated or hosted somewhere that does it
for you hey while we're talking about
website security problems security week
says Drupal has an update that addresses
quote several security issues with the
release of version 7 dot 3 9 and six at
37 we got a link to both those stories
in the show notes meanwhile SC magazine
says zero-day flaw was found in dolphin
and Mercury Android browsers could allow
hackers to perform remote code execution
that's according to security researchers
and the SC magazine notes those two
browsers have over one
hundred million downloads between them
hopefully a patch is offered quickly
while we're talking about patches ever
wonder what Microsoft's doing with that
Windows 10 update beyond improvements to
enhance the functionality of Windows 10
well the register wanted to know poked
ms with a sharp stick and eventually
Microsoft responded quote as we have
done in the past we post kb articles
relevant to most updates which will
deliver with windows is a service
depending on the significance of the
update and if it is bringing new
functionality to Windows customers we
may choose to do additional promotion of
new features as we display them and
quote which to me sounds a lot like will
