by Squarespace Bex and dead space only
the dead survive
hey everybody welcome to this week's
episode of hack 5 I'm Matt less stock
and grown Christian and it's time for
your weekly dose of techno lust dude res
now Darren obviously as you can see has
had way too much candy from the 30 pound
basket of candy that now resides in our
hallway
I'm totally picking at it I am gone for
in Miami for a week come home and there
is a wall
okay just and then there was all these
cobwebs became 30 pounds full of candy
in my hallway where high res and we're
high res okay you've got ten seconds Oh
better I'm totally good with that
whatever so this as I've said we're high
res we are I res a lot quicker than we
we had anticipated going you know HD
it's it's high res we're we're making an
assumption that we will be HD but if
we're not at least it's high res SD yeah
yeah it's probably like the most
beautiful st you've ever seen so for
1080i
everything's HDMI now no no we're that
composite stuff everything arts are
beautiful and and we'll show you the
pictures of the console and the
beautiful new setup and it's all thanks
to you guys and I'm totally stoked like
we're gonna have to like scroll the
credits with like oh dude dude everybody
you got I didn't get it I can tell so
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this one over
okay cool we want to thank everybody who
went ahead and made this possible by
going to hack five dot org slash
stickers everybody who has purchased a
sticker donated you know every kind word
that we got saying we can't wait for you
guys to go HD so here's a couple bucks
this is all brought to you by you yeah
okay we basically had a plan to go HD
first of the new year
well I mean our original plan involved a
$11,000
mixing board by edirol and after talking
to the dave randolph the guy that
engineered the revision3 studios totally
helped us put together a HD on the
hacker level we're talking it's not
ghetto fabulous or anything we're still
talking to a couple of grand here but
it's way more like packed together the
way I like we're still this is still
like hack 5 and HD beta there's one
we're learning the new production
process right and another thing is we're
borrowing Paul's Mac Pro which is not
completely pimped Mac Pros can get super
pimped turns out yep this one's only
like 2 gigs to the pimp Ness and it only
needs a little like 8 gigs to the pimp
he's like mini PIP yeah he needs to
become big chime ginormous why lend us
is macro forever so we're probably going
to eventually have to
Mack pro bono we're on our way there and
in the meantime enjoy the high res and
cheers to you guys cheers to you guys
catch ink you got one right there there
we go yeah all right so what's going on
man
um I just got back from Miami I was
working my ass off literally lost a
couple pounds no who's down there for
work I had a good time just worked just
incredibly too much but I'm back now so
I'm really excited to be back in the
groove you guys just got back from
daikon yeah yeah I'm going to talk about
that at the end of show totally had a
lot of fun went down there with Paul met
a bunch of great people it was a fun con
and and now it's good to be back in the
studio and playing some video games yeah
we've got warsaw war so going out in the
background you guys asked us for an
open-source game something that you did
not have to you know have a Windows
machine for or anything like that
so we went ahead and did we went ahead
and set up a war so server war so is an
open-source game that you can download
for Linux Windows and Mac and I if
you've ever played the game 13 the
graphics are quite similar but a bunch
of people having fun in the server don't
know what's going on with it
Darren's back and they're talking oh
we're up dude I'm oh that's what it was
we were winter ready up yeah ready up
there we go all right so what do we got
for today's show Darren sweet so we're
gonna be talking about DOSBox crisps
Girling is down here we're going to be
doing some some more packet sniffing
we're actually going into the structure
of a packet I believe using some toys as
props that's gonna be fun
okay and then of course next week
getting our hands dirty actually doing
some analysis of the packets and showing
you how to create custom filters and
stuff in and Wireshark a lot of fun
Thanks and we got two answers to all
your questions and a whole bunch of
other fun we hack 5 stuff coming up
later on yeah for rehab 5 those of you
that don't know basically take in your
comments and answering them questions
and all that stuff and be like oh wow we
have fans and we should reply to them
who know exactly and kick it over to the
girl that's constantly reminding us that
we need to pay attention to you guys
it's Shannon Morse the community
development wizard what's going on
DOSBox girl yeah that'd be me I wanted
to tell you guys about this program
called DOSBox
it's basically this software that
emulates an IBM PC compatible computer
running ms-dos it's pretty much intended
for games although there are a couple of
other things you can do with this
program but I'm not gonna tell you about
those today you can run this on Windows
you can run it on Mac on Linux you can
even run it on your PSP or your palm
your palm sentro so it's a really good
software program if you want to play all
those old-school games that you can't
play on your computer these days because
your computer is a little bit too fast
for it one of the really cool things
about this is that it simulates modems
and IP x networks so you can play all
those multiplayer games that you really
really miss like Duke Nukem 3d and do
back here I have rise of the Triad so
another nice thing about DOSBox is that
you can capture screenshots and video
footage with just a couple of clicks so
over here with Monkey Island
I created this photo a little while back
of an image from Monkey Island so I can
create my own little tutorial online for
all my friends that need tutorials I
don't use those I never use those anyway
if you want to check out DOSBox go to
DOSBox comm I definitely suggest
checking out their forums as well as the
wiki article there's tons of really good
games listed there that you can you can
check out for yourself see if you like
it so speaking about in Duke Nukem 3d
and all the old school I wanted to tell
you guys our trivia for this week in
Duke Nukem 3d what movie is playing at
the million dollar theater in the first
level of la meltdown if you're the first
one to get this right answer it in one
of the forums of your choice either
revision 3 or the hack 5 forums and if
you're the first one to get it right
well we'll send you some hack 5 swag
instead of just sending you some
stickers like we usually do we're also
going to include a pruna bozo CD this is
zero equals one equals everything if
you've heard of it I think you have we'd
also like to thank our sponsor Beck
Speer very very much for sponsoring us
as you know already Beck's beer is the
number one german export beer so pick up
your Becks right now and look at that
key on the front of it see that iconic
graphic it's from the coat of arms of
Bremen Germany which is the founding
city where Beck's beer came from and
while you're enjoying your Beck's beer
check out Beck's Key Club it's for all
the loyal drinkers of X and it's open to
any of you guys they have special events
free gear and exclusive content so sign
up at Beck's Key Club calm and unlock
the possibilities last but not least I
wanted to show you guys this really
great wallpaper it's by Razer 512 and if
you guys have any cool wallpapers that
you want to share with us and you'd like
to get up on the show send them over to
our forum and put them in the community
images we just started this and we think
it's a really great idea so check it out
and now we're going to take a break
so Chris last time you're down here
we're talking about some packet sniffing
he gave us a high-level overview of kind
of you know the terms terminology of the
tools and why we would want to do this
so now you're back let's do some some
getting into the package structure
because we just glossed over that last
time okay we're gonna kind of go into
the
Wireshark here and actually bring it up
and show you how to capture a you know
some packets and that's them there and
in dissect them okay so Wireshark of
course awesome Network analyzer tool yep
so let's go ahead and fire it up so we
have I have this just a default screen
right here and we're just gonna I'm not
gonna go in all these little menu
options for now we're just gonna go to
capture it interfaces so this is where
you can select all the interfaces you
have you can see that there are right
here there's packets coming across this
okay so there's our actual Ethernet card
mm-hmm yes it's just the microsites the
same Microsoft has a share driver okay
so if I hit start and I pull up let me
pull up Internet Explorer browser and
I'll go to hak5 don't know
IE really well okay to make it simple
you know whatever I didn't feel like
waiting for I hear you know Fox and I
don't have chrome on this laptop yet all
right so Wireshark we pulled it up and
now I'm gonna stop it there put this
little button up here so we don't get
any more packets and you can just kind
of scroll around here and you can see
we're gonna go up here to this get
request this is when we I actually so
let let's it's a Wireshark it's an open
source application it's cross-platform
you can get it on Windows Mac Linux you
can use it to see what's going across
the wire we just did it to capture the
the the traffic when we went to the when
you pulled up Internet Explorer one tag
five dot org and now we can actually see
everything that goes on to actually make
that connection happen and we're gonna
take a look at one of those packets and
and take a look and dissect that so that
we have a deep understanding of how that
packet is formed because I know last
time we totally glossed over this and
once we have that understanding you tell
me next time
on on part two next three part 3 sorry
part three next week we're actually
going to be doing some made advanced
stuff with Wireshark you have some
custom filters and stuff like that yep
alright so let's pull up our package I
think you already have one from so I
just wanted to demonstrate you know
opening it so let me open this guy up
here and here is our if I can scroll up
and so here is our Internet Protocol
right here in Wireshark and so this is
an individual packet we've already taken
a look last time at the frames that put
that together and we're not gonna worry
about the the layer one to stuff right
now we're just gonna focus on internet
protocol TCP because that's where the
meat is stuff UCP IP
sure so so we have what do we have here
well we've got some bricks here what
kind of help is that explain this
because there are several different
layers to putting together our packets
okay
let's go ahead and start with Internet
Protocol so what is the first piece of
the puzzle for a nightly header okay
putting together the IP this this guy
right here is the version this is this
is what tells you whether it's ipv4 or
ipv6 it's public is gonna be for in our
case most of the time is gonna be for
all right what's next after the version
we have header length and this tells you
how long this IP header is actually
going to be it's usually 20 bytes okay
and it's more or less than we know that
something went wrong
that's retransmitted let's fix it
somehow exactly after that you have type
that has its like type type of service
and that mostly deals with network
congestion ecn stuff like that okay
really get to in the weeds with that all
right what's next
after that we have total length that's
the entire length of the packet so the
header the packet header data other data
everything great
alright and again that's just more
overhead making sure that when we you
know get this packet and assemble it
together that that everything matches up
mm-hmm
alright identification this is just a
it's just part of this part of the
sequence numbers everything that's you
know identifies a packet not that I'm
saying it's not that interesting after
that we have flags flag this is for the
IP header this is your fragmentation
flag don't
fragment I think there's a third now why
would we fry them that why would we not
we fragment and I'm gonna actually set
this here okay all right
we fragment uh when we know that the
packets going to be larger than the
maximum transmission transmission unit
which is typically fifteen hundred well
fourteen sixty plus overhead okay so and
that if your packets and be large in
that then you want to fragment it so
that you can put it because there's no
big like hack five episode 408 packet
it's gotta be probably kind of cool bag
the Jumbo hack five packet and you tell
me something about jumbo from what will
get that's a whole nother decision so
that would actually just gonna jump to
you but okay so we if bigger than
fifteen hundred degree like you said
fourteen fourteen sixty is the norm this
is a de normal share home just person
just leave some leeway for some overhead
okay
after those we have the fragmentation
offset which price right if we do
fragment we need to know at what point
do we offset those exactly where do we
make our slices if it's large pizza is
that 16 slices is that and I'm slice 7
of 16 gotcha alright what's next
tt Oh time to live like to be able times
I mean I know but a lot of people may
not be familiar time to live time to
live is how long you have to live after
you watch this segment I'm just kidding
it's not a threat no threat please don't
arrest me so time to live is is how many
hops that packets gonna go and hop is uh
when the packet goes from nice to you
this that's okay so like when I order my
backs from the the bar mermaid right I
have to order that you have to ask my
waitress the waitress needs to talk to
the barmaid the markets it from the
cooler yep
that's that's three hops right there
that's three hops okay so ops there we
go three hops with hot you can't get
that kind of advertising anywhere else
yeah so so what kind of premium by the
way so the time to live is is that how
many hops or is that in a specific
actual amount of physical time it's hops
so it's not an actual it's not a time
it's like thirty seconds if I was trying
to get the beer from the bar made from
the cooler through the waitress and my
time to live was to probably would stay
thirsty for the rest of the night right
yeah you wouldn't be drinking any Becks
okay but what's a typical time to live
on the Internet
on the operating system i mean i i've
seen 128 I think is one I think that's
the max sometime to live for a lot of
different things youth between UNIX and
Linux and Windows and and and everything
there's different ones that help you in
what depending on what that is you can
identify the OS because well unless you
obfuscate it that's a fun that's a story
I remember with with generically 95 I
think it was 95 I actually didn't have a
long enough TTL that when a lot of
people were getting online they were
getting you know router router router
router trying to get to their
destination and then dropped because the
in the registry was anyway it's just in
were dressing alright so after well
after our tto we have our protocol and
that's gonna tell you whether it's TCP
gtp there's a million protocols we're
gonna focus on CCP TCP after after the
protocol we have our header checksum
it's just a CRC error check it just you
know helps make the we're gonna hash the
whole thing and say it should equal this
and if it doesn't yep talk to us because
if it doesn't then you need to get the
packet again all right after that source
address this is where we actually start
getting into you know so there's address
is ourselves
yep in the case of us you know or your
or your victim if you will your target
your mark if your man in the middle yes
okay and after that is your destination
which would be like it's me
okay and then where the barmaid because
I want to get the beer radio all right
so and and is this where we talk about
the different ports where is that that's
you see TCP header right so what there
so that's this is this and there's one
more that can go on top optionally and
that's an options field believe it or
not absolutely yeah optionally options
so that's that's where there's about
four or five different things in the IP
header where you can specify like no ops
you can put some no ops in there to pad
the packet to a certain size debugging
mostly debugging stuff there's a there's
a couple of network congestion things
but super awesome geeky stuff
yeah real you know debug stuff if you're
lucky if you're doing that stuff you're
probably a CCI a network engineer and
you're making more money than you and
then you're putting on watching phlearn
full IP second is you
good understanding that's the first
thing that's your header and then we've
got a whole bunch of more bricks
underneath that's before we can that
that's just to get our IP and that's
right now we need to talk to talk about
like you said right here I think was the
green one our protocol
I don't think yeah let's talk about our
protocol we're talking about TCP here
not UDP not a though there's TCP yeah
we're not gonna focus on on UDP right
now so TCP we're gonna talk about the
TCP header all right so I'm gonna
quickly go to here and actually just
pull this up on the screen so that we
can look and see what this looks like so
here's all the checks of like so now
we're gonna go through here
well okay so there we go port so the
first thing in a TCP header is the
source port and here here he is right
here source port so this and we're gonna
I'm gonna give me destination port juice
because I'm gonna talk about both the
same time so yeah I don't know about
that so this is this is me it's what are
you trying to get the beer from the
barman just don't knock your mic big
dope all right
the viewers were like ah so this is uh
this is the this is you trying to get
the beer from the bar mate sorry the
barmaid hears you great the barmaid is
the destination port all right now I
want to talk to her mm-hmm
how do I talk to her all right the
barmaid is only listening for to get
beers communications here so people like
port in this case port 80 that's all
that's it port 80 that's all that server
barmaid I want to talk to em port 80
what about me well my source Mort you
can't be poori why not you can't be the
barmaid you can't be you and the barman
at the same time I understand that very
weird okay so I don't have a different
source so you're just some random Joe
Schmo that wants a beer
all right so that's what that number
base it's a randomized number of by 1024
1024 1024 and below being of course the
old register the legacy the originals
card which is very it's very yeah almost
no nobody follows anymore but everything
through 80 David so now I understand
that and I guess we've that's a total
another conversation about when it comes
to network address translation between
your I don't have in low-level terms
you're like Linksys right it was you
would be going through
belayer yeah like we've seen just to
make it easy we've got a source report
we got a destination port so now that we
can speak even though we're not on the
same numbers what after this you'll get
a sequence number this is gonna help
this is gonna help track you know we're
in the conversation things are you know
this just just tells you where you are
in the pack now its goods amazing cuz
it's like a map um after that you're
gonna have your acknowledgement number
and I acknowledge you and this has said
a lot to do with in fact it's right here
knowledge remember there always been
number one yeah so this is the first
packet after that sounds good so data
offset and doesn't always show up but
it's just for if you were fragmentation
and other things where you have data
just a pad you know just offset of
everything great lines up right the next
one is reserved
what is it just it's there wasn't yeah
it's just in the RIC they were like
kinda in the RFC it's just from you know
experimentation you know just well did
that in college
experimentation alright this is the
flags this is the this is a jumbo
monster one right here alright so this
covers all the flags from CW are ECE
org I'm here too so this is where you're
sending okay the ones that are the Zen
AG fan and I know alright what is the
three-way so anyway whatever but the ECW
CHR beat what about this The CW are in
the ECU mainly just deal with network
congestion they that's about all they
were so really just high-level routers
are looking at these saying and then the
people that are programming those are
again with the they're not usually
you're not usually gonna see these
things said okay so that's what's next
after that we have a checksum which is
again just like the IP I'm sure
everything came out crack I've seen
after that we have an urge pointer if
the urge flag is set this will tell
where you know to put the that packet at
the top of the priority for it to
process at first all right and then
after that is the optional options again
which is not a requirement you so
options the same deals before all right
debug stuff so those are the headers for
IP and TCP and that's and if you as we
were going along you can see in
Wireshark
where they all fall and what what it
looks like this is a nice little pretty
view because it takes all this hex and
actually breaks it out and for you if
you're normally taking a like a
certification exam or something you're
gonna have to take these hex blocks and
do this yourself no fun so we've got
links to charts and and grab some of
those tables that explain all these but
basically you we've got your IP your
teacher under that we've got our TCP yep
and then and then they actually have our
data our payload there we go there we go
so all of this all of this just to send
a bit just to send this guy right
there's the MTU is big enough we can
actually send a couple more so some more
images so what's under this so what's
the next layer I mean once we get past
the IP and a TCP then we're into what
FTP well we're going back safe now all
right anyway so so yeah the kindergarten
blocks are gone we don't like the place
we graduated so we've we've gone
backwards well from the bottom up so we
went frames everything first then the IP
TCP you after this stuff is when in the
stack you would either be building this
into an image and presenting it on a
browser and you go through all your your
layers up to the application layer or
you would be encapsulating it down and
in in in our packet here we're just
looking at you know hypertext this is
indeed this is the D in capital yeah
this is why this not D encapsulation
yeah this is a D encapsulation okay
where we are where I requested that
image and the web page and it you know
we can actually see the exact traffic so
all of that was encapsulated in TCP and
that was encapsulated in IP yeah and
then that was shoved through a network
interface and like we talked about in
the lab it goes down to the layer two
and then we start talking about copper
and microwaves but yeah no fun okay cool
so I think we have a good understanding
of how high levels actually made how
it's built and now you're gonna return
next week and we're gonna do some fun
stuff and actually get our hands dirty
no Wireshark yeah so I've we've we've
you've seen Wireshark up all this time
and now we're actually going to do some
advanced some advanced filtering so now
that we know what to look for we can
tell Wireshark hey only we can get rid
of stuff
multicast broadcast MAC address we can
only look at if we want just show me the
fun kind exactly yeah the messenger
conversation IRC passwords the the IMAP
the mail all the fun stuff mm-hmm
alright Chris excellent excellent stuff
I am assuming Chris girl is Chris
curling calm the place to be to see all
the show notes on this bad boy
oh we can feel let's head over to
Shannon see what's going on with this
week's LAN party all right this month's
LAN party is battlefield 2 we're playing
on November 1st and you can join us at
game hack 5 org or if you're not really
feeling like getting into the game for
the day you can always just hang out
with us on hack 5 org where we're gonna
have the cam set up so you can check us
out filming of course this month's LAN
party is sponsored by dead space dead
space is EA's first survival horror game
and an original IP created by
hand-picked team of horror fanatics it's
a terrifying game it's an experience
that deserves its M rating to survive in
dead space it's all about the strategic
dismemberment of your enemies set in a
horrific sci-fi atmosphere
you're gonna explore the gritty bowels
of the damaged USG Ishimura a deep space
mining ship and it's amazing zero-g
environment while you employ this
entirely unique way to blast your way
through your enemies we haven't had a
chance to play dead space yet but we've
heard amazing things from the TRS crew
when they played at e3 in fact dead
space recently won the game critics
award best of e3 2008 for best
action-adventure game and it's in stores
now so visit dead space ta comm for more
details and now we're gonna take a break
I'd like to thank version X from our
hak5 forums for this next suggestion
this program is called Alice that I'm
gonna be talking about today it's a very
high level programming that's similar to
Java now it's not meant to replace your
job or your C++ so we're ever using now
what this is meant for is for your
younger brother or your cousin or your
niece or even your mom your grandmother
who are interested in programming but
I've never even seen anything like that
before it's a very user friendly
drag-and-drop kind of interface it's
meant to introduce the object-oriented
programming it's very easy to use as you
can see it's a very user friendly
drag-and-drop scenario these are my
functions I can drag those in I have
methods and it's very object oriented
the way that it reads it reads very
similar to Java so this is an example
that came with Alice that I'm gonna play
for you right now we're gonna see how it
works that's a mouse initiated function
just speed it up a little bit as you can
see it's a basic storytelling which is
meant to encourage people who would
never really be interested in
programming because it's it's pretty and
it's attractive and it draws people in
alright so now we're gonna is we're
going to add something we're gonna add a
new event let's add event for when a key
is typed when I scroll down here when
any key we're gonna change to the Enter
key do we'll have him do hey baby which
is a whole nother function that's where
he raises his eyes that's good
all we have to do is go and hit play
click to start okay I'm doing my Enter
key
see how he raised his eyes I'll do it
again so it's very simple it's very user
friendly you can go in and change this
all around there's so much you can do it
there's even a flight simulator we can
do or you can fly through different
rings it's really cool so again I'm not
recommending this for you guys who are
already very in the program and you
obviously know what you're doing but
this is for people who aren't so
familiar with programming it's a great
way to get them interested in
treat so for more tips like this check
out the hack 5 forums so Darren you just
came back from daikon up in Ohio Jeff
any time I had a blast dude it was so
much fun and went up there with Paul and
the trigger is really well it's kind of
geared like a lot different than a lot
of conferences they should really have
changed the name to - daikon because
that's really what it is unfortunately
we missed some of the stuff on Friday
which was where they did packet Wars
which is a really cool kind of network
game which is if you're familiar with
some of the network games that they do
at something like DEFCON which is like a
capture the flag Rob this is kind of
similar to that but they do like
territory type stuff where you try to
like get into a server and then you want
to hold that server for as long as
possible but as the game progresses
different things happen on the network
like all the sudden like firewalls go
down and the different like servers pop
up and there's different teams so like
you and I could be like team hack 5 and
go and compete and then like against the
different groups that are there right
looks like a lot of fun totally next
time I go we'll remember that it's to
take on that daikon and make it up for
that right but but no we had a blast we
got there the way that they do is one
track and everything's just like
backpack acting it's like a lot of good
stuff that's just like crammed together
so there isn't a whole lot of time like
you know hallway time at those
conferences is like some of the best
time and there's not so much of that
because as soon as one's done it's like
man there's another segment right so
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to
get some of the interviews that I wanted
this one in particular that I really
wanted to get and I guess I can just
explain to you what I saw there was
these two guys from ER NW security firm
out in Germany
Simon rich and I hope I'm not mangling
his name here but Daniel manda talked
about some interesting evolutions and
botnets and actually using the Microsoft
what is the peer-to-peer technology P
NRP it's pure name resolution protocol
okay
in conjunction with fast flocks you ever
heard of fast flux no okay it's so like
how botnet people quickly change their
DNS so that by the time you've gone
ahead and blocked that DNS they've
I hadn't pointed somewhere else right so
a couple PR MP with fast flux and then
start talking about and then Simon
started talking about ways that you can
actually tunnel and for me I mean this
is nothing like crazy new but they put
together a tool for tunneling a lot of
information through DNS okay which on
most corporate firewall is even on some
of the most lockdown firewalls you can
still get DNS queries through yep and if
you can get some P if you can get some
packets to your destination in it you
can get some packets back as a response
to your DNS query then also you can
tunnel traffic through it they the best
they got was 24 bytes per second yeah so
not really gonna be playing you know
anything now it's it's like 300 baud I
don't address all the affinities but
yeah but they had a lot of great
information about abusing protocols they
they abused the out of net which
was a lot of fun oh yeah seeing that
happen and talking about very
interesting ways that you can do some d
doses and well I'm not gonna go too much
in so it sounds like overall you guys
had a good time I know it was a crazy
ass long trip yes I definitely recommend
if you're in the area to check it out
it's not super expensive they treat
everybody like super grade like catering
and all that fun stuff and there's a lot
of there's a wealth of information while
there isn't the hallway stuff that you
typically get in other conferences with
multiple multi-tracks
you do there's a huge party Saturday
night which we at least made it for that
and that was that was also Paul's
birthday so I made sure to get him I do
here Paul got a little Paul Necker what
Paul had fun yeah
ain't that right Paul I think he had fun
yeah he's shaking his head so um but
anyway I definitely recommend that if
you're in the area to check it out and
if not just head over to the website
because I believe that they're posting
all the presentations as well as a lot
of video from it so one in particular
you might want to check out and and I'm
not sure if I call BS on it or not it's
really interesting but there was a ninja
that showed up okay yeah and he used a
text-to-speech reader on his computer to
give his presentation and it was all
done to like I don't know like like
not MIDI music but you know your ear
your generic like matrix like hacker
music right I don't know
so and it was talking about root kits
and backdoors and biases and wireless
cards that are still on even when
there's not plugged into this so we're
gonna we're gonna have to see if anybody
can actually put his talk into you know
practice so the one thing that kind of
like you're like really really and then
all of a sudden it's like and here's the
proof beer and parties and it turned out
B EE R and pa rt is we're like acronyms
for like something hidden an award or a
my biases that were like a secret
backdoor all right well whatever hey
listen it was one of the most
entertaining talks I've ever been to
it's not every day you go to a hacker
conference and there's a ninja yes he
had the katana and was very enthusiastic
wonder how he got through TSA with that
one I don't know we drove anyway so long
was daikon so daikon and it's not the
the Khan isn't daikon because it's a
single day it because it's held in
Dayton Ohio oh yeah I just saw the
little light bulb go on yeah right here
thank you you're welcome
all right so um we want to thank

highly recommend that you guys check it
out and we want to thank you for
sponsoring the show definitely yeah
check it out so I can't wait to see what
that's I'm gonna end up looking after I
was playing with it and it really blurs
the lines between application and
website it's one of those like premier
web - oh like like you thought you knew
what - who I know is until you start
like hovering over and it's like
gradients and if you're a big thing the
other big thing is if you're a fan of
statistics on who visits your website
and art really I mean yeah like
seriously Google like step up the game
with your analytics because wow yes
Squarespace is I don't know what's been
called a jazzy yeah I had no idea Ajax
it was like a now if only oh yeah if
only JavaScript would run as fast as
like C code I mean that's common then
that's that's the next thing maybe one
of these days yeah
sweet um we want to do some react v
stuff don't we that of course you guys
send us a lot of questions you guys post
a lot of great info on the forums
sometimes we like to feature that stuff
sometimes we're going to talk about that
directly on the show there's something
that we want to do more of here on
future episodes of hack 5 so definitely
if you've got interesting questions like
tunneling your NFS traffic through
another location in your university so
you can download giant bit torrents that
one's come up hit us up feedback at hack
5 org questions at hack $5 org either of
them good all of us and we SiC the
engineers on them make sure that we get
you guys some decent answers and it's
usually same day I've got to be honest
with you that a lot of the questions
that I've seen come in have been
answered
in the same day yeah the NFS traffic one
you know a couple others so great
because then we like you know we're like
hey did you see that one what are you
thinking and then riah yeah and then by
the time you know somebody checks their
email it's already been answered I love
it because it keeps us on our game yeah
it does yeah one of the most interesting
things okay well I mean the the fruits
near and dear to my heart
yeah and I'm putting an end to it I know
I know sure a lot of people get a say go
through no I'm doing the like tune in
next week I'm doing
Linux clustering to to crack passwords
and then I think after that we're like
doing a whole huge thing I'm like I'm
doing some Swiss Army tools for
networking anyway so one of the things
that I was asked is hey you brought your
pineapple to torque on and fake on -
that was a lot of fun and it's not
plugged into anything it is yeah because
there's a battery in here and it was
like well what battery use and I know
that it didn't explain much of it one of
the things that you can do is pick up
and and I'll show you right here inside
of my pineapple here I actually have
just a this is real simple battery pack
that you can pick up from from like
RadioShack or a lot of others like
sparkfun has these a whole bunch of
different retailers these are really
cheap like two dollars and four double A
batteries will power the Fon in my test
for about two hours if you're looking
for something a little bit more robust
forget the name of the gentleman on the
forums at the moment but if you head
over to the auger forms there are or yes
AG reforms there are there is a huge
thread about battery packs for the Fon
and one of them is this RadioShack RC
pack that's actually made for like
remote-control cars which is kind of
neat because you know it was I think it
was like eight dollars and I think this
is a great find because this little
battery pack and then you just plug it
into the wall and get your recharge on
so definitely better for the environment
don't want to be wasting a whole bunch
of like four alkaline batteries every
two hours right if you just want to like
and two hours I've I mean for my testing
you're not gonna be sitting there for
well no I mean in a longer pen test
we're actually working with the guy that
we're putting together a a lithium ion
battery totally rechargeable allow you
to run for like I don't know like a day
or two nothing like that and then we're
also looking at the same kind of stuff
we've got info on USB charging it turns
out there's a lot more efficiency if you
replace the voltage regulator that stock
on the fon he only needs 3.3 volts to
run but he the voltage regulator on here
drops everything down a little bit
anyway even if you give him 3.3 you only
give you two something so so we'll have
all that info coming up yes so we're
trying to build the lightest battery
possible for the fon keep it I'm hoping
to get it under five ounces for some
other fun stuff later cool yeah
we also want to mention another show
that we have you know here on revision3

York those up at the the live big nation
