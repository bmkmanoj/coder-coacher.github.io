so Declan I just wanted to ask you about
Aaron and what he means to you as a
person as a as a figure to our community
and what your experience was when you
found the news and what that meant to
you well I was online out on the west
coast on Friday this is just a less than
a week ago and I as soon as I saw the
news it was the MIT tech guy think that
was the first to report his death there
I actually didn't write anything for see
that even though I should be writing
something is my day job but I did I
didn't get anything up on news com or
seen up until wednesday because it was
just a very difficult thing to write
about I know journalists are supposed to
you know just owe their own feelings
aside and on the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal reporters covered what
happened on September 11 2001 I even
other offices might have been uh Nabal
but I just it wasn't until I was able to
start the story it was it I wasn't able
to get that first sentence written
because I don't know it was a mental
block and it was unusual so I ended up
the first piece I wrote for cnet was
about the prosecutorial abuses and
what looks like a mounting evidence so
that the US in US attorney in this case
Carmen Ortiz went beyond what propriety
demands went beyond what she should have
and the deputies went beyond what they
should have in this case not all the
facts are in there's a congressional
investigation underway but I would be
surprised if this didn't well this way I
would not be upset at this time ended
with try again am I would not be upset
if she resigned I would not be upset if
you removed from office we don't have
all the facts and I don't mean to
prejudge but it does not look good for
what these attorneys did and that the
sad thing is that the tactics is an air
in this case by the prosecutors were are
similar to what they used in many other
cases it just in this case it first led
a young man to commit suicide in second
they got much more attention and so if
there's anything to be gained from this
death I hate to say that way but it
would be a reform that stops it from
happening again and that reform cannot
it's too late for Aaron but but it could
help thousands or eventually millions of
other
one last thing i covered the Stop Online
Piracy Act debates last year and for a
while it looked like it was just going
to hear Congress SOPA was sponsored and
authored by the head of the House
Judiciary Committee that writes
copyright law protect IP to Senate
version was sponsored and authored by
Senator Leahy who heads the committee in
the Senate that writes copyright law and
so these things seem like a done deal
senator Wyden was trying to fight
defensive action he was just delaying
the inevitable at least that's what a
lot of people thought but wasn't until
Aaron I think at the encouragement of
Peter Eckersley at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation decided that well
let's create demand progress and all of
a sudden they had his member the counter
on the website I going from a hundred
thousand two hundred all the way up to
close to a million people signing a
petition against it and this is
something that Washington is not
prepared to deal with I mean edition
with 10,000 people they understand but a
million people that's a lot and they're
used to dealing with out on things like
taxes or guns or abortion but they're
not used to dealing with that kind of
outrage when it comes to copyright
digital copyright policy and that i
think was was one of the factors that
led to the withdrawal of the legislation
and
ultimate defeat without demand progress
without Aaron things could have turned
out differently and so how do you
process Aaron's loss
I wasn't a roommate with him like Peter
Eckersley at eff was but it's it's just
a very difficult thing to write about
it's difficult to write a fair article
because even though I have my suspicions
about what happened in terms of the of
the prosecution and possible
prosecutorial uses I mean you wanted to
try to be varus reporter if you can't be
unbiased but you don't want to be biased
either so it's actually been a very
difficult week thank you
