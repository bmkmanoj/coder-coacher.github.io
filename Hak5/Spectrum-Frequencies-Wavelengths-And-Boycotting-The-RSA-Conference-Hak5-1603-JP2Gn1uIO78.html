by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
a to weekly dose of technolo stand we
are not in the studio no we are not at
RSA either now why aren't we at RSA in
fact because I can I can see Moscone
Center I can see the Metreon yeah so it
turns out that RSA did something that
we've really weren't big fans of so RSA
decided that they were going to take ten
million dollars from the NSA to push
weak crypto standards in be safe which
then later n ist would go on to allow it
to become a international standard that
is not cool and they basically stuck a
back door out everybody's thing and now
they didn't stick a back door they just
used a very weak crypto standard okay
fine line fine line but still not cool
okay so if the NSA comes to you and
offers you ten million dollars don't
take it unless it's to make the world a
better place amid we would understand if
it was for a better place but in this
case the RSA basically sold themselves
out right and not just themselves
because you can't claim like oh we need
this kind of stuff for national security
because then it's the same standard so
everybody's using and then it breaks
everyone's networks and then nobody wins
right I mean the same kind of like oh
we're gonna backdoor Windows or
something so that we can get in and do
lawful stuff well great well now every
nation can get in and do lawful stuff
using air quotes here so anyway Vegas
2.0 awesome group of people put together
this awesome boycott and yeah yeah and
actually why don't you and we have one
of the Vegas - oh guys here tell us does
why are we boycotting with tacos tacos
are delicious that's number one this is
actually the case that margaritas go
well with tacos margaritas margaret is
typically with lots and lots of tequila
in them absolutely you know also who
doesn't want to just like get really mad
at the RSA and the NSA over a good
healthy taco lunch I mean really okay so
what what's the inspiration behind the
trolling the inspiration behind the
trolling because some would say that
this is just straight up trolling well
it is trolling let's be honest here
the in case anybody was confused we are
absolutely trolling everybody here but
the troll is basically to say RSA you
and the NSA it was a great relationship
for as long as you had it it's time you
guys broke up you know let's set that
facebook status to it's complicated you
know that's the best thing we can say
with this particular troll slash yummy
taco event awesome whenever people come
by have you been educating them if they
try to come in the door about why you're
doing this
oh yeah we got these little slips of
paper let's say Foad you know which you
can look up on the Internet's what that
means but it essentially says like you
paid to be at RSA you're paying RSA
money which means you really don't care
about what they do with their ciphers
well you don't care about what they do
with the NSA and we say you should care
especially at lunchtime when you're
super hungry this is the most convenient
place to get lunch in town it's the only
reasonably priced place across the
street from the conference and I applaud
you for crowdsourcing this and getting
everybody behind you to make this Vegas
to a dream a reality
oh thank you very much I do appreciate
it actually I really appreciate all the
people that helped out with the crowd
tails on this one they really came
through in a pinch like we're down to
the wire like last day 12 hours left and
people were like no this needs to happen
and we suddenly got a lot of good
groundswell of people that said let's
buy out this entire restaurant and make
the most convenient most affordable and
most delicious place near RSA not a
thing for anybody that paid money to be
at RSA most delicious sit-in I've ever
been at so you know props to you guys as
well as we'll see DC 408 and no starch
and everybody well yeah yeah we just
we're just here for the booze but where
can people find out about the other fun
stuff that Vegas Chuo does well we have
a Twitter account you can get to at
underscore Vegas 20 we also have a
tumblr Vegas 2-0 on Twitter or excuse me
on tumblr so definitely check those two
things out so we're gonna be premiering
a new website in two weeks called Vegas
hackers org and that's gonna be
premiering all the stuff we do EF f
fundraisers Def Con shenanigans running
around with Rascals all over the place
and causing a whole bunch of hoopla on
top of all the protests and things that
we're doing here today awesome well
thanks for having us Cheers
so yeah that's basically what we're
doing we're sitting in having margaritas
and saying no now you gave money to RSA
they're bad and so you don't get to have
tacos no tacos for you well RSA NSA I
mean what's the difference at this point
we're having a good time here in the
city and we're going to be bringing you
a whole bunch of interesting feedback
about SDR this episode
yes we've gotten a ton of it so we
should probably just get right into it I
want to thank you all for your amazing
feedback on the software-defined radio
kick that we've been on as of late we've
received so many emails and I want to
thank you for a lot of the insights as
well as a lot of the questions and I'd
like to take the moment before we get
further in the practical to lay down a
little bit of foundation stuff a little
bit of theory here because essentially
over the last couple of weeks what we've
been doing is playing around with
electromagnetic radiation
so this electromagnetic radiation or e/m
or is really essentially photon wave
particles moving at the speed of light
and these electromagnetic waves consists
of both electric fields and magnetic
fields which oscillate at this beautiful
fixed relationship so it looks kind of
like this if we have our magnetic field
here it's all pretty and stuff then
we'll also have an electric field and
this just goes on forever and looks
beautiful well these waves are measured
by frequency or wavelength which are as
we define them a spectrum so let's go
ahead and take a look at what we know of
as the spectrum right now so for
instance here over on the Left we've got
these great big waves that slowly get
shorter and shorter
and shorter there we go good enough for
me and what we really have here as we
look at these waves from left to right
is we've got this great big section that
will define over here as a radio and
then we'll have a section for microwaves
and then a section for in fact infrared
or IR maybe familiar with that and your
television remote as well as our visible
light ultraviolet right light and then
x-rays and gamma rays
and so what's nice about this is
actually in in the context that we've
been speaking about recently we're
really just kind of concerned with
what's over here and here in the United
States this is actually what the FCC is
going to you know mandate what we can
and how much fun we can have with with
these frequencies although that said
we're actually going to in the near
future see a lot more interesting stuff
happening right on the edge here in
visible light take a look at something
called life I it's akin to Wi-Fi but in
a very slim spectrum of light that we
may or may not be able to perceive so
that's kind of interesting well when I
talk about this I'm talking about the
all of these different things we just
classify them as these different names
but essentially they are all
electromagnetic radiation and I know
from experience whenever I go to put up
some massive Wi-Fi antenna in the
apartment or wherever my girlfriend's
constantly like is this thing radiating
me and I can do this for you the
universe is radiating you and just as
such you are actually radiating the
universe these photon wave particles can
be as small as an atom or as large as
the known universe they cannot in fact
be larger than the
universe else we would need a larger one
but that said we measure this
electromagnetic radiation in these
lengths of their wave and this is
actually done really easily this wave
here for instance we're going to go
ahead and say that right there from this
peak to this peak and this section right
here is what's known as a cycle and
we're going to go ahead and measure
these two cycles between you know the
peak and the other peak in fact as it's
distance between those two peaks and now
we're actually gonna measure that in
meters so this right here for instance
from there to there would be measured
and say meters or if it was really big
it would be in kilometers over it's
really small and be in centimeters and
you know the metric system isn't it
wonderful
they should probably keep teaching it in
grade school that's a little us-centric
anyway we can also measure how many
cycles there are in any given second so
for instance right here if I were to
measure this and say for instance this
right here were us oh one second of time
so time moving over here and we have one
second we would say that we have one two
three four four cycles within this
amount of time and so what those four
cycles would mean is we could express it
by saying that this electromagnetic
radiation is oscillating at four Hertz
okay so one hurt
so 1 Hz is one oscillation over time so
from here to here is one second whereas
one lower case k HZ and all of these RSI
measurements of units one kilohertz is
as opposed to one kilobyte it's actually
not 1024 no it's actually a thousand
waves per second whereas a megahertz so
we've got one capital M H Z's
this is 1,000 cycles this is one cycle
this would be 1 million cycles and then
one Giga Hertz would be 1,000 commas
there million cycles per second and so
you can kind of like already equate that
because you probably are familiar with
those kinds of measurements of
frequencies when it comes to your
computers now whereas before when we've
talked about these types of things maybe
in the going back to some of the first
white boarding segments where we talked
about these waves in terms of pulse code
modulation where we're talking about
audio these waves are not audio waves
and the difference being that unlike
this section right here of the visible
spectrum where we can actually perceive
this if we are gifted with the
perception of sight we can actually see
the electromagnetic radiation in this
area right here sound audio which we
typically perceive in the 20 Hertz to 20
kilohertz range of our human ears that
so everywhere from 20 oz per second to
20,000 oscillations per second those
oscillations actually depend on the
compression of molecules and that energy
actually needs to be converted into
pressure either in the air or say in the
water to be perceived to be heard and
that's why you can hear cool sounds in
the ocean and you can hear my voice
right now because the oscillations
coming out of your speakers how
fantastic is that so how does this
electromagnetic radiation get into my
software-defined radio down my Universal
Serial bus and into my computer so I
could do fun things with it well
essentially this guy right here is a
conductor I mean it's an antenna right
but this is actually conducting that
radiation okay that electromagnetic
radiation is traveling through the
universe at the speed of light and
what's going to happen is it is going to
couple with these can
actors and it is going to travel along
them inducing electric current by moving
the electrons through the conductor so I
mean bear in mind different frequencies
are going to have different properties
as far as like how well they penetrate
different surfaces and different
materials for example you know some
frequencies aren't going to go through
the human body as well because we're
ugly bags of mostly water and carbon and
TNG reference whereas other you know
frequencies will be able to go through
the earth and space and time and
dimensions I made up the last two but as
you can see you know essentially what
we're doing with these different
antennas is we're just putting out
something there you know some some
material that will be attenuated by this
by this radiation that's going through
the air so let's go ahead and take a
look at some of the in practical terms
the radio frequencies the spectrum that
we're interested in here and so just as
all of this electromagnetic radiation is
divided up into what we call radio
microwaves infrared visible ultraviolet
x-rays and gamma rays we actually divide
up radio and when I say we I'm actually
talking about our friends at the FCC and
the ITU and you guys know how I feel
about but and we can get into lots of
fun discussions about the International
Telecommunications Union but that said
we split up radio into different kind of
sections because of their different
usefulness is's so for instance all the
way over here on the low end what we
have is extremely low frequency and this
kind of stuff we're talking about
kilometers distance and wavelength and
that's the kind of stuff that you're
really only going to see you used by
like these guys and then they've got
like a little periscope or something and
then they've got a really long antenna
trailing off behind them and stuff and
so submarines can use e.l.f and slf very
well because those frequencies while
they can't they can't transmit a very
high amount of data can actually go very
far through
see and sometimes then through the earth
Ulf is another example of that that was
used in World War one for what's called
earth mode communications because it
like can just penetrate through rock
which is pretty fantastic VLF is another
another frequency set that's a lot of
times used for scientific stuff and
submarines so this is really kind of
outside the realm of most of the stuff
that we're gonna be getting into however
it is really cool in the sense that it
can hang out with these guys and that's
always fun we also have LF or low
frequency so if you were into LF
frequencies and in the radio arena you'd
be a loafer
likewise MF for medium frequency so
you'd be an mf'er we've got HF for high
frequencies and so then we finally get
into the kind of fun stuff because thus
far we've only been talking about I mean
this this stuff really we were talking
about like atomic clocks and aircrafts
and maritime stuff but then we get into
the fun stuff like VHF and uhf and sh f
so that's for very high frequency ultra
high frequency and super high frequency
and those are the kinds of frequencies
where we're actually going to see things
like FM broadcasts terrestrial radio
we're going to see NOAA you know weather
stations stuff we're going to see
broadcast television when I say cellular
in fact when we get into SH F over here
this is probably what you're the most
familiar with already is because this is
what's sometimes referred to as the
centimeter band because again we're
talking about the lengths between these
different waves and as we get further
along the the length decreases and so in
that band which is measured in
centimeters as opposed to these guys
which are you know measured in
kilometers we're actually going to see
things in in terms of Wi-Fi things that
we're used to as far as you know radar
and microwaves and cellphones and in
fact we're even gonna see in the the
higher bands and say for example EHF the
next and the neighbor of sh f 4x
really high frequency this is going to
come in two terms real soon with ad not
talking about time I'm actually talking
about our friends over at I Triple E so
the spec for 802 11 ad is actually going
to operate within the 60 gigahertz band
and that's pretty cool stuff because the
higher that we go down here so as we
travel down here the you know
frequencies get smaller in terms of like
we're measuring centimeters whereas
we're measuring kilometers but at the
same time our data rate is going to get
much higher which is kind of Awesome and
then we can you know in fact even in
this this band here will see things like
for instance you know in addition to
weapons systems and things like that
will actually see fun things you've
probably already experienced like
millimeter wave scanners so thank you
TSA for taking a look at all our naughty
bits and then finally we get into THF
which is your terahertz band for your
mad scientists and i believe it stands
for totally - what is it it's it's
tremendously high frequency I believe
something like that and and this is just
like bizarre mad science stuff and
that's going to be awesome to get into
and I think it's really important that
we're getting into all of this stuff as
you guys know I'm a huge proponent of
you know the fun things that we can do
with Wi-Fi and mAh so here's proponent
of you know free and open access to
internet like networks you know say for
instance censorship resistant networks
and it's really important as hackers
that we kind of embrace all of this
technology because I feel like if
anything it is going to be one of the
you know backbone underlying
technologies that is going to enable
whatever that next free and open network
may be not your stuff with a leased line
from AT&amp;amp;T or the NSA and so this is
really important to kind of grok here
and I hope that I've Illustrated it in
some sort of understandable manner but
essentially all of it comes down to it's
all energy man it's all radiation it's
all you know magnetics and electronics
and
it's flowing through all of us it's
binding the universe like duct tape it's
got a light and dark side and we're
gonna be doing some really fun stuff
with it so continue hitting us up
feedback at hak5 org let us know your
questions we're gonna continue getting
into a nice little marriage of theory
and practical as we take a look more
in-depth into different modulation
techniques and things of that nature
so go ahead share us your thoughts there
or in the comments and remember we've
got an entire SDR forum over at forums
hak5 org until next week did you do it
doesn't matter if you're an electric
field or a magnetic field when that
killer idea hits you got yourself a
domain name and web hosting quickly like
Lightspeed quickly and domain coms quick
domain discovery system and your easy
checkout process is gonna have your
website up and like boom it's there
you're like wow there's a website I'm
serious I've done it like numerous times
and it is amazing I love the guys over
at domain.com I've told you before
they're affordable they're reliable
they're ease of use and they're fun to
tweet at so gliding tweet I'm at domain
comm thank them for love and hak5 and
loving you guys with an extra 15% off
that's right head over to domain comm
and when you check out use the code hak5
I'm not gonna hook you up with an extra
15% off so when you think domain names
think domain.com it is now time for the
techno last photo of the week this photo
is from HJ in Denmark he says hi guys a
few years back I was the Sisson men at
the local student radio then at some
point the motherboard died and I needed
to get data off the raid configure hard
drives so the setup is shown in the
photo it's four disks in a software raid
configuration in the bottom cabinet
connected to the motherboard of the
standing cabinet thank you so much HJ
for sending in that picture
very cool love your setup and of course
you can share your pictures with us at
feedback at hack 5 org we love checking
them out so be sure to send them with
the subject line type the list
no I just checked it out they all say
United States Department of Justice I
was wondering how you get like front row
parking in front of RSA I guess we
should probably clarify that we love you
guys with the shiny shoes just don't be
evil
don't stop stop being evil if you've
been evil and don't be evil if you
haven't yet so we are outside RSA here
in San Francisco but obviously we didn't
get in we don't have any badges we spent
the entire day at Chevy's yes so thank
you
Vegas to O for all of the margaritas and
I guess we should also say that you know
while this is trolling there are lots of
responsible and more mature ways to go
about the problem at hand about
boycotting the RSA and about yeah the
NSA / RSA issue right and I think a lot
of them in fact we we heard Bruce Banner
talking at shmoocon about this and
basically there's this is going to be
fixed from both the bottom and the top
you know at the top like it's going to
take forever and a day for some you know
what noodle legislation to go past so
that'll happen so if that's your boat
get behind that and try to make it as
little of a wet noodle as possible and
then it'll happen you know from the
bottom up with you know the hackers
that'd be where we actually say you know
what let's start just focusing on you
know a sound crypto and some actually
privacy aware and trusted applications
and things of that nature so we'll
continue covering that do you think that
we're gonna get some really cool new
crypto because of this flaw well I mean
you know I think everybody's just aware
alike is gonna just become more
skeptical I've lost faith in NIST
because of this so I mean I know that
there's a lot of good people in that
organization however now they have a
problem of their public image and so RSA
and the NSA have done a huge disservice
not only to the tech community but the
world at large because that's actually
hurting I don't know confidence in
American companies and and you know it's
a it's a very large discussion so to
answer your question though in the end
of feel like consumers though are going
to win because we will
better applique time een if we look at
the all the latest like look at whisper
systems look at the the latest stuff
coming out of you know Maxie's company
with tech secure it's like group
messaging where the crypto stuff just
happens in the background you don't even
have to think about it so what we're
going to end up with is easier crypto
and actually cross that barrier where
you know before like we've shown like
PGP is hard let's go shopping we're
gonna get applications where it's just
secured by default and of course as
usual if you want to follow everything
that we are doing here at hack five and
you want to give your own opinion about
what's happening with the NSA and RSA an
RSA convention feel free to email us
over at feedback at hack five org or
just leave a comment and we will see you
on the forums hack five organs place to
find that as well as links to where to
follow us and our store if you want to
support us directly it'll take you over
to a check a shop comm we really
appreciate you guys allowing us to come
out with cool stuff like this which is
not housing a whoa I guess it is
nevermind I don't know anything about
that probe anyway that said that about
wraps it up for this episode of hack
five and of course thank you so much for
your feedback as usual we really enjoyed
listening to everything that you have to
say about SDR I'm Shannon Morse
I'm here in kitchen trust your tech the
last
what we're doing is we're having a lot
of fun with electro Matic electro Matic
I love dramatic should we put a note on
one of these to say sorry about what
happened to your car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
