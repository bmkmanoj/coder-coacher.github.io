Metasploit minute Metasploit minute is
brought to you by viewers like you if
you get value from this show and can
spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute calm
welcome to minutes wait a minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me mix today
we're gonna be going over a wish list
nothing technical in this one just going
over some of the awesome things that are
coming out on my tripper it's been a
while since we've been back so I just
wanted to show you all the things that
are kind of coming or getting there and
we're gonna talk about them as episodes
progress but this time we're actually
going to show the wiki page for where
the wish list lives basically and all of
this is actually came out of a form that
the rapid7 people put together and out
of all the input that everyone gave
these are all the features that people
wanted out of meterpreter so powershell
meterpreter mac meterpreter mini katz
integration meterpreter pivoting and all
sorts of and the list goes on and on and
on but the great thing is they what
they're doing is they're actually
putting done information they're
actually saying hey this is completed so
you can actually go back and follow the
wiki and say that way up at the top it
says the last update was 18 days ago so
18 days ago they finished something or
change something or actually completed
and fixed one of the feature requests
that someone had so we're gonna just go
into this segment into a couple of those
and touch on some of the things that I
think we're interesting one in
particular and I'll scroll way down here
alright one of the things that I wanted
to show you was the execute with logon
credentials so this is a cool
functionality because what can happen is
if you steal someone's credentials using
mini cats are some of the other features
that we talked about in the past you can
then create or or zombify a new user
out of thin air by creating a process as
that user just as you can with Windows
with the run is a run as command there's
the same feature inside of an
interpreter or actually just Metasploit
as a post module so we're gonna do that
with one of the modules that we already
have going or all one of the sections we
have already have going so we're gonna
session over to session 3 because we
already have this going and we're gonna
do a process list we're gonna see that
we have a bunch of users on here but
there's a user called not an admin that
we kind of want to resurrect just so
that we can do some stuff as them
so let's background that and we're gonna
use post windows manage run as now I've
actually prepped all the information in
here with show options with the password
that we know about them the domain and
and stuff like that and the the notepad
dot exe that we want to run so we type
run oh we gotta set the session session
to I believe it's for run and you can
see that it's creating a pit with
notepad.exe
and if we go back to session 4 or do PS
again we should see notepad running as
not in admin so you might think what how
is this useful what what would be useful
with this well if you have the username
and password for say a domain admin or
or another user that has something
that's using like crypto FS or or
anything that's encrypted on side of on
a specific computer if they've logged
out that crypto those crypto keys are
gone you have - there's no way to
decrypt them so you can resurrect a user
that's gone if you forgot to do a new
Chrome or something where it actually
has those cryptography keys in there and
migrated into that user or start a new
process and and send a new shell into
that that process and then you can do
all the crypto kung-fu about that or if
you just want to lead the incident
responders astray you can do things as
ice-t-- it as a different user very
easily so what do you think email
MSF at hack 5 org and stay tuned the
Metasploit
