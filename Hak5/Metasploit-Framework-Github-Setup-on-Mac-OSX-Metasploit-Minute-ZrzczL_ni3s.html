framework from get up on OSX this time
on Metasploit minute this Metasploit
minute is brought to you by hack five
and viewers like you
support us directly at h a case all calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob puller but you can call me movies in
this minute we're gonna be setting up
the latest version of Metasploit
framework directly from github
repository on OS X so this is a lot like
what we did for github version with on
sign-on Callie except for there's a
bunch of different little tweaks and
things that we have to do on OSX to get
it going right so what we have right
here let me show you on the screen what
we have here is a list of to do's and
this came directly again from Carlos
Perez's awesome tutorials on the
installing Metasploit this one
particularly is for lion and mountain
lion there's a bunch of tweaks in here
that we needed to do from outline to get
it working on our install so I'm going
to go through a bunch of the things but
we've already covered a lot so I'll just
go through some of the tweaks that I had
to do during the installation now you
can use either brew install or Mac ports
and I find that brew is a lot better at
getting the things that you need for
Metasploit to work now there are you
know this is the vinny max fight all
over again
so let's use brew in this instance so
let's go over and talk through some of
the changes all right first is the brew
install Ruby this whole thing and you
can find out that whole thing at brew Sh
so once we have that going that installs
brew it takes a few seconds then what
you want to do is get these two things
into your bash profile and we're going
to echo those in right now so those two
and let me point out something in
particular those to pass help us with
getting Ruby and the gems particularly
working and running from
whatever directory we need to have them
in so in this particular directory 193
193 4 4 8 that's the install of Ruby
that I installed here on this OS X it
might be a little different from what
you're going to install so once we do
that we install the homebrew version of
193 and we're going to just skip that
because we already did that as well as
the pro stress install so those should
complete without fail from brew and once
you have those installed you'll have
Postgres and Ruby working what you want
to do just to make sure that everything
is going alright is you want to do ruby
- v if ruby - b shows you 187 then you
have not restarted your terminal this
echo into the path puts it in the bash
profile folder or a file you might have
to restart your terminal to get that to
work correctly and if that doesn't work
then you have something wrong with your
install after that we make our
directories for Postgres to
automatically start now you don't have
to do this step this particular step is
only there if you want Postgres to start
automatically the next thing is to copy
and into that in that p list into that
launch agents which will start
automatically whenever you log in you
start Postgres now manually because
you're not having without having to log
out and log back in and you create your
users just like we did with the github
install it's not much different this is
the bundle and/or the gem installs just
like we did on github the only
difference here is we're installing
bundler instead of bundle and we're
installing PG and SQLite and and some of
the other packages that will that aren't
there by default on OS X where they are
on Kali then we get cloned and we've
already done this I just quit cloned it
in the documents Metasploit we already
have all of our the files and folders
that we already know about in there and
we bundle install just like we did
before now I've already done that to
save some time so that's already in
there and it's just as its using it's
ready to go if we do MSF console now
what's going to happen is we're it's
going to start up Metasploit but we
haven't synced it up with our database
let's see if you remember where do we
put that database file that's right in
our home directory CD MSF Forbes home
directory MSF Bor
so that database file exactly how we did
it before now we have gone over these
installations for github and for OS X
installation giving the password of MSF
while you while Postgres is only
listening on one to seven zero zero one
do you really want to make it that easy
for anyone who pops your box to get into
all of your exploit database probably
not so you definitely want to change
that password and use something else but
in this demo we're going to use MSF so
let's get back to our Metasploit
directory startup MSF console and now
one thing I want to give as a tip just
as we're going through this and we'll
give more tips along the way is almost
everything inside of Metasploit has a
dash H if you don't know what this
command does use - H it'll help out
uppercase L I like to use its it uses
real read line which is the system read
line instead of Ruby's real line it's
just a lot better when you're trying to
backspace and copy and a bunch of other
things that make life a little hard if
you're doing screen and stuff like that
so we start MSF console - uppercase L
just as an overview we went through a
bunch of steps ahead of time to make
sure that this is we're doing a lot of
the same steps we would be would be a
lot faster and look at that we have our
little bunny alright that's it so tell
me what you think hit me up at MSF at
hack 5 org stay tuned to Metasploit
mini-com for more shows like these until
then I'll move --ax and I'll be hacking
til the cows come home
I hit command Q to quit and in so know I
was trying to close out of my notepad
with all my stuff in it and command Q
inside of VMware is quit VMware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
