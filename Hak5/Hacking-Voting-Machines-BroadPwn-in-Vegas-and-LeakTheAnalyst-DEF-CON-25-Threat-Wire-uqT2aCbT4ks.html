voting machines get hacked at DEFCON in
a matter of minutes and broad pwned
patches are now available for mobile
devices all that coming up now on threat
wires greetings I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for August 1st 2017
this is your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom I obviously lost my voice during
DEFCON so if I sound kind of weird that
would be why real quick make sure to
subscribe and hit the notification Bell
button to see the show as soon as it
goes live and check out
patreon.com/scishow
it's a really great way to support all
of your favorite podcasts and now on to
the news a senior security analyst at
mandiant a security firm based in
virginia and owned by fire I had a
breach of his personal accounts by
anonymous hackers the information leaked
via pastebin and mega uploads included
the analysts login details contacts and
correspondence from emails internal
company documents and screenshots from
his windows find my device geolocation
tool the attacker also broke into the
analyst LinkedIn page since the breach
was too personal data for a high-ranking
employee of a security firm the attacker
also claimed they had gained access deep
into the company's internal networks
since 2016 now at this time no data has
been leaked from mandiant servers and
mandiant claims that their company's
servers have not been breached
the attacker is using the name hashtag
leaked the analyst and as such it sounds
like the attack was a personal vendetta
more than an attack on mandiant the
attacker explained in their leaked data
of release that they wanted to trash
reputations of reputable analysts in the
field of info SEC this leak shows us
that we should be taking steps to
protect our own networks as well as
workplace ones as some attacks may use
personal profiles or details to gain
further access to much more private data
and as bring-your-own-device becomes
more and more popular for employees and
companies we should take the same
precautions we do on work systems for
our own machines and networks
remember that smaller breaches of data
could happen to anyone including
top-notch security professional
this year at DEFCON 25 the convention
brought in 30 different voting machines
to be hacked by con goers in an attempt
to educate the public about ongoing
vulnerabilities in voting machines and
how important it is to work on making
these more secure the hacks happened in
a room called the voting machine hacking
village where all 30 machines were
hacked some within minutes others within
a few hours machines including equipment
from sequoia ABC edge Ivo tronic a cube
OT s x-wind vote and Diebold express
poll 4000 many of these voting machines
are used across several different states
and still have similar machines in
commission for future voting days hacks
introduced included the ability to take
complete control of a poll books used
for checking into polling places and
remote execution vulnerabilities in the
wind vote machine which is no longer
used in elections this machine in
particular showed hackers real election
data that was stored on the machine one
attendee hacked a wind vote machine in
minutes with it being reported to press
within 90 minutes thereafter in his case
an exploit from 2003 did the job since
the machine was running on Windows XP
now while wind vote machines are
decommissioned as of 2015 though the
company did go out of business way back
in 2007 many others are still being used
and they too were successfully hacked
some machines had publicly accessible
USB ports which could allow an attacker
to physically plug in a USB rubber ducky
for example or alternative devices to
install malware or enter in malicious
scripts with keyboard injection
techniques allowing them to exit out of
the voting software and do anything from
play minesweeper to change vote tallies
another hacker downloaded media player
on the device and then proceeded to play
Rick athletes never going to give you up
which basically Rick Rolled the entire
Cod all of these machines were purchased
by Def Con or supplied to the convention
for the event organizers simply want to
raise awareness of vulnerabilities to
election systems that could potentially
harm a country's election process the
village should be around for the next
three years as well giving hackers a
chance to reverse engineer several
different voting machines and hopefully
continue to educate the masses
on what can happen if these machines are
abused now in the u.s. voting machines
get certifications through the election
assistance Commission and certs cost
over 1 million every single time most
machines are compliant up to 2002
although several have not been certified
since how many of each type of voting
machine is currently being used has not
been reported on but the hope is that by
finding these vulnerabilities machines
will be more secure in the future so
trust would not be lost on them lastly a
vulnerability in iOS and Android phones
plus many other devices has finally
finally been patched thanks to Apple and
Google dubbed broad pone or broad own
the vulnerability would allow an
attacker to gain root access and use
remote code execution technique attacks
on devices in their proximity as long as
Wi-Fi was being used on the phone in
some form factor broad cone sends
malicious packets over the ways to
Broadcom chips that are vulnerable and
it rewrites their firmware worth yet the
attack is self-replicating meaning that
each device would replicate the attack
and infect even more devices this means
that an attacker could remotely own a
phone without ever needing to touch it
broad pone effects any device using
broad coms BCM 43 family of wireless
chips and the bug was first reported by
researcher NEET a tartan Stein before
being publicly reported on during hacker
summer camp aka black hat b-sides and
Def Con earlier last week patches have
been released by Google as of earlier in
July an apple as of July 19th which just
so happens to be a few days before
everybody started flying to Vegas the
bug affected Android 5.0 point 2 and up
on any device using that Broadcom
chipset and Apple iPhones 5 through 7
plus some iPads and iPods affected
phones worldwide are over 1 billion
which is more than 80 percent of the
total market place victims would not
need to connect to the broad pwned
device they would just need to have
Wi-Fi on for them to get infected
furthermore using location services that
require Wi-Fi would also make you
susceptible to attack now while some
carriers may not release patches in a
timely fashion if an update is available
for your phone make sure you install it
and
your device is susceptible to the broad
pown attack and no update is currently
available turning off Wi-Fi and location
services will help thank you again to
all of the wonderful people who
contribute to patreon.com/scishow and
again my apologies for my voice I know
it is really weird today and hopefully
it will recover throughout the week and
I also wanted to say a huge thank you to
all of you that said hello during DEFCON
it was really awesome meeting you all
and it totally keeps me motivated

convention make sure you say hello
because I love meeting each and every
one of you we're all passionate about

know everybody if you can spare a bit of
change it all helps keep threat wired
