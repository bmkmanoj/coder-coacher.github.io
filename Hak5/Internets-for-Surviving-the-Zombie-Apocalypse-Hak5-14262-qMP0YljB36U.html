by goto assist I'm very passionate about
the network of networks and I think
that's key here because the Internet is
nothing more than all of us like if all
of us raise your hand if you don't have
a network at home that's what I thought
right and if all of us were able to
network our networks it would be an
Internet and that would be pretty
fantastic so the internet though has a
rich heritage and I'm going to try to
breeze through this but basically was
born out of a Department of Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency or you
know Martha you've heard of HAARP and
that from 1969 it was it adopted the
Internet Protocol suite that we all know
and love today tcp/ip back in 1982 the
year before I was born
so that was awesome and so you know
Congrats hats off to all of those guys
that you know and you know for putting
the dollars behind it to come up with
that because you know I love America
it's the best nation well anyway so hi
Anna
as far as Internet governance is
concerned like I said this is just a
network of networks and all of us geeks
in this room can figure out how we could
use toasting rain we could use IP X that
we really wanted to be masochistic we
could network our networks right but
ultimately as far as the internet that
were familiar with is concern the only
real governance of what makes it what we
know today is the domain name system the
IP address system and so somebody needed
to maintain that because before this
Authority what there was was host it
wasn't even host dot txt I believe it
was just well now lives in / @ c / host
on unix lives in let's see windows
system32 SC drivers something else on
windows and awareness on OS 10 but the
host file was literally just a text file
that said here's the website here's the
IP address you know here's how you get
to this site and people would just
update this and so when you get on the
internet you put a new server on the
internet you just update this
central authority and some guy maintains
the hosts file didn't imagine just some
guy and then everybody would just
download the new person and yeah look at
all the new sites that are available so
DNS changed everything and so somebody
used to run it and so I Anna does that
Anna was contracted by the Department of
Defense and then in in 1998 this company
was founded actually not far from here
in Santa Barbara I want to say it's
gonna be tragic terrific all right okay
so not far from here at all
to oversee internet operations you see
the the internet was privatized in 1995
when the National Science Foundation
stopped the the last backbone but I can
took over authority of Ayana and other
such organizations kimura at the same
time to to volunteer like volunteer
organizations of private industry and
civil society the internet Engineering
Task Force you know they make our FCS
and specifications for all sorts of cool
stuff the Internet Governance forum and
many other organizations like these have
been governing the internet back before
the United Nations thought that it was
theirs and icon and I can they actually
worked for these as the Department of
Commerce actually pretty much runs the
Internet this is actually why when I was
in the United Nations watching this I
can totally understand why these nations
say it's like Czech Republic and Russian
Federation and stuff look at the
Internet and they're like dude that's
the United States thing you know because
ultimately I can't answers to these guys
man I can't wants to make a new you know
top-level domain when they want to xxx
these guys have to approve it they can
update the list all they want but
ultimately our government runs the
internet even though we you know elude
that it's so private because in 1995
these guys National Science Foundation
ended the the last the last government
major backbone you know and just this
luxury the privatization you know you
remember like prodigy and AOL and arrows
and
there's so many more of these CompuServe
even Microsoft's what was that MSN
anyway so 1995 was a good year for the
internet you know Lee the time the
backbone was actually 56k believe it or
not and then it upgrades with t1 and t3
now get Lucy 192 is I don't even know
what's after that but as a phone geek
I'm into that because the Internet has
gone from like slo-mo to we're streaming
and we get upset when we can only get
720p streaming so yeah so that was a
privatization of the Internet and now
that was so that was 1995 let's take
overstepping way back to 1948 this is
Eleanor Roosevelt holding a copy of the
universal declaration of human race
rights and you're probably wondering how
does this tie into the internet well you
see the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was passed by the United Nations
there was actually 48 Nations in favor 0
against a abstain there's whether soviet
union ukrainian SSR a bunch of others
that end in SSR you get the idea
south africa but basically it has to
what is human rights for humanity right
not just some nations rights but these
are what you know we should all expect
and there's this one article if it's
very important that i feel to the
internet which is about the freedom of
expression so it says everyone has the
right to freedom of opinion and
expression this right includes freedom
to hold opinions without interference
and to seek receive and impart
information and ideas through any medium
and regardless of frontiers
that's our universal you know freedom of
expression which if you've looked at the
internet it's a fantastic place for
freedom of expression you know in every
single way you know everything from
hamster dance to youtube comments and i
believe it at all so in 2011 the UN did
is the special report talking about
blocking of the internet
about filtering of the Internet mention
did this survey the report is not that
interesting you really have to read the
law to read between the lines when it
comes to the stuff that comes out in the
United Nations because they use weasel
words here a lot and ultimately all they
do is influence policy they don't make
laws nation states make laws but these
are you know the nation states are come
together to create policy of the
influence those and so they make
recommendations and things of that
nature as far as you know not being a
douche to the Internet but basically
this is talking about the Internet
enabling that basic human right of
expression
well not all countries are so down with
that but some are these are the
countries that have actual laws not just
some United Nations policy free hippie
happy stuff this is law that you have
that you know fundamentally Internet
access is a beauty is you're right in
these nations those are the only ones
so hopefully this list will get bigger
in 2012 the Internet Society did a
survey asking people if they believed
that access to the Internet should be a
basic human right I'm very surprised
that this wasn't a hundred percent
strongly agree who are these people that
someone's trying to disagree what well
the Internet has done so much to
transform our lives not just freedom of
expression but it has done a lot to
change industry I think there's actually
pretty hot here in LA anything that can
be digitized can have its industry
totally decimated just like the buggy
whip industry with the automobile and
that's fine you know adapt right this is
the cost of progress and this will usher
in more awesome right hopefully one day
I get a replicator and I can order old
hot so my hope is that the Internet can
actually remain truly free and open and
can remain untouched by Internet revived
by corporate and government interests
and that cyberspace they actually
transcend these these borders and be
granted some sort of sovereignty because
I consider you know that these
nation-states enjoy and enjoy the kind
of rights where like every human is
actually having equal opportunity online
it's so great because when I go on IRC
everyone is green text on a black
background everyone is judged by what
they say not you know to put the mint or
you know we exist without nationality
without skin color without religious
bias the Internet has that dream it
transcends those old school borders
released that is my hope my fear of
course is that the Internet is seen as a
resource ok it's seen as a resource and
will be bent to the will of the state
and the corporation and used to control
access to now what who has access to
what information for domestic spying to
engage in information warfare to
otherwise oppress citizens
it's totally uncool this that leads into
internet censorship because this is
actually a issue where well I mean
everybody's going to have a different
opinion on it because would you say it's
ok to limit or filter internet access in
a library in a public library in a
public school what about on a corporate
network when you go now if you're
working for the man and you go to your
cubicle and you're using the machine on
their network shouldn't they be able to
say what access you have ok I mean I go
back and forth on this but when it comes
to your home right when you're when
you're at your home I believe you should
have I don't know not only just the
Fourth Amendment you know but you should
have freedom of expression freedom of
speech right so other countries don't
see it that way
China known for their Great Firewall of
China employees things like IP blocking
DNS filtering packet filtering
man-in-the-middle attacks they'll
actually drop
actions who TCP resets the they block
any VPNs or SSH traffic out of the the
country
I forget what country it is as mandating
it was North Korea just said it's okay
to use a VPN now in North Korea you can
use this VPN North Korea yeah but if you
go to China good luck
googling Tiananmen Square protests in
1989 it's just not gonna show any
results man this time of the year it
seems like everyone is trying to get
away from the office I know I am
vacations enjoying the warmer weather
but listen if you're working in IT as
man so many of us are it is a challenge
