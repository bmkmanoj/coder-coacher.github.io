go further Brock 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 checking out oculus and
I'm about to go into the into the oculus
rift as it were so are you ready yeah
I'm ready I'm I got to be honest some
big unreal fans so bring it on alright
my eyes are closed with your left hand
okay just help me yep get it in the
right spot that would just a little bit
more pretty clear yeah that looks great
okay okay all right so look look left
look right look up look down it actually
look backwards look at me turn your body
look at me there you go where are you I
don't see you where did you go so I'm
gonna give you a control just so you can
walk around a little bit just wonderful
okay left hands better and you just want
this stick and you're going to use your
head to sort of look around okay oh wow
yes straight strafing is a little weird
hardware with Ronan type software but
it's a tech demo using Unreal Engine 3
and the oculus rift developer kits and I
don't know what do you think what's your
initial well okay so i'll be honest i
played with some stereoscopic 3d glasses
from like musics and stuff like that
before but I've never never done a head
tracking system that's this I mean this
is a really unique head tracking system
what's the secret about this so we
actually developed our own oculus head
tracker and so we've done a lot to
optimize that for VR with the hyatt
tracker runs it of a rate of up to a
thousand Hertz which is really really
fast we're also doing a lot of men sir a
novel sensor fusion head modeling
predictive tracking all sorts of tricks
in software to make the head tracking
latency as low as possible with the best
VR experience and so what are some of
the challenges and coming up with this
is it the refresh rate is it the
resolution is it the sensors and the
calibration just about just about
everything is no you're fine you're fine
I know just about everything is a
challenge you know we uh we invest a lot
in our tracker technology we're
constantly evaluating new display
hardware to lower latency there the
software is a challenge you know using
all the latest techniques for you know
sensor fusion and predictive modeling
these are all challenges but we're
trying to make it as easy as possible
for the average gamer to experience
really truly immersive VR and finally
step inside the game for the first time
I mean no joke this has been the dream
for quite a while now uh where did you
guys come from and how did you get into
this space so um my name is Nate
Mitchell I'm vp of product at oculus the
company was actually founded by Palmer
Luckey who's wandering round the show
somewhere he actually designed and
invented the rift in his parent's garage
over the course of two and a half years
you know he was always super passionate
about head-mounted displays in virtual
reality and he wanted something to
actually allowed him to you know jack
into the matrix for video games really
step inside the game and there was
nothing available so he experimented and
ended up building the rift that you're
playing with now and so are these kind
of like the same kind of accelerometers
and sensors that would find inside of
like a Nintendo Wii controller or what
is the early
types look like well so i can't speak
for the nintendo wii necessarily but it
is the same sort of combination and
sensor hardware that you'd find in your
phone this is so cool so what's your
goals here do you have like a target
market and what you're trying to do with
the product you know we're right now
we're completely focused on developers
what you're using now is an early
prototype of our developer kit so we're
hoping that developers come out and buy
these developer kits develop content for
the rift and as we approach the consumer
version launch there should be fingers
crossed content for gamers out there all
over the world to step inside and
experience like they've never
experienced anything before you have to
tell me in your beta tests of this have
you taken it into like counter-strike
have you seen people have like visceral
reactions to playing games this way I I
can't speak to any official games but i
have seen plenty of screaming and
jumping out of chairs it's very
immersive experience and that's
definitely what we're going for okay
I've only been at TS for a few hours and
have already found the product that i
want to take home with me wow this feels
so cool I I guess I all I should say is
check out the technology from oculus
where's your website w WQ less Viacom
and the oculus rift the resolution here
is a lot better but the world there was
really cool for continued coverage of
all things see as head to revision 3.com
as soon as we want to go back in the
game now
sink is about helping keep you connected
while on the go one of the most useful
features of sync is its ability to
control what you listen to and sync
applink gives you the power to control
apps like pandora and slacker radio with
your voice sometimes going to listen to
your own tunes well sink makes it so
easy it gives you hands-free control of
your music files for your digital music
player USB Drive or other compatible
devices and even better if you ask it to
play similar music sync even uses your
own tunes to make a playlist thanks
again to ford from powering this hack
