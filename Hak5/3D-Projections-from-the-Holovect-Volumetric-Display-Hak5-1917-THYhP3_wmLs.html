you by domain.com hello and welcome to
hack 5 and today we have a very special
treat because I made from hello vex is
here to join us how are you doing ma'am
I'm very excited there I'm I'm just like
my mind is blown because we weren't
expecting to have you on and then
suddenly Tom Merritt calls and we see
some some stuff on Kickstarter and next
thing you know here we are yeah it's
it's all about the dichotomy of things
how things get together yes Wow huh okay
we should probably preface all of this
by saying that we are talking about the
howl of act which is a device that
creates as you can see Holograms is that
is that accurate it's they're coming and
known as Holograms but basically it's a
3d projection and in space a hologram is
a very specific it's a specific thing so
we're trying to be careful about that
but it will do what you know r2d2 does
okay hopefully I mean so well what
differentiates well I consider a
hologram versus other forms of typical
3d imagery well a hologram is actually a
recording of interference patterns
usually on a glass plate glass
photographic plate so you can see into
it and you'll see a complete 3d object
what we consider Holograms and in
fiction are these volumetric projections
and and that's what this machine does
that's that's that's what we're we're
trying to make so this right here is a
true volumetric display yes we've seen
things like this in the past things like
from SIGGRAPH we've seen for example
electro holographic displays and things
of that nature how does this differ well
the first thing it does it's it's
completely in space second you can touch
it it's not a it's a it's not a it's not
gonna cut your finger off
it's it's not making plasma in the air
with with infrared lasers you can
actually draw in a you know
and a cube that is about 10 centimeters
cubed and we have 200 by 200 by 200
voxels and that that volume that you can
address when you say voxels should I
think about this like pixels yeah think
of a little if a pixel is a little
square this is a little box it's a
little cute it's a tiny tiny look you
because what you're painting right now
is you're painting this shape and if I
kind of dancing around and it's moving
in XY and Z and and that's just done
with lots of these points yes basically
the main data structure is vectors in
space 3d vectors and you start with the
head of a vector and then you go to the
tail and as you go you're eliminating of
individual voxels along the way it makes
it a straight line okay so you're not
like drawing pixel pixel pixel pixel
it's more like a vector X display like
if you've ever played asteroids like a
true asteroids in the arcade and The
Tempest if you were born in the 80s you
would know that that so you're actually
just drawing a line yes we're drawing
lines that lines in in three spaces so
because it's easier are you actually
using the laser here to like excite some
element here to actually create the
refraction or or what's actually what
why am I seeing something there okay
would imagine we take air and we modify
it we tweak tweak a little bit of
humidity you took a little bit of
temperature and we make it different
from the air around it and then we
control it very precisely so that we we
can put a voxel where we want it and the
laser knows it and when it finds the
modified air it illuminates it diffracts
it creates a an image yeah you say on
your Kickstarter page that you're
basically modifying the albedo right
that's a term I wasn't familiar with
that's the refraction coefficient of the
air you're you're modifying the the
reflec refractive index and in the
tivity of the air you're just making it
basically a the reason why a beam of
light deflects when it goes into glass
and stuff like that is because there's a
difference between two two spaces so
there's an interface and when it goes
through an interface of changes this is
what we're doing we're making some air
react to light differently from the rest
of it and and it just you know works
that's so cool okay well you know
science rad I have to ask though if what
you're what you're doing is you're just
changing kind of the the properties of
the air around here one what on earth is
allowing you to have you say 256 by 256
and then what on the z axis is it
infinite or how does that work well it
can be its we're drawing in 200 by 200
by 200 it on the z axis you can go a
little bit higher but it gets messy and
basically our air patterns become
unpredictable and so you don't know what
you're gonna draw up there yeah so with
this work if I were like in Orlando or
Miami or some of those other like really
humid places it we have tested a lot of
different conditions there's some that
are a little bit harder than others but
we have tested it in in Austin during a
rainstorm and Arizona and Palm Springs
so it should work in all these places
okay so I have to know all the techie
details because this box
this whole assembly here is gorgeous
tell me about what's inside and what's
making this happen what are the elements
okay because this is nothing like like a
CRT or anything else I've ever seen in
displays we we have given names to
different areas we call this the stage
okay and that's where all the action
happens and we call this part the
emitter and within within the the box is
a an Edison
I know what to call it the Intel board
right yeah so like I don't know what are
what's a computer anymore right right it
Edison has a atom working at 500
megahertz and a a quark microcontroller
all together acting so that you know we
can connect things and and and interface
with it and it has built-in Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth so the idea is that people can
take this device and you know teach it
to do things program it to do a lot of
the concerns maybe control it with the
phone maybe maybe make a game right that
sort of thing it sounds a lot more a lot
beefier than the kind of micro
controllers that use tend to see inside
little Internet of Things devices how do
I that brings me to how do I interface
with it if I run a programmer if I'm
like a game developer if I'm a CAD I
mean I see that there's a lot of
applications for this I want to see my
cab come to life how do I there's a gap
there's several several ways of doing it
one you can connect directly to it by a
USB connect to a computer you can also
reach the Edison by Wi-Fi and and
actually modify it and go into the is
there like a desktop environment is
actually there is a desktop environment
it's running Linux and you can actually
reach it and and my five kernel from
there if you want to before and also on
top of it it's set up to run arduino ide
so anybody who who likes play with an
Arduino can say so you could like send a
sketch to it yep okay you can that's
what I do most the time and sending
sketch
you can also we're also working on an
SDK of where you're gonna have a library
for Arduino that you don't need to know
anything about the lasers or the stage
working all you need to do is give it
you know a XYZ coordinate and then
another XYZ coordinate for to define a
vector and you can make objects and
combine them and move them so they're
like a file format where if I'm familiar
with Maya or some other auto
product and I want to then you know take
that and have it displayed I just have
to convert all of those points yeah you
can you can directly import vectors from
from you know a straighter or Maya or
something like that the only thing is
that you have to remember that you're
making an object out of individual lines
and so you have to keep that in mind if
it becomes too complex it goes into this
very cool lag effect where some some
parts are lit up and others aren't and
it's oscillating what is it like why is
that well since your your your drawing
the individual lines you're drawing the
individual vectors the laser has to go
to a place and then go to another one
and go back and forth so if you go
beyond a certain amount you're gonna
have some lag so is it kind of like a
refresh rate it's like IRA fleshly but
for example large objects large complex
complex objects tax it a little bit more
small less complex objects are easier
for it so what's actually then inside
this part with the laser what would you
have like a mirror something that's
getting to there's there's a mirror
assembly there again controlled by the
computer it aims laser there's also some
detection components that that can can
detect where what the laser is going to
get a reflection oh so it's not actually
a one-way street it's not just sending
the beam hoping for the best no no no it
knows precisely where the the reflector
is at all times very cool so so it's not
inconceivable that one could actually
program pong for that yes actually that
that that would be awesome and if
anybody wants to program pong we would
really appreciate it and we're happy to
to show it there's other interesting
things you could do you could do 3d pong
for sure but you can also do what I call
black hole pong where you have a object
in the center that will deflect your
your ball or your your pong back and
forth and if you go to close it can spin
around
that's what thing Oh that that would be
really neat because here you're working
in three three dimensions so so tell me
what are some of the technical
challenges that your you're facing right
now as I see you're like deep into the
prototype yes well one of the more
interesting technical challenges is
actually drawing in polar coordinates
what do you mean by that well the laser
system actually uses angles instead of
XY and Z so so for some of the demos I
actually had to go back to you know
tenth grade math and try to try to
figure out how to do that but thankfully
we have we have our librarian procedures
to do that for us now but that was that
was interesting okay so you've already
done the heavy lifting where you know
you could just treat it as yes as a 3d
space just and then your libraries
handles the rest yes no no no
trigonometry needed nice but it was it
was kind of challenging for a little
while also refresh rate this is one of
the things we want to do and and we
recently developed this interesting
optimization procedure that I think it's
going to help us make more and more
complex drawings well what do you mean
by that like when you say complex
drawings well again the S is sense now
it's doing the vector drawing and we are
working on an optimization protocol
where it it can actually do raster so
basically 3d TV
oh yeah it's it's it's still early
stages but everybody who gets one will
will get updated
we're not interesting because it's just
kind of like a driver thing yes yeah I
know that when I throw like a raster and
to say my laser cutter it's sitting
there going but it's just it or this and
takes forever whereas like you know
obviously a vector if I tell it to draw
a circle it just draws a circle it
doesn't have to sit there scan lining
right thank and and for most
applications the vectors are going to be
great and they're easy
but maybe somebody has a very complex
scene or maybe somebody we've had
increase from from artists so maybe they
want to make something with some
gradients or something like that and and
and this will help them yeah that's what
I really want to know what are some of
the practical applications that you see
for this it's or maybe start with what
was the first one that you thought like
what did you want to see
well the story of it takes me to two to
the day that I called the breakthrough
happen it's it's they got a single dot
and I remember seeing and just looking
at it and the first thing I thought is
is buttons and controls you know you
know touch instead of touching a screen
you can touch in the air and stuff and
and actually a cousin of mine is it
works in the medical field and he says
that that that would be awesome for a
lot of medical applications because a
lot of bacteria get transmitted by
touching panels elevators ATMs stuff
like that so you could have like a
little layer I love that hair but it is
it is surprising it's it's it reminds me
a little bit of the laser when they
first made the first laser visible laser
nobody knew well what they were gonna do
with it you know there was no
applications they were it was it was a
nice little experiment and I think I
think there's a little bit of that here
where it is an open canvas people will
be able to do with it what they want
well that's one of the things I want to
see you you seem to be going that kind
of like open source approach to this the
very maker focused with your Kickstarter
we should mention we're by I mean this
you've taken this apart from me and I've
seen like wow this is something that you
could print with a 3d printer and cut
with a CNC and put together all those
parts of you have access to the laser
cutter and things like that yeah no this
this this was designed specifically to
be made by makers mm-hmm it it was all
the parts are either laser-cut 3d
printed or CNC router the idea is is is
that it
we did it for a number of reasons one
was so that we can have a very basic kit
which we have as one of the rewards
where you just get the electronics and
some of the very hard to print component
and then you can go ahead and make it
you could also make it into the shape
any shape you want like you know you
could make it into an astromech droid
maybe help me obi-wan Kenobi
yeah and the other reason is so that we
can scale very fast
you know we it can be made in many
facilities all over the place without
needing to have tooling
right by the same token if if you need
to replace a part because you know
there's somewhere or something you can
do it easily and you can just go and
have it reprinted so you're going with
the whole homebrew route just like back
in the day when we would build computers
yeah and it's that that's the idea and
and and I'm actually a big fan of those
days and and and you know some of the
this is my my personal unit in and it
has the wood because it must know it
absolutely looks gorgeous so there's
something very 1970s pong Apple to
happening here and I love what's going
on it's got a little bit of a it looks
like it should be on Darth Vader's death
as well for someone but you know there's
that so I must know though how long then
will it be until we are playing
holographic chess with a Wookiee I don't
know about the wookie part but I think
holographic chess is is coming very very
soon and and if we do have work ease of
course you have to let them we'll let
them win yep yeah yep that's that's good
advice from us to you yes the wookie win
yeah so I must know what we're can
people find out more information about
this get all the nitty-gritty details
get involved in the Kickstarter yes it
sounds like you're trying to bring this
to the people and the major sense that's
exactly what we're trying to do we're
trying to get them out there and have
people make things for them we've spent
a lot of time thinking about the
technology and we don't we we don't have
as much time to see what can be done and
we want to see people do it well that's
the beauty is you know you do the heavy
lifting of figuring out the libraries
and then
can stand on the shoulders of giants and
that's the open source way and then it
cannot become iterative and get better
and better yeah so definitely visit the
Kickstarter page I think we have a tiny
tiny tiny dot CC / hall-effect h o
l.o.v.e c t okay and you can also visit
Halawa calm cool it's a great name - I
love that it's it's short for
holographic vector display okay
however it also yeah it's cool
it's almost like GNU is not UNIX though
because the hollow of act isn't a
hologram nope nope but it looks like one
no and and and the things that you
project our bets yeah they're not
Holograms although they look like Melda
grams well it looks awesome thank you
for bringing it here for somebody with
my love this dude I'm a check it out on
Kickstarter check it out on the
Twitter's where are you on Twitter at
10:00 sir GOG at 10:00 sir guy alright
we'll see you guys later
if you've been watching act 5 for a
while you know how much we love domain
Comdr our go-to place to register all
sorts of domains and lately we've been
having a lot of fun with a new top-level
domain and that is dot Club domain.com
told us about it we're very excited
because so many amazing ideas are very
club related you may not think so but
you must realize that one clubs are
universally and globally understood it's
not just here in the US and - if you're
building a new business or a startup
it's really a perfect name right now
because it is like the ultimate social
domain and what is the internet if not
about building community and
collaboration so you guys could all
collaborate on a dot Club about how
terrible my haircut is or lack thereof
you could do that right now because it's
a fantastic time to get yourself a dot
Club all you have to do is head over to
domain.com slash club and register one
they start at $9.99 a year there's
bajillions available already and get
this just because your hack 5 viewer you
get to use the special coupon code hak5
that saves you 15% off and let's do a
comm know all
about it and matter of fact why don't
you tweet at domain.com and let us know
let them know how much you appreciate
them supporting hak5 for all these years
so when you think domain names think
domain.com that's just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack 5 but before
we get going you're not you're not
Shannon I waited for the operation
Shannon - Kevin that's what happened now
uh you know surprise visits awesome to
see you as always
pleasure to see you as always yeah and
you know what yours this here to grab
some toys toys this wasn't the episode
we're gonna supposed to announce this
but you know whatever check out the site
you'll find out of a new pineapple Wi-Fi
pineapple goodness and more on that
later and actually you'll see tons of us
tons from us throughout the channel
throughout the week but but you know I'm
glad to see you down here I'm excited
because I heard a rumor that you're
working on a new book yep that's called
the art of invisibility and the book is
how the average person can protect their
privacy because people don't know about
signal we do in a normal book nor me
book oh that's fantastic
security for muggles that's right like
privacy for dummies right so it's really
how the average person on the street
like I know so many people that have
iPhones and androids they don't even
have a passcode to protect their phone
you know they don't people don't know
about encryption they don't know about
tools like that Moxie built like signal
or tor or tails or what even a VPN is so
basically we're gonna we're going to go
from the you know talk about all the
different devices that could actually
monitor what you're doing like even like
Barbie dolls these days for kids oh my
god that was monitor the conversation
hey your Forex thing to the next level
nobody knows this stuff right so I'm
gonna cover like all this kind of cool
stuff and then at the end of the book is
like how do you get like really good
invisibility and that's been the hardest
part because I've been researching like
back in the 90s how I was able to get in
disabilities yeah clone cellphones right
and through hacking the phone company
and being able to make myself look like
I was anywhere else I wanted to be right
yeah it's hard today you can't even find
a payphone no good none of the tones
work so or access to a switch without
breaking the law right so
now you're looking at like how do you
separate you from your IP address on
that first entry to the Internet and how
do you build up layers of security so
it's hard to track you back so but do it
in a legal way you're talking about
prepaid devices you're talking about VPN
you're talking about you know doing hard
you have an email address but I know
they need a phone number they need a
phone number so everyone anyway like
it's not even just like Yahoo and
Microsoft and Google but it's like Lycos
who is Lycos anymore no kidding in yeah
and the thing you used to be able to do
is like you can go to these sites that
have telephone numbers like they're
called free SMS sites and you can
actually put in the phone number that
they temporarily happen you could use
and you can do your verification that
way oh nice and now they got smarter and
they're actually dating that list those
also so then the solution becomes you
take cash you use it to buy a gift Visa
Card
right there's a gift card like the
drugstore and then you use that to go
get a SIM card from t-mobile because
thank you think about that yeah would
you go get when you go get that prepaid
card are you on a camera oh right yeah I
think about how did you get to the store
to buy did you use uber yeah are you
using that rent-a-car are using your
Tesla that basically anybody can get you
track your location so you actually have
to think how do you purchase these cars
devices and stuff so you're not going to
easily be pinned so much harder here
about you guys I bought like a hundred
or a hundred plus phones in Missouri or
something prepaids at Walmart
immediately they call the FBI because
they bought too many prepaid super any
pre page and and the whole thing is is
Walmart if you go buy a prepaid and the
government has the serial number and
IMEI they can call they could find out
what Walmart that was purchased at
actually cueing the video we got the
whole video of you bite into the thing
yep yep Wow so I actually probably
buying the Visa gift cards are the same
way so exactly so what in the book is in
the cover is actually how to do it the
safest way possible how do you acquire
the devices to create invisibility now
let's say you have a prepaid a hotspot
right do you like now use your mobile
phone in the same place use the hotspot
no because they're both yeah oh the
boasts the same cell so yeah right and
it's gonna be a modern enough of that
and then it
it's kind of obvious who you are so you
know what it becomes a royal pain in the
butt
uh-huh hey private right yes it really
does it's really hard so a lot of you
know not many people are gonna bother to
do it unless they have a really good
reason but people don't think about all
the different ways you can be caught by
one mistake right right so so the
alternative is so it's it's that is
finding that balance between giving up
all of your privacy and functioning in a
modern society where you're expected to
Facebook and Instagram where else you're
being antisocial for some reason right
or Montana tinfoil hat off the grid
right you have this whole between so
everybody has their different privacy
requirements so we're trying to get to
the medium of the road right but there
is people like journalist maybe activist
and all this sort of thing they should
already know about these tools yeah
right but it's weird I'm trying to cover
each extreme from the middle of the road
that like the average person on the
streets going to really care about where
they care about their pictures on their
phone money in their bank account text
messages with their significant other
and that sort of thing very much right
that's all they really care about right
and then you talk about the part you
know down you talk about you know the
journalists that's gonna interview the
next Snowden - right you know so there's
different level of requirements for that
and the difficult thing is even trying
to explain what PGP or encryption is if
the average you can't do that it doesn't
work
I know security experts so don't use PGP
unless they have to because it's a pain
it is a pain yeah nobody wants to bother
no it's why I have a special laptop for
this so that's what the book is about
the net Wow cool this is amazing right
this is the new form factor for the the
pineapple and I use the pineapple when
I'm doing like my demos and my keynotes
and stuff and this is truly Darin showed
me this today and I'm just really
excited to take this home and play with
it cool right I mean it's like the form
factor is really cool I heard you you
told me about you built a complete new
all new software yeah from the ground
every different interface yeah and my
problem the old pineapple is radio RF
interference so I'd want to listen on
one radio and talk to the Internet on
the other radio and that was always
getting a lot of packet loss and I heard
you did something so out of RFP I'm
really excited we learned a lot play
with this toy
you know really good song yeah yeah yeah
cool well hey thanks for coming down and
checking this out you guys can find out
more about Kevin obviously you should
follow him on Twitter anyways kevin
Mitnick yep twitter.com slash kevin
Mitnick go and and just click on my
links anytime you want it's cool it's
safe just don't even look just click
let's click yeah you'll find links to
the Kickstarter of with the Hall effect
as well as the Wi-Fi pineapple and Kevin
in the show notes below all of them are
safe yes with that so you thought with
that i'm darren kitchen i'm kevin
