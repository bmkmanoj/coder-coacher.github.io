you by Netflix welcome to active the
show where we break down concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morrison today I'm
getting into some more terminal 101 we
have recently covered how to get around
in the Linux terminal changing
directories moving and reading files
just to name some of the tips today I
wanted to get into some extra tips about
the terminal that you may or may not be
familiar with whenever you're working in
the terminal remember that there is a
maximum file name length for any given
file you'll run into some problems if
you are so descriptive that you need
more than 255 characters but let's just
hope that isn't the case anything less
than 80 should pretty much supplies and
keeping your file name lower will make
it not file wrap or word wrap around the
entire screen file names are also case
sensitive so if I wanted to move pick
one dot jpg I would have to make sure
that the P and picked one is correctly
uppercase or lowercase to match the file
in question now like all operating
systems there are certain characters
that can totally confuse the heck out of
shell and you'll want to avoid those
when renaming files for example using a
forward slash board or I guess it would
be this way on the screen in the middle
of your file name will make it think
that you're trying to save a file into a
directory for example if I wanted to
type in I want to remove a file
pineapple guide dot txt it's
automatically going to try to remove a
file called guide txt in the pineapple
directory as mentioned in a previous hat
tip spaces can confuse the shell as well
so instead punch words together in your
file name use quotation marks around
file name or place a backslash after
each word in the fire file name so an
example of this would be
again this file called pineapple guide
instead of writing out pineapple guide
txt what I could also do is put quotes
around it so I have pineapple guide txt
and you can also put a backslash
pineapple backslash guide dot txt in
right after the pineapple the first word
in the actual file name now after the
break we will look at some history
shortcuts but first a word from our

one neat thing about the terminal is
that you can view your history of
commands up to 500 lines so if you've
been moving in renaming files for like
the past hour and you want to run the
same command again you have a few
different kinds of options now history
is a command that will show you each
line that has run up to 500 different
lines back if you want to look at them
all on one screen though you can type
history slash less to use the less
program which will let you view each
page of commands one at a time now let's
check this out
so I can type history and that will show
me an entire list of all the commands
that I've been putting in over the past
like two hours or whatever I can also
type history less and this will show me
by page
I can page down and see everything all
the way so yeah works very nice one two
just run the last command that you did
that's super simple too you can just
type in two exclamation marks press
Enter
actually let me put in a command so it
knows what I'm doing so it shows
something - exclamation marks press
ENTER and there you go you can see that
I recently use the print working
directory one you can also type in an
exclamation mark and whatever the last
number was for that line so when you
looked at the history if you want to
memorize a certain line number that you
wanted to use for a command that you're
going to use in the future you could
type in exclamation mark four nine nine
for the very last command or what have
you whatever number that might be you
can also press the UP button on your
keyboard a few times to find a recently
used command so up up up see I'm using
the history less won a whole lot and you
can also press down a bunch of times to
go back to clearing it out and getting
back to where you started you can always
go back to a command and retype it as
well if there was some kind of mistake
or you can press tab to have it
autocomplete for you I want to run FF
record so I can type dot slash FF and
then tab and it'll fill in the rest of
the line for me some super simple tips
some things you may have already known
and if you didn't there you go now you
know some shortcuts now how do you guys
learn the terminal there's a lot of
handy websites out there that go really
into detail and tons of books as well
tell me about your favorites in the
comments or email me tips at hack five
org and be sure to check out our sister
show hack five for more great stuff just
like this I'll be there reminding you to
