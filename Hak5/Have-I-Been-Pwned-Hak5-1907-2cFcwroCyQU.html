that and more this time on hack five
I've always wondered if I got pwned
or maybe it's owned well to teach us
whether it's owned or pwned today we
have Troy hi Troy it's nice to meet you
how are you thank you very much for
joining us thank you this so first off
is it pwned or owned if you know it's
whatever you want it to be and I've
heard some really really interesting
combinations you know I heard someone on
the news the other day as a news agency
say have I been pruned Prime and I
thought that was cool to shrimp
welcome prawns that an effect was an
American drone take it so Troy hunts you
created have I been poned yeah that's
awesome but you've also done a whole
bunch of other stuff I'm sure
everybody's very familiar with have I
been poem but first off how did you get
into you know computers security because
that's kind of like what have I been
poned is about in a way yeah right well
look I do a lot of developer training so
I've been doing a lot of writing about
security my background as a developer
and what I kept finding is that software
developers I mean we know this right
they don't have a really good grasp on
security this is why we have things like
ever been paid yeah I spend a lot of
time training them I'm an author for
Pluralsight they're an online training
organization so I write a bunch of
training tool for them awesome and I go
to a lot of events and do a lot of
workshops and and talk to a lot of
developers and help them figure out how
not to be pwned
and you're a developer yourself yeah so
my backgrounds development and then
eventually architecture because that's
what you do when you get back Greg it's
okay I came out of a restaurant
hospitality industry seven and I started
doing a hacker show so well there you go
these backgrounds but software
architecture lists it's not the building
building real things I hope that makes
meant that makes a lot more sense yeah
so how did you get the idea of have I
been poned calm so I was looking at a
bunch of different data breaches so I
would see a data breach happen and I'd
do some some research and analysis and
I'd see these patterns where you keep
getting the same people over multiple
data breaches and what's really
interesting is when you sort of start to
piece together all the attributes and
you see the profile that gets built up
about someone yeah because of all these
multiple features with the same person
but I found it really interesting I
thought I wonder how aware people are of
just how broad their exposure is so they
aware that they've been in Adobe and
Gawker and you know whatever else so I
thought that would actually be a really
good project and that would give me a
chance to build something where people
could find this information and again I
look I got to develop a background
building yeah it's fun right and
building big stuff is really fun so when
I started out I had I think about a
hundred and fifty five million accounts
then when I say counselor email
addresses I know it's it's a lot and
this is just the stuff that was easily
obtainable at the time but that's good
because that makes it look like I
shouldn't say good baby it's good and
yeah I wanted to do a bunch of stuff
with Microsoft Azure cloud services and
it's like look if I do it with this then
it's real data and real scale and now
there's about two hundred and twenty
something million accounts in there two
and twenty million three eighty five
thousand two hundred eighty one about
that which would be there right and now
the site you know at really really crazy
times there's millions of people a day
that come and search on it yeah it's
just just gone nuts so when somebody
searches on here so I actually went to
this website once into my friend comes
up behind me and he goes that's awesome
a site that's harvesting tons of email
ya know I sure hope not so harvesting
this comes up a lot and I'm always kind
of amused about it because I'm gonna say
you've come to my site and you grew me
one email address
yeah the full consciousness that there's
two hundred and twenty something million
there and you're worried about me taking
so what would be the point one email
address look if I wanted to harvest them
and
I guess if we say why do people harvest
email addresses well they want to do
things like build spam lists yeah
example I've got 220 million count oh I
have a very very good spam list if I
wanted to probably would so no I don't
harvest
I don't capture and store them anywhere
or anything like that so you know you
come and you search and and that's it
I'm not doing anything okay so what does
happen when somebody puts in their email
address there right so what happens is
it searches two different resources on
the site so we've got the the breaches
and that's the 220 million odd accounts
and every one of those is things like a
debut Ashley Madison where there's been
one big incident I've gone and obtained
that breach from wherever it was
published publicly there are all things
that I mean done publicly oh yeah and I
will load those into the system and I
validate it as well so I make sure that
this was actually a valid incident and
make it up okay so there's that and then
they're also the pace so we have
pastebin where a lot of stuff is just
dumped randomly or just look at
someplace before
okay the weirdest stuff just appears on
paste bin but very often it's a very
early indicator of a compromisers off
because the attackers will grab a subset
of the data they'll dump it there and
just to prove that they have it yeah
it's like a proof so I go through and I
pull the data out of there
on a very very regular basis and in fact
normally it's around about 40 seconds
between something appearing in a paste
and then being searchable oh I'm fine
so when you search find it so quick
magic and look I mean there's it's it's
through a combination of ways but
basically it's it's easy to tell when
there is new content on paste bin and
there are multiple ways of doing that
looking at paste bin there are Twitter
accounts that announce it as well so I I
sort of go across all of those and go
what's the fastest I can get it and then
I put those email addresses into the
system so when you search you're
actually asynchronously searching across
two different sources and then it'll
come back and tell you exposure okay so
yeah you brought up Ashley Madison
actually and I was thinking like what if
somebody finds their email and they want
you to get rid of it like they want you
to delete it off the site yeah look
Ashley Madison is like how does that
play into it exactly it's interesting so
Ashley Madison sort of changed the
landscape a lot for have I been
and I'd say even for data breaches in
general and that this was now like a
massively sensitive class adult you know
this is not if you're in say Adobe
people know you like Photoshop you know
who really cares but if you're in
actually medicine and they either know
or they assume that you're cheating on
your wife like this is a different
scenario and it was always cheating on
the wife there's almost all guys in
there sorry sorry dudes actually guys
and Fembots as well but I think you know
really kids so this is the thing like it
is here's a sensitive piece of data and
what I decided with actually medicine is
not make it searchable by the general
public insofar as I can't go and search
for you and you can't go and search for
your significant other or anything like
that so in terms of protecting
identities I wanted to make sure that
when you search for yourself you have to
get an email back to your address and
show that you've received it and then
you can see well you really okay so
you're very very fine the actually no
dress we're verifying the email okay so
that's a look that was the right thing
to do and because if if you ended up
like deleting started starting to delete
emails off of an entire you know pasted
on the website then you'd have half of
the data that you should actually have
on there it gets really tricky so I sort
of thought the thing to do is to err on
the side of caution and go look this is
sensitive data let's just go all right
you're only gonna be able to see
yourself and interestingly after that
breach happened there are a lot of sites
that popped up and just made it all
publicly searchable not just were you in
there were you not here is all the data
so you know this is what you said about
yourself what kind of Lunger a you liked
you know this is all publicly searchable
it it is it is creepy but the really
creepy thing is hearing the stories
about who was searching for it so you
know you would have things like
community members going and searching
for everyone in the postcode and then
putting a list on a bulletin board as
this is so you could imagine in the 15th
century like nailing it up on the church
oh yeah it's like it's like you know the
witch trials like this it is it's like
that and so this is what people been
doing and the interesting thing is a lot
of those have had some form of legal
action against them as well so they've
either had DMCA takedowns which are a
bit questionable but be that as it may
they've had that from
avid life media around social medicine
although looks like there's some other
legal proceedings as well against sites
that were distributing this information
to the public so with the benefit of
hindsight and and there was some
foresight as well I think was a good
idea not making that available I think
that was a good idea so I actually tried
out your site on a few different email
addresses
luckily my main one has not been poned
and this one showed up in a couple of
different places so I like how you set
it up though you tell us like the dates
the email addresses that are available
in the paceman and we can actually see
the paceman over on the paceman site
yeah if I happen to late to expect us
there's a lot of ranting and raving on
pace but isn't there there's a lot of
angry people on pace so angry you have a
bunch of email addresses because they
pubescent that's why not all of them I
hope guys look it's a lot of kids it is
yeah so where do you see this site going
from here because you are a developer so
are you planning to implement new stuff
yeah so there's going in a couple of
directions I mean what's there and
people use freely that you know that'll
keep going yeah there's now sort of a
commercial side of it that I'm working
with various companies with in order for
them to get intelligence mostly about
their customers so particularly things
like identity theft services where
they're trying to build a very broad
profile the risk of their user base and
they're looking at things like you know
other credit inquiries and so on for the
customer but they see an upside for
being able to say well has my customer
being exposed and data breach or are
they appearing in lots of pace yeah and
this effectively white labels the
service so they can get notifications
when their customers are impacted so I'm
doing some good things there there's
there's some organizations using that
with with many tens of millions of
customers they monitor and that's kind
of cool too and the site's totally free
to use so Kim people people can donate
to you i zoom yes I'm afraid of the
night there's a yeah bitcoins with
paypal and there's an API as well as a
free API so if anyone's to build on top
of it and you want to sort of integrate
it into your system and do whatever
awesome things you can come up with cool
cool
all right well where can people find you
if they have
other questions I am at Troy hunt on
Twitter and I am Troy hunter comes off
and everything leads in from there
thanks so much and I'm gonna check all
of my co-workers email addresses now
