an F for privacy encryption for cameras
make it so yeah who's breached accounts
hit the billions and a new malvert izing
campaign hits sites coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for tuesday
December twentieth 2016 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom a quick shout out to
our patrons over at patreon.com / threat
wire especially at this time of year I
just wanted to say thank you for your
contributions you fund the making of the
show so thank you so much for letting us
bring you security news every single
week our first story is all about HTTPS
HTTPS is quite the standard for online
browsing as it offers users some privacy
when they visit sites it offers website
security especially when logging into
pages and when you use payment details
on sites which by the way can I mention
it is really fun to capture packets
while you're browsing to see what sites
are transmitting your login credentials
and plain text I do that sometimes I
know it's weird also HTTPS protected
journalistic sources whenever they are
trying to get in touch with news outlets
HTTPS can also help with preventing
authoritarian censorship of sites and it
can help stop content modification like
packet injection and it can help with
speeding up websites well there is a new
site by the freedom of the press
foundation and they are looking to help
spur the adoption of HTTPS across new
sites to better help users but also to
protect real news outlets as well as
journalists from potentially dangerous
occurrences at their new site secure the
dot news you can view a leaderboard of
new sites and whether or not they have
adopted HTTPS and if it's the default
and if h st s is preloaded for the site
h st s is HTTP strict Transport Security
which prevents sites from downgrade
attacks that can change them from https
to http allowing for in secure browsing
which we do not want so h st s is a good
thing only one site at this time of
recording gets an A+ for their use of
privacy practices
with a few closely following behind but
they still got a little bit of work to
do now this isn't the first face slap
that we have seen two websites that
don't use encryption it is a step in the
right direction though we have seen
similar sites like this pop up for
tracking Canaries as well as tracking
which sites use two-factor
authentication or multi-factor
authentication I would love to hear what
you think too in the comments below from
my this is something I would totally
support because I go to hacker cons with
my camera for my podcast pile an open
letter was signed by over 150
documentary filmmakers and
photojournalists for the most popular
camera companies including nikon sony
canning olympus and fuji the request is
simply to add encryption to cameras this
news also comes from the freedom of the
press foundation in which filmmakers and
journalists outlined the harsh realities
about their filming border security
guards local police etc and more attempt
to seize video equipment countless times
and while it is easy to encrypt an
external hard drive so that film is
secure it is not so easy to encrypt an
SD card that was just recorded onto and
is still in your camera and the same
thing goes for actual film journalists
don't have a way to remotely lock or
encrypt a camera and it's footage if it
is seized or stolen and in many cases
the outcome could be detrimental to
getting the truth out to the public when
it comes to film cameras there really is
no way to encrypt them so digital
cameras is best but the task wouldn't be
easy but manufacturers would have the
support from the freedom of the press
foundation in making this a reality we
would love to see this happen so guys
make it so I think we all just need to
take a moment of silence for Yahoo no
actually no I really don't think we need
to do that remember when Yahoo was like
500 million user accounts had data's
stolen just like three months ago or
four months ago yeah this time it's even
more no it's not a few more million its
1 billion accounts that's B as in Bravo
is an alpha Bravo Charlie yes B 1
billion accounts more these are not
including the first 500 million 1
billion
counts more have been stolen in a
completely separate incident that
happened in August of 2013 data stolen
in the hack includes email addresses
names phone numbers dates of birth md5
hash passwords and encrypted and
unencrypted security questions and
answers attackers have also forged
cookies allowing them to log into
accounts without passwords but yahoo has
already invalidate a--does the attack
may be a state-sponsored actor connected
to the breach of 500 million accounts
previously happened so what can you do
if you do have a yahoo account change
your password change your security
questions and make sure to add
two-factor authentication make sure that
you don't use your yahoo password
anywhere else in oh yeah you may just
want to consider moving off of yahoo
completely there are plenty of other
email service providers just last week I
discussed a type of malware hitting
banner advertisements on legitimate
sites called stiga know which uses
steganography to hide itself in ads
distributed across popular websites this
week another type of malware is being
used in a malfoy tising campaign that
doesn't hit a user's computer oh no but
it goes directly for vulnerable routers
whenever a user clicks these ads it
takes them to a site hosting dns changer
which is an exploit kit that remotely
infects routers with crappy passwords
and firmware dns change your target
specific IP addresses routers so if your
router IP address isn't in that range it
doesn't get exploited but if it is the
exploit is hidden in a PNG image and it
redirects the user to a site hosting dns
changer there a second image is infected
with malware and the router gets
infected so if the router doesn't have
default credentials or it isn't easily
exploited the malware is aborted but
vulnerable routers include the d-link
DSL 2740 are the netgear are 62 hundred
and plenty more so what do you do to
defend against these ads well you could
run an ad blocker but now new sites are
blocking article viewing for just doing
that so you could also run the most
up-to-date firmware possible on your
router you can use a long password on
your router and you can disable remote
administration thank you again for
becoming patrons of threat wire you can
