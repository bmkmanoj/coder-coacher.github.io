Squarespace welcome to hat tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas i'm your host Shannon Morse and
today I'm looking the how to safely and
securely delete and restore your files
now deleting your files is really easy
right you just delete something with a
flick of the wrist and it goes to your
recycle bin and after a while you empty
the recycling but that's not all there
is to it fortunately in unfortunately
there are some really easy tools you can
use to restore your deleted files which
is why it's really important to securely
delete those files for good so here are
some great tools for both deleting and
restoring your files to restore files
previously deleted from your recycle bin
you can use restoration or Recuva first
of all as restoration run restoration as
an administrator to search deleted files
or even old files on a newly formatted
card or drive this tool is really great
in the fact that it's so simple and
there isn't a download so you can use it
on a flash drive even its cons are it's
not going to find everything and it
doesn't have a vast interface for really
really extensive searches next up is
Rick Yuba recuva also works for
restoration and it can do a simple scan
or a complex one depending on if your
file hasn't been found by previous scans
although this tool does require a
download it is a lot more advanced with
the tech tangle GUI so it can make
search is much easier to dwindle down to
just a few results very nice after the
break I'll check out a couple more tools
that will make erasing a file much more
secure Squarespace is the fast and easy

those blasted files heading delete just
removes the references to that file from
the file list the file is still there
until some data gets written over it and
even then it's still not completely
deleted so you need a good good tool to
finish off those files completely for
good so first off is eraser eraser works
with pretty much any drive on your
machine it's customizable and you can
schedule a races I like that you can
choose the eraser method and you can
replace files with new files to allow
plausible deniability that's cute and my
last choices s delete this command line
tool uses the Department of Defense
standards for securely deleting files
being a simple command line tool s
delete doesn't take up any space and it
runs without issue on pretty much any
windows box it doesn't have the smooth
and our face of eraser but it is
streamlined and it is really simple to
use so do you have a different one for
recovering and deleting files send me a
