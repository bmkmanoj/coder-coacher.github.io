5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to act tip the show will we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are
performing aggressive scans and even
more now first off and map it can be
used to obtain a much more aggressive
scan than the ones that we have seen so
far in our previous hack tips it's very
very simple to do this to you simply add
an extra little script and you're good
to go
so let's go ahead and try this out on my
computer I'll go ahead and pull up one
of my terminals I have two grunting and
I'll show you why in just a few moments
but first off let's go ahead and do this
aggressive scan to do this you type in
nmap tech capital a progressive and then
whatever you're wanting to scan so I'm
going to scan 10.7 a 3.31
dot 64 and I'm going to go ahead and run
it so while this is running in the
background let me go ahead and tell you
a little bit about what an aggressive
scan is so these simply put together
some of the most popularly used commands
in nmap into one command for you to type
so it just makes it easier it uses
commands such as tak o tak s capital C
tech tech traceroute and some others
we'll go into all of these very soon on
hacked tip but for now just simply know
that Oh works for operating system
detection which is pretty cool tak s
capital C runs several scripts inside of
nmap once such as speed and verbosity
and then traceroute is just that it is a
traceroute now when running the scan
which will take a lot longer and you can
tell in the background because of the
extra scripts involved you'll receive
back a whole bunch of strange looking
fingerprint information so let's go
ahead and wait for this to go ahead and
finish so once that's done it'll pull up
a bunch of information about the thing
that I'm trying to scan and it does take
about like two three minutes for it to
finish
there we go okay so if you are watching
this you see that I ran two commands the
first one look like this it was nmap Tek
a 1070 330 1.64 and the second one I ran
was 74 so the reason for that is I
wanted to show you the difference
between the two first one I ran was a
printer which really doesn't give us a
lot of information if I scroll up and
look at that command right here okay so
we see a whole bunch of fingerprinting
information but otherwise we just get
what we normally would with a regular
nmap scan if I scroll back down to this
one 74 this one is running our Nass and
it gives us some really interesting
facts such as the name of our Nass which
is the Synology dis station and if I
scroll down you can see that there it is
HTML title Synology z-- dis station and
we can also see things such as the open
ports with a little bit more information
so you can see right here we have
OpenSSH 5.8 running on this open port 2
- 2 - as well as the printer work group
a workgroup and whatnot you can even see
this really interesting part down a
little bit further let me see if I can
find it for you it's kind of funny oh
there they are right here I've
highlighted it for you the SSH host key
with DSA and RSA encryption that's
really funny I just enjoy being able to
see all those interesting facts about
different things on the network it can
really help if you're worried about
somebody breaking in from externally
into your network and trying to make
sure that things are you know secure
like they should be now after the break
I'm going to go ahead and jump over to
netcat yeah we're bringing back in that
cat we're going to have some fun with
that but first let's go ahead and thank
our sponsor the hack shop is hack 5s
premier store for all of your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard it
type scripts into a computer crazy crazy
fast like this week's pick from water
pistol in the forums so this very very
simple script is used to change the
wallpaper on an OSX Mavericks computer
it's very very easy to use and it's
short so it's a really great one to
start off on also congrats to water
pistol on your first script excellently
written now of course we couldn't do the
show without your support so we would
like to thank you with something very
special you can use the coupon code
snubs with any order in the hack shop
for your very own hack tip sticker isn't
that cute and I even signed it for you
thank you so much for supporting the
show we'll be right back we're back and
we promise to bring you some netcat
action so here goes if i nmap our
network obviously we already know how to
use this so I'm going to go ahead and
type it in its nmap 10 dot 73 31.0 slash
24 that's the site or cidr notation so
I'm going to let this run in the
background basically what it's going to
find is dot six four so ten dot 73 31.6
for which just happens to be an HP
printer with telnet open on port 23 here
we go
alright so it's updated for us so I'm
going to scroll up so I can look through
here and see all sorts of fun things so
here it is oh look at that
telnet sopin on for 23 hmm what can I do
now so let's think in netcat we learned
how to log into a port so if i open
netcat on my computer i'll just type NC
10 dot 70 3.31
dot and that was 64 and the port which
is 23 and click enter I am now in telnet
debugging we just tell NetID into our HP
computer so fun so now I can just type
in all sorts of different things that I
can do in telnet so I could try PWD and
I see nothing all right that's boring
let's try LS ok so we have some folders
let's see what what are these
directories cloud eprint IPP
that's interesting let's try ePrint
actually CD ePrint and if I LS now I can
see let's see
okay so we have debug settings error
codes cloud config I can show settings
so I'm going to type show settings so I
can see the settings of the computer if
I see D period period get back to home
LS again let's see I'll go into cloud /
wild LS and here I get a whole bunch of
fun things I can do let's see I can set
cloud cert validation custom settings I
can set the serial number oh that's fun
print print instruction page okay so if
I had this printer installed on my
computer instruction page CSS printer is
not registered but if you do have it
registered you could pretty much print
from the terminal because why not this
is so fun I got so excited when I
figured that out that I could easily do
this with two programs that I just
recently learned and researched how to
use it's super exciting and I love being
able to integrate what I've learned into
a hack tip like this so yay
I learned something fun and I want to
see what you guys have been doing with
nmap as well because this is really cool
I love being able to take netcat and use
my example with nmap and just you know
have some enjoyment out of it seems you
can always send me a comment below or
you can email us over at tips at hack 5
org we check them all we may not be able
to reply but you know we're busy so if
you like add map perhaps you will also
enjoy our new show with Moo bik's which
is called Metasploit and minute it's
over at youtube.com slash hack 5 and
hack 5 org and be sure of course to
check out our sister show hack 5 we've
been having a lot of fun with antennas
definitely check that out I'll be
reminding you over there to trust your
titanal list see you next
