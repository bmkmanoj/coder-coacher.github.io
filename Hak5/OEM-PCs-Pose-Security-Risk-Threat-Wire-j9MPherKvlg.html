security risks more passwords have been
owned than ever before have 100 grand to
spend there's a zero day for that and so
much more all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for June
first 2016 your summary of the threats
to our security privacy and Internet
freedom first off our main podcast hak5
is up for a podcast award so if you are
a fan of hak5 or a member of Diamond
Club check hat T 2 T 2 T you for a whole
slew of podcasting friends that we are
voting for I've never tried to win an
award for hak5 but some of our friends
nominated us so we figured we would give
a shot I mean heck we've been doing the
show for 10 years so why not unto the
news first being about laptops and PCs
do you want a laptop from dell HP acer
lenovo or asus all of these laptop
manufacturers or OEMs for short have
serious security flaws in their built-in
update processes straight from the
warehouse the team at duo security
conducted an investigation into these
OEMs to find out what kind of
vulnerabilities are exploitable a full
PDF file of the report has been posted
on duo com the gist of it is that these
manufacturers ship their laptops and pcs
with pre-installed updaters which is
completely normal all of which have at
least one flaw that could enable remote
code execution attacks on a victim
computer an easy to understand guide is
available to view showing that Dell was
more secure than acer and asus and
lenovo has both a terrible security
practice and a really good one depending
on which software was chosen to be used
digitally signing their listings of
files was missing from most of the
vendors which an attacker can use to
their advantage to start a
man-in-the-middle attack against a
victim some OEMs did not send updates
over HTTPS while Dell did send over
HTTPS while also signing certificates on
the other side of the coin asus sends
unsigned file list called manifest over
plain HTTP
with an easily decrypted key now while
Dell HP and Lenovo had reachable support
who answered the questions of the
researchers and have already or are
working towards implementing fixes acer
and asus have failed to release any
fixes this study highlights a huge
problem with OEM software unnecessary
programs on a new computer come
pre-installed with security problems out
of the box ie bloatware the best way to
mitigate the problem anytime you get a
new computer just completely wipe the
crap out of it and reinstall your
operating system of choice with zero
bloatware if you had an account with
myspace linkedin tumblr or fling a few
years ago you might want to make sure
that you haven't been using that same
password on multiple sites so here's the
thing each of these breaches happened in
the early 2010's fling was in 2011
linkedin in 2012 tumblr in 2013 and then
myspace happened sometime between 2007
and 2012 so this means that the millions
of passwords that were stolen were
sitting in the dark until may of 2016
and there were over 600 million
passwords stolen one all for breaches
were up for grabs on the dark web so
that happened in May now obviously our
first means of defense is to ensure that
your password is different on each in
every site that you use and if you still
own any of those accounts just you know
change your password as soon as possible
now in a blog post on Monday the owner
of have I been pwned calm and that's
owned with a P Troy hunt noticed
patterns between each of these different
for hacks age size and release timing
and it brings up an unsettling thought
there could easily be more breaches from
that time period that haven't gone
public so our websites aware of the
breaches and just not sharing the
information with their users or are they
completely unaware that these events are
happening on their servers either way
it's kind of bad on May 11 trustwave
security services noticed a seller name
buggy Corp selling a zero-day for
Windows PCs on the dark web for ninety
thousand dollars this zero-day
vulnerability is said to have the
ability to give admin rights to an
attacker on any
windows2000 up to windows 10 machine
even with a fully patched operating
system now while this could be a total
fake the seller offered an independent
escrow agent through the forum to verify
it that it works before payment is
actually made now he or she also
includes two videos showing the zero day
in action allowing local privilege
escalation on a windows pc now microsoft
currently knows about the sale and while
they haven't attempted to actually buy
the zero day they have notably stressed
their bug bounty program which pays out
up to a hundred thousand dollars which
is up from 50,000 before i go and want
to give a huge thanks to everyone who
has supported the show so far on patreon
