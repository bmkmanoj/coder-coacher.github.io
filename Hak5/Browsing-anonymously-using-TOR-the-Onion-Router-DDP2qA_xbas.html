us how to be anonymous on the internet
on the internet on their internet yeah
that's it I'll go cool so you can talk
to us a little bit about tor tor now
what is tor I don't know it's The Onion
Router actually okay then so it stands
for The Onion Router correct where'd
that come from originally from the Navy
and then they dropped the project and
the AFF picked it up and made it public
so everybody can use it the Electronic
Frontier Foundation correct and we just
raised nearly three thousand dollars for
them we did way to go 880 things yeah
right on there you go so it's a way to
be anonymous on the internet but how
does that really work well it works
through nodes basically serves it's just
another word for it and you the client
connect to these nodes from A to B to C
to B and then out through E and that
kind of like kind of like routers on the
Internet
correct so say like you were trying
you're a the client right and you're
trying to talk to D the server right and
you have to go through B and C right but
B doesn't know about D and C doesn't
know about a correct because your phone
it's like cert has no logs at all well
that's great so of like the FBI were to
subpoena one of those routers they
wouldn't know anything right that's
pretty cool now how does that affect
network performance well right now since
there's not very many people actually
being serviced no one's being nice about
it it's really dagger data because it's
so populated so so many people are
actually being the clients and and
taking control of services but not being
the server's themselves okay so you'd
suggest that more people look into
actually becoming notes a matter awesome
so this sounds like it's not really a
good way if you'd like to be anonymous
doing things like BitTorrent trying to
get the latest movie from some minis no
about something it it's not a good way
to naanum eyes you're right on traffic
right you're not gonna max out your
total download speed okay family well
what kind of traffic can you use over
tor you know you can use anything that
uses Sox has the ability you sucks you
know tor doesn't actually create a Sox
server but it uses the same
communication so game so all your RFC's
or your users are you can use IRC on
obviously the web browser and
I don't see FTP and email great so all
those things can easily go through the
tour router okay and tor is
cross-platform I'm assuming yes it is
linux freebsd windows anything
open-source yeah so you know it's been
audited and then served it's secure
great now you've also got with you hear
a live distro is it Linux or FreeBSD BSD
distro called anonymous with a dot
between the ons okay so it's just called
anonymous right but it's like an
anonymous OS right that's kind of right
and what's in this distribution well
it's it's really nice because as soon as
you boot it up it asks you a couple
questions to set up your wired or
wireless and just yes/no CB all those
different options and then you're set up
on a tour and then our FreeBSD distro so
no configuration for your socks no
anything like that and all you have to
do is open up your web browser and your
through tool so it doesn't have like a
set of tools built into it yeah
your initial BSD tools but it also has
Firefox on game IRC IRS SC and different
Thunder burden okay so you've got a
great suite of Internet applications
right already on the CD you boot up and
it's automatically on the Tor network
you know it's anonymous right and the
cool thing is if you're at a friend's
house you don't have administrative
access you can easily just boot off this
doesn't matter if you're at school at
work you're always BAM you've got your
own tool kit they'll get you on the
internet anonymously yeah now what kind
of courses does that use them well
initially it runs over ninety ninety-one
and most people block that so tor has
actually gone on to 80 and 443 okay so
you're a basic web and SSL everybody has
to have that open so it's good great
so if people would like to find out more
about tor and about anonymous where's
your dad
Tory ffo org is where you can find tour
but anonymous is there's a long stint
long URL and we'll have it in the show
notes probably great down here way so if
you're interested in being anonymous on
the internet and would like to check out
these awesome cross-platform open-source
and also free Linux live or BSD live
distribution see
I know the the Brooklyn he was gonna
flame me now but go ahead and hit up the
shownotes hack five org Rob thanks so
much for joining us Rob thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
