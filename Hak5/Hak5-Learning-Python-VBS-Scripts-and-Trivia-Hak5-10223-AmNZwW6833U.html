by jack threads shannon before we check
port 995 or 993 for SSL IMAP I figured
that I would mention since we were
talking about code Academy yes learn
python.org
is kind of a similar experience except
it's learning Python which is a great
programming language for beginners it's
not going to award you badges and it
doesn't have all the social sharing
functions but I like those and it's a
little bit rough around the edges but
here's the thing if you go through yours
you're gonna have a basic understanding
of like the way syntax works and things
of that nature
and you definitely should because it's
like learning to speak a foreign
language the more languages you learn
the easier it is to learn many more and
you don't want to get stuck where like
every ball you know is JavaScript and
everything slippage yeah I understand
the app camera so what I just wanted to
point out down here is like the way that
it works is you'll get your tutorial up
at the top and then there's these code
windows at the bottom and it'll give you
a challenge like you're supposed to make
this a hello world and this says goodbye
world so you did you just change that to
a hello you'd hit run and then you can
move on to the next chapter or like in
this one you have to like set some
variables I think you're supposed to say
like my string equals hello you're
supposed to say my float you're supposed
to make sure that it ends up equaling 10
is a 10 point Oh or you could put it
within float thingy it explains how
those works and then you know you
continue on and you if you run it and it
doesn't compile it get an error yes so
it's not it's similar to the one that
I'm doing because it'll give me a
reference error if I if I forget to put
quotes around something I'm not gonna
say I don't think any of these are a
substitute for a good book but as far as
like lowering the level of like
intimidation and just like breaking that
ice so that you're like oh this isn't
scary at all cuz once you learn a couple
of commands and a couple of functions
and whatnot you start like you can start
recognizing the code and you're like oh
I know what that is here's the thing I
don't actually know Python that well but
I can fake it like for example this code
here that was sent in from a fan who
sent us this Python script you want to
this is actually who this is that is
related so hey Zeus wrote I really like
the USB rubber ducky I just got it today
and have been playing with an all
evening slash night I was fascinated by
the base64 ASCII to binary vbscript I
played with your reverse shell payload
but I needed something bigger
so I attempted to do the same thing for
Metasploit Windows reverse TCP
meterpreter it took a while for it to
completely create the meterpreter exe
and execute it but it did work I
borrowed some of your reverse shell
payloads to make it work here's a Python
script I created that will allow you to
convert any binary file I just tested it
with meterpreter exe into a ducky script
file including the VB script decoder
just encode this with your ducky encoder
jar and it should work meterpreter exe
was too large of a binary file but it
might prove useful for some other binary
files some smaller binary files that is
this is nice yeah I'm working over the
codes cool yeah and you know a lot of
this is like oh like down here I see you
know four line in the input file that's
saying for each line of it do line
equals line dot replace and he's got
just suits with with so he's got lined
out replace this which is a space
application no quotation marks yeah I
mean they're all the syntax is looks
very similar yeah a lot of them except
for cobalt but but yeah I'm just
imagining I don't know what line dot
replaced does but I can imagine it's
replacing on every line wherever it sees
a space with no space I don't know
that's that's what I'm saying is like
you know I'm not a Python programmer but
you know you code enough of these little
languages here and there you start
picking up stuff and you're like so true
and I actually I'm gonna kind of gather
can't code without a reference anyway oh
really yeah but I code worth uh well
we're gonna have been doing some awesome
Alice scripts and stuff next time we do
those scripts
yeah you're gonna arise well you're
going down the rabbit hole oh this is
that's what's happening I'm looking
forward to those yeah well I take
I say that was fun now stay tuned
because we're gonna be back with this

metroid it'll just be like boom savings
right there where you are
from time to time you guys email us your
JPEGs of feedback at hak5 Dorgan we'd
like to look at him we're all like yeah
this is one of those isn't it yeah well
very nice picture girlfriend's last name
was Joe Peck what's this what's the
picture oh my gosh okay so this is from
Gary and he said I was recently gifted
with a 1932 General Electric electric
grandfather clock slash AM radio
possibly the first model of clock radio
don't actually know beautiful clock dude
I love some antiques me too the cost of
the parts to fix it worth three times
more than the cost modest so here's my
variation of your very mod do it what do
you mean to fix it it looks to me like
you fixed it it looks like it's in great
condition yeah it's gorgeous
oh man that is so awesome I've always
wanted one of those really big
grandfather clocks in my household I'm
one of those old-timey radios yeah oh
yeah one of the really good mini ITX oh
my god
I like how it's like you know you don't
know if it's gonna point at the thing
that is there anyway you know what I'm
talking about feel like you know
technology is beautiful and it should be
Shokai did you yeah I agree
we're not showcasing it Paul what's up
with that anyway the sets still in beta
and you can always send in your photos
to feedback at hak5 org I'll run this
because grandfather clocks the trivia
last week was announced at CES in 2007
this operating system codenamed Quattro
featured centralized backup file sharing
and media streaming for home networks
ooh ooh I know is it a low powered Linux
box that you put in the closet no is it
like a cloud service you can get for
next to nothing
oh is it a really bloated inexpensive
Microsoft Project they never take yes
yeah good on ya this week's question is
this common business oriented language
began its life as a specification
written by researchers at universities
corporations and the government in 1959
and you can answer that question over at
HACC $5 org slash trivia for a chance to
win some wine
19:59 yeah once oh that's 20 years after
the IBM you want to chain you want to do
the IBM anthem with me now as we close
the show as we always do you know what I
can do because I just looked it up yes
my high school motto so that's the show
trusted Tecna list we'll see you next
week hacked $5.00 oversized follow
hockshop comm download every week back
tips on the other week skin yeah hacks
follow age heck $5 you should stick
around to the end of every week just to
hear that well I do let's change the
format now I stick around for the
bloopers something great yeah if you
don't stick around until the end end of
the show you're missing the bloopers
yeah and skateboard kid and skateboard
kid alright until next week i'm darren
kitchen back I'm Shannon Moore who's
rusted out your most trusted technology
robitussin
hello and welcome to hack 5 my name's I
did that wrong
my name is God and before we wou that
was Paul trying to make people sick
hello and welcome to a very special
episode of hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
well probably my fourth Perret into the
horse Mike worst force me the force to
be with me do the shakeout we see now
you just you totally right you
programming and cold medicine is fun
okay oh do I start this leg to the block
shake to unlock throw to unlock Oh turbo
to unlock BB
database what even is a database you
know what this head don't compile after
midnight but isn't that when everybody
compelled pause I was rendering their
gurus angry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
