by go to assist with hack 5 I'm Shannon
Morse coming to you from CES 2013 at
digital experience and I'm here with Kim
Titus and he is with NQ Mobile a
security platform for your phone you've
heard about all those antivirus programs
for your computers but lots of sensitive
data is on the cell phone so Kim tell me
a little bit about this program well
Shannon actually you mentioned the the
computer we're carrying more sensitive
information right here in our pocket
than we are leaving at home on our
computer I totally agree I have pictures
messages with my fiancee at home I don't
want to share with the world everything
absolutely so this is a way to secure
that and to keep your mobile phone safe
we have 242 million registered user
accounts around the world's in 150
countries we are by far the largest
mobile security and privacy provider in
the world Wow that's excellent so how
does this work on the back end so this
is very easy you download it from Google
Play and you install it on your phone
the features are about 90% of them are
free and in fact antivirus and
anti-malware is always free on these
phone on this app so some of the things
that you can do that hour on this phone
is you can also protect it from a
privacy you know many of the things that
you do many of the apps that you
download ask for different permissions
this is a way for you to accept
and and decide which permissions you
want an app to download we also have
anti-theft that's part of our one of our
premium features you can sound an alarm
you can lock you can disable a phone all
remotely if you lose it that's really
nice and it is very important because
again like the home computer or the
laptop you're less likely to lose it
than you are your mobile phone and
finally we have backup we have
optimization features we also have a
network manager which is very important
for people who are managing accounts
that are not the all-you-can-eat
accounts so if they have a certain
limited amount of data they can set that
limit and it will give them an alert
when they're getting close to that data
limit that's nice I have unlimited on my
iPhone right now but if I switch to the
2gig or four gig I want to make sure
that I'm not going over my budget
because that would be really expensive
would really absolutely want to know and
particularly if you had a family account
you would want to know that you are
staying within those limits now I
noticed that it had the anti-theft as
well as the anti antivirus basically
whenever that pops up it does it like
actually pop up something on your front
screen when you're downloading a new app
or how does that work on the anti
antivirus
oh I'm the antivirus so every time you
download an app it checks it out while
you're downloading it to make sure that
it's safe it also checks it out whenever
you're opening that to make sure that it
hasn't become infected and every time
you make a phone call it checks to make
sure you're not being eavesdropped on oh
oh that's really important I didn't know
that part that's really good to know I
would hate it if somebody even the
government was eavesdropping on me that
would drive me nuts
so does this work on just Android phones
or can I get this for iOS windows
anything like that so
is primarily for Android phones right
now and it's at $1.99 a month or $13.99
for the year a hundred and ninety-nine
dollars $2 dollar ninety-nine that's
excellent I think this is a great
program it's something that a lot of
people need especially in the android
marketplace with all those other all the
other marketplaces that are out there
for Android applications so Kim thank
you so much this is really cool and I
appreciate your time
