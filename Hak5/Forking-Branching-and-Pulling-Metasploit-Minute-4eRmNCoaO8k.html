time on Medicine minute miss Boyd minute
is brought to you by viewers like you
if you get value from this showing and
can spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute comm
welcome to Metasploit minutes up
breakdown on breaking in
I'm your host Rob Fleur but you can call
me Moo Vic's this time we're gonna take
the module that we've spent so much time
creating and we're going to actually
submit it to the Metasploit development
group to have them commit it to the
hopefully the trunk and you can do this
with your modules too so we're going to
walk you through each step we kind of
skipped one though one of the picnic of
ones and it's not hard at all is getting
a github account and we've already done
that the Medus wait a minute account and
all you do from there is you go to
rapid7 Metasploit framework so you go to
the whatever the repository is that
you're going to then fork and we're
going to fork this and we're going to
make our own copy by pushing fork and
it's that simple all you do is is push
the fork button and it should take a few
seconds it's not too long and there we
have now our own version of get so we
are going to switch to the ssh version
you can do HTTP or ssh version that over
here on the far right-hand side we're
going to do SH because this way we can
actually add like SSH keys and so that
it we can do push and pulls a lot easier
so now we have a copy of the Metasploit
framework for ourself so we're gonna
copy this and we're gonna make sure dev
and you can put this anywhere you want
but I would recommend having your own
development version as well as the
actual trunk version so we're going to
go in the dev and then we're going to
get clone
and this will take a while yes you need
the public key crypto so we're going to
actually do the HTTPS version just to
make things a little quicker since I
haven't added a key yet all right so
we're back and we finally got Metasploit
pulled down to our system and in our dev
environment so we get into Metasploit
and branch should tell us what brent get
branch should tell us we're on the
master branch now what we want to do is
we want to actually create a new branch
now if you you can you can commit things
to master and then do pull requests
based on master but it's just bad
practice because once you do that that's
the only pull request that's the only
request you can make so if you if you
make new branches you can continually
make new pull requests and let them stay
in the pull request queue as long as you
want and then update master and continue
moving forward that way you don't have
to wait on them to finish things for you
to update your own master copy so we are
gonna get check I have a alias for this
this is why it's interesting check out B
and we're going to call it PHP my admin
log in so it created check out - be
automatically switches me over to the
branch that I'm creating that way I know
which one I'm on so it automatically but
I could if I wanted to create a branch
and then check out that branch but this
is an easy way to do it all in one
command line alright so we're in that
command and all we're gonna do is copy
over our modules so msf for modules tab
complete all the way to the end and
we're gonna put it in modules auxilary
scanner HTTP that's just because we're
it's it me it essentially would probably
be the best place to put it obviously
the Metasploit admins or devs will will
make comments on where it should be or
not so we're gonna copy that over and
then before we submit anything we've
gone through and done an MSF tidy so if
you do dot forward slash Tools MSF tidy
dot RB and then pointed out our new
module we initially had a bunch of
spaces and tabs that student be those
those are all warnings then it also
showed us that do not read set cookie
headers directly you can you can do it
this way so what we can do later on and
we're not going to do it here is
actually use the get cookies on the
result instead and that actually I
tested that out for a little bit on the
side and it works a lot better than what
we had in there all the splitting and
each doing stuff like that so now that
we have it mostly done except for that
get cookie stuff we are going to now
we're in the wrench we're going to get
push so and then we put in our our
username and password for I'm going to
wait a minute
just make sure it's Metasploit min at
all one word all lowercase
Matis wait a minute putting in our
password
everything else today oh we we get we
get pushed because we haven't committed
anything and it worked just fine so get
status we can see that there's an
untracked module right there that we
haven't add so get add modules auxilary
scanner HP PMA so now that we've added
it actually to the commit we commit it
locally with a message saying add PHP my
admin login module
it just doesn't it's not my stuff isn't
configured yet so let's get config
global username
I myself met us lloyd unit get yeah
config config can thing typing is not my
strong suit
then username email would be raw plus
weight in it that see you that calm I
think it's like and then we commit all
right so no it already committed so git
log shows us that we have our root at
localhost committed but that's okay what
we'll do is we'll we could recommit it
or or remove that if we wanted to but
we're just going to go with how it is
right now and it's going to just show up
as fruit at localhost committing it so
get push Metasploit minute password and
that
good now show up as a branch and we have
verified our email address and it didn't
show up as a branch yet because we
forgot one thing so git push origin and
then what we're gonna because that's
going to push it up back up to the thing
and then PMA underscore login Metasploit
init password alright so that
successfully pushed a new branch up to
github and then if we look here this
page will automatically refresh and says
hey there's a new branch out there to
look at
would you like to actually compare and
push the pull request you push that it
goes over to the Metasploit site and
says you you want to push a pull request
to rapid7 master with p.m. a login yep
and you add a comment saying PHP my
admin login module log in module done
during Metasploit minute create a pull
request and that's it now the pull
request is out there and you can watch
as developers will look and comment on
the code will most likely get an MSF
Tidy
slap in the wrist saying hey there's
there's a warning with MSF Tidy you
should have fixed it and we're just
going to close this pull request in a
second anyways but what you can do is is
make the commitment
make the changes locally and then push
those back up exactly the same way we
committed our changes initially and
that's it you've you submitted your own
code to Metasploit framework and that's
awesome it's really cool to have code in
there and see how things get changed and
updated and work through the flow it's
all it's really cool so what do you
think email me at MSF at hack 5 org and
stay tuned the Metasploit minute
