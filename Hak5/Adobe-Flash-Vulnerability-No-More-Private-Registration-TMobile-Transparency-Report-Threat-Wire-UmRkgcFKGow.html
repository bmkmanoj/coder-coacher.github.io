more private registration what an
t-mobile transparency report is released
all that coming up now on threat wire
hola I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for July 8 2015 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom first off a toast
to the patrons for your support we are
still pretty far from one of our very
first goal so please share this show on
all of your social networks to the news
first off we have Adobe so Patrick
informed us of the hacking team breach
earlier this week and it seems to be
getting worse as the days go by after
the hundreds of gigs of data was stolen
and released into the wild researchers
have started reading through all of the
information to see what's up most
notably today is a zero day
vulnerability in Adobe Flash in some
code targeting Microsoft Windows and
selinux the really fun part is the new
vulnerability attacks the newest and
latest version of Flash ending in dot
194 and it can work against IE users as
well so you know don't use IE the flash
bug allows code to be executed remotely
by an attacker and according to Adobe a
patch should be released this week but
was not issued at the time of recording
so just a reminder just you know disable
flash forever now just install it for
good the windows vulnerability is
reported to be in the kernel or the
brain of the computer as I like to
explain to my grandparents it also
allows an attacker to get an escalation
of privileges the problem in selinux may
also work on Android phones which also
use Linux code to work and to top it off
we also learned that the FBI purchased
some of hacking team spying products
specifically one called RCS for short
which infects a computer and lets the
attacker listen to communications before
they are encrypted including emails
instant messages passwords Skype calls
etc etc in total it's reported that the
FBI has spent seven hundred and seventy
five thousand dollars on hacking team
and other clients included include the
DoD and the DEA yeah so since the breach
just happened a few days ago there's so
much more in from
in that you know researchers have to
work through so we may find even more
vulnerabilities in the next coming weeks
have you ever signed up for a website
you probably have especially if you run
a business and when you do you have to
fill out the Whois information for your
domain that includes your name your
address phone email etc etc and this
gives people a really easy way to
contact you if anything happens to your
website but it can also create a serious
problem with harassment so if you take
off a customer they could release your
address to the entire internet and then
anybody conducts you even further
luckily there are things like privacy
and proxy registration services which
use a privacy companies address and info
on the Whois database instead of your
personal information
for example hak5 does this well now a
proposal that I can is looking at may
change that though the proposal could
limit privacy and proxy registration
services that are available to any site
deemed not commercial and transactional
unfortunately no one can really lobby
against this new policy unless they work
inside of ICANN a few ICANN folks have
in a document labeled the initial report
on the privacy and proxy services
accreditation issues policy development
process but the ICANN's official vote is
yet to be determined I'm gonna keep a
close eye on this one
and last off we have t-mobile one of the
largest wireless carriers in the US
which just so happens they turned over a
ton of data to the government more so
than any other large carriers they
handled 100 77549 subpoena x' 17,000 316
warrants in over three thousand wiretap
orders in 2014 just 2014 but they
actually received over 350,000 requests
from the government so t-mobile recently
released their first-ever transparency
report this year which shared the
information with the public that's a lot
of data that the government agencies
really want to see it's kind of creepy I
don't have any featured comments today
but comment below guys it's really
important I really want to know what you
guys think about all the different
stories but I did want to take a moment
moment to remind you guys that we all
have a Google+ community dedicated to
sharing news about what's happening in
security and privacy and we
they even use some of those stories for
the show and give you props there too so
simply search for threat wire in the
community section of Google Plus to find
us and before we leave again big thanks
to our patrons over at patreon.com slash
threat wire if you find value from this
and you can spare a few quarters or a
few cents an episode even a quarter a
month which actually ends up being about
two cents per episode it's not much
consider becoming a patron via the link
right below right there just click on
that little square and we may even
feature your adorable fur babies like
these ones in our next episode because
they are so kawaii I really like Grendel
I'm feeling Grendel very very cute
similar to my little Luna mm-hmm so
we're almost to our very first goal so I
really hope that you'll contribute to
help keep us this show coming completely
independent completely ad free and by
the way why are we at free it'd be a
little awkward if we were sponsored by a
company who ended up getting hacked cuz
then we'd have to talk about it on the
show now if you can't donate a like a
share subscribe all that stuff goes a
long way too and you can find all the
things at threat wired dotnet and with
that I'm Shannon Morse
I will see you and you and you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
