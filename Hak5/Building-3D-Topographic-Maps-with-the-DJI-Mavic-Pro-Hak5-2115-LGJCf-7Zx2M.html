topographic maps with drones all that
and more this time on hack 5 warning
this episode of hack 5 is for a mature
audiences only expression 5 hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen my name is shannon and against
and it's your weekly dose of Technol us
know it is the show where we recover
whatever we're interested in this week
two thousand five eleven years now i saw
that comment we do here hey just make
sure that you guys are staying tuned
until the end of this episode because we
are going to be announcing for the
second time our huge hack shop giveaway
that we're doing this month some more
details on that and a little bit i also
wanted to mention threat wire you can
check that out over at the hack 5
youtube channel it's your source for
internet privacy security and freedom
news we talk about the news every single
week so we let you know what kind of
policies are forming in the US and
around the world we just released an
audio RSS feed for our patreon backers
to so you can download the show offline
and you can find information on that
over at patreon.com slash threat wire on
to today's segment which is which is
photogrammetry yeah yes so gramma tree
it is basically the science of making
measurements with different kinds of
photographs right so it's a technique
used in topographic mapping or
topographic if you want to be different
architecture engineers use it
manufacturing geology and you name it
somebody's going to be using it it can
also be used to create 3d models out of
real world objects and you'll see this a
lot especially like if you're a 3d maker
like that's a big thing like what we are
doing today so previously we had covered
3d photogrammetry on hack 5 episode 1815
using Autodesk 123d catch Darren what's
new since what's been going on with you
right this is one to 3d catch from
Autodesk and it is the software that we
were previously using to go ahead and do
some of this photogrammetry stuff and it
seemingly dead now what it feels that
way it hasn't been any updates it's
partially not working I mean I actually
here I have it Genki now I know like
here is for instance the Southampton
shoal the lighthouse that we did on that
episode and you can see all the photos
or at least the cameras for the passes
from the drone but you can't actually
see the 3d model thankfully well you can
on the website at least so I can go over
here in a second ago I had this and of
course you know no it doesn't want to
work there we go that's that's kind of
what it's supposed to look like see if
it'll hold the 3d view like I said just
a little janky but you can get an idea
basically it was all of these
photographs of this lighthouse platform
out in the San Francisco Bay and
basically it would take all of those
images and create a 3d mesh and then
texture onto it but it would down sample
all of those photos so the 3d mesh
wouldn't be that high resolution so what
are you using now ooh
so I'm using the bigger boy software
version of that as opposed to one to 3d
catch which is free I am using Autodesk
remake which is pretty cool stuff this
is some like really high-end
professional stuff for exactly this and
is it cost money yes it is but it'll do
so much more than just photos you can do
laser scans 3d scans so it has a pretty
cool workflow um it can be used to among
other things build 3d topographic maps
out of you know will in this instance
I'm using it to survey a 40-acre marina
in the San Francisco Bay Area cool it'll
render up to 250 images in their cloud
and so you can actually use Autodesk
servers to go ahead as everybody's going
to see those photos basically lots of
photos of land huge tracts of land so I
don't know there might be some weird
stuff out there yeah
the internet rule 34 before I show ya
that went and you just invoked that in
the comments so we're gonna happen move
on from that basically I'll give you an
example of that here's what I was able
to create with that here's a the first
passes and this is a 3d model actually
I've got a little a little error right
there ain't even notice that I gotta fix
that guy which is why I took a second
pass of this in this version right here
so there we are check that out you could
actually kind of see some of the stitch
lines from the photographs but otherwise
you can see that it has created a pretty
high resolution 3d mesh of this area
looks like any good it is I mean I can I
can zoom in and I can see the foliage
and I can see how the you know how the
terrain contours and you know especially
like the the first version of this I
took right after the rains here in the
Bay Area in December which meant that I
was able to very easily see kind of the
difference between what was dead foliage
and what was alive knowing where to
landscape and this is really cool stuff
because now the developer can take this
into very common CAD software and that's
one of the benefits of this like
high-end high-end autodesk stuff is it
obviously integrates very well yeah of
course it's auto cad and all of the
other kind of cad software you might
imagine and can now start planning the
excavation and doing it in on the
computer before you ever even pick up a
bulldozer bulldozer you know as you do
as i try to do that all the time toys
yeah that's my exercise i wanted to ever
tell you i wanted to be a crane when I
grew up
correct I want it to be like one of
those like I want to do crane I either
wanted to be a crane operator or a
firetruck and like my parents and like
you know adults growing up would be like
are you sure you don't mean a fireman I
was like no we're gonna be a firetruck
anyway this software is really cool
because you don't necessarily need to
use their cloud service to render it if
you have a beefy enough machine you can
render more than 250 photographs locally
up to a thousand and then a thousand
plus is kind of experimental this
rendering right here is made up of two
50 whatever their max was for their
clouds stuff because guess what as it
turns out I don't have a beefy enough
machine to even Italian during this not
even our editing machine no sadly our
editing machine is a skylake i7 with 32
gigs of ram a couple SSDs and that's not
good enough
no I I think we we do a video card which
would just scratch the surface we have a
an Nvidia card some Quattro or something
that's got 4 gigs of RAM yay ok so what
do you need like they recommend dual
Xeon 128 gigs of RAM lots of SSD that's
all yeah I like check these system specs
out down here do to do to do yeah
basically minimum is 64 gigs of RAM and
a 4 gig card but they recommend 128 gigs
of RAM and like a Quattro m6 thousand
which was like a what four thousand
dollar video card and of course multiple
Xeon processors so if I were if I could
justify this other than this one-off
project that I'm doing for a friend
that's doing some development in the Bay
Area I would probably put together a rig
to do this cuz that would be fun yeah
are you figuring that no no no okay so
how much does it cost
um it's it's like it's like everything
these days right that's like asking what
Photoshop cost you used to be able to
say 700 bucks but now the answer is 50
bucks a month for a mine because
everything is a subscription now that's
what you know that's what should we
should do Shannon sell the pineapple for
free and just make it 20 bucks a month
to use that's ridiculous
but this software is $30 a month or $300
a year that's a it does come with our
cloud crunching stuff so I don't have to
build a quad Xeon that's quite something
and it doesn't agreat really nicely so
that is kind of the high-end commercial
stuff if you will okay well what if I
don't have the money to afford the
commercial stuff whatever I want to
open-source alternative there's got to
be something there there is and you know
what there's actually a lot of really
cool stuff coming out of NASA of all
places - yeah it's good stuff
the program sure is like the coolest
little esoteric thing of likes this is
random neither go-to SIGGRAPH one of
these years going forward I am looking
at a couple of alternatives of the first
being visual sfm and another one being a
tour and atoll they're kind of outside
of the scope of this particular segment
there they're a little bit to get
running but I will loop back around and
try those out because wouldn't it be
cool to just I want to throw some like
Python on Linux on a Raspberry Pi and
see how long it's going to take to
compute a thousand images all right
that'd be fun so judging from the
pictures that you've created with your
render I'm assuming you did that with a
drone is this the drone you're using you
know me I love I love this drone I I
have I have us - no no no lick it back
like to Matt Damon's hand anyway I'm
gonna move on I didn't die I didn't know
it wasn't his hand oh my hand after I
shook is he why did he lick your hand
no he okay I'm trying to do this that
was that was there he will tell you what
really happened people are like you guys
aren't taking seriously and they don't
understand these are December episodes
folks you get legit bloopers at the end
of the year that's all you're gonna get
that's all you good guy no we have to
take okay being serious can't be still
honestly I have taken away for this I'm
thinking about Matt David now I can't be
serious trying not to make like South
Park references so okay honest techno
was for this and they say they say that
the best camera that you own is though
is the one that's on you and for the
most part I would say day by day that is
none other than my phone uh yeah and
then you can't you can't fly your phone
into the sky
what don't really yeah I don't know um
in in a way like I would say my phone is
not nearly as good as my you know Canon
t5i or myself rx100 I love those cameras
but I just don't tote them around
wherever I go yeah exactly similarly I
don't tote around my really long we
didn't fit that in your purse don't do
it you're gonna break it
I can kind of fit that in my pocket
there we go oh my gosh you can fit your
 now I'm just happy to see you let's
move on um so basically I feel like this
this DJ I'm a Virgo is kind of the
equivalent of that because it is the one
that you could potentially just always
have on you yeah so I I don't know I
mean I think it actually compares pretty
well to its bigger competitors in fact
it flies very much like the Phantom 4
really which is another very popular
drawing it very smooth it's not you know
it's not a fpb racer like we've built in
that series on building your own drones
in the past link going here but it is it
is as an aerial platform for photography
another yeah it's basically a photo
drone um it's it's really nice yeah
right and I mean you've got fantastic
features fantastic flight time a great
camera and it's like a quarter of the
size and weight is anything else in fact
when you figure in the controller and
everything like that's that's it and yet
if I broke out my DX and the battery
it's already on there yeah yeah if you
just want to carry one battery it's
already on there yeah it's a far cry
from what I could home build and that's
actually what saddens me to even say
this because I love building I have a
love affair with the soldering iron and
I'm an avid enthusiast in DIY drone
builder and it hurts me to admit the
fact that the DJI is superior to
anything that I could build one off like
this is the closest thing is my xugong
pro which I love you know you guys have
seen me rave about this before it's a
fantastic folder and actually it funnily
enough it actually uses a lot of DGI
flight components but that's fine and
and it has very similar specs like these
two have the same flight time you have
the same you know very similar cameras
you know whatever GoPro you happen to
throw on it they're very much the same
avionics there's an obvious difference
here and so it's just sad to say
that I can't you know even then even
while a homegrown solution is like
heavier I don't know I just it's I look
at this as like the total package the
all up weight right not just like you're
all up like in the sky but you're all
right so I consider the battery the
spare batteries the chargers the
controller the goggles everything and
yet this is like it feels like a
Nintendo controller that your phone
happens to slide inside of and you're
off to the races I don't know I'm just
I'm gonna stop now because I know I'm
gushing about the drone but that is my
Technol us right now have technolon
smaller than anything I could build one
off and why is just as well so this is
weird for you I feel like you're almost
saying don't build cuz you could buy
this hack five I know and actually you
know I want to point out someone who is
building something very similar and
looks fantastic props to the glitch
check this out this is a DIY Mavic loan
if you will and it looks cool just
gorgeous yeah so basically this is all
of your kind of DIY open-source
components that you might expect with
any home build and he's got a fantastic
build log I mean look at this thing
coming apart let me mute that there but
you know I just like you know it's
simple it's a couple 3d printed parts
yeah you got some wing nuts
who doesn't love a wing nut and then you
know you're off to the races and it
looks like it flies pretty well check
that Wow so you know like any other 350
class 450 class drone so I'm keeping an
eye on that one because that looks like
a really fun one to 3d print yeah
definitely yes
okay so that was just kind of a
show-and-tell of what I've been into
lately an introduction to some software
and some tools that I've been using
because it's just that's what we do here
that's what we what we do and I would
love to hear your comments cuz this is
work in progress I'm doing I'm doing
this as part of a project where
basically I'm surveying the land with
you know drones I'm taking that that
imagery I'm creating topographic 3d maps
using either commercial or open-source
software I'm exporting that into some
higher-end CAD software
so that we can like actually do
excavation and then put in 3d models of
different yurts and camp sites and a
piece barn and it's the bank and so then
you're gonna be able to take that and
like okay so here's the dream of what
this place might look like yeah and then
strap on the 3d you know the VR goggles
and be able to look at it from that
perspective of like okay you know this
looks really good but maybe if the piece
barn were over there and we put the
teepees here all right I like this idea
that's that's kind of it so I want to
hear you guys feedback have you guys
been playing with you know 3d
photogrammetry software have you guys
like been playing with drones like this
what kind of models are you guys making
I would love to hear your picks
especially is open source alternatives
because I've only scratched the surface
on some of those things I'm gonna have
links in the show notes to all of this
stuff feedback a hack 5 org is the
direct way to email us otherwise just
comment below on YouTube we love hearing
from you guys and we're gonna talk more
in just a bit but first a quick blink
we've been watching this hack 5 USB
rubber ducky series you know that great
ideas start with delay 1000 and they
also start with great domains which is
why we recommend heading over to
domain.com it is the source where
Shannon whenever we're having our
brilliant ideas and want to bring them
to the Internet we get ourselves a sweet
little domain comm domain name because
they have this domain discovery system
that makes it super intuitive and sweet
to get the perfect I mean just for you
and their check out process is a breeze
so your website will be up in no time
flat and the guys over at domain.com
huge fans of hack 5 he trans you guys
they have a coupon code just for us it's
called hack 5 hak5 saves you get this
20% off so you should do that you should
go over to domain.com and type in hak5
and yes you'll find out that hack 5 org
has already taken but if you plug it
into the coupon code field you'll save
20% which is brilliant yeah they've also
you know they've been supporting us for
years so you should probably even just
tweet at them at domain.com say hey
thanks guys for like hooking up hack 5
for the longest time we think you guys
are cool I think
delay 1,000
so when you think domain names think
domain.com it is now time for the
technology of the week every single week
we are asking you guys what tickles your
technology and you can enter by sending
us a photo over Twitter Instagram or
Facebook and just use the hashtag hak5
that's hak5 which is also the name of
the show this week century and winner is
from your watcher go up rare sighting of
a duck family in there pineapple nest
tending to their young it's the leggo
that gets me to go 88 miles an hour or
something like that
it's so cute yes it is so I'm gonna get
in contact with you over diem to send
you a prize and get your physical
mailing address Louise winning Ann Ann
oh yeah I'm gonna bite it she does this
so anyway stay tuned for that and if you
would like to participate all unit to do
is a hashtag hack five on your favorite
social social we have stickers yes we do
hey we actually got a buck ooh
you got a book we got a book we got a
book so first off we got a couple
stickers and I tried to Google this cuz
I was like I don't know what this is and
I kind of find an answer so can you
email us and let us know what these are
cuz I want to stick them on the set
before I know what they are so you
person that emailed these little s
mailed them to us I think the last
Netherlands the last time we got
something from the Netherlands we ended
up with your net pooping so I know what
that is I don't know what is like please
help us yes and then we will stick them
up on the wall the other one we got is
from net MUX at net MUX joshie says hak5
team thanks for all you do in the
community and I hope you enjoyed this
manual any feedback is always welcome
have a great holiday so he sent us a
netbooks logo as well as this awesome
hash crack password cracking manual so
it goes through a whole bunch of
different software components that you
can use to do hash cracking it's really
cool thank you for that I can't wait to
read back right we've been getting some
hash cat stuff lately so this would be
perfect in fact you know what that's why
we need a duel
Zeon with 128 gigs of RAM and you know
what let's just get four of those 24 gig
Nvidia cards right who's Titan X cards
or maybe the the Quattro something 6000
weird let's do it right so why don't you
help us get there by buying stuff from
the hatch I'm gonna put this up on the
set yeah why don't you tell them about
art oh right right because they don't
necessarily even have to buy stuff from
the hack shop to get cool lacquer gear
all they have to do is get in on our
giveaway our watchdogs to hack 5
giveaway celebrating the fact that our
lovely Wi-Fi pineapple has made it into
a video game which is just the coolest
thing ever it's like you know going from
being in comic books to newspapers to
movies and TV shows and now we're in
video games so so cool what is wrong
with you guys why are you watching this
anyway fantastic get in on it and win
yourself a $100 gift certificate for the
hack shop every day through December we
are picking winners that use hashtag
watchdogs - and hashtag hack 5 and
there's a grand prize winner which we'll
announce at the end of the year which is
like this massive awesome kit and you're
gonna love it and you can find all the
details over a hat shop comm slash
watchdogs to underscore giveaway links
at the bottom and we look forward to
seeing your submissions cuz already
there's been immense creativity did you
see that comic book Shannon oh my gosh
the comic was my favorite right oh yeah
as a vinyl yeah check that out trying to
be very careful with the the depth of
field that makes it kind of disappear
hey next on hack 5 you will be applying
stickers to the wall this is hard wall
get sticker I can build things with an
Arduino but putting stickers off the
wall just can't do it yeah yeah hey
guess what we're gonna be a shmoocon
so if you're gonna be there come by and
bring us a Yingling and if you don't
just not gonna not gonna self not cool
not cool girl have to have you anyway
yep JK lol I'm also feedback and act 5
dot org greatest place to get a hold of
us and say
hey guys yall off-the-rails why you've
been doing this for 11 years and then
also hack shop commies how you can
sports directly and get all sorts of
cool i awesome hack 5 gear like the
Wi-Fi pineapple and the duck and the
turtle and stuff thanks you're welcome
who all's what else was there in the
show if you guys know how to end the
show or you'd like to write a script for
hack 5 and submit it to us so that we
can read it verbatim all you have to do
is create a wiki and get 10 of your
friends on Twitter to get involved and
we will do just that because what I'm
feeling insane today I didn't know that
was the thing that we were doing now I
just made it up see if it happens
alright with that I'm Darrin kitchen I'm
shenanigans trust your techno was off
