brought to you by netflix go daddy and
my little exorcist with pretty pretty
pink hair that is the last time I fly
american airlines oh no that was world
hey evil server I was a crisp miss
welcome all cars on redecorated
hello and welcome to hack 5 I hope your
christmas and new year's was excellent I
am Darren kitchen I met last stock Jan
and Morris and we are joined by the
infamous Dave Randolph you may know him
as the tech extraordinaire behind shows
such as system or maybe the rev3 studio
yeah if you've ever checked out the
reversion 3 website they have like tours
of their studio life and it's just like
awesome goodness and the most amazing
revision3 Gazette ever yeah and he did
it all yeah whale eater than us nice
what's going on Dave oh you know me just
hanging in there I've been since leaving
rev 3 i've been doing kind of the same
thing just on a much more accelerated
scale what do you mean by that
accelerated scout mean like I mean come
on that's got to be pretty hardcore to
put together a set for our studio for
like a half million quarter million uh
yeah it was about a half a million for
that studio there and Wow lately I've
been doing a lot of you know 12 5 10
million dollar deals up here in San
Francisco and the good thing is i now
have kind of a team of people to help me
out with it i got sales guys that
actually generate everything I've got
installer so it's not just me sitting
there making cables or me and a couple
internet making yes sincerely strippers
all day long I mean own hey papa poppers
yeah of course you're not strippers
wells do he's the big man he's key can
have strippers day well welcome to the
ten-thousand-dollar set if that set and
back area thank you not see ya um what's
up I million 25 million dollar sets I
cannot imagine OTT imagine I mean is it
are you doing stuff for like you know
you know local TV networks we're going
HD or you know what I mean can you give
us kind of an example of what you know
typical three million dollar studio
would go in you know what would go into
that well tickle the typical three
million dollar studio usually requires
maybe 10 15 edit bays nice large control
room
uncompressed HD clips side by side video
effects boxes cg everything like that
custom furniture start to finish large
studio giant you know lighting grids a
horse muslim we're not talking just
video we're talking like the lighting
audio the set construction like the
whole shebang yes a lot of them
literally i walk in there with a hard
hat and they say we want to build a
studio here and can you tell us where to
put the shovel if we want to put a
studio in the back i can tell you where
to put the shovel great man but wow I
yeah that's that's incredible so even
keeping up with the whole IPTV seen been
keeping up with a few of them the shows
that I really like um you know like hack
500g it's required of all guests of
course it is yeah I'm not gonna go on
and dis you're interviewing you you guys
after we hang up all all bets are off me
no you're actually telling us right
before we started recording about the
whole the tekzilla set which I must say
looks quite beautiful as someone that
has had this quite the same deadline as
you I'm just saying lowes has the exact
same product sku in every city in this
country Rex are nice mad they work you
know I we need to get plastered well I
mean you know we were trying maybe Dave
could have helped us find their thinking
about what I love them crystals or you
know everybody makes brick as in the
standard like red brick yeah I want
cinderblock brick plundered centerville
cinder block like foam no foe like elf
are you yeah well like the screen savers
when it was on ZD TV yeah kinda uh-hmm
you can do that with plaster maybe that
Darren I'm not then hide out metal and
plastic plaster not so much I don't do
plaster well we'll just have to find
someone else Dave Dave you know I mean
there's there's tons of theater shops
out there that generate that
but the other thing you could do is the
the cheap way would be to go out and get
yourself large sheets of plastic and
then heat gun it over one cinder block
oh wow like with a like with a hair
dryer no with the heat gun like a shrink
to be well see when I do shrink tubing I
just use a cigarette lighter uh go out
and buy a real heat gun okay you know
and then you can actually a kind of heat
gun it and it'd be like vacuum plastic
forming and you can kind of make your
pattern oh right this is once you do
that it's just like filling the plastic
beads and went on my mind has been blown
I have some shrink wrap at work and I
can use the machine if I wanted to
really awesome all right well maybe we
can get some money blah you here yeah
only something to shield it from that
thing yeah the warp drive yes very but
but yeah so what I mean so what if you
what's what's been your like biggest
installation I mean I know you can't
give us specifics on the names and
whatnot but you want to give me an idea
of what's the dope what's the craziest
thing you've gotten to play with in the
last since since leaving rev3 yeah yeah
oh boy um well on a weekly basis I get a
bunch of like hundred two hundred
thousand dollar cameras to come through
the office for me to play with some
badger all cuz i can give you our hero
box you know they always have fun with
those panasonic very cam had a couple
red cameras come across my table but a
lot of it's been like moving 3d studios
that's been a big part of it up here
every every every 3d company in town
wants to move their production
facilities to another building so
they'll contract us to come in and kind
of move their operations in the middle
of the night in the middle of the night
just yeah yeah you know you unplug the
thing you Reese which the DNS your route
and Robin and there you go right there
can you move 400 people and you know
over a weekend sure no problem whatever
you want good sir just write the check
anyone in IT knows what it's about on
the weekend transition yep yeah Wow
kitten starts at Friday 5 p.m. yeah we
can transition starts on the first
monday of that week
an email the other email reminder on
Friday and then an apology email on
Monday yep because everything's still
down and everybody's pissed off an
emailing IT ah maybe they can get smtp
anyway and rock on dude so that's pretty
hardcore I mean like live to disc
everything it's all HD for the win right
all HD for the win a lot of them are
doing you know 4k files for a theatrical
release and stuff like that Wow so we've
been playing with a one company that
built a box still under come in da for
their name but they build it for 3d
movies to do real-time dailies of their
animation so what do you mean by a 4k
well he's talking about 4 megapixels
basically ah i'm a 54 mega pixel which
is laying white HD twice HD and it's
basically kind of a cinematic preview
resolution and the three of you guys
will render it out but they want to look
at it in real time to see how it plays
back so King mail goes tema giant
theater and play it apparently he can
yeah you can play 4k in real time
because I'm having problems with AVCHD
maybe I just need a quad-core nevermind
okay well a 4k a type of solution most
of them usually have attached a giant's
ass attached or San attached to him he's
like 24 a platter stunning up and it's
pretty intense yeah I can't imagine the
kind of disk array it would take to I
mean you're talking 44 44 k it's got I
mean what are we talking about how many
hundreds of hard drives per minute well
we're talking you know as a bit the
smallest solutions have 24 drives
attached to them the average one or one
I just recently did a head I think six
of those 24 drive chassis Wow attached
to it which was nice yeah so and it was
just temporary storage so yeah that's
the cash you say you're not using
off-the-shelf stuff here or are you uh
well it's off the shelf hard drives
attached to proprietary controllers and
video playback solutions things like
that cool so what are you looking
forward to the most to nab um what I'm
looking forward to the most is I want to
see red
it's new cameras coming out which I'm
really excited about um there's quite a
few software solutions for asset
management which has been the biggest
problem in the industry really right
because avid just loves to talk to final
cut oh absolutely well no not only that
but nobody wants to work with After
Effects and 3d studio nobody can track
all those different things that are used
in those shows but they're all using XML
maybe not anyway there why don't you go
ahead and write that spec I'm sure
everybody will adopt it sure let me just
put that to my laundry list is oh my god
anyway we all need to give a hand to
Dave Randolph because he's the one that
let us know hey you can hack together in
HD solution instead of spending what 13
grand for a edirol you know this without
even HD a VTR you know the sad thing is
is you know we've got Dave on the show
mm-hmm and we're still releasing an HSN
SD but that's because we can't we can't
come to some agreement on a file format
that we send to them whether it's an
eight day how about you call rev3 start
cracking some heads I like that idea
listen we will most likely be HD for CES
tuned for that next week for your daily
episodes of hak5 you will be getting
technology for the showroom floor with
all sorts of gadgets gizmos and all
sorts of fun stuff we're gonna be
special guests in on tekzilla as well
and we will probably have quite a few
fun adventures with a pineapple and lots
of open Wi-Fi from vendors so we promise
not to get kicked out no because
tv-b-gone people were dumb mm-hmm so
yeah we should probably move on to the B
Block probably all right Dave thank you
so much for joining us right thank you
you pleasure thanks for having me hey
anytime man just let it know and trust
us will be calling you Jim for stuff
right with the smtp e yeah all right
Dave thanks a lot man all right we're
gonna take a quick break and when we get
back I will be talking to you guys about
how to crack md5 hashes with your
graphics card stay tuned
hey guys I was recently reading some
interesting stuff coming out of some
researchers from Switzerland and
basically what they were able to do was
get a ssl certificate from rapid ssl
which is like a verisign company and
since it was done with md5 as the hash
they were able to with like 200 PS 3s
and a bunch of collisions come up with a
certificate authority certificate with
the same exact md5 hash and that
basically let them be able to i don't
know create ssl certificates for just
about any domain that they could
possibly want take over the internet and
oh my god the sky is falling so I
thought what better way to bring us into
talking about md5 hashes and in
particular the new advances in it that
being brute-forcing with our graphics
cards so in order to make this a little
bit more fun i decided i may get some
ingredients over here bring you guys to
the kitchen and we'll make a cocktail
for snubz how's that sound so let's get
down into the theory all right so the
theory of the cocktail is pretty simple
basically we take all the ingredients we
mix them up we drink it we feel pretty
toasty the theory behind the md5
cracking pretty much the same to be
honest with you guys we've been talking
about password cracking here and i'll
just quickly go over those you know say
like we're at matts computer we could
guess his password you know we could
enter in po knees or intending unicorns
and then we get in or we could use a
dictionary attack we could grab a oxford
english dictionary or txt file
equivalent and just keep trying or we
could use a brute force attack which i'm
going to be talking about here so in a
brute force attack let's imagine we've
got an eight character password right
and we're just going to try a and then
we're going to try a 2 a's and when we
can try 8 a's and then we're going to
increment it we got it a and then Abby
you know it's like and we can try every
possibility in betweens then that's just
lower case letters I mean imagine you
get like capitals you get numbers you
got symbols so as you might imagine it
can get I don't know a little time
consuming so that's where the cool part
of that the GPUs come in and then
there's also pre computed and I believe
schnapps is going to be talking about
that a little later and that is to say
we're doing the same thing as the brute
force attack except we're writing it
down from future reference so that next
time we want to do the same kind of
attack we don't have to sit there
and figure out all of those different
possibilities we can just kind of look
them up in a beautiful table with the
plain text in the hash of equivalent
hope that makes sense so how does this
password hashing work well let's say on
Matt's computer here we're just going to
use md5 as an example let's say his
computer stores his password in an md5
hash then when I go to log in what I'm
actually sending it is the md5 hash
equivalent of my plaintext password so
that i'm not actually transmitting my
plaintext password in the clear and
whatnot over the wires and then it just
compares those hashes make sure that
they look the same and if two hashes are
identical they should be the same exact
plaintext right so go ahead and it Matt
in way cool how do we obtain that
password well some like SQL systems we
can actually just go ahead and pull that
and then that's like a whole nother
story but we can totally just pull the
md5 hash out of a lot of SQL databases
wahoo or we could just sniff them out of
the traffic and we've talked about
packet sniffing we could put together
some filters to look for that kind of
stuff but that basically all of this is
leading you to be able to do your
password cracking offline so let's say
our online cracking is actually us like
either on a website or say like in front
of Matt's computer and we're sitting
there actually going through with a
brute force attack and I don't know
maybe the systems administrator some
group policies I've actually set some
policies that make sense where after
three failed attempts it locks us out
for a set amount of time and that can be
a real pain in the ass so I thing you
know you're taken something that's
already gonna take forever and then now
it's just it's not possible it's not
feasible whatsoever but offline cracking
once we've got that hash we can do all
of our password cracking against that
hash to see if we can come up with
another plain text equivalent that has
the same exact value of the hash and let
me just get into a little bit about md5
and then CUDA the the architecture the
API that were going to be using so md5
hash algorithm design like 1991 to
supersede md4 then just kind of found
like to be a little insecure back in 96
and then as of 2004 and then last year
well let's just say I hope nobody
using md5 and and the problem is with
collisions and that is to say now then
this is a whole nother then we can do a
whole theory on collisions and it would
be kind of fun to do some illustrations
with some cars we could get some rental
cars with pol insurance and that is to
say if I've got two inputs that have the
same output so if I've got I this and
goes through the hash function and it
creates this hash and then I've got
something else that goes through that
and creates the same one so anyway
that's that's the theory behind it i'm
going to have links to things that they
explain a lot better than I could in a
little five-minute segment but just
wanted to let you guys know what that is
as for the API that we're actually going
to be using to get our little password
crack gone here with our graphics card
this is going to require nvidia graphics
cards and it uses in a new api called
cuda its new as to the eighth series
nvidia graphics cards and it's basically
going to allow us to use the GPU to do
massively parallel operations and and
that's beautiful for what the kinds of
math that we're going to be trying to do
here so while our CPU is general purpose
and nice and dandy we can be used in the
power of our GPU to be doing some
interesting stuff now just with like a
modified version of C so let's go take a
look at our ingredients on the cocktail
side of things we're pretty much just
going to be using Jen a little bit of
triple sec some rum and gin thing of
vodka we're also going to need pineapple
juice orange juice and cranberry juice
plus a splash of evil server brand
grenadine that should be fun as for
actually getting our md5 cracking on we
are going to need to first come up with
an md5 hash and if you take a look at
this PHP it's really simple you can use
just about any other md5 like Windows
md5 sum is a great executable for it
there's a similar one for unix systems
but basically we're going to take
something simple like law and we're
going to create an md5 hash out of it
and then we're going to take that over
here and then we're going to use the
bars WF md5 brute forcer and this is the
application that is not only going to
use all of the cores of our GPUs and
then this is beautiful if you've got
like an SLI system with
like for NVIDIA 280 graphics cards but
it's also going to use our CPU so if
you've got a quad core system plus that
I've seen upwards of like four billion
hash tries per second I know right so
we're going to go ahead and fire this up
and start trying to crack this and
here's what we get what's actually doing
here is taking the key here and this is
the plain text equivalent and it's
coming up with what that hash would
equal and then it's comparing it to with
the hash I gave it and saying is this it
and if it's not it's going to do it
again well it's using all of these
graphics cards all of these cpu cores
and as you can see it's going really
freaking fast it's pretty easy program
to use available in Windows we just
specify the hash specify our character
set whether it's capitols lowercase
numbers symbols there is actually a
Linux alternative so if you want to get
done in your knicks there's even a one
that uses your nvidia graphics cards
here to do ntlm hashes so I'll have
links to that in the show notes because
that could be a lot of fun as we're
putting together the cocktail it's
pretty simple we just take our take our
gen a little bit of rum that's triple
sec not rum take a rum and this was
accidentally a little bit too much vodka
but it's okay a little hack five shot
glasses and then a little bit of
pineapple juice some orange juice try
not to spill on my laptop here and some
cranberry juice right and then just like
we did with our GPUs we're just going to
shake it up rule book mmm we're going to
give it a dash grenadine and I'm going
to put happy little straw in there and
there we go mmm
yeah you do really don't want to hack
hungry so anyway if you guys have any
questions about md5 cracking with the
graphics cards you got some suggestions
for other hacks that you would like to
see let me know also I'm open to your
cocktail suggestions and i hope to be
doing some more hacking in the kitchen
so stay tuned next time also a little
bit of a takeaway here what do we do
with all this we've got these insecure
md5 hashes and the key to all of this is
what we need to consider passphrases or
very long passwords and and that's just
going to buy a time really and the real
key to this is salt so tune in next time
when we do margaritas and password
salting or hash salting anyway we're
going to have some salt it's gonna be
fun ready yeah guess what we're going to
be playing quake three on saturday
january 10th are you gonna join me we're
gonna play on game no not game q3 hak5
org are you gonna play some games with
me you're gonna own it up you're gonna /
a little bit yeah I bet if Kirby played
games she would be awesome at it anyway
um yeah so we're playing quake 3 q3 hak5
org and I'd really like to think our
sponsors Netflix with Netflix you can
rent over 90,000 titles online including
lots of blu-ray titles with free
shipping both ways to your home they now
have over 40 shipping centers so almost
all deliveries happen in just one
business day Netflix plans start at four
dollars and ninety-nine cents and as a
new member you can get a no-risk two
week free trial membership check it out
at WWF flexkom / hak5 and please don't
forget the www and next up Kirby and I
are gonna take a break
so a couple of weekends ago I had to
help my sister with a little problem one
of her friends decided to change the
windows password on her login screen on
her own computer therefore she wasn't
able to log on to her nice expensive
computer so i found this nifty little
tool which was perfect for the job
called us be off crack it's basically
for your IT ninjas who have very
forgetful users or while your little
sister who has a dumb friend it's this
free precomputed password recovery tool
or password cracker depending on how you
look at it it's only good for windows XP
and vista and as i said its precomputed
so like Darren said during his segment
that basically means that these rainbow
tables are already installed with all of
their hashes and all USB ophcrack is
going to do is run through this table
real quick and try to figure out what
these what this plain text is for this
password it's not going to have to go
through and create every hash every
single time so these rainbow tables
those are basically just two columns in
this really really long table with
hashes on one side and plain text on the
other it's going to take this hash and
turn it into this plain text so you can
read it with your human eye and not have
it all garbled and messed up like it is
for Windows hashes on hak5 we actually
have one on the wiki it's a really
really big rainbow table and it could
probably find out a lot of the special
characters that you wouldn't get with a
smaller one like the one that's included
on USB ophcrack you only need three
things for this to run first of all you
need your Windows computer obviously you
also need a nice little one gig USB
flash drive this one's eight gigs God
that can fit a huge rainbow table hmm oh
yeah and you need us be off crack.exe
the first thing you might have to do is
format your flash drive I'm not going to
show you how to do that today but there
are really easy steps on the web page
where I got this tool from the second
thing you're going to need to do is
download the exe onto your PC and you're
going to open the dot bat file from
there and follow the really easy
on-screen instructions
and trust me they are simple I was able
to do it myself the installation on to
your flash drive it only take a couple
of minutes so just chill out you know
relax and while you're waiting once it's
done you're going to reboot your PC and
open the bios screen so you can change
your boot up from windows to your USB
flash drive or if you have a nice little
epc like i have here all you do is hit
escape choose flash drive and you're
good to go and as soon as the rainbow
tables start up in the background and
there you go it already found the first
two user passwords it might take a
couple more minutes to find the last two
user passwords because those ones are a
little bit longer so as you can see this
is it's fast it's reliable it's a
customizable tool for anybody who needs
to use it you can change around the
rainbow tables to our however big or
however small you might need it's good
for your IT ninjas with those very
forgetful users again and well my little
sister I saved the day it was a good day
you can find this on pendrive linux calm
and i'll also have a link in a nice
little explanation in my show notes
thanks for watching
alright guys so that just about wraps up
this week's episode of hak5 want to
thank you for tuning in to the first
episode of 2009 we're bored we had a
great time thinking Dave Randolph for
coming on to the show and in addition we
want to thank wicked poster for this
amazing background yes I don't know if
you guys can see it but if you can great
he created this is which one is this I
don't know but I think I'm Chakotay okay
and I think I'm Janeway Oh sucks for you
I know I have boobies his shin and
B'Elanna could be I really have no idea
she makes a good B'Elanna I'm not really
sure what the stewardship in the center
is I don't need her is that the defiant
that's the defiant oh yeah okay I I
hated ds9 hey I watched like the first
half you did we had watch that like all
the time when I was little mm-hmm in the
living room that's it okay well I thank
for that story shannon i think i have
heard one better but it started in a
much quicker so um want to let you guys
know that darren has gone ahead and
ordered a metric shitton of stickers um
the designs which he will be featuring
here after he gets done putting down his
drink you mean this one that one and a
lovely evil server which fits perfectly
on cell phones yes yeah I and um it's it
takes a little work and if you're doing
it on a blackberry that's gonna get the
exacto knife out you can make it work I
mean like I did exactly right but we
want to let you guys know that we are
coming out with a new stickers page and
for everybody who has ordered a sticker
before right in the last in the last
couple of days from this episode taping
or for the next couple of days as we go
to CES because we are not going to be
here to fulfill anything right in that
time period just if you want to go ahead
and do the regular secure donation go
ahead because you will be presented with
it's a beautiful little pineapples evil
servers may be any less tickets if they
come in but what not well tilt in
addition to the regular hak5 and
treasurer technol occurs we're going to
be putting in the evil server and the
Oscar sir excuse me yes or a girl sager
big device I am I invite nick my going
to do so good darren has just alluded to
the fact that we're going to go be going
to CES we already told you guys about
this in addition we're gonna be doing
live or excuse me not live we're going
to be doing daily episodes from CES via
humor we're also going to be special
hosting some segments for the live
episodes of tekzilla mine Brewers zero
boat and also we're going to do a CES
wrap-up show for that wednesday after
CES now CES is actually the day starts
the day before this comes out so if you
are in vegas for CES make sure you
follow one of us on twitter so that and
let us know via like direct message so
that we can go ahead and meet up with
everybody who's going to be at CES and
wants to go ahead and have a drink
together my employment matt is then
wounded there better be subtitles under
here so that I can kick his ass later oh
there will let's see uh so yeah watch
tekzilla they're going to be doing live
episodes thursday friday and saturday
and also they're going to be doing daily
episode so tekzilla and hak5 the
featured revision3 shows going to CES
want to let you guys know about that and
also we will be shooting HD from CES and
from that point on so you guys have been
asking when it's actually coming and
finally it is coming I hope yes if we
