Netflix welcome to hack tip the show we
break down the concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Aaron kitchen and
today we're diving into the doodads that
make up a dough 2.11 so great until
Friday I'm little Sparky anyway we're
going to go more specifically into all
the fun little things about why five
frames now if you're not familiar with a
frame it's simply a data packet for
example an Ethernet frame is just a
bunch of data sent from a network card
consisting of a header a payload and an
integrity check of some sort at the end
the payload itself it just could be any
kind of protocol packet it typically an
IP packet but it could be anything right
the payload is encapsulated or enclosed
within other elements that make up the
frame overhead for example an 802 dot 3
Ethernet frame will begin with a source
and destination MAC address as well as
the ether type which is basically a
field that kind of defines what protocol
is inside so think of it as an envelope
for a letter and the frame then at the
end will issue a frame check sequence
which is some sort of it's kind of like
a special checksum of the frame so that
the receiving party can use that to
verify the integrity of the frame as a
whole
so if say something happens like I don't
know it just gets bored there's some
interference on the line or something it
can go ahead and ask the sender to go
ahead and send that again right well for
the most part 802 11 frames or Wi-Fi
frames work very similarly and it's with
careful use or abuse of these frames
that we're able to accomplish some
pretty nifty stuff so as always let's go
ahead and start with the terms now
without getting into every single octet
or bit within the frame suffice it to
say that Wi-Fi frames are made up of the
same kind of stuff as Ethernet frames
they contain source and destination MAC
addresses they also contain control
fields for specifying like what version
of the 802 dot 11 protocol they're using
and again the payload could be anything
like the TCP or UDP packets that make up
this here video and then finally a frame
check sequence so verify the integrity
there are three major kinds of frames in
802 11
we have management frames control frames
and data frames so let's go ahead and
begin with the management frames there
are four basic types of management
frames there are beacons probes
associations and authentications now a
beacon frame is one that an access point
or a base station just periodically
sends out announcing its presence to the
world saying things like here's my SSID
or service set identifier we're going to
be getting into these frames a lot more
in detail very soon so suffice it to say
those are our that for now now the next
type of frame is a probe and probes come
in two flavors they they come in
requests and responses now probe request
is one that usually comes from a client
think of it as like your laptop or your
phone calling out for an access point
asking whether it's within range or you
know trying to get details from an
access point that it just heard of
beacon from now the probe request is
typically followed up by a probe
response and that's where the access
point will send one of these where here
the probe requests it'll say things that
include information that they'll need to
establish a lasting and meaningful
relationship things like I don't know
what kind of data rates they support the
next type of management frame is
Association and these come in three
flavors Association requests responses
and disassociation now Association
requests are simply that it's a frame
sent from one station to another asking
if they can be friends saying hey among
other things can you allocates a memory
for me and let's synchronize our watches
so we can more effectively communicate
and an association frame is typically
followed by an association response
which will either be acceptance or sure
let's be friends or rejection like the
popu now when two stations want to say
peace out y'all they just send a
disassociation frame and it's really a
polite way for them to do it as it
allows the other party to on allocate
memory and other such cleanup functions
now the final kind of management frame
is authentication and that comes in two
flavors authentication and D
authentication now the aptly-named
authentication or authoring begins the
process of authentication who would
imagine right and in this case in the
case of like an open access point
there's really only two authentication
frames that are exchanged
when asking for access and then the
other ones saying come on in partner and
in the in case of the pathetically weak
WEP authentication standard the client
will send like an auth frame asking for
access and then the station will respond
to the auth frame with another of its
own with kind of like a bit of text and
this is what's known as a challenge and
then finally the client will then take
that bit of text encrypt it with the WEP
key and send it back and if everything
matches hey they're all best friends
right now the authentication process for
WPA and wpa2 is similar but also a lot
more complex and we're going to be
getting into that later on in this
series in a lot more detail but that
brings us to the last management frame D
authentication or D auth and a deal off
frame is one sent from one station to
another to basically terminate secure
sessions now the stations may still be
associated to one another but they've
effectively stopped speaking to one
another at all like Clark to the hand
anyway now in just a bit we're gonna
cover the last two types of frames but
first we're gonna take a quick break and
then find out about this week's giveaway

hak5 and sign up now be sure to use this
URL so that they know we sent you as we
just discussed there are three major
types of a two 2.11 frames management
control and data and while we've defined
management let's go ahead and talk about
the last two now control frames come in
three varieties request to send clear to
send and acknowledgment frames a request
to send or an RTS frame is
the name would imply is kind of a short
little frame that just sends what one
one station to another asking if it can
send some data frames and it's really
the first part of a two-way handshake
that makes up the beginning of any data
transmission the second part of course
to that handshake being the clear
descent or CTS frame if the station
isn't busy doing other things it'll go
ahead and issue one of these in response
to an RTS and the neat thing about this
is that will actually specify an amount
of time for which the two stations can
communicate now the other stations
nearby are going to observe this data
and they're going to wait patiently and
this minimizes interruptions that would
otherwise cause interference resulting
in I don't know them having a resent
packets and basically overall
degradation of the network performance
now if finally after the RTS and CTS
handshake are taking place and that the
data been transmitted there is typically
being sent an acknowledgment or ACK
Frank and this lets the sender know that
everything was received in good
condition if the receiver checks the
integrity of the data frames and
something or it's just simply not going
to send an ACK frame causing the sender
to retry and the last frame as we've
just mentioned is the data frame
containing anything you want inside and
these guys are the workhorses of Wi-Fi
but of course they couldn't even exist
without the diligent work of the
management and control frames so good
job everybody
that's all AB some cake alrighty it's
time for the giveaway last week I asked
what draft started as a steady group of
I Triple E 802 11 in 2003 to define how
wireless devices can create static or
ad-hoc mesh networks with each other and
the answer is 802 dot 11s this week what
I'd like to know is what numbered flag
in airplay and gee will send a DI
authentication break answer in the
comments and be randomly selected to
receive one of the radios that I use
right here on actively and as always we
value your feedback and your suggestions
