Google now and Siri get owned from 16
feet away NASA acts from the 1970s and
the EU declaring data transfer
agreements with the US and valid all
that coming up now on threat wire hello
world i'm darren kitchen this is threat
where for October 14th 2015 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom and we begin today
with the beloved yellow HTTP warning
icon and Chrome yes that icon that was
previously a warning of mixed content
where HTTPS sites but also hosts
non-https material is now phasing out
according to a Google security blog
coming in version 46 Chrome will mark
the HTTPS with minor errors state using
the same page icon as the HTTP pages and
this means instead of having that shiny
happy green lock icon of consumer
confidence and will humpback
preservation you will instead get the
bland desolate why are we still using
meat space analogies in the digital
world piece of paper icon the two
reasons Google States is that it will
give you know a better sense of security
which makes sense because HTTPS sites
with mixed contents are really only
marginally more secure than HTTPS at all
and because it means less icons for
consumers to learn basically it's either
skier or it's not secure or it's that
broke-ass icon with the red X and the
HTTPS crossed through like the humpback
whale referenced previously in this
script go figure
mad props to France this week as the
government's National Agency of computer
science or a NSS I have reported a
wicked cool hack against Google now and
iOS Siri that would have an attacker
remotely controlling a phone using radio
waves from between 6 and 16 feet away
this is so cool the hack relies on
either an Android phone or with Google
now or iOS device with Siri to have a
pair of headphones with a microphone
plugged in and no I'm not talking about
a Bluetooth headset but a wired headset
why well because this is so cool the
headset wire actually acts as an antenna
and the attack is pulled off using will
get this G on your radio and the USRP
though I'm sure any software-defined
radio would do the trick
and it is just a cool hack because
basically they're able to
to your phone through the wire yes it's
ridiculous it's simple to fix of course
is Google you know you just disable
Google now or Syria on your lockscreen
iOS currently does that by default or
you could start rockin you know a
headset with a shielded cable or dig
yourself a hole and cover it with mylar
and chicken wire I mean it's it's really
up to you the authors have a lot more
details on the technical stuff in their
I Triple E paper though I've yet to find
any of the GRC files that are in the
company the hack which would be really
nice because I want to try this right
now with the hack RF anyway it's awesome
research which actually shows that that
was shown off at the hack in Paris over
the summer but it wasn't really getting
a whole lot of traction and kind of
slipped through the cracks and you
should check out the full wired article
in the show notes maybe it's because I
just saw the Martian and loved it or
because I'm a NASA junkie at heart but
this hackaday story having nothing to do
with security and privacy caught my eye
and I thought you'd love it too
basically it's an account of the NASA
hacks and some crafty engineering over
eleven days in May following big
less-than-stellar launch of America's
first space station Skylab I won't spoil
the tale but suffice it to say we've all
been there we've all at that moment in a
hardware store where we realized well
actually this tool is an intended to fix
solar panel arrays but it could probably
do the job also just in case you missed
it we had an awesome discussion myself
and Tom Merritt over on the daily tech
news show on Tuesday covering the
European Union Court of Justice
declaring data transfers agreements with
the US to be invalid which has since put
a lot of pressure on Facebook in having
them go on the privacy offensive and it
could mean a lot of either really good
jobs for data center techs in Europe or
a lot of strange loopholes and laws and
we'll see what happened anyway my eyes
on it and it's basically going to be a
wonderful fragmented future for the web
now before I do go I want to give a huge
thanks to everyone who has supported the
show on patreon if you find value from
this you want to put some value back
into it maybe you should give some
thought into becoming a patreon and
patreon.com slash threat wire and we may
even be able to feature your adorable
pets and fur babies and the like on our
next episode our plan of course is to do
this three times a week and we're eager
to hit that milestone goal with a
rotating cast of myself as well as
Patrick Norton
Shannon Morse so I hope you will
contribute to help keeping threat wire
coming to you guys completely
independent and ad free and we can't
donate a like and subscribe all of that
goes a long way too with that I am
Darrin kitchen and I'll see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
