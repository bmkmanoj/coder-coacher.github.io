free hacking team malware scanner Google
Play Store compromised happy Monday
people all that more coming up now on
threat liar greetings i'm patrick norton
this is threat wire for July twentieth
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
huge thanks to everyone who watches this
show three times a week and supports us
at patreon.com / threat wire oh my
goodness I don't even know where to
begin this morning so i'll start with
ashley madison the cheating site has
been hacked yellow apparently a good 37
million folks have signed up for Ashley
madison.com that's the cheating site is
that a judgment calling a site to set up
affairs of cheating site that says quote
life is short have an affair and a group
calling itself the impact team claims to
have completely compromised avid life
media the canadian firm that owns and
runs ashleymadison.com claiming to have
quote the company's user databases
financial records and other proprietary
information it's quote from krebs on
security so the hackers started posting
chunks of that information online and
then a manifesto posted with the data
quote avid life media has been
instructed to take Ashley Madison and
establish men offline permanently in all
forms or we will release all customer
records including profiles with all the
customers secret sexual fantasies and
matching credit card transactions real
names and addresses and employee
documents and emails the other websites
may stay online generous ILM's chief
executive Noel Biderman confirmed the
hectic rebs on security and krebs quotes
an impact team manifesto posted with the
stolen data that it's where the other
stuff came from that they decided to
publish the information into response to
alleged lies ALM told its customers
about a service that allows members to
completely erase their profile
information for a $19 fee apparently ALM
is collecting 1.7 million dollars in
those fees but hasn't really erased
anything uh the latest nasty found
hidden in the 400 gigabytes of data
stolen from hacking team is not
surprised a flash zero-day exploit
woohoo unfortunately what trend micro
discovered wasn't quote and draw
back door capable of bypassing the
Google Play screening process now you
have to actually download an app be news
to open up your android system and
google has pulled the app from the
Google Play Store security week's
article Google Play checks bypassed by
hacking team android back door which is
where we found out about this adds that
quote the back door which trend micro to
texas android OS underscore HT been EWS
dot a I guess that would be Android OS
underscore HT the news made it past a
Google Play filtering process because it
doesn't contain any exploit code and
requests only three permissions during
installation unquote which makes me
wonder just exactly what could somebody
with access to a much more popular
application to you by inserting a few
lines of code that look relatively mild
note to self make sure I've got my
security software running on my android
phone I might suggest you do the same
while i'm talking hacking team has fine
monday morning it caught an article up
on cooper ski labs threat post blog it's
really interesting it's about a tool
called milano quote researchers at rook
security of released a new tool that
looks for hacking team malware on target
systems and also have published a set of
indicators have compromised to help
organizations look for signs of an
infection from the intrusion software
end quotes IE if you're worried about
hacking team you want to check this out
the tool is called milano the Chrome
browser really didn't want me to keep it
flighted as something potentially
nefarious and asked me to wipe it before
I opened it it was pretty interesting me
in chrome mono e mono trying to actually
open the software i download Thank You
Chrome for looking after me I just ran a
quick scan with it on the windows system
it rocks the DA style interface Milano
