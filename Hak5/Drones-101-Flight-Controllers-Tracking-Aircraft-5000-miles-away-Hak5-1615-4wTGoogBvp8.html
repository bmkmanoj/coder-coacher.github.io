by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Warren Thank You weekly dose of
technical system we have a fantastic
show for you guys this week yes we do I
would like to introduce somebody new to
the show there's no coming yes this is
our new friend what are we calling her
this is brother you know Frappuccino
yeah yeah well it turns out you can
repurpose items from your local coffee
shop no this is actually my personal one
and we'll get into that
Frappuccino is looking great thank you I
pride myself on her zip ties and velcro
is pretty much all that's holding me
together a couple m3 screws later we're
actually talking about more drone stops
this week Peters back with us and we're
up in the Eugene OR again back with
mustache talking about the drones
putting one together - no that's - you
know what else though in addition to the
car way to come and need to shave and
all thanks thank you
these are the important comments by the
way we got a comment that we don't seem
to be having enough fun on this show
wait seriously mm-hmm and you know what
I haven't we've just for this occasion I
happen to come across I guess as we were
doing some spring cleaning yeah here do
you remember oh no from a fin that's a
gift from me Wow there are now how many
100 look at that you see that there are
11 eyes there are now 11 of these in
existence oh my god I remember when you
made these it is at five on one side and
trust your Titan West on the other I
guess it's not a legend actually it's 11
oh no I'm doing this I'm live here just
a little bit just a little bit just I
have to drive home just later in a few
hours okay that's fine
there we go Wow nine available now yeah
it's called cringe Cheers
well at least it tastes like cinnamon
well drink it already okay I need a
chaser I'll chase you around the set no
I need a chaser do you soda this is so
bad
do your system you have soda alright
yeah we just had a shot are you having a
shot too yeah okay
so there's actually gay ass is left this
one's going to Sarah and the laptop who
appreciates here you go oh man I am so
not into liquor I'm 20 years old and I
should be but
oh I'm not something that into liquor
beer and wine right here yes ya Yin Lee
exactly we also got a legitimate
question here which was about a few of
these in fact about the solar-powered
pineapple case from last week and just
some specs on in honestly I thought that
we covered this and I have talked about
solar in the past before but this is
stupid simple we can actually come back
at this with a sexier design something
maybe in a much smaller more covert
Pelican case I think that should be apt
with like I don't know lithium batteries
instead a lot acid but all that's inside
of here is we got what is this a 10 watt
panel on the roof we've drilled some
holes for our antennas mounted our 14 DB
eye panel antenna as well as our 9 DB
eye dipole and our coaxial collinear 4ad
SB and then on the inside all we have is
our Wi-Fi pineapple and just a big-ass
lead acid battery and this is simply a
the least expensive 12-volt charge
controller you're going to find in fact
I think it came with the kit it's
nothing fancy not like the one in the
van but essentially all of these do the
same thing which is a three-phase
charging where it it doesn't bulk J the
bulk phase and a trickle phase and I
forget the other phase but essentially
it gives power and then makes it through
the night I love it
yes it works well and it's so covert as
a lot of people have pointed out in the
comments it's totally no one would
notice this if it was yeah
so I'm taking our segment from last week
and I'm growing this week segment off of
that and we're bringing in Rob to talk
to us what's wrong there are two divert
and then there's the other Rob right yes
all right and by the way no one has ever
seen both of these Rob's in the same
place at once
coincidence I don't just say him he's
just a Cylon so there's two of them
actually the Cylons are backed over by
the bay and they carry oil from the
refinery we've covered this on the SMS
maybe we should get into the first
segment yeah let's get into the first
segment right
and we're back with our drone series
here and Peter I have just a quick
question just something brief and that
is we've been talking about how with
this remote-controlled quadcopter here
now I can give it input with my remote
control and it will you say pitch
forward or do what I tell it to do when
that all just goes into the flight
controller and and then there's a
hamster there's a hamster on a wheel in
the flight controller and then yes does
that work so what you have there is as I
meant as we mentioned in the last
segment to there are some sensors on
this so you are sending some commands to
the flight controller yes I'm saying
pitch for each forward and then the
controller takes that into account with
together with its own representation of
where it is so there are some sensors
like gyroscopes accelerometers we will
get into that in detail in a minute
these are being used to tell the
microcontroller where it is in the world
so if it is tilted how fast it is
turning and then using that information
it takes your what you wanted to do into
account and then it does what you asked
it to do why do you need to do that well
we were talking about previously how
like even if you're the most badass
fighter jet pilot you've got maybe a 10
hurt response rate and this needs to
have something 10 times that to stay
aloft or else you're just fighting with
it and it's just gonna be jerking around
and crashing that's right that's right
so basically you have a second person
that is inside the aircraft co-pilot
copilot that sounds a lot better than
autopilot act yeah and actually actually
there used to be copilot modules for
airplanes and stuff in the past for RC
airplanes that's interesting see now I
need a bumper sticker that says my
co-pilot is open-source that's pretty
good
yeah that's that's exactly what is
happening here you have you have an
electronic co-pilot on board of the
aircraft and the copilot has to know how
it is flying because it it is the faster
one it's the faster one of this to
oversteer so I'm really saying like hey
go forwards and it's like well based on
all of this stuff the best way to go
forward would be like this like this
right okay so how does it like what are
those sensors you know aside from my
input what are the other sensors that it
knows about itself right so the most
basic sensor that you have in the most
basic setup is 3-axis gyroscope you
could even have a mechanical one that's
like when we started with this hobby
this is what was happening when I kind
of got first ever like ICBMs had
mechanical yes yeah and yeah also KX UFO
that was say a very early toy in a
quadrocopter toy head and mechanical
gyroscope inside so by now we have much
more sophisticated thanks to our
cellphones so it is much smaller it's
barely visible right so if you take one
of those boards yes so this is a very
basic flight controller and it has a
3-axis gyroscope in it in fact very
similar to what's inside of this like
off the help shelf toy which one has a
3-axis gyroscope what does what does
that mean first of all what are those
accesses and what does a gyroscope doing
for me yeah that's right
so
there is a there is a big difference
between a gyroscope mechanical gyroscope
and the MEMS gyroscope that we know of
so many general scopes can measure the
rotation rate of of an object around one
linear axis so we have three of them and
we have three axes again
we define where front is so let's say
this is X and we have Y and then we have
Z sir and we have for each axis we have
one gyroscope that is telling you how
fast are you rotating around along those
act this axis huh
so if you are not rotating to zero
rotations so it actually doesn't know
like what your pitch is it knows what
your rate of pitch corrects that's right
so for example like with this this is a
very basic toy that only has a 3-axis
gyro and if I hold this down sideways
while I plug in the battery it's going
to get very upset and it's not gonna it
in fact if I try to fly it now it's
gonna just crash because I was holding
it sideways now it's actually actually
there is a calibration yeah there's a
relation where you set it on a flat it's
the important thing is like when you're
starting almost every auto pilot it's
like don't rotate it while it is doing
it startup that's that's actually you
are trying to find where these zero
rotation speed is because when you
switch it on it will take the current
value it's like because of the sensors
how accurate they are in then and an end
they basically take the zero value of
zero rotation when you put them on the
ground so you plug it in you get the
zero value and then if you were rotating
it while it was doing that and it would
think oh rotating like this means zero
means so it's going to try to do that
you know that a stable stable exactly so
don't do it
okay so what happens there as as you
said with this very basic quadrotors
right is when you're commanding with the
stick to pitch forward you're actually
commanding to rotate with a certain
speed forward so rotate with that
certain speed forward like this now
what's the problem with that though if
I'm like controlling this and I say hey
tip maybe so forward there's no problem
there's no problem with it yeah you you
have to do more you got as a hacker I
want like all of the yeah the winters
what is the next step up to make it
cooler
it's like Gordon better or easier
because icon on my stick if I'm saying
rotate forward and then I just let go
it's then it will stay that way she's
gonna find you have to pull it back and
say oh yeah it is it level somewhat and
you have to do the leveling right so
what do you do there you take
accelerometers it's a three axis
accelerometer so what it does it gives
you the acceleration along this three
axis XYZ as we described for the
gyroscopes and what it actually measures
is how fast you dig you are accelerating
to the ground okay well how fast am I
accelerate into the ground right now
1g nine point nine meters per second
carefully I am in fact falling towards
the earth in space I'm accelerating
towards the planet
yeah but yeah there's like rounding the
way I am really thankful for gravity
right yes and so you're saying like for
instance this one that they call it
sometimes they call them a six access
gyro or something what they mean is it's
got you know there's only three axis as
X Y Z of your joy of your gyroscope -
again like you said no the robot a
rotating right and then three more
access of accelerometer so we're nowhere
down is OAC so it knows along this axis
what down is
and along that is what down is yeah you
tilt this guy up and then still it is ax
the G vector or the earth acceleration
vector is down so it now knows it's like
I'm not rotating at the moment but I'm
still tilted got it
so now so so this is why on the nicer
ones on the more advanced you know
off-the-shelf stuff that has that
accelerometer you can let go of it and
it's what they call Auto leveling where
it knows that it's tilting forward and
it can write itself that's that's
exactly right that's what the things are
actually doing cool there are I take it
when I tell it to do something and it
takes into account that information when
we're just talking about gyroscopes
there's probably some complex math that
requires Lisp or something called right
where it will kind of come up with a
solution you then tell whatever are
actuators are the things that actually
cause flight or in our case the rotors
well the math can be as complicated as
you want to make it basically it's like
you can you can start with actually
quite simple math with Euler Euler to
representation of your angles and then
you just take the gyroscopes speed you
write a simple PID controller it's just
actually quite a basic controller
concept so what he's saying is like two
lines of Perl know it's two lines of see
actually it's real two equations or
three equations that unity is like eight
characters of Perl
now this is actually it's like when you
look at it and it's actually not that
hard okay in the basic level it's like
you can make it more sophisticated to be
more accurate but that's what you thing
is I want more sophisticated I want to
say have the the except the gyroscope
says R as well as the accelerometers in
fact there are others and I take it the
more sensors you have the better of an
intelligent decision the flight
controller can make it as far as telling
in our case motors yeah what to do yeah
you can figure out that yet you can
basically not only make a decision about
it it's not also the way
you are figuring out where you are in
the world is and dealing with the
sensors have noise have errors they how
you deal with that's interesting right
because another sensor that for instance
this one has is a barometer right now a
barometer measures air pressure and now
it's not perfect in fact this one has
you know there's like a piece of little
foam that has to stick on top of it and
it's not gonna work so great in a storm
or something like that like it's rainy
outside right now so one really worked
the greatest because there maybes a lot
of variation yeah it's like windy or
like gusty or something then it will
because the this is the interesting part
it's like this is we are talking here
about pressure in like mini Pascal it's
like it's like change
Tencent they are incredibly sensitive
they are that sensitive that they are
actually better temperature sensors then
pressure sensor well but I guess what
I'm getting at is that the more sensors
that you can tie into the mix each
sensor can check the other sensor you
can kind of else right wait
different things you can come up with
him sure there's fancy algorithms yeah
you get more more of a absolute
reference to the world the more absolute
reference to the world you have and less
relative to your previous state the more
accurate you can make it yes you know
I've seen you put and then you go at
some point to Kalman filters where you
have real matrix matrix calculations or
even adaptive filters that adjust their
gains based on on some estimation it can
get really really cool sounds awesome I
mean and so I guess what we're getting
at here is the more sensors the better
and how do you deal with those sensors
is is really well better for us yes more
to work with for instance so that we
haven't talked about this yes but I know
that one of the first you know drones to
hit the scenes commercially as far as
like I think Shannon reviewed a couple
years ago at CES was this parrot
ar.drone and it worked with Syrio scopic
cameras that pointed towards the ground
yeah no it was it is a single camera
was it single camera yeah it has it does
optic flow directly in the chip so it's
kind of similar to say your optical
mouse yeah you know way in a way yeah in
a way but the disadvantage used to be
like if you don't have enough features
on the ground and it's too smooth just
like how old optical mice didn't work
very well
on surfaces that were all the same color
or whatever yeah okay so there are so
these we've just been talking about
these are toys right yeah and they
implement various levels of different
yeah basically when you buy them you you
just get a flying controller in it we're
not interested in that we want to make
something cool something with raid hard
drives and liquid cooling and
overclocked video cards except applied
to or aerospace yeah so what what is
available like if I just wanted to get
flying but what do I need flight
controller wise flight controller wise
yeah yeah it's huge huge selection
there's what we actually want is
something so there are commercial ones
there are also professional ones we will
not talk about the professional ones
because I don't think we it's outside of
the scope in fact let's go ahead and
already Nix this guy this is one of your
more comments very very popular praia
terry one this is from a company out of
China it's called DJI and it's called a
NASA flight controller it's very popular
we've used in fact in the previous
segment where we took a drone to the top
of Mount Diablo to do some ATSB research
we used one because it was well enough
and didn't have to do anything
plug did plugged in the battery turned
it on well where we go which is okay
sure and I could tell you just go by an
iMac and you're done but that's not the
way we do things so thank you very much
Naza but let's let's go with the open
source open source stuff yeah you want
to get like like Linux you know yeah
yeah yeah so that we have several
players it's like everyone a little bit
more familiar
it's like distributions yeah we've got
yours gentoos you've got your Ubuntu so
you got your man see that your March we
we left the Mac OS and windows
out of the equation now so let's look at
the open source stuff right there is the
also very known
it's our copilot it's based on Arduino
and it is very commonly spread and you
you can buy it in almost every round the
corner that's awesome well I mean I love
Arduino it's open hardware that's a very
cool thing there's another one that's
based on some other yeah a particular
commercial like like kind of a hack
together oh right he has a multi we you
just kind of have his Lynn a lineage
from we were talking about how these
MEMS sensors these I am uses that are
called these inertial measurement units
and stuff have become so inexpensive
because of cell phone technology that
then then found their way into that
gimmicky game console the Nintendo Wii
and because that was basically in one
Chuck and I think from then the nunchuck
I think there is like a small tiny board
inside that has the gyroscopes on it and
you can pull it out so they detect that
yeah and they took an Arduino plugged in
the this board in the other one wrote
some software and got it to flood it's
it's beautiful hack it's I love I love
that kind of stuff
there's also some other bigger players
as well we've got pixhawk big hockey act
that's what I have an example of that in
the iris drone we have from 3d robotics
however it is not running the pixhawk
from where in fact it's running stuff
from another project yet it's from our
copilot I think pork export it over it's
like it they have their own firmware for
it it you can't play around and swap
things around and like if someone ports
to one Hardware through the other
because at the core these boards are
actually quite similar from what they
provide sure they're not x86 obviously
but you know these are little
microcontrollers various yeah like
atmega so things from at mole or things
from different arm vendors in fact yeah
I think there were some project based on
pic but at mega was huge and everyone
was using it for
many many years yeah and now they are
being replaced by bike cortex m3 arm
32-bit processors and this is like
pushing away the atmega out of it when
people start to want to do more
sophisticated algorithms and spread they
their algorithmic wings yes no pun
intended
so another popular one in fact would be
open pilot yes so this this is an open
pilot board in fact that you know
another example of an open hardware
where this is an implementation from
what was the company that does this one
again the orange one this is a
ready-made I see okay these are the guys
yeah yellow one and a black one this is
the basic white one as well yeah yeah
there is a depends on who which vendor
you're getting it from there are several
vendors that because it's open hardware
that that can be the case and this is
really popular with the fpv flyers and
I'm gonna be implementing one in a
separate project for a small 250 class
quad just for first person view flying
and then we come to and this is why
we're here and why we would feeder then
we come to the paparazzi yeah paparazzi
UAV yeah this is an open source project
that actually has has been there out
there for quite a while it's started in
about ten years ago when they started to
make out of pilots and actually for
fixed wings first and then added quad
rotors to the system so we have in what
is great about paparazzi is that it is
not it is quite controller or autopilot
agnostic it's like anything you want to
port it to have fun and there is a huge
amount of different auto pilots
depending on the application who
developed it and they are mostly open
hardware and I think all of them are
actually open hardware and so you're
saying that the the hardware's decouple
is vastly decoupled from yeah for
example Microsoft Project started with
an atmega
then got ported to an LPC arm
then to stm32 and so and there's also a
port just a PC to run it on Linux
directly the completely controlled so
let's just put a think pad on this and
we'll be good to go no for real no way
yet people people are able to port it to
this any pcs or their 86 running yes so
cool yeah you can do that it's like
paparazzi's it's flexibility in every
aspect in some ways well we have for
instance we've got our you know our auto
quads and our our UAV pngs and are open
pilots and those that are you know some
of them may be of various levels like
distros we know you've got your linux
mints and your boon twos and then your
Debian's and you know as you put more in
you can get more out the paparazzi is
kind of more like a Gentoo yeah it's
like if you're comfortable compiling it
yourself or something like that yeah you
can get a lot more performance out of it
yes that's that's exactly right it's
like the idea is we are not telling you
what you want hmm
you are telling us what you want
basically you take the whole framework
the whole paparazzi framework you
download it and you configure it to your
needs you compile it to the right
processor and as you just said as the
example of it running on an x86 board is
a good example of like you know imagine
that and then take a look at this
implementation this is what a centimeter
by a centimeter is it isn't two by two
as you say by two centimeters and this
this implements how many sensors now so
this one has additionally to the
defaults of three axis accelerometer
three-axis gyroscope three axis
magnetometer also a GPS receiver onboard
and so this is a magnetometer and a GPS
receiver so this is a GPS receiver
that's correct and on the other side
when you turn it around you have
barometer so pressure sensor you have in
three axis magnetometer over here and
then so the Magnum the magnet meter
mag nama term pronounce that
magnetometer anyway it knows where North
is and that's a good thing yeah and also
it's inclination that's also interesting
cool yeah Wow
so a compare with that the barometer and
the GPS like so cliff has small that is
a little sensors so it's a basic set of
sensors that you need to completely
autonomously fly around this time yeah
thing this thing yes that's a lot
smaller than an x86 board okay this is
really cool so I guess we have to give
mad props to everybody though in this
open source community ya know done and
we are going to go ahead and continue
this series with the paparazzi I'm eager
to get our papa first our Lisa M board
as it were plugged into the computer and
set up so we can actually start
programming this guy get some motor
spinning and yeah and get to flying
Thank You P let's do it alright we'll be
right back I had a brilliant idea the
other day Wi-Fi enabled bird houses so I
went to the puppet I told all my friends
and they're all like dude that's a
brilliant idea and I was like man I
should tell the world then I thought
about it you know what I could put it on
the World Wide Web and you know what
when I go to do that I get myself a
fresh domain and I pick them over at
domain.com because it's got a quick
domain discovery system and an easy
checkout process and you can have your
website up and running in no time and I
love that so no time like the time when
your domain is set up and I love that
and domain.com loves hak5 and we love
them because they're affordable reliable
easy to use and also they're really fun
to deal with on social media is you can
tweet them and be like hey why are you
guys still sponsoring high-five those
guys are crazy but you know what else is
crazy the savings you use the coupon
code hak5 a check out get extra 15% off
at domain.com so when you think domain
names think domain.com
we're back and it's now time for the
trivia question of the week so last
week's trivia question was the last
version of Windows to use fat as the
default file system was what and the
answer was Windows ME now this week's
trivia question is who coined the term
robot and you can answer that over at
hak5 org slash trivia
beware of the Panda in good luck we're
back in the office this week and I
decided to have some more fun with a
virtual radar server so if you guys
remember last week we basically decided
to take the Wi-Fi pineapple out stick it
on top of a hill with a solar panel so
that it charges for like three days and
we stuck an antenna on it we went back
here to our office connected to our
Internet's stuck in antenna out the
window directly at the hills so we were
able to get all sorts of really really
cool airplane tracking going on from our
Wi-Fi pineapple on the hill straight
down to here so we didn't even have to
leave the office once we got it all
connected it was awesome we had it
running for several days with no
problems at all and luckily nobody ended
up taking our Wi-Fi pineapple well we
thought about it and we figured wouldn't
it be really cool to not just use our
local network but to also connect to
somebody's Wi-Fi pineapple really really
far away so that's exactly what I did
this week and we are bringing in mr. Rob
aka archiver hi archiver how are you hey
Shannon has things hi it's so good to
have you back on the show again
so if you guys remember our cover is one
of our longtime friends he's from
Ireland he lives over in Dublin I hope
you don't mind me sharing where you are
no not at all okay so you have a Wi-Fi
pineapple connected where do you have it
exactly is it sitting in your house it's
actually out on my balcony ah which is
facing Dublin Airport oh that's perfect
how far away are you from the airport uh
about five kilometres as the crow flies
okay that's awesome so we're gonna get
some good airplane action going on so
what we did this week we had archiver's
set up his wife
pineapple and archiver can you tell
everybody how you go through the process
of setting it up so that we can get the
airplane tracking happening sure not a
problem basically as you had it last
week on the show I plug in my pineapple
locate the SD Oregon going to it power
it all up I know I have it set so it
connects straight into my Wi-Fi upon
power up it knows what to look for in
connecting just check it in make sure
that it's broadcasting it correctly and
make sure that my port three zero zero
zero three on my router it just goes
straight through to the pineapple gave
you my IP address in a way we go awesome
alright so what I did on my own computer
I stole a virtual radar server installed
so I went ahead and got that if you
haven't downloaded it yet you can get at
virtual radar server co uk this is an
open source dotnet application so you
can have lots and lots of fun with it it
has plenty of customizable applications
for its maps so you can have lots of fun
with it
so if I open it up I went ahead and
included his pineapple down here and I
called it archiver if you want to add a
new one you just go to tools go down to
options and then choose receivers and
include the new one so I have his right
here well don't worry will will blur
your your IP address so nobody can see
it so I included his name right here
Odo's his external IP address and the
port number and that's all you have to
change so once I tested the connection
connection can be made with these
settings click OK choose ok and then I
have it down there so I can already see
that we get tons and tons of messages
coming through here from overseas which
totally blows my mind but it works I
love this about it once you have
everything ready to go you click take
online mine says take offline right now
because it is running online and then
you can click on 127.0.0.1 slash virtual
radar and you should get a map now if
the map does show up in your local area
so for me it's way over here in the
United States you can still see my
little blue dot down there you can just
scroll over to wherever you have the
Wi-Fi pineapple setup so you should
probably know the location beforehand
that would probably help zoom in to
wherever you plan to look and you should
start seeing all sorts of different
airplanes now you'll notice that also
the map looks a little bit different
this time around
I just decided to change it over to
solid satellite instead of just the
regular map so you can see a little bit
of a difference you know looks a little
bit more like an actual map and we're
already seeing a ton of things coming
through here look at this archiver it's
so pretty
we have planes coming in from Wales from
Dublin you're seeing as far as Wales
England yes now mine you did show me
previously and I got a screen capture of
it what you are seeing through your
Wi-Fi pineapple and it looks eerily
similar to what I can see as far as
which airplanes you're able to see and
everything so I don't really see any
kind of loss of connection between you
and us over here in San Francisco which
is great
wouldn't you agree yeah it looks really
clear it's a brilliant piece of gear
it's beautiful so if I run down the menu
of course you can see everything like we
used to
Ryanair I'm not really familiar with any
of these aircraft actually there's a
green one in here with a cute little
shamrock on the on its butt which is
awesome Ryanair again so I'm seeing
about one two three four five six seven
on the map currently and then there's
two other ones which haven't determined
their location at the moment but they
were setting some kind of ping requests
out how many are you seeing on your side
same amount right now I have seven on
screen and nine in the list yeah me too
okay perfect so we are seeing this exact
same amounts that is so cool I love this
program it is so much fun archiver I
want to know have you found any other
programs out there other than what we've
talked about on the show for and for use
with your antennas at home not so much
at least I find one or two that I'm
still testing yeah once I've tested them
a bit more I might send them in via
feedback at hak5 dot org and you guys
can take a look too that is so so cool I
love virtual radar server I love
it's open source and that you can do so
much with it I have a feeling that
there's plenty more about all these
programs that we checked out that we
just haven't figured out yet so if you
guys have any kind of opinions comments
or questions or you have a program that
you want me to check out as far as
antennas go let me know feedback
