coverage for hak5 I'm Darren kitchen
here at CES 2012 checking out the latest
from Asus this right here no it's not a
netbook it's not a laptop this is the
Asus Transformer Prime it's the tf201
there's a 1280 by 800 display as a
bigger brother that's coming out soon at
the tf700 that will be available in May
with a slight upgrade from this a
whopping 1920 x 1200 that's the one that
I want and has a slightly improved
higher megapixel camera on the front end
we got a camera in the back end to this
right here is running Android
Gingerbread but by the time this airs it
will be running ice cream sandwich which
will potentially make this the first
tablet to enter the market with ice
cream sandwich so that's what's got me
all excited aside from the fact that
it's running the NVIDIA Tegra 3 wait way
to bury the lead Darren this thing's got
the Tegra 3 that's a quad-core tablet
actually has a fifth course or though I
don't even know what the word is that
but the extra fifth Corps is just to run
like little background processes the
wallpaper unessential stuffs save
battery life speaking of which 10 hours
of battery life on the tablet itself and
then this keyboard edition here sold
separately for 149 dollars will add an
extra six hours of battery life in
addition to giving you a ninety-two
percent a qwerty keyboard here so the
price point on the 20 1 32 gig model is
a four hundred ninety nine dollars these
700 which will be available in May is
going to be 5 99 and there's rumors that
might potentially have some FCC
documentation sometime soon for
potentially 3g I don't know that's what
I'm excited about because i'm using this
thing as a VoIP phone you know that'll
fit my pocket right huh move over galaxy
note anyway this is what I'm excited
about specifically hak5 audience will
know that the first generation of this
guy runs backtrack 5 and oh yes USB so
you know that's what I'm looking for
okay anyway for more coverage over here
at CES 2012 go ahead and head over to
revision 3.com / CES and thanks once
again to ford for powering our CES 2012
coverage the Ford Fiesta features
intelligent access with push-button
start the remote keyless entry
eliminates the need for keys and starts
your fiesta with the push of a button
you can't say enough about the
simplicity of just being able to walk up
to the car open the door and drive away
without fishing around in your pockets
thanks to Ford for powering our CES
