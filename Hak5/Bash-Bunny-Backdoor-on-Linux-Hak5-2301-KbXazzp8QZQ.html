Mac OS with the bash Bunny this time on
hack 5 he'll open hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen my name is shannon moory
it's your weekly dose of Technol s
welcome every DUP buddy ever died a
buddy dude to the show that we're not
recording for the second time because
the first one was out of focus oh man
that is never by the way happened to any
other podcasters ever lies well at least
we were recording the audio so if
anything I could like rerecord us just
being Talking Heads on camera and then
use our voice over just me and the whole
thing just meme the whole thing well
because we've never done that either so
we are rear according this episode and
we are going to be talking about a
really cool bash money script that
somebody wrote and sent in to us which
is really cool but we should first start
off talking about something else so back
doors yeah they're fun they are a
mainstay of hacker hijinks and today we
are featuring one of our new favorites
from Mac OS and Linux thanks to a nifty
bash money payload by Oxus so this is a
really great example of not only like a
well written payload that uses some
novel techniques to inject code into non
Windows operating systems to take over a
sudo command but he's also got some
notes in there some note-taking which is
excellent
now as we know on UNIX based platforms
including Linux and Mac OS X for example
or OS 10 sudo is a command that allows
you to run programs with elevated
security privileges so it's basically
the same thing as root which everybody
knows yay administrators who don't make
me a sandwich okay
no no sudo make the hack 5 episode okay
wait you didn't cancel out the first
command it killed - no with a sudo user
command or user account you can
basically just do anything you want you
have administrative privileges on that
computer it means super user trivia
those sudo originally stood for super
user do but we just call it pseudo
because we don't know pseudo
sounds weird so the payload basically
works by swapping out the sudo command
with a nefarious version on the targets
bash profile so we have talked before
about the dr. C file back to profile
file yeah exactly
that's when I was just simply like
adding aliases or I'm customizing my
shell prompt to be purple instead of
green so check out that series of hack
tips if you are new to bash really
really handy but today we are talking
about a bash buddy script so Darren how
does this thing work
oh it's I'm really excited about this so
so let's just check this out here it is
on the bash many payloads github
repository and I can pretty much walk
you through it it's a very
well-documented payload it's got a nice
you know description the target the
configuration and the different LEDs and
what they mean but it basically has two
parts to it there's an injector which is
what actually you put on the victim
machine right on your target computer
jack doan right and so it injects the
the pseudo backdoor if you will and then
it has this cleaner variant where in
fact I guess you could assign the
injector to this and the cleaner to that
the cleaner removes it which is nice
because in testing I always love an undo
function yes you can try it on your
boxing you're like no that's why we have
virtual machines right snapshot restore
there you go yeah so the cleaner not
only does it clean it up though but it
also grabs those passwords that it
nabbed for you and you know it's a novel
example of a lot of nifty different
elements so let's just take a look real
quick at the injector payload okay so
this payload dot txt basically after we
kind of do our nice part like commenting
our code does a setup phase where you
can basically specify if it's a Mac or
not so by default is set up for Linux
and you could change that to true if you
want it to do a Mac if it is a Mac it'll
go ahead and execute an attack mode ECM
Ethernet and hid but it's also going to
pass these v IDs and PIDs interventions
and product IDs so that the neck will be
happy
doesn't care right yeah cares about that
it also sets the ducky language so if
you want you can just change this to if
you're in Germany you want that to be D
instead of us you get the idea it gets a
couple of variables so the switch
position which is basically getting the
number of the position that the switch
is in remind me which numbers they are
one it's furthest back three is closest
to you I always forget that so thanks
yeah to the USB port and and 3 is also
arming mode okay
so there you go got it and it also gets
the IP address of the host the host in
this case is actually the bash Bunny
then from the perspective of the bash
Bunny CDs over to well basically where
the payload is gonna live in fact if i
plug my bash bunny in in arming mode we
can take a look at that then it sets the
led to a a special blink special special
okay there's all these these LED modes
and are these these some these statuses
that are kind of a standardized set of
statuses so that if all the payloads
follow the standard kind of like setup
attack cleanup finish yeah phase yeah
like then any payload you run you can be
like oh it's it's magenta it's still
setting up and oh it's blinking once
amber it's in the attack phase or
blinking twice amber it's in the second
attack phase that's the idea of those
and special is kind of reserved for when
you're doing some extra cool stuff this
extra cool stuff if you away I think it
is pretty cool right I don't know where
you know it's a headless box yeah mine
right now is just blinking blue these
are specifically there to give you
prompts so you know exactly where you
are in your script it makes complete
sense
totally so if I look at this now you
know when it's doing the LED special
what's actually going to be doing is
dropping port 53 which is DNS kind of
esoteric and not important for right
here what's really important is this
Python tech M simple HTTP server 80 and
then you put an ampersand at the end so
you know what fun since it's just Linux
I'm just gonna do this on my own host
machine here and you'll see what happens
if I just paste that in right so I'm
doing Python tech m simple HTTP server
80 if I now in BRR in chrome go to
localhost colon 80
1 337 go figure
I've done this before with that awesome
port okay oh you know what
you know why it can't why because I
didn't do it with sudo anymore under
1024 requires to be able to do which is
also why I got a traceback error because
it's it says permission denied let me
try that again and actually do this demo
with one three three seven ampersand
okay cool so that's happening and now
when I go to localhost port 1 3 3 7 hey
look it's a directory listing ok from
where you would find this is exactly the
same files right there's my url snarfs
here's my url snarfs so there we go in
fact hang on yes aux grep Python I now
need to kill that process which is
where's 1962 which is very similar to
the shirt you're wearing right now so
killed -9 what's good you're not running
as root okay so now that should be dead
no it's not dead I got the pit wrong you
know what I don't care I'm gonna leave
it running because we need to move on ok
that's that's the gist of it so what I
think though is really novel here and
one of the reasons why I picked this
script in particular yeah is so it's
firing up a web server on the bash bunny
yeah that's gonna come into play in a
minute here but in order for the payload
to continue it needs to have positive
confirmation that that that web server
is actually up and running and
remembered just like duck your script
delays are important right yeah because
we we think about as humans like there's
those little nuances like obviously I
can't type
you know 400 megahertz or whatever one
point whatever gigahertz yes yeah but
it's going to execute the next line in
the script as soon as it's done
especially considering right here you
see that ampersand similar to how I'm
now having problems like figuring out
what process this is because it's back
rounded that's what the ampersand does
it runs this in the background so that
it's not blocking the rest of the
program from running like if I were to
run this again on port 1 3 3 8 without
the ampersand I can keep hitting enter
all day long it's going to continue
running right it'll keep on running
exactly I can I go to 1 3 3 8 there it
is
and you see it's blocking and to hit
control-c to finally interrupt that so
that's the reason why you know we don't
want our payload to just end here so
we've got that ampersand and we need to
know that it's running which is while
this really cool and novel while loop
thanks to audio audible blink comes in
handy because basically what this is
going to do is say while okay so that
means continue doing this until this is
true yeah and in this case not true
actually we're looking for false
hence the exclamation point make that a
little bigger for you and it's gonna run
netcat taxi on localhost so oh so from
the perspective of the bunny to itself
it's checking port well in this case
port 80 I was doing one through three
seven and when it doesn't see that what
it's gonna do is so it's saying hey I
didn't see any you know I didn't get a
connection to port 80 so what I'm gonna
do is sleep for 0.2 seconds so 200
milliseconds and then done so what this
means is this line it's going to
continue looping around and around
checking port 80 for a connection right
and sleeping for 200 milliseconds until
until it actually gets the connection
yeah and then once it gets the
connection it knows the web servers
running and it just continues to the
next line that's cool I was a little I
in fact I think that should probably end
up being an extension that's kind of a
story for another time but I think it's
a cute little one-liner and then the
attack can start you know led attack is
just letting us know hey it's doing the
attack and just like before you say if
it's Mac do this and if it's not a Mac
and then do this it's using an extension
called run run allows you to open up the
run dialog on Windows we're saying run
Windows whatever command or run
something in a spotlight by doing run
OSX whatever you want and in this case
run unity whatever you want in and what
do you win a run and unity well X term
so this replaces you know writing a
bunch of ducky script into here by just
having one nice little utility that you
just say run specify the target OS and
the command you want to run ok and then
once it has a terminal open whether it's
terminal on OS 10 or or X term on unity
it then
is if it's going to either curl or
double you get and what it does is it
pulls that file that backed SH and pipes
it over to SH your shell so this is cool
so far but I'm a little confused about
how how does the back SH code end up
getting injected and executed on to the
target computer or the victim in this
case basically what we're doing is we're
using W Gator curl which are both little
programs that fetch program to fetch
anything from the World Wide Web right
and in this case that web server happens
to be on the batch money itself and it's
gonna pipe the output of it into slash
bin slash SH which is your shell yeah it
could be slash bin slash bash if you
wanted whatever HAP you have you it's
going to be interpreted by that victim
computer okay so it's saying hey it's a
stage you know so this is the stage ER
and it's and it's saying hey go
reference the second stage which is over
here yeah
rather than typing in the entire back
dot SH all at once okay because if you
actually come back here in the payload
but if I come down here you have your
payload txt but we also have this back
SH and this is what's actually getting
executed this entire shell script which
you can see is I mean it's only 42 long
it's 42 lines yet to type all of that in
would take a lot longer than if you
could just reference it and say hey go
and execute this so now why is the
payload having the victim computer W get
the back SH script and run it as opposed
to just typing everything out is it just
to be faster yeah that's basically it I
mean we could it could be a single if we
did that it would be a single-stage
payload yeah and you can use I mean
we've done that previously like we've
already done a bunch of episodes where
we take the bash money and we just type
everything all the commands that back SH
is going to be using right there on the
bash money but so this is calling it
this is making it just slightly faster
yeah exactly
in fact if you wanted to make it a
single stage you could use a technique
like echo to EOF I'll show you that
basically you could say echo blah blah
or walk a walk out to EOF and now you
just say blah blah
Wacka yeah exactly just and then you
could do you know your slash bin slash
sh and you could say like i don't know
LS tech la or tack la slash i don't know
okay the best shell script ever got and
then yo f right and if i had actually
put that if i had actually done that
redirected into a file it would create a
new file and then you'd have file in the
system now that you can execute it would
just take a lot longer well let's walk
through back sh cuz we should probably
know what's going on there right so back
that Sh what you're actually running
this is the you know the second stage of
it is basically creating a configuration
directory in tilde so in your home and
it's called dot config right so that
should already be there but it's
creating a new directory in there called
pseudo then hey guess what using that
same yo f technique in fact i'm sorry
it's not echo it's cat yo F into that
file so basically it's using the same
technique I just showed except correctly
and it's saying put all of this contents
up until you get to the the word yo F
put this why can I not get my mouse to
anyway you get the idea all of that into
this file right here right this file
called pseudo file then it's going to
make it executable by giving it a chmod
u plus X to that file so now it's an
executable and then it checks whether or
not you have a dot bash profile and if
you do have a dot bash profile it's
going to export the path to that thing
to your bash profile at the end or if
you don't have a dot bash RC it'll do
the same thing so you know whether or
not you're on a window or sorry a Linux
or a Mac you can see where this is going
yes I can a little demo that's super
cool because I've already I've already
done this against my machine it's owned
well okay yeah but I do have a question
yeah okay so I love that it's
cross-platform I think that's amazing
it's great that you can do it for both
Mac or Linux but I know that you were
also a little worried that it might not
work on your Linux box because you're
using gnome 3 instead of unity and it
mentions unity so what what do you do oh
right yeah because we were talking about
that run extension yeah and so if we
take a look back at the payload here
doesn't matter with gnome 3 kind of
here's the thing right this 'run
extension will accept OSX it'll accept
unity accept Windows and in fact if we
go back to payloads and I'll pull up the
extensions and pull up the run extension
basically what this extension does is it
says hey here's the function it's called
run and it allow it has a case for win
it has a case for OSX and it has a case
for unity and basically it's a shortcut
so you don't have to type all of this
stuff out each time and for the case of
unity what it's gonna do is it's gonna
type all f2 delay for a second and then
type in whatever you pass to it delay
for a second and then press Enter right
whereas on Windows it's going to use a
different technique it's hard to pull up
the dialogue yeah play for a second type
in what you want and then hit enter and
then on OS 10 it's gonna you know do the
spotlight thing yeah the reason that I
say unity is because all f2 I know is
built into unity yeah it is I just did
out of mine I used gnome 3 because I
love gnome and if I do alt f2 I get this
dialogue right here
so I guess okay I could say unity but I
don't I could say just Linux but I'm not
confident in that in yeah because
there's so many window managers
somebody's know you got xfce I got KDE
I'm not cool enough to run that one but
so what I recall though with canonical
who just so happened to make Ubuntu
they're dropping unity and it's being
switched back to Nome which is great but
it's it's pretty cool that you can use
alt f2 on any of those yes both of them
well what's also cool is this is open
source so anybody can go in here and say
add another one for KDE I don't know
what the keystroke is maybe you do or
add one for xfce or you know whatever
have you and maybe maybe hopefully
there's actually some uniformity across
all those windows managers that maybe
I'm not aware of but that would be nice
to be able to like look at a box and be
like that's Linux okay so cool
flip the switch over to the personal
payload that's meant for your target
okay so I want to see it be made even
more efficient how do you do that yeah
I'm assuming you already know something
because you're always trying to make it
more efficient yeah so that's the thing
about all of these yeah you make a
payload you put it up on get you throw
it on the forums you
he's like I could do it faster shorten
it always it's 42 seconds bounce so the
one thought that I had and I'm not gonna
go through and do this but I want to
show you a tip here if you're using X
term yeah
for example so part of this payload what
it does here if I go back go back all
the way to this payload here we go
is it pulls up X term you can see this
part where it says run unity X term and
then it waits for two seconds and then
it types in the actual command yeah well
you might actually be able to plunk the
command all into that alt F to run
dialog if you will if you use a tack e
in your X term let me give you an
example here so if I just pull up my
command prompt and I do X term tack E
and then I put in quotes touch snubs
no that doesn't sound right no touch
dare to touch something totally legit
okay I'm legit I'm doing nothing
inanimate something in something with
permission there you go
okay great so this file by the way does
not all put a pound in front of that so
it doesn't execute if I LS something hit
okay I have it something cool dot exe
but if I had something with a hit tab
nope okay there's no file there right
now with that so let me run that X term
again with that tacky and this so
basically the touch command is going to
create the file and in this case that's
going to be that right so I'll do that
you'll notice nothing happened yeah well
did something happen there's just not
output yeah all right because VY LS
something star you'll see there's
something with permission
so did actually do it but it did it
invisibly in the background it was just
great because then it doesn't pop up a
command
okay well what about Mac got anything
for the the Mac people put apples no I I
know I own a Mac but I gave it to Sarah
Oh Oh Mac - what we need a Mac for
testing now do which is weird I don't
know yeah actually we do need a Mac for
testing a little so I need to go and buy
a Mac again yay it's a great question
though because what the beautiful thing
about this being an open-source platform
is that anyone especially from our
amazing community can come in and
contribute to that so maybe you have
some insight and you'll throw it up on
github and we're up in the forums or
just even here in the comments because
I'd love to know maybe there is a way to
do some invisible terminal action up on
OS 10 OS X Mac OS I don't know what to
call it either okay so we acne we've
gotten this far once it is all up and
running though what is your result okay
so here well I'll do the demo so the
result is you nab this pseudo password
so here's me doing something with pseudo
which is awesome and legit so I'll do
I'll do pseudo LS tak la slash right oh
my gosh and now I have to type in my
password I'm going to type in a wrong
password just so you can see what
happens if it fails one two three four
five which is not actually my password I
know and it's gonna say sorry try again
here's the funny thing about that let's
go back yeah let's go back to the
injector and take a look at that back
that Sh yeah okay right here this is
sorry try again try again I'm not
actually using the real pseudo it's
passing so when I actually type this in
it's saying echo you know sudo password
for dollar sign user just as it said
sudo password for in my case DK that's
my user and once I type into it so it's
gonna read that and then it's gonna echo
that into the real pseudo which lives in
such USR slash bin slash pseudo okay
right and then based on whether or not
it exits successfully or not so this is
saying if the exit code equals one
meaning it was not successful then it's
gonna say it's actually gonna say echo
the user
their password and the word invalid over
to this config file like eyes and say
sorry try again right and if it's not
and if it's not equal to one meaning it
was successful then it's gonna do the
same thing and put the word valid there
in this config and that's go ahead and
actually run it so now I'll type in my
real password and there we go I'm
looking at my home directory I could
also do sudo apt-get install cats
because I already did that lolcat
you never know the difference is what
about nyan cat why isn't it ah you know
what demo fail now I need to figure out
what's going on with my wall cat but
more importantly if I go over to doc
config and CD over to pseudo oh I think
he need output for law cat maybe yeah oh
my god yeah oh you know what it was a
different one it was in the previous
recording yeah where we've gotten it was
nyan cat you should show them what it
does sudo apt-get install nyan cat which
I did last recording and it was awesome
because I just guessed it would be in
the repo and it is yeah that's amazing
this is um in the end for so many
seconds Oh amazing this is a payload
waiting to happen by the way
that's amazing a payload all that does
is install in the end cat and just
fullscreen it and just yeah just forever
or replay somebody's bootloader with
this you can't escape is there a way to
set it so you can't escape out of it you
could probably run a command that would
like redirect the keyboard output or
like just oh alright well that's awesome
super so here's what it looks like
though when when it's all said and done
yes
here's that pseudo bash script I can cat
that and it's just like what we were
looking at over here right and if I now
cat that pseudo dot config AHA my
username my password and valid or when I
tried one two three four five entry
using the password lame password
shouldn't have been using a little
password lame password since 2005 well
now I know how to get into
all your accounts it's true this is cool
I think it's great and it's kind of
scary so I say we hook up auxes with
some hack five gear how about $100 gift
certificate what do you think of that
already on it
perfect remember how last week I was
complaining about how github makes it
really difficult to determine the email
address of a developer so that I can hit
them up and be like dude thanks for the
contribution thanks for the awesome
payload and I was like here's some
techno bucks as it were I was like yeah
you could just like I don't know use key
base and then verify your identity with
like Twitter and then you could ask them
on Twitter but that's such a workaround
I also Oxus is an on key base however he
or she like me is using their email
address in their public profile on
github and using github zpi to do you
just give you just pop into your url bar
api to github.com slash user slash
whatever that username is and if you
give it a slash event slash public you
will get all of this fancy json which
includes arias right there you go so
glad i signed up with my public email no
it is good because now you know you can
email me darren a hack five dead org
that's awesome
or you can emotions an attack bag or you
can email feedback or leave a comment
below its feedback at hak5 org and
that's the domain where you can find all
of our awesome episodes of hack 5
including hack tip which if you want to
learn a lot more bash you can find that
she and does a great job on that show
the red wire tech thing meta split
minutes so much good stuff and if you
want to support us and get your own bash
Bunny as well so you can try this
payload at home you can always go to
hack shop comm to get that and thank you
so much for the support to everybody who
does support us over at the action yeah
it enables us to do the podcast and make
even more awesome hack 5 gear Wow that
was a really fun one yeah I can't wait
to show you guys some other fun
techniques next week what is going on
I forgot I almost said Africa alright
yeah this has been sitting here for like
ages and I completely kept on skipping
over it because you were gone I got a
gift from a fan mmm you can send gifts
to at hak5 org slash address this one is
he says km6
FPE Deka to PBT that's okay okay is that
like that's like hello daddy hello oh
this is this is the ham radio stuff it's
ham radio so he says hi snaps Congrats
on getting your license here's some
goodies from wc2 FD that 720 first
mechanized contest battalion so I got a
t-shirt I got his favorite course code
on a disc so this is Morse code which is
great I'm superstitious your code he's a
pro tip never look at written dots and
dashes do it all with your ears so
that's really good thing you know which
nobody wrote that down I'd had to find
out cuz somebody told me and then he
also sent his qsl cards which i got one
from my owner but these are really cool
oh that's for when you make a contract
yes exactly and the t-shirt I got to
show you the t-shirt it's great it's a
little big for me so I don't know it's
gonna be PJs probably but check out the
back antenna you know what I love about
people it just reminds me of the amazing
work that hams and other you know
amateurs in this space do for like
disaster relief and things of that
nature like there are like the Red Cross
of radio yes they are there comes across
right you know oh well it's true I mean
seriously if they do a lot of emergency
response so thank you so much Rob really
really appreciate the gift hak5 dot work
slash address is the place where you can
send stickers for our wall from all of
your community goodness and anything
else that you would like to share with
us hey we can get through those now that
I'm back from Jakarta I know finally
