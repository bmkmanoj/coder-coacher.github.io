have an awesome firmware vulnerability
hacker one brokers bounties for security
flaws Microsoft answers BitLocker
questions and more all that coming up
now on threat liar Abby Monday people
I'm Patrick Norton and this is threat
wire 4 jun 8 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
internet freedoms giant piles of perky
news this morning so let's fire it up
did I say perky Allied cnet's chris
mader check found a particularly
depressing read about Americans and
their opinions on privacy put out by the
University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg
School for Communication the tradeoff
fallacy is an interesting read and i
gotta say manitech found pretty much the
best quote our findings support a new
explanation a majority of americans are
resigned to giving up their data and
that is why many appear to be engaged in
trade-offs trade-offs well you know like
giving up your information for access to
friends on social services trade officer
discounts deals we pretty much don't
think are worth what we give up for them
the study isn't perfect they never are
but it's revealing when say sixty nine
percent of a fairly broad group doesn't
realize that say your pharmacy doesn't
need your permission to sell off
information about what over the counter
drugs you buy or that the words privacy
policy or the phrase I guess means your
info is actually private no it actually
means well it's a detailed discussion of
what the company feels entitled to do
with your information privacy policy
doesn't mean privacy privacy policies
where they tell you what you're going to
do with your information or what they're
going to do with it in any case it's a
good read go find the article on cnet
and then go read the report stop letting
your Mac go to sleep probably not a bad
idea OS 10 security researcher Pedro
viaggio says Mac ship before mid-2014
well the ones that are allowed to go to
sleep which I'd venture is probably
almost all of them are vulnerable to an
efi attack that quote can overwrite the
contents of your BIOS from userland
rootkit efi without any other trick
other than a suspend resume cycle a
kernel extension flash ROM and root
access end quote sounds vague not to
people that might maybe want a rootkit
your OS 10 machine and get nasty viata
suggests you email Apple and demand
firmware security fixes for this bug and
others to be presented at
on 23 presentation known as Thunder
strike two sip strike yeah we're going
to have more news in this in August
we're all going to be at DEFCON the 62
the ninth work in the hak5 table selling
pineapples sitting in on presentations
and quite a bit more Michelle prins in
yogurt Oghma the crew behind the hack
100 have a new startup called hacker one
hack 100 if you don't know was there
list of a hundred tech companies they
would try to hack they found a lot of
holes reported them to companies and hey
nicole pearl woth reports in this new
york times article at least a third of
the companies they contacted actually
raced to solve their issues two-thirds
of the flaws though were pretty much
ignored which brings us to hacker won a
venture capital-backed company that aims
to broker a relationship between
companies and the hackers that find
flaws in their security by offering
bounties pro roth reports that hacker
one will get a twenty percent commission
and that they already have relationships
with yahoo square and twitter and some
companies you might never expect like
banks and oil companies to work with
their service now i'm curious can this
turn the corner on security researchers
offering zero-day exploits to the
highest bidder i'd be happy to know more
folks we're getting bugs fixed by the
companies with the problem rather than
say selling them to organized crime or
the NSA most companies though apple the
article notes pay nothing for bugs that
can go for hundreds of thousands of
dollars on the black market this is a
problem that ain't going away soon go
read the article on the new york times
Microsoft's BitLocker is the easiest way
to encrypt Windows drives period it's
built right in but is it really secure
Michael E has written a great write-up
on the intercept that brings Microsoft's
answers to questions about BitLocker are
the encryption keys compromised by
default why was the elephant diffuser
removed how close is Microsoft's
relationship with law enforcement and
the NSA and why did full disk encryption
get really hard to use after windows 8
he's also got some great advice from
Bruce Schneier who recommends best
script for Windows users ton of good
