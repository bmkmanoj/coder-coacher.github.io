at any cost now we're not only producing
energy but we're producing less
pollutants it's better for the community
it's going to be better for generations
to come when it comes to vintage gaming
the best you can really do is maybe find
a beat up miss pac-man at the local
pizza shop but here in Springfield
Missouri we are taking a look at the
1984 arcade this place is great they
have completely restored awesome
classics like Dig Dug like vectorgames
like tempest and asteroids so we're
going to take a look inside and find out
what this place is all about come on
we do it different though then the
arcades that people may be used to or
may remember in that we do five dollars
person at the door all of our games are
free and you just play all you want five
dollars sheets from only open doors at
four o'clock all the way seminars when
we closed at eleven we installed buttons
on the games down where you normally put
quarters in just hit that instead that's
your quarter basically and then just
start the game as you normally would and
you just go to town well basically I
started buying these machines in the
late 80s say I think the first one I
bought an 85 which was drawn for my
brother for Christmas 86 i bought a
deluxe asteroids and then we kind of
went on from there at one point I had 16
of these in my office we decided when we
decided to do this we were looking for a
warehouse just to put them all in so we
can get them all together and turn them
all on at once can I get that can arcade
feel back and then we decided to go
forgetting to that you might as well
have a place where people can come in
and if they're going to come in let's
charge at the door so they're having
putting quarters in the machines and and
you know one thing kind of led to
another and before you know what here we
are when I was growing up this is what
we all did this is the social center of
my life when I was in high school and
pretty much everybody else that was my
age and nowadays you cannot find these
anywhere the 80s arcade machines are
just gone you find one or two in a
collector's area you might have somebody
that has one in their basement but as
far as having them all in one place
where you can sit down a planet just not
around anymore oh we do have a cabinet
here that is emulated and anyone's more
than welcome to try to forget which one
that is everything else here is original
as best we can in the original cabinets
in some cases it is not in the original
cabinet some of these games don't even
have an original cabinet time pilot 84
is a game that was a conversion kit and
Adams have it actually happens to be a
converted berserk and it would really
love to get the original berserks
innards and put it back
but there's a difficult fine I think
aside from that I think if if you see
one here is in the cabinet that it's
supposed to be
you
the generation coming up can't go learn
like I learn it just can't do it it's
outdated it's done we get it once again
it's time for trivia but before we get
into that it should probably explain
that yes I am flying solo on this one
and it feels so weird I lives of course
gone because of that thing with our
naval server and wes is out on business
and Las Vegas and then Paul's off trying
to get a job with tekzilla to do some
set design or something so I guess we
should just go into last month trivia
question which was in 2004 New York Film
freak decoder was arrested and charged
for accessing what hair straight can
manufacture test equipment and of course
mad props for providing the default
password that was correctly answered by
some guy that goes by Tom be so if you
or someone you know is Tom be let us
know because we'd like to get your
address and send you at some hak5
goodies so this one's trivia question of
course with the theme of this show is in
the nineteen eighty-three film war war
games lead character David Lightman
played by Matthew Broderick is
introduced while playing galaga at what
Seattle arcade and of course bonus
points if you can actually catch the
high score on that game of Galaga so of
course you can send your answers to
trivia hak5 org and I guess let's head
back to nineteen eighty four and check
out more the fun stuff like play some
we really try to do we try to create
this whole entities time capsule so that
when people walk in it's not only
imagine walking into an arcade but
they're walking kind of back in time and
there's always little things and little
knickknacks from you know past and I
think that we create that look at the
sense of the 80s I can really step back
in time of the eighties right now we're
playing as Michael Jackson I mean he's
the quintessential ladies pop star so
eight and then it transitions to
commercials we've got commercials going
from the 80s you know all the things we
can find to kind of get that sense of
like oh my gosh I remember that
commercial back when I was a kid you
know and just trying to get that across
and put a lot of videos and trailers for
movies and clips of shows club like that
well you want to go ahead and show us
your favorite arcade yeah so xavius
right tari yeah it is i'm sold already
but maybe you can tell me a little bit
more about this game basically you've
got your ship that you're flying through
I'll bird-like over countryside and
likes why not and you're taking out
enemy ships and the lie I think I fell
in love with it early days because of
the look of the metallics and the
animation it's looks really good I mean
for an 80s game I mean back dinners like
it was pretty
and I think I like about it is the
adaptability of the game because when
you're playing it like a lot of games
have certain patterns and as you're
going through you kind of know ki got to
go here go there do that and when you
die and start over again you know it's
go through all that again well the thing
I like about CBS is there is no certain
packages to go through but then if you
play the game someone aggressively
allston TVs are swelling a lot of stuff
at you it will change and kind of adapt
to you and it's kind of it can be able
to well me sometimes it's also okay I'm
going to throw it my you know all these
waves at you so it could be a lot of
challenges a lot of fun so robotron what
makes this unique robotron is the arcade
machine all right it was Williams was
known for making games that are
incredibly difficult to start with
because it was really a player's game
you kind of graduated to the Williams
games after you get tired of things like
pac-man and what I like that unit with
jealous a defender and robotron one of
the nice things I robotron is that it is
very very fast the action is very hard
it has the kind of wall of sound kind of
bingo but any given moment it's making
all kinds of cool toys isn't one not
like that it's a very difficult game you
used to because of the way the controls
are set up but once you get used to it
you can be credibly adaptive moving
around on the game and kind of kick it
on a robot but here it's not uncommon to
be able to play this game for 45 minutes
to an hour would you get good at it
which it also you can play it for about
35 seconds when you get started because
it's incredibly difficult to play when
you get going with it but it is it keeps
me coming back after 22 years of playing
this game because it has just an
infinite level of getting harder and
harder and harder and harder you cannot
get to the corner you can actually beat
this game it will always beat you back
citron I absolutely loved the movie I
mean you know who didn't oh yeah
Disney's best work oh yeah it's very
tell me about the arcade okay well this
was one of the two games that put out
sorta coincide with movie I'm
this has various elements from the movie
like at the end where Tron is trying to
get through the barriers put up by the
mCP to get into the cone to like save
you know the the video world and
everything playing each level you had
the movie in your mind type thing it's
like you should see the movie playing at
the same time that you were playing the
game but it was also very challenging
and their thing and as all the games in
the 80s work their graphics work fat
great in the 80 seems like nowadays
games are visually stunning there you
know wonderful you know they look like
movies but a lot of them don't play that
great you know like put all their effort
in the graphics these had to be fun
first so Devon you've got some awesome
little goodies out here on the table
that are normally out that's right use
this stuff to keep back behind the
counter because it's either fairly rare
or easy to break or really know whatever
like that we've had sometimes you put
the stuff out but often less than we
asked about it we don't do it we get a
couple kind of weird things like we've
got an old-school Donkey Kong game here
I don't know if you can see this very
well or not but there's a this kind of
this goofy sort of LED version Darrell
of Donkey Kong getting played inside
there it's a these were pretty popular
back in the day because this is as close
as you can get to an arcade machine and
of course they obviously scaled it to
sort of look like a little micro arcade
machine somebody poked a hole in that
one so we're got it back behind the
thing right now this was an old galaxian
handheld we don't have any SI size
batteries it's kind of rare to find us
anything it runs on the SI size battery
anymore this is pretty cool though
because you can play galaxian
head-to-head and I actually I've owned
this since 82 I would say they're about
this is one of the crown jewels of
everything that we have here this is a
vector X vector home arcade system and
actually run on a vector monitor like
asteroids or
battlezone or any other kind of vector
saw games like that it had cartridges
most of the cartridges this is an armor
attack cartridge we're actually copies
or clones of real arcade machines and
this even had this sort of goofy little
extra sorry here a little goofy sort of
extra bit of colored overlays lay on top
of it so this was this is as good as it
got back here sister mindstorm overlay
back in the 80s this was high-tech
hahaha you want a blue you put blue
color on top of it mmm and we got a
variety different games for that a Star
Trek game and star castle and someone's
like oh year was this this came out I
believe in 81 well and only lasted about
a year and then it went out of business
because it was horribly expensive for
the time i also have a this crazy old
black knight pinball LCD or LED game and
this is the worst LED game ever i mean
it is just i don't know if you can see
it or not but it's not exactly tons of
fun to play as a matter of practice hey
you pretty much just push the buttons
and hope that something happening in
there man but you know hey it was 80s
this was cool because it had little red
lights in it and then it would have
loved it this is our pac-man board game
okay and the copy on the side as much
fun as the action-packed arcade game of
the same name really great copywriting
there yeah and this involved some dice
and you move the little guy around and
you would though get back here obviously
you had to kind of think about this
little bit you'd eat up the little balls
come here
oh well here what will you want come on
power pellet yeah you know fella dang it
part of the skill of this thing was
getting to the part where you can eat
the fellows okay well I'm not doing a
very good job the L there he goes okay I
just hold it wrong there goes eat
pellets now and as you'd roll the dice
she'd move around the board and the
little ghost move around the board after
you and everything like that and and
again we had to do this because we
didn't have home systems this is as
close as you could get the plank back
man at home monkey mount 1972 got him
Nolan Bushnell was the one that designed
it he later went on to form Atari this
is actually not pong this is a winner
this is a pong clone although plays
exactly the same way that pong does and
you can even swap parts for for pong
with it but this was an unauthorized
clone but it was the closest thing that
we could find the we actually bought
five of these games to try to get one of
them together that worked the television
that's inside this is specially made
just for this game we've had to have it
worked on pretty considerably to get it
to go again and I'm told that once this
television dies it's probably a chance
again another one is nominal to none the
controllers are simplified geometers and
everything but when this game actually
first came out when pong actually first
came out Nolan Bushnell put it into a
bar they call him two days later told
him that his game was broken and so he
forget that something was really wrong
with it so he went in to go check it out
they said the problem was it wouldn't
take any quarters anymore so he opened
the coin door in the entire bottom of
the game was full of quarters and at
that point he decided there might be a
little bit of a future in this so a
pretty cool story first pong this isn't
really a pong but it plays just like it
tempest is as a vector game a lot of
people have are familiar with it and
have seen it before it's an Atari it was
one of the very first color vectors as
might be clearly going to start it here
and everybody's probably pretty familiar
with a play on it this does use a color
vector system instead of a raster screen
which is what most for example all
modern computer monitors everything is
your astor screen vectors are kind of
notable because when these monitors die
they are dead when the two back seat
goes out you can't replace them anymore
that
made in 25 years so we've got this
matter of fact we've got a dead tube
right now we had to pull a dead tube out
of this one to get this was going and
when they're dead they're dead so we're
trying to keep these going as long as
possible defender came out in 1980 there
were more defender games sold than any
of the game in arcade history Williams
electronics made over 1 billion dollars
selling defender cabinets alone
asteroids is the one vector game that
probably most people are going to be
familiar with firstly everybody used to
play this one they were a kid one of the
cool things about asteroids is the is
the power that they put into the
individual shots you can see those
things glows they're coming down through
there you can really only do that with a
vector with a vector system I mean
that's just pretty cool look and also
you know this incredible smoothness of
the game because there is no scan lines
on this it doesn't scan it's it's
drawing this stuff directly the screen
in a given moment in 1980 if you took
the most popular if you took the grit
the best-selling movie of all time in
the best-selling book of all time when
the best-selling play of all time in the
best-selling album of all time and added
all that together that is less money
than asteroids made in the year nineteen
eighty you know I can spend hours and
hours and hours of fun in here but the
new you guys are closed but and want to
get going but I do have to ask where our
audience can find more information about
nineteen eighty-four the quickest place
would be 1984 arcade com and more than
welcome everybody to come back by we're
here in Springfield Missouri downtown
Springfield across from the y so if
sprinkles out a very big place it's not
that difficult to find thank you so much
for enough all right okay so I don't
need to be telling you that video games
are awesome you already know that and
I'm going to say the arcade cabs that
you can build yourself with name or put
on your pc is is so much fun to play
those old 80's games that way again but
seriously doesn't compare to come here
to 1984 in springfield missouri and i
got to say best part of the midwest i
found so far thanks guys

you can be these days it may be finding
a beaten up next pac-man at the local
pizza shop but here in Springfield
Virginia we're taking a look at the 1984
Springfield Virginia from field Missouri
I'm in Missouri okay cool yeah feels so
weird bra I saw
it's pretty twitchy we go you better
sure to go I then I'm trying to hold
yeah I was right oh that day thing this
has no processor has no program this is
entirely done with the discrete logic
which means that it's just literally RAM
chips and my motherboard but there's no
actual program in it yeah that's the way
they used to make them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
