go further Brack five I'm Darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 with an awesome company
called
Lego and what do you guys do ah we build
robot we make robot kits for kids I'm
joking I'm joking of course we all know
the plastic bricks we know and we love
them I have not played with any of the
computerized stuff the Mindstorm stuff
since the very first product so the big
yellow brick that you could like
drag-and-drop different pieces of code I
guess it was like oh three or something
but what has changed in the last 10
years with mindstorm a lot has changed
actually it's our third generation we're
in our 15th years so what you had the
RCX platform is still an autonomous
robotics platform for kids and now we're
on our third generation so what's
changed is lots of things as you can
imagine lots more sensors more inputs
more outputs more memory in the brick we
have a toy version for use at home we
have an educational version for use of
kids for you said schools to teach
science and technology and so what is
the process like for somebody that's
completely new to this to get started
with the platform it is like Oh
programming that you know I'm stuffing I
just want to play with Lego but I really
like technics and I've already figured
out gears so now I want to take it to
the next step
what's the barrier to entry the barrier
to entry is obviously the kit which
comes with the software but you need a
computer to program on you can also do
some basic programming on the brick up
to 12 steps the programming is really
really easy it's all drag-and-drop icons
into a line so it's super simple to use
very similar to what you described
before only it's much more intuitive now
so the idea being like if I want to do
an if statement I grab a little green if
and I drag it in there and then I'm like
oh if what and then grab something else
and say well lift the sensor sees this
so and then I grab a then and things
like that yes okay well what if I'm a
programmer and I know what I'm doing
with like C++ and Java and things like
that what do you have for like the
hardcore enthusiasts so the
brick is now the operating system is
Linux now so you're kidding for real no
way when did that happen just with this
generation it happened this morning it
just happened
what was the the thought process behind
bringing it from like a little tiny
microcontroller that it was before to a
complete Linux platform we just wanted
to make sure that it appealed to all
kinds of people so had to be super easy
to use for kids but it also needed to be
really expandable for adults and fans
like you sounds super hackable what is
the device itself how many inputs and
outputs and what are the kind of outputs
it has an ARM processor and a 64
megabytes ram but it also has expandable
memory with USB and SD what about
connectivity Bluetooth Wi-Fi do you know
anything about the chipsets of the Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth probably not for you okay
well I guess that's just for the hackers
to open it up and check it out so in
addition to launching the hardware today
do have kind of any other things to kind
of do that the the full experience if
you will for those that are new coming
into that sure so for schools we have a
30-hour stem curriculum so teachers can
take this and implement science and
technology engineering and math
curriculum in their school and we also
have a software that science teachers
can use with really innovative and new
and cool data logging you can data log
right on the brick you can program on
the brick and upload it into the
software so you can get started really
quickly on for the toy division there
are lots of really cool new robots for
kids to use at home right out of the box
all right so what I'm really excited
about just you know hacker brain is
going a million miles an hour right now
thinking like dude robots and Wi-Fi and
swarming there's like api's and or
they're easy ways to like drag and drop
things to like create a collective of
robots that understand each other there
are they're probably better people who
could explain that to you than I could
but but I know that that's possible this
is super wicked what's the price point
what's the availability on the ev3 sure
so we're pre-selling now it'll ship in
the fall and the price point for home
use is 350 you can outfit a classroom
for under five grand
okay and lastly space castle or town
castle way to go all right well for
continued coverage of all things CES
2013 head over to revision three.com NPR
has a great public radio app that is
compatible with Ford SYNC athlete this
means that when you're in your car and
you're on the go and you don't want to
touch your phone you don't have to you
have all your favorite playlists all
your favorite NPR shows right on your
phone ready for voice commands hourly
news i'm louis kavod a house Republican
leaders are challenging though if you
want to listen to your favorite shows
like Morning Edition and all things
considered
you just have them right there in your
new Ford car thank you again to Ford for
sponsoring this hak5 CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
