by carbonite for someone who is new or a
beginner in the environment of ubuntu it
can be pretty daunting but for someone
who is an advanced user you probably
found the switch to unity in the newer
version of ubuntu to be a bit pointless
and trivial I for one being new to the
Ubuntu world fine unity to be it's okay
but I really wanted to check out gnome
and KDE as well so that I can really
make a choice on which one that I like
the most unity can be pretty nice if
you're a brand new user you get a group
of icons on the side where most of your
programs and the access points for the
OS are found it's really easy to find
everything but a couple of times I did
have to like hover over the icons to
figure out what it stood for gnome is a
cleaner environment it has links to all
the programs and the applications in the
upper left-hand corner instead and and
then you could add dog if you wanted to
like i did to give it a nice little
extra feel of animation so to switch
from unity to gnome or back vice versa
first thing you need to do is go up to
that power button up in the corner and
click on system settings and then you
want to scroll down to login screen
you'll need to unlock it with your login
password see if I can remember mine I
always forget when we're recording and
you want to choose Ubuntu classic that's
known so I hit that she's close close
out of that and I'm going to go ahead
and log out
and log back in now it should be
switched over to know when i log back in
cool so i'm logged back in that whole
icon thing over on the left-hand side
has disappeared in all my applications
and my OS all my system files and
everything can be found at the top
instead so this is no it's nice and
clean and very pretty i did want to go
ahead and add the docking interface to
my gnome desktop environment so to do so
you got to click on applications up at
the top go to bunt ubuntu software
center and then just type in da key and
it should come up where you can click
install which will be right here and you
might want to restart your machine just
to let all the changes go into effect
and it'll be down there ready for all
your changes and settings so how easy is
that you aren't stuck with unity if you
don't want it you can always switch back
if you get tired of gnome I do want to
check out KDE in the future but right
now I'm going to play with gnome for
about a week or so and see if I like
this one more than unity coming up soon
we'll be answering your viewer questions
but first let's take a quick break and
then check in with Darren for the nibble

nibble was sent in by Rodrigo here I
said instead of just using top you can

say da key since I'm on Shannon system

not needed to know anyway send your four
