by goto assist my recent segment over
little B got me more interested in IRC
and I hope it did the same for you guys
now where did it start and what other
programs can I find out there to use it
to its maximum potential right now I'm
just using it for twiddle I'm bitter
little B and I'm using IRC for chat on
the hack 5 Channel and that's about it
so today I'm answering one of your
viewer questions and I'm also going to
get into the history and theory behind
IRC so internet relay chat aka IRC
started in Finland at the university of
correct me if i'm wrong because i don't
know any kind of Finnish Lulu
it was created in 1988 by Yakko Wiz Oh
cotton he basically wanted to implement
real-time discussions BBS style he
created the chat part which we all know
and love and we're very familiar with
and then he started his own server
eventually yarko and two of his friends
asked the university if they could use
the IRC code outside of Oulu they then
installed a new server to be the first
IRC network that we all know and love
now new IRC servers started gaining
momentum and several universities around
the world and its use grew and more
servers were started to get installed in
several different universities now
server called eros berkeley.edu Berkeley
ago figure was created in 1990 and this
was completely open
there's no passwords no limits new
servers were connecting and everyone was
getting Nick lighting and that's
basically a term used to describe when
two users with the same Nick both end up
being killed off because they're both
using the same Nick in it doesn't quite
agree as soon as I receive finds out it
goes no you're out of there now if net
was then created to cue line or
quarantine the ear esteem from IRC and
both eventually died as the first major
disagreement in the IRC world and
there's a lot of drama going on with
that one
now several other Forks off IRC were
created in the early 1990s including
Tubb net and the under net under net
tried to make ircd the server software
for IRC less of a bandwidth hog and fix
some of the issues if net felt felt too
see request for comments 1459 for IRC
was made public in 1993 and after this
down that was formed and this is another
fork of an older server down that many
had many options that are still used to
this day such as longer nicknames
because originally they were only nine
characters and they could queue line
nicks so you couldn't use channel serve
you can use chance serve as a username
Kay lines which is basically for pinning
and all sorts of different things that
we use to this day now Oz org was forked
under under net to mainly for Australian
use due to connection problems with the
network link across the trans-pacific
Australian US line and there was all
sorts of crazies so that was another
thing and then the great split happened
in 1996 and I know a lot of you guys
probably know of that name it's after a
big disagreement on how ircd should
evolve when EF net when it's a timestamp
ircnet the European servers they want to
NIC and channel de leaves there was all
sorts of crazy stuff going on and both
services grew rapidly in the next two
years with several thousand users and at
that time in the earlier late 1990s
early 2000s several thousand users was a
hit and then we hit the 2000s freenode
is borne out of the open projects that
Network many other networks were created
around this time many of which exist
today many standardization attempts have
been made for all the networks to buy to
but none have worked and since 2004 and
2005 IRC has seen a decline in most of
its users with quakenet being the most
used network and with over a hundred K
in 2011 and even then 100k is not that
many IRC users now we have several
programs to use IRC we have you know X
chat and mint IRC and all sorts of
different ones and many use hacks to
make IRC more powerful like little B now
I promised that I'd answer some feedback
about IRC so here it is and right before
we do get into that feedback question I
did want to mention I found all of that
history over at Daniel Steinberg's blog
he wrote out the entire thing and it's
really really interesting if you want to
go over there and check it out and check
out all the other different stories
about the IRC history definitely you
know take a few hours and check it out
because
very very interesting now Chad asks
rather than attaching H individual
messenger account to Biddle B is there a
way to combine that'll be in Pigeon so
only one account your pigeon account is
connected to middle B or is it possible
to use only pigeon now what I figured
out is that you can convert pigeon
settings to Biddle be using a code
called Lib purple and you can find all
the information about that at the pigeon
web site
what is lid purple so it basically says
this is intended to be the core of an IM
program which is why you need this file
to use it with little B so they outline
this entire thing on pigeons website and
then what you want to do is go over to
that ol B's blog I also linked this in
here now although this was written back
in 2010 it is still useful to basically
give you an overlay of what to do what
you should do is be able to find convert
purple dot py a nice little file in one
of your sub directories if you can't
find this what you'll do is click on
here and all this code right here is
going to give you a nice little XML file
that beetle bee understands and uses to
convert your pigeon account once you
have that done you'll go back to their
page and it's going to give you this
nice little layout that just copies and
paste the following commands into your
little B Channel now why is that well
that isn't exactly converting your
pigeon account to Biddle be it is pretty
much the closest that I can find now if
you do have a different version of doing
this and maybe you users out there do
definitely let me know and I'll be sure
to you know let everybody else out there
know about the answer to now coming up
soon we'll have your tetanus photo and
our favorite feed back but first a quick
break
hey Darren where are you
yeah somewhere on there why what's up

unattended support I'm now connected to
the hack shop computer that Sarah's
using this is really cool for me this
