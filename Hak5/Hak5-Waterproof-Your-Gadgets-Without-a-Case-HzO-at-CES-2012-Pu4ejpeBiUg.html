coverage with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2012 and I feel
something kind of interesting my little
brother was very interested in a company
called h0 now what is h co h co is the
devel are the developers of water block
waterblock technology is a thin-film
nanotechnology that through a gas
deposition process is injected into
electronic device coats it and then it
doesn't matter if water gets inside
doesn't damage the electronics wait wait
so you're saying you don't actually have
to get some kind of plastic cover for
your phone or anything like that suck
out all the air and then stick it in
water you just you coat it yeah finally
you don't have to sacrifice looks or
aesthetics that for a big bulky case or
cover now this is designed for accidents
obviously but it's as you can see and
I'll show you its submergible and still
continues to operate because not the
outside is mechanically sailed the
insight is coated everything inside that
matters or is necessary to operate the
device is coated or protected ok huh
that sounds actually very cool I must
say yeah I do actually show me the how
this works a couple of things you can
see there's a samsung tablet back here
and we've been using this all day for
demonstrations so I don't know if the
viewers will be able to tell but there's
actually water spots in there this is
clear full of water and yet as you can
see it continues to operate under water
now it's full of water because Samsung
didn't make these to be dunked in water
but in spite of that it continues to
operate the music you can hear in the
background is coming from this little
nano which also encoded turn it on so
you can see its operating got a little
music from wicked there and get it to
turn around so you can see it still
working that has also been in water in
and out all day to day well that is so
cool I'm sorry it's hard for me to get
my mind Rep
wrapped around this because I've never
seen anything quite like it now do we
know when this is going to be out on the
market because I want to see it in
stores that's the big question and in
order for it to make sense price-wise
economically so everybody can has access
to it it needs to come through the
manufacture it makes a lot more sense to
coat them in the manufacturing process
than after they've already been built
and put together we are talking to many
of major producers manufacturers and I
can just say watch the news keep keep an
eye out because pretty soon you'll be
able to get hco inside your handheld
device that is so cool now one last
thing do you know how deep this can go
or how long it can last or anything like
this great question and again it's not
designed to soak underwater for long
periods of time so it's not ready for
scuba diving but we're testing it at
least a meter in depth so that's pretty
deep out three feet and for extended
periods of time so if you have an
accident you do drop it it's finding to
be very durable at that depth so far
that'll definitely save me whenever I
drop my iphone into the toilet again
number one cause of damaged by women
number one cause from women yeah yeah I
kind of figured from CES again on my
name is Shannon Morse you can find all
of our revision3 coverage over at
revision 3.com / CES and we'd like to
thank Ford for powering our CES coverage
thank you break coach found in the Ford
Focus v's instrument cluster allows you
to optimize your usage of the cars
regenerative brakes it displays a
graphic that shows how much energy is
captured each time you stop so that you
can make adjustments to maximize your
range thanks to Ford for powering our
CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
