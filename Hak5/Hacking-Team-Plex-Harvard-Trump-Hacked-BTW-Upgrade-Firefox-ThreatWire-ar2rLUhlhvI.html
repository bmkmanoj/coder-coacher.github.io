Harvard trumps hotels and hey upgrade
Mozilla today all right all that coming
up now on threat liar happy Monday
people I'm Patrick Norton mrs. threat
wire for July 6 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom big thanks to everybody
who's been watching the show three times
a week and supporting us it has been
well it's like breach fest this week so
let's get right into it first up 400
gigabytes of emails files and source
code were allegedly taken from hacking
team the Italian company that sells i'll
quote security week here lawful
interception tools or what they like to
call offensive technology and hacking
team they sell it to law enforcement and
intelligence agencies the files are
being eagerly examined by anybody that's
torrent into the file because well some
of those emails and data seem to show
hacking team was directly involved in
selling its tools to countries with less
than stellar human rights records
something a hacking team claimed it
didn't do the news was broken by a
hacking teams Twitter account and
according to cso online around 220 in
the a.m. this morning members of hacking
team were up online pissed off claiming
that the data was false but they were
being framed or at least they were on
twitter doing that until their personal
Twitter accounts got taken over ouch I'm
sure we'll see a lot of developments in
that hacking team story this week but
you know what there's been a lot of
hacks in the past few days Plex sent out
password updates for forum users with
linked accounts after the forum and blog
servers were breached at plex plex says
stolen data included IP addresses
foreign private messages email addresses
and encrypted while hashed insulted
encrypted passwords for forum users plex
added that they have no reason to
believe that any other parts of their
system were compromised and quote we
never store credit card or other payment
data on our systems meanwhile Harvard's
Faculty of Arts and Sciences and central
administration are among the networks
that have been compromised at Harvard
threat post reports that at the very
least this exposed user school login
email information while Harvard CIO says
quote at this time we have no indication
that personal data or research data have
been exposed it is possible that Harvard
logins used to access your university
accounts have been exposed and
apparently trump hotel collection that's
done
Trump's hotel company is trying to
figure out if it has a credit card issue
Krebs on security quotes eric trump the
executive vp quotes like virtually every
other company these days we have been
alerted to potential suspicious credit
card activity and are in the midst of a
thorough investigation to determine
whether it involves any of our
properties and quote one last thing
before i go if you're running mozilla do
yourself a favor and updated firefox 39
was released last week and it squashes a
big old pile of security bugs while
you're at it make sure your operating
system and antivirus are up-to-date too
because hey if you don't update them
well they don't do the job as well and a
