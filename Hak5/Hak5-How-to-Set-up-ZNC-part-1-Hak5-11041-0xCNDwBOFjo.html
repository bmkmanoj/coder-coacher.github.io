persistence and privacy on IRC with your
very own bouncer Darren explains then
setting up simple two-factor
authentication in Windows take that cold
boot plus woven is better than by or all
that in much more this time on hack five
this segment of hack five is brought to
you by domain.com hello welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen i'm nyan
cat and nyan cat would you mind I know
that you like standing on Pelican cases
because you want to be my height but
that one's actually my laptop oh it is
no I'm serious then why was the I didn't
saw a box and I was like oh this is
perfect cuz I have heels
well you don't I feel about these things
they're just hardcore and I got I lucked
out our and they're not a sponsor or
anything you know I just know just know
I just I just like doing that it's fun
over the lawyers under us right well
they're glad construction next door
they'll just think it was them we lucked
out with these 80s or 1832 because it
was made for an iPad LS yeah so how's
your week been buddy my week has been
awesome oh my name's Sheena Morris oh
okay I'm getting there in fact I'm
you're getting now our chair paul hates
what we do that
yeah the South by Southwest panel all I
can say I guess is to keep keep up to
date with the hack five dot org slash
blog I'm vlogging again and I will have
updates from South by Southwest they're
excited to see those I don't think I can
record my talk but we'll see I don't
know you know it's one of those things
know what this was yes it's
Condit oh it has your favorite one okay
so for those not initiated konbu is
freaking sick because it bypasses
Windows security like that and really
even do it for the 2.6 kernel that's
konbu 1.1 it'll do 32-bit in 64
so how does it work so it takes the
Windows kernel and it like changes it or
something I don't remember it brings its
own kernel it's a B Y okay but yeah
messes with the Windows kernel and
basically you get to the login screen
and you can type in gibberish and it
lets you log in as the root admin so
it's kind of fun to use and I actually
have a tool that I'm going to be using
this segment this week that's going to
let you kind of avoid the comm boot
issues that a lot of people have so yeah
another way to keep yourself safe and
secure I'm gonna start doing this
absolutely in fact I want to find out
how can I do this for Linux now and put
my like Etsy password shadow file or
whatever cuz you know the the idea of
these these boot keys I love these boot
keys when you did your conduit segment
you just boot off of this and you're in
and it's done this game and it doesn't
affect this running system because if
like you were to come back to it later
after I've hacked your box you wouldn't
know because your password hasn't
changed or anything like that
yeah I just use the uh forget what is
called the NT offline brute force
password reset blah blah blah anyway it
would just allow you to reset the
password but then yeah you know it kind
of the gigs up you know your password
has been reset and this one doesn't even
reset your password or anything you just
login with some gibberish do whatever
you want to do log out and walk away
the person comes back the real user they
login with their normal password and
nothing's changed at least so they think
so people who ask me like how do you
protect against this and my thing was I
use full disk encryption with TrueCrypt
and I mean you've got a segment on that
as well it's fantastic stuff but this
would be a nice additional layer to that
security gives you that extra light
two-factor authentication that a lot of
people are really really you know
gung-ho about right now because you know
it's always like a back and forth this
way it's easy but it's just for Windows
well so like my password in Windows
historically has been the apostrophe key
because it's right next to enter and the
way that I feel about is why bother
having a Windows password when something
like Khan boot exists like come on that
shouldn't be the thing preventing
somebody that would be stealing your
laptop from getting at your data you
shouldn't start thinking in the mindset
like don't trust Microsoft to protect oh
crap just encrypt your stuff and so I'd
do full disk encryption and use
TrueCrypt volumes with hidden burt
petitions and stuff like that but you
know I was always like it back and forth
because the was it the the stuff where
you can like freeze the memory with like
I can so you know like pull the RAM and
then get the encryption keys and then
who is the name of the attack with with
the cleaning lady oh the French maid
attack to bypass the login for for
TrueCrypt full disk encryption so it's
just like one of these back-and-forth
things but I love this solution because
really in order for me to like steal
your laptop and get in I have to see
your laptop and your second factor of
authentication and if you like you know
hide that as like a suppository or
something it's gonna be really difficult
yes exactly yeah so anyway I'll get more
into that in my segment but we have a
gift from a fan yes we do we have
multiple I'm actually wearing a gift
from a fan get this I know I kind of
feel like a domain superhero with this
on I'm like I'm ready to really like
flash I actually just registered an
awesome domain over there uh it was
chill out effects org instead of
chilling effects that org I head over
there it's fun we did it on TNT but but
yeah so we just finally got these in the
mail and I got a letter and it's like Oh
Darrin Shannon no love for you Paul but
it says hey Darrin and Shannon we wanted
to willing it to send you our new
domain.com t-shirts as our things for
all of your amazing support we also
threw in some extras for Paul oh there's
there's a shout out and anyone else so
we should give those words we can do
some trivia winners yeah that'd be great
hak5 has really been a huge part of our
success from on-air mentions so Darren's
tweets we think you guys are awesome
here's this it says Happy Holidays to
you and the entire hak5 family
domain.com Thank You domain.com we love
you to me
happy holidays March so what happened to
that package but apparently it finally
right hate to call out I don't want to
be that guy that's all like alright had
horrible service so I'm gonna tweet
about dang because I actually normally
love earth class mail earth class mail
calm it's so cool because you can have
like 548 Market Street you know and and
all these addresses and it's how way
yeah so we're glad that we finally got
it and I feel like a domain you super
you know super cute yes I have mine at
home yes anymore of been goodies yeah
actually this one is I don't know what
it is but I hear that it's very cool
alright take a letter
so found this FreeBSD power pack what
caught my eye and made me laugh was this
quote from the back of the box Walnut
Creek cd-rom the publisher of this book
relies exclusively on FreeBSD to power
its website and FTP site FTP cd-rom comm
the busiest site in the world according
to independent auditors its uses it uses
FreeBSD to manage 5000 users for gigs
abrino for 500 gigs of hard drive space
for gigs and 500 gigs hard drive that's
the specs on a mid-range laptop today
it's amazing how fast technology evolved
over 12 years to keep up the great work
back five and hat tip our informative
and entertaining thank you from Tom
thank you Tom it says right here it's
that FreeBSD is what makes Yahoo scream
you mean you can take that several
different ways now I'm actually you know
no my heart goes out to lay off people
yes yeah really sucks but yeah dude I
mean I'm don't be wrong I love the
FreeBSD it's it's fun to call it free
beast to I'm just gonna say
Prem's but uh but yeah that's gonna go
in the collection thank you so much I
love it and well in that Creek you know
where that is yeah that's like that like
right over there I'm so weird to be in
the Bay Area now because I got a baby on
so you remember like being back on the
East Coast and like you know growing up
in tack and stuff and you would sign up
for some web - oh stuff and it would
always default you
San Francisco in your life in San
Francisco I think Paulie remember we
like hated on this city this Bay Area
for like years just because it was like
I don't know it was like nd or just like
tired of hearing about stupid a yeah we
can't beat him join him I guess
man we lose some street cred for that we
should go back to Williamsburg and churn
butter alright fantastic episode this
week because we've got fun how to stuff
your protecting pcs I am relaying
Internet Relay Chat so that's like a
double real life what does it mean yeah
what's going on you happen to catch any
of the news about LulzSec yeah the guy
got captured from his teeth being
immature yeah yeah so um it was us
believe that guys handle is a boo or
Sabu Sabu and you know it depending on
the article that you read you get a
completely different picture like the
Fox News article but these evil hackers
and the bus gentleman yeah go
Republicans you know and uh and and then
there's also you know if you head over
to the register that code at UK you get
like a much different opinion anyway
regardless the long and short of is this
this kind of Sabu or Sabu was busted and
became an FBI informant and you know
helped bring down some other people the
other day from anonymous and LulzSec and
stuff like that I mean you guys know how
we feel about that whole issue it's just
like guys being mischievious have fun
but don't do stupid stuff and don't be
malicious but yeah yeah and there's
nothing cool about oh I see
but that said it was really interesting
that you know like like people are like
oh my god the FBI got in because he
didn't route his IRC traffic through tor
one time The Onion Router but one time
that he didn't do it
yeah I mean I'm not claiming to be like
an IRC master but I have been on since
like the 90s with mirc and I actually
got down that you know Pam has been
using it
you know X is X at yeah explanation
should point F serve what yeah it's way
but I think is off I'm just sayin um duh
the FBI is on there that's just like
standard operating procedure so for like
the other article people go oh my god
FBI has infiltrated the internet really
Network it's like yes and all the top
binaries is for where's of course but
but so I figured this is actually an apt
time because I was I actually had later
on the dock and the season today to talk
about this but I was like you know what
it'd be fun to talk about IRC bouncers
now so if you're gonna do a nice little
segment on it especially since
domain.com hooked me up with a cool
t-shirt and I'm using their service to
do the thing it's fun alright I'm very
interested in your nyan cat Power's
should activate hack 5s eleventh season
is here and we are so happy to let you
know that domain.com has been sponsoring
us for three years there are a favorite
domain registrar in the truth is we
couldn't be happier five dot orgs
actually hosted there and four new
domain names the add new domain names
your portfolio to manage all your
company's domains do hacking domain.com
I just told you about how often their
virtual private servers are and let me
tell you if you need to host your
website you can get up and running with
like WordPress and Joomla you've got
like installs in seconds with tons of
other cool super easy to use open source
software and let me tell you the women
at domain.com the other hand they're
fans of hack 5 and I'm not kidding if
you in fact tweet at domain.com their
Twitter you might actually find yourself
hooked up with a cool new domain.com
t-shirt I'm just saying try it out and
don't forget when you're at domain.com
buying your new domains like i just did
with chill out effects org you can you
know also transfer them them if you're
over somewhere else use the coupon code
hak5 a check out and save you an extra
15% so when you think domain names think
domain.com
so a bouncer an Internet Relay Chat
Network bouncer or a BNC it's a server
program that maintains persistence and a
connection to IRC server it's kind of
like a proxy now the BNC is actually
used to bounce traffic through and it's
great because it protects the users
privacy and I also adds a cool
functionality and you know like I said
the persistence now my bouncer of choice
is called Z&amp;amp;C it's been an active
development since 2004 and this bouncer
it's so cool it's written in C++ it's
licensed on the the GNU GPL so it's free
and you know how we feel about free and
some other cool things that it does in
addition to simply relaying IRC sessions
is that it supports ssl security it does
IP version 6 support it supports
multiple users and it can be it has all
these extensions through Perl Python and
TCL modules and it's also get this
really really easy to setup so in this
demo I'm going to be going ahead and
using my very own virtual private server
from domain.com so that you know when I
shut down my laptop or I'm at the office
or I'm at home or wherever I may be I
can just log into my VPS over at
domain.com and it's already connected to
my IRC yeah already in progress and that
way I don't have to log out and back
into the chat room all the time
I can lurk an idle infinitely how cool
is that all right so let's go ahead and
begin with a little SSH action and we're
gonna head over to the root account at
my VPS over at domain.com they actually
host hack five org and the forms and
everything else and the zero or legal
and first thing I need to do before
anything else is I need to add a user
because the last thing I want to do is
be running this as root don't do that
so there's various ways I actually like
to use add user now and I'm gonna call
it Bob cuz you know that'd be awesome
I already did this in a previous session
so we'll add user Bob
Roberson because you know why not and so
if I cat slash Etsy slash passwd you'll
see here that I have in fact a bob bob
resan oh there was my bob user account
from the previous demo and I can go
ahead and create a password for him so
past WD Bob Robertson and then give him
a password like lame password and there
we go and so now all I have to do is su
to switch user to Bob or sin and here we
go and if I type CD and hit enter my
directory changes PWD to print it and I
can see I'm in my slash home slash Bob
Bob erson directory and that's where I
want to be so now get this now to
install it this could be very simple or
not depending on how you want to go
there are packages in like the Debian
and Ubuntu repositories but they're
mostly out-of-date and honestly you were
just so much better off compiling from
source and believe me it is super easy
so all we need to do to get started with
that is download the file unzip it
configure it make it install it we're
good to go
so W get to just download it from the
web and Z&amp;amp;C can be found at Z and CIN
and if I go to the releases folder and
Z&amp;amp;C tak ODOT 204 latest version as of
recording guitar GZ and C it's the C and
C dot 0 dot chooser for dot r dot you
see and we'll unzip that or uncompress
it or whatever you want to call Z and C
and then CD over to it and there we go
we look around and we can see here we
have the the files and we just need to
go ahead and do dot slash configure and
this is going to go ahead and check
everything and once that's done we can
go ahead and make and I see right here
that I do not have Perl or Python or TCL
those would be really handy if I wanted
to run a lot of the cool modules that it
comes with but the nice thing about the
modules is you can load them after the
fact
so just to make things easy I'm gonna go
ahead and make and it goes ahead and
starts compiling all of those fun little
C objects and it's gonna be good fun
stuff
and we're done making so now we can make
install and there we go now it's all set
so by LS here whoops LS and I can see I
have my Z and C and if I do a dot slash
DN c-- and then tack tack make conf I
can actually go through this cool wizard
to make my configuration files so I
don't have to do it by hand just got a
nice and obviously you would probably
want to make install at a certain point
but just for now we're going to run it
from right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
