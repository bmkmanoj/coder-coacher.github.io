by go to assist so one of the most
important tasks in the world backing up
your machine it can be kind of a pain if
you don't know what to use or what works
best for your needs and you always have
to ask yourself all these different
questions like do I want full or
incremental backups should I back up
locally or should I back up you know up
in the cloud and it can be really
confusing about which program you should
use and what item you should do and
what's things you need to download so we
have some pretty interesting ideas for
this there's a built in tool now in
ubuntu yeah and I me they've like all
operating systems for the longest time
they've always had a built in tool I
mean I think even windows 31 had a built
in tool of course I'd use it because cuz
you always come on it download the
better one right well yeah I mean like
Microsoft briefcase isn't going to be
there ya know for you um and I also
think the one of the other things that
comes into account here when you talked
about backups is it's not just you know
all of those decisions about if it's an
incremental or a full backup it's to the
cloud or local but also what it is
you're backing up and yeah and what kind
of security precautions you have to have
in those cases do you want to encrypt
your file do you want to put everything
into just like a tar and just back that
up somewhere on a cloud yes for like
some of my stuff I will you know for
like my work in progress stuff I use
Dropbox yeah and for that reason it
synced amongst my computers now mind you
I use like a GP g archive oh yeah men or
even a time crippe volume in there so it
makes a little bit Messier yeah for
other things I back up locally for a lot
of my stuff from a general day-to-day I
just use crashplan you know there's
plenty of online backup stuff but then
there's not a lot so a lot of things
that you don't want to backup to the
cloud I find cloud most convenient but I
just want to throw that out there that
think about security is we like and
we'll probably touch on this when we get
into our GP g series here but yeah that
was using those volumes makes it so easy
go ahead so backing up to euro boon to
machine it's been made a lot easier
recently with deja dupe and this is I
believe it's for 11 point 10
higher and it's really really simple
it's got a really nice GUI to it and it
says our sink on the back end I'm sure
you're probably familiar with our sink
so it's a GUI front end for our sinks
yeah that's again like I stop looking at
the built-in stuff for the operating
systems and then they call ya know it's
gotten cool well you can do really cool
stuff with like our sink over ssh and
then tie in some gpg for your encryption
and really well your own I mean it's
kind of complicated but so you're saying
this is easy yeah it is robust I like so
it's just built into the GUI so I'm to
find it it's not called deja dupe in the
settings you just have to look for
backup and you have this little tool
that looks like a little safe so for
once in my life the dash was actually
useful yes so this is back up deja doop
and you have your overview storage
folders and schedule they recommend i
did read a little review online they
recommended not changing your schedule
or not planning an automatic backup
until you've already done all your
settings because if you do the automatic
backup first it'll just go ahead and
start doing a back up to whatever this
right previous settings were so you can
change your backup location although all
of this is pretty obvious by what you
read on on the screen it does let you
know down here old backups will be kept
until the backup location is low on
space so it automatically want to delete
older versions now this backup location
what is this location how do we change
it okay well show me what is it where am
I backing up to so right now it's just
backing up to the Shannon Ubu to PC or
you can do it into a boon to one if you
have that setup okay until Ubuntu one is
like canonical's version of Dropbox or
box.net arena yeah you get like a
specific amount for free on their
website I pretty sure I did a review of
it several months ago and then you can
also purchase more storage I'm not
seeing the benefit of backing up to your
own hard drive on your own system unless
it's a separate physical disk yeah you
know you here on a laptop where you've
only got one physical disk in there you
know really good point on backing up
locally so i would definitely either put
an external hard drive on here that i'm
just planning on you know keeping some
more safe or put it on to a cloud that's
why has the option to say
we run the backup when the backup
location is present there for so if i
set it up so that whatever this guy is
plugged in yeah heading on back up so
you can do that you can do a custom
location you can also do ftp and ssh it
has both of those sorry set in here and
then a local folder but that's kind of
pointless obviously unless you like want
to back up some kind of encrypted thing
and just leave it on your hard drive I
don't know if you're dead over us I mean
if it's an encrypted volume to begin
with then you're all good there and if
it's backing up over ssh then it's
secured in transit as well yes and then
you've got you know tune encryptions at
the scene yeah do it the same oh god
that's kind of like whoa meta blew my
mind and then you can choose your
folders that you want to backup the only
ones it has in here right now are the
home folder for Shannon and then folders
to ignore which is my trash in my
downloads probably because the downloads
in trash have a crap ton of stuff in
there that we really don't need but I
can choose to add 10 you know do I would
also blacklist your Dropbox folder if
you are sinking drops with that one
takes up a ton of space and it's all
we're took me a long time to figure that
out and then at the very end you can
choose whatever you want to schedule so
weakly every two weeks daily keep
backups for as long as you need to so
you can change that I do like that they
give you that option in case you plan to
do like a new backup every year or
something like that so if you do run
into that problem you can always change
it in there and that's pretty much it
you can also choose if you click back in
here to restore by clicking this restore
setting and it's so easy you just click
whatever the thing was that you backed
up and then choose forward sign in to
your boon to account if you have that
and then restore it so it's very very
simple and I like the fact that it's
simple but it's missing a lot of the
customizations that you can do like it's
not like download is at a certain time
of the night or something like that well
also I'm seeing here that it's kind of
the old-school mindset of like oh well
do a nightly backup or a weekly backup
not like a everything is
constantly being backed up in your hand
like you know instant yes so it has a
lot of issues to it but it is one very
easy built an option if you need that
yeah I'd say that backups built into
operating systems have grown leaps and
bounds the fact that it doesn't have an
option for you to burn them the cd-rom
or put them on a floppy disk I do you
agree so cool all right well then I then
there you go the end no I'm not kidding
so there are other options too if deja
dupe isn't perfect for you say you you
want some kind of other alternatives say
you're excited about other ones in the
GUI or in the terminal you can also
choose one like backup manager which is
free to download it's there's no
encryption though and there's no
scheduling in it okay um there's k back
up those that one has it doesn't have a
restore function built in though okay
well then it probably just does just the
files yeah yeah yeah it's just the files
and then there's back in time but that
one also doesn't have any encryption
built in PI back up that one is a really
really simple interface to use has
really nice GUI so that's a pie huh
python program yeah most likely our sink
which i'm sure you're familiar with I
love that well that one's like
straight-up terminal so that's very that
one's very Darren I I believe well if
you're not you're not so keen on the
rsync for the terminal there is a GUI
front end for it and that one is called
gr sink it's a total front in and it
stands for GUI our sink hey cool well it
seems like there's a lot of backup
options in the open source world yeah
and seems like they've really come far
away and so you have plenty to choose
from I do want to know what you guys
prefer because i like the backup one but
the day shot Duke but you know it does
have some customizations that I'm kind
of missing with it or it it doesn't have
those so I'd like to know what you guys
prefer what do you prefer Darren rsync
uh well I'd like again I said it really
depends on what the information is and
where you want that I do like crash
plans ability and give them to set your
own encryption key out of all the backup
services that wanna use that address
some conservative ones are there any
specific ones for linux
linux only that you use none that are
linux only okay i try to get whatever my
backup strategy is I really have to
think cross-platform because it is such
a you know I mean we all have so many
flavors of OS is here in the off i'm
using windows mac and linux now here you
go yep i have one pc for each of those
nice and then i also have the home
theater PC at home which I just built
and it's awesome there you go now we
just need to get her an Amiga let's stay
tuned because I'm gonna get back we're
gonna get right into your feedback hey
tuned I said that just again why I don't
know just thank you stayin tuned yeah
this seventy year between the holidays a
bad weather the sick days everyone is
spending time away from the office
except it's really hard to do that when
you work an IT because what users always
need support networks always need
support management but management needs
support the most and that's also why i
recommend go to assist from Citrix that
essentially has these three different
components that are all into one easy
use integrated cloud-based platform get
this go to assist remote support lets
you provide live or unattended support
to any pc mac or mobile device from
anywhere even from your iPad or Android
device for with their free apps so you
can take time away from the office to
plus go to assist monitoring lets you
proactively identify those issues before
they become a huge fire headache thing
from Satan I know you don't want that
and you can easily keep track of all of
this from go to assist service desk I
strongly recommend this stuff I used it
when I was a systems administrator and
it is saved my bacon so get this you can
sign up for a special 30-day free trial
all you have to do is go to go to assist
com click on the try it free button and
then use the promo code hak5 let's go to
