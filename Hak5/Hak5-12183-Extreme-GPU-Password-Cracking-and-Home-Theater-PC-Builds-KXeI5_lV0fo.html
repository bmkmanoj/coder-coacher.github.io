2013 Ford Fusion I want to put this
thing together so I could start using it
all right well as he just tosses things
out have a knife
all right let's get building and I have
a screwdriver well the knife is so that
you can bleed at the end of this because
you're not building a computer it'll
snaps bleeding that's just you stabby
stabby yeah you you're always the one
that gets the stabby stabs I'm the one
that just left and goes alright so we
got that got the Kingston
look at this it's got cute little Wi-Fi
ears it's like a huh what yeah it's got
little Wi-Fi antennas for this is it
there you go oh wait I've got a
thumbnail for the show there we go
obi-wan Kenobi you're my only hope now
Paul has bloopers
and that right there oh my god is why we
don't want us trim screws Oh
but safety first awesome now we can take
it off yay uh-huh
and to get the metal shards out of here
now
not gonna escape hmm oh cool comes with
an eSATA nice you're sad I seem to be
right-angled so let's see where the
ports are here okay good weekend
are they at the top it's gonna be easier
to plug these in now than later
well you never have too much RAM you can
never have too much move it drives you
crazy the Android devices still only
have like a gig of ram each no I mean
the the note 2 has 2 gigs and that's
like the note 2 yeah but but even then
it's like if Ram is so cheap why don't
we have like no why don't we just like
many examples that's out but I guess
that's so that they still have something
to sell us next year yeah they always
can do the upgrades now you say I'm like
Apple I said that'd be really cool if
you could upgrade the RAM in your uh
your phone that would be pretty sweet I
mean if you're really handy with
soldering at you could but then the
question is can you address it
you
you just cut it off no no are you sure
you don't want you to speaker AC speaker
is gonna go ah yes I got that PC figure
today we're sponsored again by Ford you
know that we're tech geeks and we've
told you about some of the really
amazing technology found in the 2013
Ford Fusion today I'm checking out some
cool driving tech that will make your
life easier out on the open road the
fusion comes equipped with bliss which
is the blind spot information system
bliss is designed to use radar at the
rear of the vehicle in the rear quarter
panels to help detect a vehicle in a
blind spot zone if a vehicle is detected
the system alerts you with a warning
light in the appropriate sideview mirror
this car also has the lane-keeping
system a camera mounted behind the
windshield watches rode lane markings to
determine the vehicles position and
detect a lane departure the system can
operate during the midday or the night
the lane keeping system alerts you
through vibrations in the steering wheel
which kind of mimic of rumble strip
should the system detect any kind of
unintentional lane departure now these
are just two of the different features
that you'll find in the 2013 Ford Fusion
thanks again before for sponsoring the
show today and for their commitment to
technology
all right so that was kind of an
interesting build I've never had this
problem before but half of the memory
didn't read and there was no video
output that was kind of weird yes so the
motherboard may say like oh we support
eight trillion gigs of RAM which was why
I bought eight trillion gigs of RAM
well check check for firmware updates
I'm sure you just are a bio some time
away from yeah you having both sticks
work but actually in my experience
building pcs that's the number one issue
really booting up if it's not happy its
finicky Ram finicky Ram that's gonna be
these guys oh well it's some offering
engine yeah that's my I've heard of miss
Bingley's yeah yeah I'm not my favorite
but you know I usually like cesium for
say yeah ocz is awesome but anyway what
do you guys like um yeah I want to know
what you guys like if you guys have
built HT pcs in the past this is my
first one and it was pretty good for a
$300 PC and I can't wait to start
messing with that we had one of that
house for what was it just like
somebody's spare rig give me the spare
rig yeah it might have been like evil
sir well that's also another good thing
to point out though is if you're
upgrading this is a perfect way to
recycle that yes oh it's kind of like
just bring it downstairs to the living
room
nice doesn't agree hit it hopefully now
that we fixed the RAM issue but um I
also wanted to mention what operating
system should I use hmm well you don't
have a cd-rom in here so no not yet
so if you're gonna install windows
you're gonna need one of those yes yes
but I can just use an external one we
have plenty of those sitting around but
um I was actually thinking windows might
be the best option
oh you're going Windows 8 now Shana
Morris what is a lover uh uh Oh Fogel
Windows 8 maybe I will cuz I have
checked it out and there's a few things
that I like about it most likely I most
things I don't you know I feel that
Windows yeah it is a best operating
system for this rig oh really
it is are you serious yeah why do you
say that we showed off couple weeks ago
how to get Netflix running in Linux yeah
total hack and from experience trying to
get things like Amazon on demand and the
YouTube store whatever it's called where
you can rent movies the in all the
different marketplaces all the different
there's so much great material available
but there's no Linux capable it's not
just Linux it's it's Linux Google TV
Chrome Android you name it
yeah and it's just a fact of the
industry is you know 90% of the world or
something I'm making that up running
Windows and so that's what you support
and then you support everything else and
so if you're looking for something
that's gonna do Hulu Plus and and and
browse all those right sharing go get
along I'll tell you run internet
explorer and I'm also saying you know
use Windows best practices here exactly
I'd even put it on a separate network
but you know it's just me um yeah you're
gonna be fine yeah I totally agree um
one other thing is I have a gaming PC at
home it's currently Windows 7 PC and I
want to be able to share media between
them and not have any kind of
compatibility issues between operating
systems I mean you could just do a Samba
share or an FTP or NFS or a million
different ways to share data using a
2013 and there's still new ways to share
data
they're always are getting a file from
one place to another I won't even give
you the rant I had about getting a file
from my note 2 to my Nexus 7 without an
internet connection I also want to check
out X and B c XE XBMC EMC XBMC would be
a great front end they have it for
Windows Mac Linux and it's just it's
software it can run on any operating
systems there's Android 2 there's also a
version for the Apple TV mm-hmm so there
you go yeah pretty much anything and
they made it strictly for home theater
pcs so it would probably work best in
this kind of environment so oh no maybe
I'll check that one out yeah this is
like the caveat it's like when it comes
to the entertainment stuff ya know like
they do baby different others changing
its totally changing and I'm not saying
like stop pushing these companies to
provide Linux support you know I'm like
constantly on Amazon's case like hey get
the video on demand working yeah um but
that said if you're gonna game and if
you're gonna do this kind of HTPC
entertainment stuff it depends on yeah I
mean you really got to look at like what
are the services that you care about
because a lot of times they're like
weather like oh we're sorry we detected
that you're not what we want to see yeah
you know and you can do
good luck I really wanted to give you my
business but oh well yeah so what do you
guys like I want to know what operating
system you guys chose am I totally
off-base yeah are we cuz I kind of want
to go Windows to its kind of I don't
know that's a little weird to say that
on hack Drive it's okay I had to do it
for a Photoshop premiere thing recently
and I'm not proud of it right you know
doesn't mean that I don't shop I've
loved for open-source goodness that's
true well I know this has been a very
long episode yes but lots of Awesomeness
I'm quite festive nobody that Noah is
bleeding nobody's bleeding surprising is
maybe you just shouldn't poke that
towards you okay no just put it away
there you go but just put it back in
your pocket but make sure it's closed
okay so we value your feedback as usual
you can email us feedback at hak5 org or
whatever to hang I've done or go ahead
