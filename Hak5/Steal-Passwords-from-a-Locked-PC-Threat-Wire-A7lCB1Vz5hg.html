still vulnerable to hacks and chrome
calls out non secure sites all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for September 13 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel to get
these shows before anyone else and check
out our patreon to see how you can help
the show grow patreon.com slash threat
wire is the place for that
onto the news in a research paper posted
by ben-gurion University researchers on
Friday a study shows that hackers could
successfully DDoS the 911 si system due
to its implementation of immediate
routing for 911 calls the FCC requires
that all emergency calls be routed to
the service immediately regardless of
the caller's IMSI or IMEI identifier z'
the attack would disable the service for
several days using just 6000 malware
infected smartphones in something known
as a telephony denial of service or a t
das attack calls could continuously come
in to 911 fected phones while hiding the
IMSI and IMEI so that the emergency
service can't pinpoint and block the
attackers since 911 C systems are run on
the state or the local level just
200,000 BOTS would be needed to take out
the entire u.s. system of service the
911 infrastructure is an older analog
fashioned network and to mitigate this
kind of attack the government would need
to invest time and money into
transferring it to a managed IP network
for telecommunication less than half a
minute of access a $50 device in a bit
of code is all you need to steal hash
logging credentials from a locked PC or
a Mac in an article written by Rob
fuller aka muak Salif friend of hack 5
host of Metasploit minute on the same
channel as this and principal security
engineer at r5 industries he describes
how easy it is to pilfer login
credentials from a list of operating
systems by using a hack 5 land turtle or
a USB armory device in a module called
responder Rubik use these devices and
responder together to trick the target
computer into thinking they were a DHCP
server on a default gateway which the
computer automatically trusts as it's on
the same local network the target then
routes the traffic to the land turtle or
the armory then responder asks for
authentication for various services
since the device is trusted
authentication is relayed to the device
this authentication also serves up the
username and a hashed version of the
target machines password in ntlm version
1 or version 2 now while the passwords
are hash they are not salted and they
can be used to mitigate other attacks
after being stolen to mitigate this
attack new bik's recommends reading an
article on exploit Monday comm which we
will link below and he also is working
on preventative measures the attack has
not been tested on Linux as of this
episode recording and it does work on
locked computers not logged off
computers Google Chrome will update to
version 56 in January of 2017 and with
that comes a new security feature the
browser will now notify you if a site
you visit does not secure your passwords
or credit card information securely in a
blog posted on September 8th by the
chrome team the new notification will
display the words not secured as opposed
to the current format of just a neutral
icon indicator eventually Google will
warn Chrome users that all HTTP sites
are not secure not just the ones that
have passwords or credit card form
fields thanks again to all the fine
people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow in return I want to
build an RSS feed for you so you can
actually download the show instead of
just watching it on YouTube and I'm
hoping to bring another episode on per
week so we're getting there and I would
love it if you guys could contribute
we might even feature your adorable fur
baby in an episode so check out the perk
levels on patreon calm and thanks again
for helping us keep this coming
completely independent and completely ad
free and of course if you cannot donate
you can hit the subscribe button you can
share this episode on your favorite
social media page and use the hashtag
threat wire because yes I do check those
and I'll be sure to check them out and
hopefully even retweet them from you
guys and with that I am
shannon Morris and I will see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
