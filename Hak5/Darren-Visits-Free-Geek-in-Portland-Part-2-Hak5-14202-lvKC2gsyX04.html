portland the segment is brought to you
by crashplan so for those it requires
absolutely no level of technical
proficiency and even for our build
program are the very first thing we ask
people to do is take the hardware ID
workshop where they are going to learn
all of the core components components of
computers and so we don't ask them to
have any advanced technical expertise
but at least show you what's going on
over here so the build program is meant
to be very accessible it's also kind of
tailored to how comfortable your you
know you feel with your learning so the
first step to the build program is here
hardware ID and you only have to take
this once but if you feel like you want
to marinate on that information more you
can absolutely take it two three four
times whatever it takes to kind of make
it for coffee we're going to introduce
all the different computer components to
you and talk about them and show you
some old old examples
and some newer stuff that we're looking
for for our specifications and on what
we're rebuilding currently so yeah we're
just going to go over all the different
computer parts and components and teach
you all about them so that's step one
hardware ID yeah so is everybody at free
geek volunteer no we do have paid staff
here we have over 35 paid staff members
and we average between between five and
six hundred active volunteers a month
and those are volunteers who come in and
give at least three hours of their time
we do many volunteers who are here much
more than that who will see a you know
three or four sometimes even five days
out of the week but we are stuff we are
stuffed we are but we are very much
volunteer powered and our volunteers are
important to us in terms of what they
offer and what we're able to offer them
and so how does pre-gig sustain
operations in 2012 we were one hundred
percent self-funded we approximately
twenty percent of our income came
through our recycling and so that was
recovery of precious materials and our
participation in the Oregon II cycles
program approximately twenty percent of
our income came through donations at the
front door every time people drop off
items to us we do offer them a
recommended donation amount and we're
happy to take none and we're happy to
take the recommended and it's wonderful
that people and Portland really support
what we do here and are often willing to
give more than the recommended donation
amount and then approximately sixty
percent of our income came through sales
and we have a thrift store that's open
monday to saturday 10 26 that offers a
wide range of electronics you never know
what you're going to find there because
we never know what's going to come in
the front door and we also sell things
online through ebay and amazon and all
of those can be found on our
website so you say you've been with the
organization for five years now with
some of the stranger things that you've
seen come in the door so I started
volunteering with free gate five years
ago and then I was in the bill program I
at that point I didn't get to see many
of the strange things that come in
because they often get filtered out by
the time they get there I've seen some
amazing computer cases one of the most
interesting things that came in in the
past couple of months was in a MFM
portable radio that was shaped like a
gun with a actual holster as well and
clicking the trigger it turns it on and
off I mean it was a really unusual
design I'm not sure who thought that
would be intelligent but and this is
prior to the age where we put the orange
orange plastic on the Front's of
anything that could look like a real gun
to indicate to police that it's not and
so this looks like a very real replica
we've had a couple of things come in
that we haven't been able to identify at
all I mean with you know all foreign
language on it and nothing that we could
figure out how it was supposed to
function or what it's supposed to do
it's pretty neat I definitely recommend
one of my favorite areas to volunteer in
free geek is actually in the sorting
area because you get to see all of the
material that comes through here and you
just get to find some really fun
interesting finds so this is the build
area this is where you'll be spending
the bulk of your time in the film
program will start you off by quality
control testing five or six systems
maybe some laptops if we're out of
systems at the moment but that will get
you familiar with the testing process
then you'll start working on the six
computers you'll use some checklists
here we've got teachers and stats on
hand available to help troubleshoot me
answer questions we definitely encourage
peer-to-peer learning also though so you
know if you're you notice your nut
neighbor struggling with something that
you just figured out go ahead and give
them a hand with it you know sharing of
information and helping each other out
is a lot of what makes scree geek go so
carry that on with us all engine you
love max and you want to go I figure out
how to refurbish them this would be the
place for you all they're definitely
challenged challenging you might have to
remove like 34 star-shaped screws to get
into one little area of manipulating
with one little thing and then frying
and taking more things off and yeah so
definitely challenging at the reward so
you might be wondering where the other
five systems are going that you're
building for us you're going to keep the
sixth one some of the other five will go
to adoption volunteers some will go to
our hardware grants program we're
basically we grant out tons and tons of
computers to local churches schools
nonprofits we've given over 7500 away
since our inception in two thousand so
yeah that's good you might build some
higher end or lower end systems for sale
in our thrift store we like to keep a
wide variety of different specs out
systems of
the community for cheap prices and yeah
they're sort also supports our
operations so that's kind of what's
going on with that what about like
historic computers things of that
ancient yeah I mean it's it's great we
do have some wonderful we had something
prior to your visit about two weeks ago
we took them down and put them up yet
but we did have a historic museum in our
thrift store and we've seen some amazing
older systems come through here we many
of them though we actually have donated
to OMSI which is the Oregon Oregon
Museum of Science and Industry for them
to put on display there because we know
that they can do a better job of
preserving these for the future and so
we didn't want to be hoarders about them
but we should have some still some
interesting older technology on display
and some of our voluntary isn't at the
front desks yeah we just haven't had an
opportunity to get to that again so what
are some of the challenges that that
face the organization as personal
computing moves more towards things like
tablets and smartphones and how does
free geek adopt those things I mean this
is yeah this is a huge issue for
refurbishers everywhere I mean it's just
getting harder and harder to r if you
need greater skill sets to refurbish
technology and you see that iFixit
repairability scores and these things
are that you have the newer items that
are coming out or a parrot ability
scores are pretty low you're saying
fours and fives out of ten and it's a
it's a shame because we really want to
be able to provide opportunities for
anybody to participate in the
refurbishing process and to learn about
computers but it's becoming it's
requiring these greater skill sets in
advance and so that can be very
difficult we will need to modify
what different volunteer opportunities
we offer to people and the way that
we're training them to go through the
process and we really do need to
consider how we are how we want to vet
people as they continue through the
process to make sure that they're
learning successfully from it and that
they're successfully refurbishing these
materials and not doing damage to them
that's a reparable if we bring in
somebody else to help with it and so
that can be very difficult and it forces
for a geek to really consider what is it
that we want to offer to our community
is it necessary that people become be
able to refurbish computers for us to
offer them the skills that they need or
what should we focus more on our
classroom education and the skills that
are going to help people be employable
and work well in an office environment
and so we could very easily start to
shift our focus from hardware as
Hardware becomes something that requires
more specialization to more of a service
based organization that provides a very
reasonably priced tech support that you
can count on to different people both
individuals nonprofits and other
organizations that offers the classes
and the learning opportunities and right
now we're in the middle of doing our
strategic planning for the next five
years and I'm hoping that out of that
comes a vision for free geek that really
takes into account difficulties with the
miniaturization of technology and how
that affects what we do here yeah I mean
it's uh it's really awesome what you
guys are doing with the desktops notes
those are all like IBM clones if you
will and although those are standardized
components and right and like you were
saying with the laptops like well you
know maybe if it's with an say a dell
inspiron family you can swap some things
around but for the most part
everything's perfect out of them it only
gets more so exact with tablets and
smartphones so have you guys taken on
any initiatives to to refurbish tablets
or smartphones we
if we've done some work with that and a
lot of that we haven't institutionalized
it well yet and so a lot of that has
been finding individual volunteers who
have expertise in these areas and having
them work on them in this past six
months or so we've really been trying to
do a lot more to bring that out of a
small room and create more more
procedures for working with that that
can be shared with other volunteers and
we haven't struck on the best way to
make that work yet but that's something
we are refining as we go through this
year and I'm hoping that within the next
six to eight months we really have some
opportunities in place for our
volunteers to learn more how to deal
with these Moors individualized
technologies and proprietary
technologies we are in our laptops area
we generally have asked people to go
through our entire build program before
they can go into laptops but we are
offering this month in next month 24
week-long workshops where people will be
able to learn about laptops directly and
skip everything with desktops and not
learn about those so that we're hoping
that we will get more trained volunteers
in here who can help us produce more
laptops so it makes it it makes it so we
can make more laptops available and
we're also hoping that we can offer
people the skills that they want to
learn so that they can learn to fix
these for either their own personal use
or possibly possibly for renew Maury
shin in some way and so give you the the
back of the book like I walk in the door
I want a free computer what do I do so
if you if you want a free computer it
depends on whether you're a non-profit
school church or community change
organization or just an individual but
assuming you're a person off the street
who just says I'm ready for your
computer i need one what's the quickest
way i can get it i would recommend going
through our adoption program where you
would come in take a tour at either
eleven o'clock or four o'clock tuesday
through saturday and you would learn
about all our different volunteer
opportunities and get a safety training
which is really important we don't want
anybody getting hurt here and after that
you would sign up for volunteer shifts
and you could if the volunteer shifts
are available you can work eight-hour
days and put in three eight-hour days
and be ready to receive a computer at
the end of that we do ask that people
take a free two to three hour course
that will introduce them to their
computer let them set it up and quality
control it themselves to make sure
everything's working correctly people
are not required to do that by by doing
that we offer them one year free
software support through tech through
tech support it's very user-friendly
very anti virus but it's different for a
lot of the community or used to working
with Macintosh or Microsoft operating
systems Shh so I recommend taking our
getting started class basically for the
adoption program you're going to want to
complete those 24 hours sign yourself up
for the getting started class it's three
hours we'll take your machine that
you've earned into the classroom quality
control test it again make sure
everything is working properly we'll
help you set your preferences on your
machine will help you download some free
applications that may interest you give
you a history of Linux and kind of just
literally get you started on working
with that so it's about a three hour
class and you get a ear a free tech
support for taking it and you don't if
you don't so there is a good enough
reason to take it right there but it's
also interesting and good so we have
about twenty something other classes
they are all free and open to the
community as well as volunteers so we do
this for two reasons it's helpful for us
because our tech if they're trained in
the ways in how to use their computer
better they won't have to call in to our
tech support as often straining our
limited resources and it's also great
because we know we're sending somebody
home with a computer that they're ready
to you
use instead of a doorstop and that's
really important to us we want these
computers to get used for people that
have more time and more interest in
getting involved in the technology we
would recommend that they go through the
build program and through that program
you learn all the basic components of a
computer you triage the systems that are
coming in to see whether there's
something we're able to reuse or not and
whether they're functioning well are the
different components are functioning
well and what we might need to retest or
what we might need to recycle and after
you demonstrate it comfortable you're
comfortable with our hardware that's
coming in and our processes you are able
to move into the build room where you
will start by quality controlling the
work of other builders then after you
quality control the five other builds
you would build five systems and then
the six system you get to take home with
yourself for yourself that program takes
a fair bit longer than the 24 hour
adoption program because you have to go
through a lot of different steps but you
also get a much greater appreciation for
knowledge for electronics and computers
and so what's next for free geek what's
next for free geek other than the
obvious answer of taking over the world
with you know proselytizing open source
software being kind of your environment
and trying to reuse your materials for
the benefit of the community it's hard
to say I mean we I think that we're
going to see I would love to see freak
really be able to continue to grow the
services that we offer I think that
would be excellent I think it'd be
really nice for us to continue obvious I
come at it from an education background
that was how I was originally hired in
to free geek as the education
coordinator so I see a lot of advantage
to us really developing our education
program and offering something
online that we don't currently offer and
so we're looking at different ways to
record our classes develop interactive
modules through open source software as
well so that people can learn regardless
of where they're located and whether or
not they can make it into free gig Yeah
right now we're just really happy to be
in such a wonderful community that's
very supportive of the work we do that
understands the importance of being
ethical in the recycling that you're
doing and understands the difference
between dropping off your computer with
a recycler who's going to just take it
and shred it right away and put all this
energy into breaking it down to core
components just to build new computers
out of it versus an organization like
ours that puts a focus on community
education on opportunities to learn job
skills and and actually reusing the
components how they are which requires a
lot less energy output completas
bringing up into the community as well
as volunteers we've got a two hour max
on computer access and will volunteer
10-minute limit 1 i'm linux is on all of
these computers so i might check that
out on your breaks got a little baby
library here of linux related books and
programming stuff um so you can rent out
any of these books at the front desk for
two weeks and bring it back those are
free books yes sorry um so these maybe
not as Linux related or maybe a little
older so where do people find free geek
or a free geek like organization in
their area i would i would recommend
well free geeky org is where you will
come to find us the free geek mothership
the first one on if you go to wiki free
geeky org we actually provide a lot of
the documentation that we use to support
this organization because we want other
people to take that information and use
it themselves and that includes links to
several other free geeks around the US
and in Canada
and my recommendation is to google
yourself to Google responsible recycling
or computer reuse or you know
environmental disposal of electronics to
see what you have in your area and
hopefully on where you live has a
progressive program like we have here in
Oregon the or guinea cycles program we
really put a focus on recycling all of
this key ways that can otherwise be very
dangerous no cool Darren thanks so much
my pleasure that was a good time help
absolutely I'd like to take a moment to
welcome our newest sponsor crashplan now
i've been using crashplan for years and
I never thought I would be this excited
about off-site backups but let me tell
you these guys are doing it right first
of all your data is for your eyes only
and that's why crashplan offers the best
privacy guards using bruce schneier is
open-source Blowfish cipher so you can
generate and import your own private key
so it's never stored on their servers
what's more crashplan is cross-platform
with clients for Windows Mac Linux even
Solaris and couple that with the truly
unlimited backup seriously I personally
have a couple of terabytes up there you
can see why I'm so excited in fact the
crashplan software is so flexible it'll
back up any file not just to their
off-site servers but to your very own
external hard drives even your friends
computers for free as hackers geeks and
IT professionals we know the importance
of off-site backups but get this as hak5
viewers we're getting a very special
hookup from now until July thirty-first
2013 we're getting a huge discount under
one year unlimited plans now normally
they started a totally reasonable 5999 a
year which is about five bucks a month
but if you go to this very special page
just set up for us at crashplan calm /
hack it up you'll get a whopping 20
percent off that's like a year of
unlimited backups for less than four
bucks a month now it's never too soon to
back it up so I highly encourage you
guys to take advantage of the July only
offer at crashplan calm / hack it up
it's time for my favorite part of the
show the techno last photo of the week
in this
one comes from Ryan he sends us this
photo from his tech space and he says
he's running to servers a Windows 8
desktop an old macbook running ubuntu a
Raspberry Pi new MacBook Pro running
three monitors a wee Apple TV Wi-Fi
pineapple a rubber ducky eight computers
total five monitors a TV a total of
eight terabytes of space holy crap Ryan
that's a ton of stuff how do you keep up
with everything wow that's nuts that's
like I think my home computer layout is
like if not half of that may be any way
you guys can send your photos over to
feedback at hak5 org with the subject
line teton LS if you want to be seen in
next week's episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
