officially dead and a man accused of
ddossing almost a million people has
been arrested all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for Tuesday
February 28th 2017 your summary of the
threats to her security privacy and
Internet freedom this show is now on
iTunes as well as your favorite
podcasting app thanks to our patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat wire
thank you so much make sure to subscribe
and now on to the news the first story
is all about CloudFlare they are a
company that optimizes security and
performances for websites all around the
world 5.5 million websites to be exact
including popular websites such as
medium yelp OkCupid Zendesk
23andme uber Fitbit and even more on the
17th
Tavis Ormandy a vulnerability researcher
at Google contacted CloudFlare regarding
a problem he found which seemed to be
residing on CloudFlare servers it was
later known that this bug was the nel
and famously coined cloud bleed bug by
the mainstream media cloud bleed was a
problem with an HTML parser in three
features called email obfuscation
server-side excludes in automatic HTTP
rewrites usually HTML parsers work fine
and they do things like change HTTP over
at HTTPS while passing a website through
a server to your web browser in cloud
flares case though a parser rewrite and
update caused the bug to start happening
the HTML parser created a buffer
overflow or in their case over run of
private data to be leaked at random
intervals and at very low percentages
and that's zero point zero zero zero
zero three percent to be exact if a user
searched for the right terminology via
Google search or otherwise they would be
able to see this data very clearly data
leaked included HTTP cookies
authentication tokens HTTP POST type and
other data because of the clearly
serious problem CloudFlare immediately
took action and they started mitigating
the bug 47 minutes
after it was shared with them that's a
really really fast time frame with a bug
being fixed at time of recording now
some search sites were still showing
existing queries late last week while
chances were low that your personal data
was leaked in this overrun you should
still take precautions just in case
since the leak was happening since
September be prudent with your security
instead of just assuming that you're in
the clear most importantly don't panic
as Troy hunt points out in a great blog
post over on his website sensationalism
of bugs is a very very popular
especially for clicks but if it has a
cool name or a logo well it must be
serious he also goes on to explain why
it's very tough to measure this kind of
bug experts recommend users change their
passwords and turn on two-factor
authentication for your sites if you
haven't already use a password manager
and you can also check the site WWWF a
site uses CloudFlare but obviously this
may not mean that it was affected for
sure wow this is so awesome we knew that
this would happen eventually but it's
still incredibly cool basically a team
of researchers at Google and the CW eye
institute of Amsterdam we're successful
in a sha-1 collision attack that's
awesome so what does this mean with
encryption a collision happens when two
different files have the same
cryptographic hash this has already
happened in 2010 against md5 hashes and
now it's a finish ah one which has been
widely adopted to prove authenticity of
digital certificates and file objects
now by using Amazon's cloud computing
and about a hundred and ten thousand USD
dollars an attacker could create this
collision now well me and you may think
that that's a lot of money and rather
costly a state-sponsored hacker or a
well-funded attacker what not that would
be child's play for them now this means
that an attacker could copy or steal a
sha-1 hash from one file and recreate it
for a spoofed copy of that file certain
types of applications will be affected
including digital certificates PGP and
GPG signatures for emails software
vendors certificates and signatures ISO
checksums get and more file integrity
is potentially vulnerable the
researchers recommend moving to better
cryptographic hashes as soon as possible
such as a sha-256 or sha-3 as get this
they will be releasing a
proof-of-concept on the collision attack
in ninety days and if you are worried
about a files integrity you can check it
with Google's detection tool which is
linked below in the show notes now
ironically there's even more news about
this the to PDF files that were uploaded
by the researchers as kind of a test
with the same sha-1 hash ie collided
PDFs they broke the WebKit browser
engine on Friday due to the Apache SVN
or subversion which tracks and merges
duplicate files now since WebKit uses
SVN it broke so I'm I guess just be
careful when uploading collided Docs if
you are testing them and use the SVN
tool just created by admins to reject
any of those duplicate hashed or
documents or files the entire research
paper is linked below it's 23 pages long
of technical information but it's really
really interesting to read I highly
suggest taking a look especially if you
want to get into the dirty details on
Wednesday of last week European police
forces arrested a 29 year old British
man whom they suspect played a key role
in the takedown of about 1 million home
Internet routers in a branch of the
mirai botnet which happened late last
year the botnet was able to take
citizens in Liberia the UK in Germany
all offline sporadically and also
attacked spam house which is an
anti-spam organisation Mira is a botnet
that attacked noted security researcher
Brian Krebs website and one of the
largest DDoS attempts ever recorded
which we had reported on previously on a
threat wire episode the German federal
criminal police office announced the
arrests as the 29 year old man is
suspected of computer sabotage against
Deutsche Telekom now since the person
behind the attacks used a screen name
and their screen name was Best Buy which
is a really odd screen name to choose
they used evidence collected by spoof IT
to find the man's identity if the man is
indicted he will face six to ten years
in prison before I go and want to give a
huge thanks to everybody who supports
the show so far on patreon you have made
it past
for us to create a video RSS feed for
iTunes along with your favorite
podcasting apps of course and if you
find value in this and you want to spare
a few cents an episode please consider
becoming a patron over at patreon.com
slash threat wire also I just updated
our patreon threat wire web page with
all these snazzy new graphics and I made
it really easy to find all the perks and
the goals and everything so even if you
don't contribute check it out because
I'm quite proud of all the changes that
I made and also we may even feature your
adorable fur babies like these ones in
our next episode just choose the perk
for hush puppy you will get access to
extra content and audio RSS feed and new
perk levels and also I've been doing
some behind the scenes videos and
posting those for patrons as well I hope
you will contribute to help us keep this
coming independent ad free if you cannot
donate of course a like share subscribe
all of those go a long way too and you
can find all of our episodes and links
to our social networks at threat wire
net and with that I'm Shannon Morse and
I will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
