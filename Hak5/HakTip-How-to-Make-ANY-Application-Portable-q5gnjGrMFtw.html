threads welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus in IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse and
today we're not talking about portable
apps we're making them portable huzzah
okay so making an app portable it sounds
hard right but it's not using commands
free virtualization application you can
combine all of the files the dll's the
registry all of that into one single
file that you can open from a USB
Dropbox or any other cloud storage to be
used on any computer you don't have to
reinstall your apps again and again and
again because that gets to be a pain in
the butt I know using a virtual app
which is also referred to as a portable
app also keeps your computer stable and
carefree by isolating the applications
from the PC I can already see this
program freeing up a lot of my valuable
time
ok so I've gone ahead and chosen to
download VLC media player and I will
hopefully turn that into a portable
application so first things first I need
to download the executable which I've
done and then I need to take my initial
system snapshot before I actually start
installing VLC so I have cameo running
in the background taking the initial
system snapshot and then once that's
done I'll click on the Exe and start the
installation process ok so it tells me
install the software you wish to package
which I've already done when
installation is done click install done
and if the installation requires we
reboot go ahead and simply reboot so I'm
going to click on my VLC Exe file
and start the installation and I'll just
go through the regular installation of
it let it extract all of its files the
dll's and everything this little red
button at the bottom tells me that it is
recording the installation process ok
once it's done extracting files I don't
want to run it I'll click finish and
installation is done and then it will
take a post installation snapshot to see
all the changes that I've made to my
computer system and then it should tell
me that it's ready to go
all right building package it says
something different oh there we go
opening package okay now after a few
minutes of waiting we finally have a
successful application created so it
says package successfully created in My
Documents cameo packages so if I click
there I should be able to open up
Windows Explorer and have my package
made so I can take this Exe and pop it
on to my USB flash drive or dropbox or
pretty much wherever I want to put it
and it should boot up from any of those
different programs since this isn't the
actual installation that I did earlier
let's see if I can do this one and just
pretend it's booting off of a USB flash
drive it also bring up the package
editor after you click ok but you don't
have to do anything in there you can
just close you'll have the option to
like upload it to Dropbox Street from
there if you want to but I just like to
hop on to the file in Windows Explorer
and move it around to where I want
physically so I'll double click on that
and sweet it opens it opens just like
the actual installation file now I know
that VLC does come in a portable app
anyways but I figured it'd be a good
example because everybody uses VLC and
there's a planet there's plenty of
programs out there that don't come in a
portable version that you don't
necessarily want to put on every single
computer
over and over again so it's a useful
tool now after the break we'll do a
little bit more digging around the
Camellia website but first here's a word
from our sponsor if you love alternative
apparel brands like Kidrobot Hurley and
Stussy but you hate wasting cash get
this you could score these premium
brands at up to 80% off everyday at

of all hack fives hooking you up
that's right skip the wait list and join
free at jack threads.com slash h8 k5 to
start saving instantly without having to
leave the house and back now commando
also works online where you log in to
their website and you submit your
application installer and they package
it for you you go over to online cameo
comm and create a new username and
password you log in and then you choose
a name or installer web location or you
can also upload the exe file executable
that you got from their website so for
example I want to do pigeon I want to
create a portable file of pigeon keep it
at 32 bit hit submit and then it shows
you your options if you choose by name
so I'll click on the first one and then
you hit package or you hit submit again
and it packages it for you after a few
minutes you'll get an email with the
package file ready for you to take on
the go so if I go over to my email I
have your virtual package is ready
pigeon so I can just click on that save
it to a USB and I'm ready to go thank
you so much to Cory for sending this in
it is totally made of win now it's your
turn what program or command are you
using these days send me a note in the
comments below or email us tips at hack
5 org and be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
just like this I'll be there reminding
you to trust your tech know last
