you by domain.com go to assist Express
and the Ben Heck show hello Mona hak5 my
name is Gerren kitchen of course your
weekly dose of technolo
welcome to you the hick fave oh gosh
yeah Oh guess what
I have some cool toys oh yeah you're
right we do you wanna talk about yeah
yeah we love to receive you guys mails
for 548 micro street number three nine
three seven one San Francisco California
nine four one two four and send that
over and we'd love to had some coffee
lots of coffee yeah you just think okay
so this is from Tim in Belgium I think
that was Tim this is for Paul right and
this is yeah this is for Paul this is
like old school when we went to New York
and we were at that record shop it's
like there's data on it but it's analog
and and you know what it's very similar
to the way a CD works except for it's
not I'm gonna pretend I know what it is
and call it a 45 all right and then do
we also got some really cool tech this
one here yeah this is not a cigar box
but the public intox
no no a VCR it's called a leappad3 ATZ
it's 90 megahertz has 64 megabytes of
RAM is running Windows 2000 yeah
I just tried my zero day exploit thing
that we're gonna be talking about here
in a couple weeks on it totally worked
took a little bit longer than it would
on another computer here was this made
I'm gonna sit well okay to give you an
example in the BIOS you can't set the
year to be over 1999 so this thing is
literally partying like it's 1999
yeah I know huge it's got a PCMCIA
Express card slot you know I bet
Thorsten was very happy to get this off
his off his hands back back drive I know
right I I'm gonna try to turn this thing
into a wireless access point because
walk around with this thing good schools
yeah no joke man that's probably what we
did back in the day you know geeks be
getting slaw be because our iPhones be
getting smaller yep and stuff yo that's
my street talk to the woman this thing
please how about some hacker headlines
yes Wall SEC has just opened up a hack
request line enabling people to give
them a ring and ask for them to hack
some kind of certain sites the groups
phone number is a 6-1 for us a area code
that they posted on their Twitter feed
they say that they have already sent
DDoS attacks over to like eight
different sites that colors have
requested with ton more to follow but of
course they're doing it just for the
lulz
are they all like you're the fifth
caller we're gonna have it was federally
heard it this morning and it was this
French accent guy and he was like you've
reached the line of Pierre du Bois I'm
like nice they love the boats they
really they do love the boat or the
LulzSec listen you want to hear some
good stuff random hacks of kindness just
occurred on June 4th and 5th
it's a globally linked conference that
brings together hackers from 18
different cities around the world to
discuss problems in the world that could
have technological solutions so it seems
like an awesome idea I wish that we
could you know I've made it this year
that would've been great I know we
should go next year because that sounds
really really really fun and if you've
ever had the England for that flash and
Arduino using a zip at c2 now there's a
way remember is if a Z to have yeah yeah
good stuff yeah apparently you can flash
an Arduino with it an Arduino board if
there's this really long video over on
hackaday you guys are free to check it
out there and the link is in our show
that's the cool thing about that device
is it's USB host mode I wonder what the
dingo could do you that
okay anyway it's time right now for
Kirby's sci-fi book of the week
did you have what it took to compete in
our crack the code challenge brought to
you by goto assist express these hack
five viewers did last Sunday mad props
go out to Judah zukor Judah suck
Canadian taco base this DB adrian K
Frederick Mike Edmund Adam w111 and
Julianne who were the very first ten to
complete the entire challenge a big
thanks go out to all you guys that
participated join the live stream and
the chat and of course go to assist
Express for sponsoring our hat 5 lab
network now stay tuned for info on the
next even bigger correct the code
challenge and also stay tuned in later
in the show for a brief synopsis but now
let's take a moment to thank go to
assist Express for making this challenge
possible I'm here to tell you about a
tool that's gonna help you save time and
money and make you look like a hero in
front of your clients and colleagues go
to assist Express by Citrix lets you
easily resolve computer issues in real
time or after hours even work on your
customers computers while they're away
from their desks dramatically boosting
productivity in fact on average go to
assist Express users report a 40 percent
increase in productivity that's like
getting two extra work days back a week
try go to assist Express free for 30
days for this special offer visit go to
assist comm slash hak5
you may remember earlier in the season
Jason Applebaum was showing us how to
use this cool Ruby script to go ahead
and back up our websites to Amazon's s3
cloud why not why not have some backups
I mean we could all use some right well
as Jason was putting it all together he
kind of mentioned that you need to use a
unique name for your bucket on Amazon's
s3 cloud and then that got me thinking
like oh really why why does it have to
be a unique name oh well I wasn't the
only one a good friend Robin wood over
at digi ninja org thought the same thing
when he saw the segment and he's put
together a really nifty tool called
bucket finder you see brute-forcing
isn't just for passwords anymore know if
there's some you know information that
can be had if you just know the name of
it well then let's try every name of it
this is why if you're say backing up to
the cloud it's important to mark your
bucket as private well Robin over at
Disney ninja org has a great write-up on
how Amazon s3 buckets work and how you
know the difference between public and
private and then even in a public bucket
how you can have private files but
what's cooler is the tool that you put
together with a little bit of Ruby that
allows you to go ahead and brute force
those Amazon s3 accounts so I've gone
ahead and downloaded the tool yeah and
and gone over to packet storm where you
can find some really good word lists
like any brute force a dictionary attack
you're gonna need a dictionary file or a
word list and packet storm has some
pretty good ones here they've got Usenet
names just general names Norwegian names
because Shakespeare names you know
Swedish names I mean actually in this
tool you can specify the region whether
or not you're looking for the US region
or the European region or anything like
that
so I don't know you could take the
German names and brute force Amazon s3
with that and see what kind of you know
Deutsch files you can get that'd be cool
yeah yeah I assume I lied so I've gone
ahead and downloaded the tool bucket
finder dot RB and I've got these common
names I'm gonna go ahead and just fire
up the the tool it's really simply usage
bucket finder and then the word list and
I'll just do the tack h1 or and we can
see the tool is going ahead and running
here and I can see that it's going to
tell me that the bucket exists bucket
doesn't exist I don't have access to it
and it's just running through this word
list to see if there's any good stuff to
be found here now you could run this all
day long and you could put up some some
awesome statistics about what is
available and what is not and Robin has
actually gone ahead and done that
already he's run what is it like like
2,000 some buckets and of that 1200
didn't exist 848 were private and then
131 were public so you know there is a
lot of information out there a lot of
people like not securing their buckets
he's found of the people that do leave
their buckets open most of what he found
were images he says the most of it was
like baby photos and stuff like that as
well as a lot of music and videos so you
know he's actually found a couple of new
bands that he's interested in so I'm
just running this tool over here and I'm
seeing that there's a whole lot of
buckets that don't exist I've actually
run this before and I have a little bit
of a log here so you can see what
happened we're like Amy over here has
you know these these log files open and
I'm sure if I were to comb through those
logs I might run across some interesting
information that potentially Amy didn't
want me to know about so I guess the
lesson here is while Amazon s3 is a
really cool service cloud service it's
on it's not is no different than any
other say putting it up on your HTTP
server in slash temp or you would
probably want to put an HT access file
because you don't want just anybody
going to hack five org slash temp
because there's actually a lot of stuff
in there I should really clean that up
anyway we all do it we all just use
these temporary web storage places and
when you do that and you don't secure it
well you know it's just a matter of
brute forcing the name well obviously
there's going to be a tool to do that
and Robin has done just that so you can
find over at digi ninja org slash
project slash bucket finder we'll have
links in our show notes thank you so
much Robin for putting together that
cool it's just nice to see how like a
fleeting idea can turn into a shell
script the next thing you know people
are pounding away at these buckets
I'm going to finish the h's here and
suing it our last trivia question was
this operating system also refers to the
1982 science fiction film a board game
and a song off of The Prodigy CD b-side
what evil lurks and the answer was
Android this week's question is the CCC
was peripherally involved in the first
cyber espionage case to make
international headlines in what year
answer over at hack $5 work slash trivia
to win some of our sweet swag and now a
word from our sponsor we were asked what
would hack 5 be like if it were a
paranormal investigation show so we went
to domain.com and registered a dot TV to
find out these are the hack files
obviously it's the work of evil server
this telekinesis again agent kitchen you
know as well as I do inanimate objects
cannot decapitate mannequin
truth is out there in the photo one from
a security camera
and wait I see something there in the
window zoom enhance that
okay go to sector 27 up there enhance
Oh zoom enhance
Paul Tobias
if you're building a video site or your
website has a play button a dot TV
domain is the way to go dot TV web sites
let you showcase your original content
and create a unique site not just
another YouTube channel go to domain.com
and search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea then use the coupon code
hak5 at checkout to save an extra 15%
looking for hosting save 15% on that -
at domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
there comes a time in every boy's life
where you decide that one computer just
won't do and at that time when we need a
little synergy in our lives here to
bring us this enlightenment Morse
darn tootin it is there really what are
we doing
oh we're synergizing whoa but to give
you a very nice example of this I'm
gonna go over it into the hack shop and
show you like right there on my desk so
yeah the definition of synergy is
basically when you take two or more
things and you make them function
together to produce an outcome that's
greater than just the two things
separate by themselves and this handy
tool called synergy does exactly that
here at our hak5 office for the hack
shop I use two different computers I
have my normal laptop for like social
networking and facebooking and catching
up with emails and writing show notes
and whatnot and then I also have this
second laptop for the hack shop I print
labels fulfill orders all sorts of stuff
like that and along with these two I
also have two mice I have my two mice
two different keyboards and seriously if
I had a dime for every time I grabbed
the wrong Mouse when I'm switching
between the two laptops I'd probably be
a millionaire maybe a billionaire I'm
not really sure I did probably have to
count it up do a little bit of math
anyway
enter synergy the free and open-source
software that lets you share your mouse
and your keyboard between two different
computers it's amazing where each
computer has its own monitor or its own
display you don't need any hardware
add-ons no special mods all you need is
a local area network some kind of
internet connection that's shared by
those two different computers but what
if you have different operating systems
on those two machines
luckily Windows Mac Linux they're all
supported it's no problem sharing the
computers is as easy as just moving your
mouse from one monitor to another ahhh
it's so cool it enables you to use
multiple monitors for your single
computers as normal and you can copy and
paste between the two separate machines
now synergy was first created a couple
years ago or well tons of years ago but
it wasn't being updated after 2006
so now we have emerging between synergy
and synergy plus and now it brings us
updates for all the new OSS new OS
compatibility it fixes a ton of bugs so
it's pretty nice now to download synergy
all you have to do is go over to synergy
- Foss org and click on the download tab
and choose whatever the OS and browser
or the OS and the 64 32 bit that you
have on your machine on the made
computer and you go through the normal
install process of course and then
eventually you'll get to the point where
you can open up this energy program now
in the main menu you're gonna want to
check server which means that you're
gonna share this computer's keyboard and
mouse
now you'll click on the configure server
after that and it gives you this nice
little grid system from here you can
drag and drop your main computers
monitor to a desired box in the grid so
I can move this one up down wherever I
plan on actually having this monitor it
gives you a nice structured view of
where each of your computers is going to
be in real time so since my main
computer my main laptop right here the
server is going to be on the left side
of my second laptop I'm gonna put my
main computer right here I'll move it
over one and it's called the snubs - PC
that's gonna be the keyboard and mouse
that you'll want to connect your other
computers to as clients now I'm gonna
connect my second laptop to this main
ones keyboard and mouse and hopefully it
all goes well
now I've already installed synergy on my
second machine over here and to install
it on the second computer aka the client
you just follow the same steps as before
this time when you open the program
you're going to need to check client and
type in the name of your original main
computer's name so I already clicked
client and mine was snubs
- capital PC and then you need to go
over to edit settings and look up your
laptop's name hopefully mine hasn't
changed okay we're still good it's hack
shop hok shop so I click okay so I'm
good on that side so I have that one
named hack shop I'm pretty much good to
go in that second one I want to go back
over to my first one and click into can
figure server and make sure I have this
second one ready to go I'm gonna double
click on that one and if you haven't
named it already you can go ahead and
type in the name hack shop click OK
click OK again and you should be ready
to go so I'll go ahead and click start
on both of my machines and start and if
it works right my mouth should just it
works moves from one monitor to another
it's brilliant
and it's easy I mean what more could a
lady asked for and it's totally cool
like when I was at home I literally had
one of those like woe moments when I had
my laptop on the complete other side of
the house and I was able to move my
mouse from my PC on my desk all the way
over to my laptop and I looked over it
and I was like dude awesome so if you
like synergy or if you have a program
kind of like it email me over at
feedback at hack 5 org and now back over
on the set Darrin has the crack the code
challenge walkthrough for us to check
out earlier in the show we talked about
a tool called bucket finder which we
used to perform a brute-force attack and
while it wasn't your typical password
cracking scenario the concept is really
the same as well this week's cracked the
code challenge we did it a little
different this week we had the the
participants join us and download a
payload file and there are so many
different ways to go at this because
basically it's picture of kirby course
oh yeah of course
inside a password yeah inside of a
password protected PDF file that was
inside of a password protected zip file
and then this words there's usually a
readme dot jpg which is Kirby of course
and again there was exit paid in there
which led you to a word list and there
are so many different ways to complete
this in fact we had like as of right now
we have like 56 people who have
completed it oh wow ok talk about how
you know it's but it was a good example
of an offline brute-force attack versus
which for right now we're going to do an
online brute-force attack go ahead and
pick a card any card any card any card
I'm not Brian brushwood here so it's not
sleight of hand or anything no all right
don't tell me what the card is you know
all right ok so I could say is your card
and ace of clubs
now is it a two of clubs no is it a
three of clubs no soap or cloth no is it
five of clubs no see there's a brute
force attacking in 52 got close early
and in 52 questions here I will is a six
of clubs no Devon yeah okay so somebody
says yeah that's the club so low there
we go we did a little brute force attack
there and the same idea with this one it
being an offline brute force attack that
means that you can use several tools to
basically try all of those combinations
I mean of course the EXIF file yeah the
the the link in the EXIF data was kind
of a clue because it was a word list you
know you can do yeah you could use John
the Ripper to generate random ones lots
of people took different approaches
Judah Zach he used the active archive
password recovery and then the advanced
PDF recovery tools Canadian taco used
the Elcom softs password crappy stuff
for PDF and zip bass used the ultimate
zip cracker and PDF cracker Pro Mike
used F crack as if which a lot of people
use F crack zip command-line tool really
good advanced PDF password recovery tool
as well Edie bun used fast crack zip and
PDF crack there's so many different ways
I didn't want to like bore you with an
extensive like here's another
command-line tool to pregnant was it
file with the word bliss it's like you
know what's the same but the difference
here is in the online attack when I'm
asking you you know is it this is it
that is it that yeah you can eventually
what you do if I was in a bar I ask you
this and I started eventually I pour my
beer on you and say screw you buddy yeah
there you go so that's the difference
because eventually Amazon is gonna say
wait you've asked me how many questions
now in the last 30 seconds yeah I'm
gonna spill my beer on you yeah yeah and
that's that's we're gonna call that
science and we're gonna take a break
we're gonna thank one of our wonderful
sponsors and we've got some wonderful
emails science and while we're thinking
our sponsor Shannon let's play 52 card
pickup I win
join modding wizard Ben Heck and his
friends as they build and modify a host
of amazing community inspired creations
be sure to watch the most recent episode
of the Ben Heck show where Ben builds an
Arduino powered exterior mounted camera
system for an off-road vehicle the setup
enables the driver to control the camera
from inside the cabin to get a better
view of obstacles while driving on a
rugged off-road terrain the show about
building modding and electronics culture
is brought to you exclusively by
element14 be sure to visit element14.com
/t BHS for a chance to win one of Ben's
latest builds
as you guys know we welcome your
feedback so send that over to feedback
at hak5 org we got a great one here from
Scott W excited about this Shannon Scott
W writes I'm an adjunct instructor out
of local university we got the approval
to build two of the wall mount servers
for our CS lab pretty sweet I was able
to get the parts list and have
everything that I need I've built
computers before so I'm fairly familiar
with most of the parts of the system
however this is my first out of casemod
I've installed the CPU fan the memory HD
and the power supply I've made the three
power connectors that I can find on the
board I've plugged the CPU fan into the
appropriate place on the board when I
plug it in nothing happens
I then ask myself hmm what about a power
switch aha
so how do you power on the computer
without a case is it as simple as
putting a jumper on the power switch
plan pins is there something else that
I'm missing any feedback would be great
thank you in advance okay sure
now I actually don't have power switches
on these wall-mounted servers here
because I've gone ahead into the BIOS
and told them that to automatically
power on upon you know receiving power
again like if there's a power loss at
least one day you plugged in a monitor
well yeah the BIOS has a setting and I
did plug the monitor in to first set
these off I had keyboard mouse
everything to set up the operating
systems and whatnot but the first thing
I do in the BIOS is say hey if the power
if you lose power like say there's a
storm or something power goes out you
want this machine to power right back up
when power is restored so all I need to
do to turn this guy on and off is
literally come over here unplug it and
then I'm like oh I want it to be on
again just plug it right back in now of
course that first time you boot it up
you will need a way to turn the machine
on what I like to do is just grab the
car keys here there you go and then find
the pins on the motherboard where you
would typically plug in the the power
switch the reset switch your LEDs for
all of the different like hard drive
activity stuff like that and just touch
your keys to those pins and voila that's
that's all it was No if you want to shut
it down just touch him again you know
it's
I know total my guy versus not bad yeah
machine no cuz that's all the that's all
the switch is going to do anyway is
short those connections so sometimes I
don't know what what connection it is
and I'll literally just rub my you know
just uh I'll swipe my keys across the
pins and it will turn on awesome anyway
that's so that's pretty cool
yes I hope that answers your question
save me with the Technos photo of the
week Technol s photo of the week comes
to us from cane are in island he sends
us a photo of his block posters creation
nice big hack five poster it's very cool
and very creative so if you guys have
