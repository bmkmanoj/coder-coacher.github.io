welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going
over port scanning options now in Metz
scans about a thousand commonly used
ports by default which include ones like
84 TCP and 25 for SMTP etc now if you
want to scan other ports there are
several options for you let's go ahead
and start with the tak capital F option
which does a very fast scan sometimes a
scan for the 1000 common ports can still
take a little while so you may want to
cut that down to only the top 100 ports
if you want to do this it would be nmap
tech capital F and then whatever target
that you wanted to scan so I'll do that
one so it's a very very quick scan it
looks like every other skin that you do
you just add tak capital F after the
word and map so simple
scanning specific ports is pretty fun as
well if you want to scan a target for a
port 80 for example it would look
something like this you would type an
nmap tak P for port and then 80 or
whatever the port is that you want to
just use and then your target press
Enter and it will go ahead and scan for
that specific port so under here all you
see is 80 TCP it's currently closed with
service HTTP running so using this
option you can also scan a range of
ports or specific ones all in one go so
if you wanted to do this it would
actually look like this I would type in
map again and then tack P as usual and
the ports that I wanted to scan so 80
I'll do 23 and then I'm going to do a
range to mess it up a little bit and
then 1070 3.31 1 4 5 or whatever your
target ends up being so in this case
it's going to not only do 480 and 23 but
the range 140 to 200 if you don't
remember the number of a port you can
also do the name if you wanted to so for
this example I would type in nmap and
then tack
II and I'll say I'm going to scan for
HTTP on this specific target and then
whatever your target is and this will
scan specifically for the service HTTP
ha nice and simple
now if you know that a port starts with
something like so for SMTP it starts
with SM obviously but you don't remember
the rest of it for some reason you can
also do this where it will scan for just
SM and then whatever comes after that so
everything that starts with SM I can
type in and map tack P then I'm going to
use some quotations for SM and a
wild-card asterisk we learned about that
back in Linux 101 tips and then your
target you hit enter and it's going to
run for everything that starts with SM
on your target no matter what port it is
or what state it'll give you the service
SMS smtps SMT SMPTE SMTP so you see all
of them show up in here now the reason
why we have those quotes is because of
that wildcard normally in Linux in the
terminal if you use a wild-card Linux is
going to look at it and think that it's
a complete terminal command not
necessarily an nmap command giving it
those quotes let's the terminal know
that it is an nmap command not a Linux
terminal command make sense all right
cool so let's go ahead and move on keep
in mind all of these ports can be found
on the ia nain a website that we
referred to a few weeks back and I'll
put that link in the show notes below
just so you know where it is as well
make sure to memorize that entire thing
there's like 65,000 ports on there yeah
I'm totally going to remember that now
I'm going to be right back because it's
getting hot in here with more port
scanning options but first it's time for
a word from our sponsor the hack shop is
hack 5s premier store for all of your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive in it types
like a keyboard it can type scripts into
a computer ridiculously fast like this
week's favorite of mine from three six
six 9n in the forums the hack 5 org
forums this is going to create a batch
file that will
look like the matrix and then it will
execute on a machine so you totally have
the matrix running on your PC that's
kind of Awesome now we couldn't do this
show without your support so we would
like to thank you with something special
you can use the coupon code snubz with
any order for your very own hacked tip
stickers signed by nee and Darrin
because we're awesome thank you so much
for supporting the show again we
couldn't do it without you
we're back and it's time for more port
scanning now to scan ports by protocol
you'll need to add a new option similar
to this one that I'm going to do so I'm
going to do sudo because this is a root
command and then tak s capital u tak s
capital T tak P and then I'm going to
type in U or capital u there we go 25
comma and then T :
and let's do actually I'll do 53 53 and
25 and then a space and whatever your
target ends up being so I'm going to do
same one as usual and hit enter so after
the password it's going to run something
that similarly looks like other ones
that you've been using so you're using
the syntax tac P for the ports and then
you're using tech su and tak st to
specify UDP and TCP the U : 53 and T :
25 tells an end map to scan for UDP on
port 53 and TCP on port 25 if you really
want to get hardcore and scan everything
you can try this one which is nmap tak P
then you're going to use quotations a
wild-card and more quotations and then
your target press Enter and it scans for
everything so this wildcard in quotes
tells an MEP to scan all of this over
65,000 ports that are known to nmap now
if there is a specific number of most
popular ports that you would like to
scan you can also do that one with a
target called top ports and then
whatever your ports end up being so for
this example I would type and map and
then - - top - ports and then type in
however many
which I want to scan so I'm going to say
some random number 54 why not 93 31 1 4
5 and once you scan that it's going to
go through the top 54 ports in an MIT
and map that I want it to scan on that
specific target now lastly is scanning
in sequential order with tack R and map
usually randomizes when it will scan wet
ports which is really useful if you want
to evade fire firewalls or you want to
avoid detection in some circumstances if
you just want it to scan an order from
you know the top one all the way down to
the last one you can use n map tack R
and then your target
thanks to note though you won't see a
difference in the output because n map
will still type out the order however at
once although if you add tack V to your
syntax which is for verbose it will show
you the scans in real-time order and
that's it for port scanning what would
you like to see next week on n map
tutorials send me a comment below or
email us tips at hack 5 org and be sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this that's
getting pretty hot in here apparently
nobody in San Francisco believes in
central air conditioning for the summer
time so I'll be over there reminding you
to trust your Tecna list and I'm going
to go hang out in a freezer bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
