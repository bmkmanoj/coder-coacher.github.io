hack 5 this segment of hack 5 is brought
to you by goto assist now you guys know
that I really love checking out all
sorts of different cloud storage options
and different ways to securely and
remotely backup all of my different
products even sometimes locally and this
one was a pretty interesting one for me
a viewer Jack sent this one in he said
yet another cloud storage project for
you to look at I like it because it
supports secure FTP SSH etc now this one
is pretty interesting it's basically
your own Dropbox clone it's always going
to be a good option if you want
flexibility customization control and
savings not to mention a little bit more
security now nice thing about good sync
this one in particular is it offers SFTP
secure FTP file transfers and it can
sync to online storage medias as well so
for example if you have Google Drive or
Amazon s3 it can sync to those very
simple very easy to use now the download
process is a total breeze but
unfortunately it's only available for
Mac and Windows and Android and iOS of
course but there's no Linux that's a
total downfall now then you can create
your first job once you actually have it
all ready to go and you can do two-way
syncing or you can do one way backup
so I'm going to set up my machine over
here to actually set up one-way syncing
for example for my example I've already
done two ways syncing as well and that
one works fine but for this one I'm just
gonna back up one folder to another and
see how it goes so let's go ahead and
take a look at my machine so I have a
couple of folders down here 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
let's say one of these might be a
Dropbox folder for example and the other
one is a local folder so on this one I
just have a couple of images in this
case I just have a picture of me when
one of those monsters because why not
and then my other machine my folder has
nothing in it quite yet so I want to
make a backup of this picture so I'm
gonna go into good sync once it's
downloaded
and I want to create a new job you can
enter a job name so for this example I'm
going to call it monsters backup and you
can either do synchronization where you
do two ways and this means that the
files are changed on both sides or you
can do a backup so I'm gonna do a backup
they're changed on the left side only
propagate changes from left to right and
that's an important thing to remember so
when you open this up on goodsync my
monsters backup it's going to show you
to your new sync job right here of
course nothing has happened quite yet so
once I have my job created I'm going to
have to go in and decide which folder is
going to be on the left side and which
folder is going to be on the right it's
very simple to do all you have to do is
go onto your machine and choose the left
sync folder and the right sync folder so
left is going to be my stuff to back up
and my right folder will be my good sync
folder good sync to so once I've browsed
to the two different folders that I want
to sync up one way I can go ahead and
decide to analyze so analyzation
basically just takes a little bit of
time to analyze the data that's in my
folder that I want to backup and
determine what kind of files and what
kind of folders are inside of that so
I'm gonna go ahead and click analyze and
this won't take very long if you don't
have very many folders luckily and it'll
just show me that I have one image here
now these icons right here are very
important if you have several different
folders say if you're backing up your
Dropbox for example what you can do is
choose to backup just certain folders
certain file types or you can just do no
backups at all so I can choose to backup
from left to right from right to left or
not copy at all if I choose that
obviously nothing's going to happen so I
want to backup this file from this
folder over to my other folder so I'm
going to choose left to right now once
that is completed we can have a little
bit of fun so this is the fun part so
let's go ahead and click auto right here
so when you click on that you're going
to see that you hope have a whole bunch
of different options it automatically
brings you to auto so in here you can
choose whenever you want a file to
analyze and sync or if you want folders
to actually connect you can do all sorts
of different things as well as do
scheduled backups - I love scheduled
backups so that's one of my favorite
things to go ahead and customize myself
but you can also do other things as well
so I'm going to go ahead and choose upon
file change I want it to sync and
analyze I'm not going to run the
scheduled ones right now for this
example but I'll go back and do that
later you can also check out generals
the general options different job types
that you can run you if you want to
change this specifically you can do
synchronizing two ways you can backup
from right to left if you want to change
that and there's a few other options in
here filters are pretty important if you
want to choose to exclude certain kind
of files say you have a whole bunch of
files in your Dropbox and some of those
are for work some are for personal use
you don't want to backup the work file
so you can exclude those in here scripts
are a little bit more advanced but that
gives you a whole bunch of different
customizations in there and you also
have some advanced options as well so
I'll go ahead and save those and it's
going to analyze one more time and once
that is done it also does an automatic
sync for you so you don't have to click
syncs that usually when you do that and
you have several files and may take
quite a lot of time for example I had
about twelve gigs that I backed up
earlier and it took about 20 minutes so
it can be good can be bagged just kind
of depends on what you're used to now
once that has completed you can go over
to your different folders and make sure
that they have actually synced as they
should so I had my stuff to backup and I
had the one file right here so that has
not changed as it should and then I have
my good sync and there's my file so it
looks like it worked just perfectly so
there are some pros to this particular
program there's lots of customization
that's a definite plus it's very quick
and it allows SFTP as well as syncing to
online
storage and that's pretty cool now you
can also get versions for USB to
automatically sync to your USB Drive
which is also pretty handy now on the
con side it may be too much
customization for some people it might
confuse some and you have to pay to get
certain things like syncing to Google
Docs yeah that's only in like the pro
version so also and this is probably the
biggest downfall it's not open-source
weren't were now there are open source
options of this kind of program for
example sparkle's share and i believe
i've reviewed that on a past tak v so
you can definitely check that one out
but if you guys have options for me that
i haven't checked out so far or not I'm
always willing to check out new programs
you can email me feedback at hak5 org
and I hope you enjoyed it now coming up
soon plenty more awesomeness for you but
first a quick break working in IT means
constantly jumping from one problem to
the next and everything needs to be
resolved fast every minute counts so
don't waste your time juggling different
tools and duplicating all that data
entry use go to assess from Citrix these
guys are the leaders in remote support
and they have the tools you need to
integrate into one easy to use platform
so you can work faster and more
efficiently so here's how it works
there's the go-to assist as essentially
three tools in one that you can
customize to your needs there's the
service desk which allows you to track
incidents and you know the resolutions
there's good twist monitoring so you can
be proactive about you know issues so
you can fix them before they become huge
problems and of course remote support so
you can provide live or unattended
support to any PC Mac or mobile device
from anywhere to resolve issues quickly
