Linux install for better battery life
Darren reports then encrypt all the
things I'm setting up local encryption
volumes that play well with cloud sync
services like SpiderOak
and Dropbox plus RSS podcast from
YouTube is it possible all that and more
this time on hack 5 this segment is
brought to you by untangle
before we get started with this episode
of pack 5 I just wanted to make a really
quick announcement because by the time
you see this I would have already
cleared customs and I'm already now in
Geneva Switzerland where I'm on a
special mission the International
Telecommunications Union so by the time
you've seen this I've actually already
spoken to the Secretary General of the
ITU the United Nations how crazy is this
if you've been following threat wire you
understand the importance of what's
happening in the ITU I will be attending
parts of the W TP F or the worldwide
telecommunications Policy Forum so I
will be in Geneva the what is it now the
3rd through the 9th so I just want to
throw that out there I will also be
reporting from the field throughout
Europe for a couple of weeks now
as long as I'm over there I will be
celebrating my 30th birthday in Dublin
so I will be in Dublin the 10th through
the 15th I want to say so if you're in
Ireland just you know there's gonna be a
meet-up it's gonna be good fun as well
as the rest these countries and then
from the 15th through the 20th I will be
in Berlin Germany at some hackerspaces
and then from there on I think I'll be
in in the UK so I'm just throwing that
out there because I know that this is
really short notice and I couldn't
really talk about this too much before
heading there but by the time you see
this I'm already in there and you should
be looking out for tweets and cupcakes
on hak5 org so follow us on all of the
social media places darren kitchen comm
for all of the places where you can find
my specific social media presence and
all of the information about the meetups
that will be happening in these
countries and I'm specifically looking
for your advice once you say through
spaces in Berlin or
or London or wherever this may take me
but that's my quick update before the
show to let you know that right now I'm
in Geneva at the ITU Cheers my name is
Technol us my name is Shannon Morse hi
how are you it's the show we count up in
to the show and not down one and now
arbitrarily it's me son they have no
idea what we're talking about
no no yeah that's okay we have a there's
um I don't want to talk about it yet but
I'm just saying there is like a special
secret project kind of thing going on by
the time this airs and so stay tuned
next thing with the thing okay yeah I
think it's the thing so stay tuned to
the Twitter and the Google+ yeah stuff
on that and it is why it is why today
I'm doing my first series of crazy stuff
with this new ugly black box that thing
is huge
I know it is do you ever buy that well
because I need a clean machine for when
I want to take you know I want to take
the hacker box but going yeah yeah that
one draws attention so this one you look
like a business I look boring you just
have to wear a tie you have a tie yeah
okay I will wear it on my forehead so
the idea with this is I want to start
talking about all the things you do road
warrior travel blah blah blah and one of
them the kind of the first one that I
actually started working on before all
of the other you know fine encryption
tunneling and you know PGP and all that
good stuff is just getting your machine
to a point where you can really use the
crap out of it without it dying on you
yes the reason I went with this right
here is a Lenovo ThinkPad T 430 and it's
got a nine cell battery that juts out
the back as well as another nine cell
battery that runs at the bottom god and
then you can get any other monster yeah
you can actually get another three cell
that goes into the cd-rom bay yeah for a
total of 21 cells but ours does this
thing last right now well that's the
thing they claim in Windows up to 30
hours now
up to means right but that's windows you
can only get that if you're not doing
anything on your computer exactly and
just and so the thing is Linux battery
life has really taken a dive as of the
three three oh three external notice
some of that on my own machine and we're
not gonna get into all the reasons here
but I would like to actually spend a
little bit of time talking about ways
that you can optimize your Linux
installation for better battery life and
the first way that would never get like
seven great tips and within all of those
will drill down but the very first one
is if you have the opportunity to get
yourself get this out of your life no
get the spinning disk out actually
there's a three and a half but you know
stop go over to a solid-state drive
because there's gonna be huge
I think I can I can exchange this one oh
yeah there's screws on the bottom of
this so I could just pop this out and
put on a new solid-state drive that be
easy probably and I think this one's
currently such a small hard drive anyway
I could probably get the same amount of
hard drive space
it's solid-state space first and with
all of those new ultra books that are
coming out where's this guy yeah so like
with all of these new ridiculous
machines that are coming out like this
guy yeah the the s7 you're going to have
a solid-state in there because they've
pretty much put everything soldered onto
the motherboard so it's so pretty
so that's there so but the thing is once
you get your solid-state drive you're
not done there because it turns out
Linux isn't really set up for the kinds
of optimization you would expect but the
state drive out of the box I guess they
do this just for the to make it as
general as as possible okay so I've got
a couple of tweaks that you're going to
want to do and they involve editing your
FS tab file don't follow along on this
one because you don't have a solid state
Oh your FS tab what you can't want to do
first of all is make a backup of it so
let's sudo CP / XE / FS tab and then if
you put braces uh-huh
we can create a backup right there in
one thingy thingy and there we go by LS
/ X u /f s tab
star you'll see I've made a backup of it
which is great so now we want to edit
our FS tab by sudo I'm gonna give Nano
some love because I've been doing so
much man oh no there you know and edit
my FS tab and I've already done these
tweaks I want to walk you through them
here so the the first thing that you
want to do is disable writing the last
access time and the last time the last
time that a directory or a file was
accessed okay if you don't need that I'm
on a single user system I really don't
care when the last time a file was
accessed to think of like every time the
files accessed it has to write this
metadata back to that while it's
constantly turning on the drive yeah and
if we can stop doing that it's gonna
save a lot of juice so to do that what
we do is come over to and we can see
right here here's my mount point for
slash or my main drive and it's ext4 and
what we do is we add no a time no dir a
time and that right there will prevent
access times from being recorded the
other thing that you want to do is
enable trim now trim can be added
what is trim it's just a you know I
don't have all I didn't read up on that
right before this but basically it's a
facility for making hard drives more
efficient of their solid state it's in
Windows but it's to enable it and Linux
basically you just put this management
tool mm-hmm and you just put discarding
next to it I think it has to do with the
way that it writes to the disk the way
that it buffer is its writes but I'm not
positive right off top of my head okay
another thing that we want to do is we
want to tune our sloppiness oh yes swap
enos so I'm familiar with that
so our swap file is the file on a hard
drive that basically acts as virtual Ram
if we can get by without using it or at
least not using swap disk until our
memory is full we can set swap enos to
zero and so to find out how your swap
eNOS is doing first what we want to do
is cat this file here so we're going to
cat /proc slash sis BM / swap eNOS you
can see right here that this is set up
to be 60 yeah this is by default in
Linux Mint 14 that I'm running here what
I want to do is set this to zero very
simply
logged in as root so I'll just echo zero
to that file and then is it so what this
does is this says go ahead and use all
of my memory and then once you run out
of memory then you can start doing start
but don't start using swap all the time
when I even still have free memory yeah
you can find out just by typing in free
you can see right here I've used about
half of my memory Oh interesting
yeah so if you type three you're gonna
see how much memory of use yeah it's
good stuff now let's go back to our FS
tab because there's another thing that
we can do to calm down writing to the
hard drive okay there's another way that
we can use our RAM to really enhance the
power management of our system and that
is our temp FS so on a Linux situation
there's always going to be temporary
space where like log files and other
crap is written too and if you can move
that over from the hard drive over to
RAM it's going to be a lot you know it's
gonna be hitting every time in RAM yeah
the less you can hit the hard drive the
more you're gonna save battery life so
to create the RAM disk for your temp
file system first of all we want to find
out how much you know how much memory we
have and how much we're using so if I do
a DF tech H it's gonna show me that I
have a temp FS here the size of it is
732 Meg's
I've only used one and a half Meg's so I
really haven't used a whole lot oh yeah
yeah so I have a 730 to make one percent
of my mean and slash run now what I'm
going to do is come over to my FS tab
that I have open here and I'm going to
add these values here and you can just
copy these right over and I've got links
in the show notes to what you know all
of this does but basically what we're
gonna say is slash temp yeah do a ram
drive for that use a temp FS and then
here are the options that we're going to
be using we're gonna be using the
default + remember no a time for no
access time so it's not adding that to
the files you can specify a size you
don't have to I've set it to be 512 megs
remember I've only used 1 Meg right and
for the what's really interesting about
this is when you actually set that file
size it's not going to go ahead and
okay 512 megs of your RAM to this temp
FS it's gonna use up two before it
starts like overwriting stuff where we
might have to clear it but so that's
cool because like I just showed you I'm
only using a Meg and then mode one seven
seven seven is just for your permissions
so I've done that four slash temp /var
spool and 4/4 our temp now if you don't
care about log files after we after you
reboot your system you can do the same
thing to slash var slash log considering
this is a single user system yeah I'm
gonna do that if I'm running into
performance problems of running to into
like crashing issues I'll tell comment
that out and then hopefully figure out
what's going on with my system but
that's where your logs would live more
permanently okay okay so we can go ahead
and exit out of our FS tab there now and
so the next thing that I want to talk
about is an awesome utility that we
should all just start running now called
power top so you know get yourself power
top it's sudo apt-get install power top
I've already done that or whatever your
window manager of choice or oh a distro
of choice is and run power top and what
this is showing me here this is so cool
I get to see all of my processes just
like I would see in top in fact here let
me run top in another window next to it
to kind of show you the difference see
top runs it shows me you know what the
process whoops what the process ID is
who the user is and a bunch of other
stuff about the CPU and memory usage
well once you learn how to read it it's
back over to the power top really what
we're interested in is the the
description it says say for example
network interface wlan0 my Wi-Fi it's
using 12 watts
wow it's doing 136 packets per second
cinnamon which is the windowing
environment that I'm unfortunately using
right now is using 2 watts and we can
come down here what's using a watt and
1/2 eth0 so that right there tells me
hey I could probably save a watt and a
half just by disabling my eth0 interface
because I'm not actually even using
Ethernet right yeah so I'll just open a
new tab and sudo if config eth0 down and
if I come back over to power top and hit
R for refresh that hey it just
disappeared
in fact probably using a minuscule
amount but just turned off my Ethernet
and now I saved what you can also see at
the very top here it says 25 watts
that's how much I'm currently using I
really want to get that under 10 it also
says estimated remaining time and
battery is 0 hours and 24 minutes so
Darren get your segment done quick the
reason for that actually is if I come
down here you can barely see it but I
have two batteries in the system one of
them is at 11% the other ones at 100%
so these combined to give me the total
and it's only reading one of them right
now but that's fine for what I really
care about I just want to get my system
using the least amount of watts as
possible and so there's you know lots of
different ways that you can tweak your
system to use as little as possible and
power top is an awesome resource that
you keep coming back to in fact if you
use page up and page down you'll see I
can take a look at you know my CPU usage
you can take a look yeah I can look at
tuneable stats tunable z' is really
interesting because it'll give you a
good bad recommendation on different
stuff like right here enable audio codec
power management I haven't done that and
it's saying it's bad because I haven't
done that so there's a bunch of other
stuff that it can do to make the play
more efficient and power top will tell
you so I love it ok so next up is this
tool called laptop mode and laptop mode
among many was like the Windows laptop
mode it kind of it's it's a daemon in
the background that's like hey I know
that your laptop I've got a bunch of
things that I know that you can do to
use power most efficiently ok and laptop
mode is on most distributions by default
but there's a tool that will allow us to
tweak it now what laptop mode does is
among many other things dealing with IO
it prevents the harddrive from spinning
up constantly every time we're trying to
touch a file now mind you we're using a
salt
Drive which already uses a lot less
power but it does many other things and
so it's definitely useful so to
configure laptop mode you're going to
need laptop mode tools and so let me
come over to another window here and see
I've already apt-get installed laptop
mode tools but again it's just sudo I
have to get install top mode tools if
you haven't already and once you have
that you can go ahead and start
configuring it there's a file in / Etsy
slash laptop mode and it's called laptop
mode conf and we can again give Nano
some love there and you can see all of
the different weeks that you can do in
here like enable laptop modes is set to
one so this tool is enabled I can come
down here and see when it's going to be
enabled like enable it when it's on
battery yes
enable it when I'm on AC power no you
can change whether it's on when you
close the lid and things like that and
there are all of these different modules
like AC 97 Power Save that's a sound
card power save CPU free all of these
different you know modules here and if
you come down here just says enable auto
module is one that means that all of
these are enabled by default you can
really come down here and start reading
all of the things on these and finding
out all of the tweaks that it does but
for the most part out of the box all of
this should be pretty happy now you may
be asking yourself well if I've got a
solid-state drive do I really need
laptop mode tools and it may not be
relevant for your discs but laptop mode
tools also does a whole bunch of other
improvements and even if you do have an
SSD getting your SSD to go into sleep
mode or al PM mode to kick in will
definitely help a little bit you know
you may mileage may vary depending on
your different hardware that you're
using but it's it's not just for hard
drives it covers all sorts of different
io and like I said the AC 97 sounds
stuff so there's I think still a lot of
good reason to be using laptop mode
tools so you can verify it running
really simply by in a terminal if I do
if I cat slash
/ sis / vm / laptop underscore mode I
can see that it's set to a nonzero
integer and that just means that it's
running and we can go ahead and enable
this if it's not already enabled by
doing something like sudo update - our
CD and then you just say laptop - mode
with defaults there you go but I've
already done this so I don't need to
it's telling me that it already exists
this stuff we had just briefly touched
on CPU frequency yeah and this is a huge
one to save yourself some juice now
there's a CPU scaling indicator that'll
allow you to you know check out your
current speed and actually adjust your
speed and then change it to different
kind of profiles like you know high
performance or on-demand or things of
that nature and in order to end CPU
freaked D if it's probably already
installed but a CPU fre QD it's a daemon
that's probably already running is
really cool but it's not the sexiest to
configure for for something like you
know changing my CPU scaling I kind of
want a goo as much as I love the
terminal I like you know coming from a
former Windows world I'd like how on the
windows thing you just click on the
bottom right and change not necessarily
your CPU speed but you can change it
from like high-performance to battery
saving so what I've done is installed a
little awesome applet called indicator -
CPU freak so it's again sudo apt-get
install indicator - CPU F req and I've
already done that and let me show you
how this looks if it's not all once
you've installed that you'll run it by
typing in indicator
- CPU freak and then hidden ampersand to
make it run in the background okay you
can also add this to your startup's
in most distress just type start up and
you'll find where your startup
applications are of course this is we're
talking about gnome here so it may be
different in KDE that said you add your
CPU indicator and now in the bottom
right or for you.your you
it's probably the top right yes I see
this little icon here and if I click
that I can see all of the different
gigahertz I support it right now I'm on
on-demand I mines terrible what are you
at one point - I'm not on demand is
Sears go this is one point you got the
i3 didn't you know it's like three years
old whatever okay well on demand is what
I'm doing and I find it to be so far the
best you can play around with this and
see what kind of different CPU you know
speeds and verses battery life that
you're going to get I really like the
idea that I can specifically come in
here and say I want full 2.9 gigahertz
or I want to go down to 1.2 on demand is
pretty cool because it just says hey
stay as low as possible and then as soon
as the process says that it wants more
well then give it more you know but then
come right back down so I pretty much
leave it right there and I thought
that's an applet that you guys brilliant
that's awesome okay
another one that you can do to really
save a lot of juice here is called is
it's just adjusting your fan speed out
of the box a lot of some of this may be
specific to my ThinkPad how or to
ThinkPads in general however there's a
utility called think fan and think fan
that actually supports some other
machines like from Dell and whatnot so
this might be worth checking out and
seeing if your machines on the list
because what it allows you to do is
change the way that the fan operates by
default in Linux something like that on
my old Acer Aspire yeah back in the day
yeah that's the thing is Linux is by
default it's very much kind of made for
the desktop and yeah a lot of us now are
using laptops and it's not really tuned
for it so that's why we have to go
through a segment like this but it's
just going to be so aggressive on your
fan and really you can kind of tune that
back because if you can specify various
thresholds of temperatures and different
fan speeds you can really get it to one
be a lot less noisy and to stop running
that dang fan and 100% all the time yeah
so one out on my machine one of the ways
that you can find out what your fan is
doing is to cat the
thing under proc and ACPI and then for
mine it's IBM / fan now yours is
probably going to be different but
you'll see that it's enabled here it's
on auto and this is the RPMs that it's
that's spinning at I could also find out
my thermal stuff by AK adding / sis /
devices / virtual / thermal and then
there's a thermal zone zero covers my
laptop and it says it is a directory
what I want to do is there's a temp file
in there that's or it's not a temp file
it's a temperature file I don't know why
I'm so tickled by that okay my whole
life I've had C colon backslash temp and
I've always thought about it as
temporary not temperature but you can
see it is temperature isn't it I'm at 51
degrees Celsius right now okay that's
not too bad okay well I think fan is a
cool utility that's going to allow you
to actually specify the different
thresholds and what speeds to actually
do so sudo apt-get install think fan to
enable it on your machine it really
depends on what machine you have for
mine I have to go in / Etsy slash
modprobe D and I'm going I had to create
this file here called think fan if I
can't think fan Kampf you'll see the
option that I had to give it was you
know think ACPI I think he likes one it
just says hey let me actually get at a
CPI to be able to edit those okay now
with all of that done think fan the
utility has made all of the stuff really
easy as far as actually you know I don't
have to manually sit there and adjust it
based on the temperature it's a daemon
does that so what I can do is configure
it now once you have it installed it's
an Etsy you want a nano or vai or vim or
Emacs your file here called think fan
Kampf and they have a whole bunch of
parameters in here but really what you
care about is where your sensor is now
an older ThinkPads the sensor was in
proc a CPI IBM thermal on mine it
happens to be in this location so again
that's just something you're gonna have
to find for your model but after that
you've got all of these different ways
that you can actually specify
what to do and when so zero through
seven here are the different fans speeds
and the RPMs are really going to differ
based on your model the next numbers are
the low and the high temperature so what
this means is stay in state zero which
is fan not running at all mm-hmm and a
Celsius so don't spin the fan at all
between zero degrees and 55 degrees as
soon as you get to 55 degrees go to fan
speed 1 which is the lowest and stay
there until you drop to 48 degrees at
which point go back up to 0 and then
stay there until you get to 60 at that
point go to 2 and so you see that
they're actually staggered so as soon as
you get back gets back down to 50 it
goes to 1
you can really spend some time tweaking
this there's a on the think wiki org
they have a listing of people like put
you know what values they're using I've
got mine set kind of aggressively right
now I hate the fan noise I'm keeping an
eye on my temperature and and we'll see
but that is another great way you can
save your battery there's one last one
that is or not one last one but there's
another one that is this one was the
biggest for me and it's specific to a
lot of new laptops have both an intel
graphics card or an integrated graphics
card as well as a discreet graphics card
like an nvidia or in a TI yeah i've seen
there's a lot well it used to be a huge
pain in the ass but it's gotten a lot
better lately there's a tool called vga
switcheroo which will allow you to turn
on and off and enable and disable those
different graphics cards and so i've
already actually gone into the bios of
this ThinkPad here and disabled the the
discrete graphics the nvidia graphics it
comes with because i'm not gaming on
this machine if I don't need that
running what it still even though I've
disabled it in the BIOS it is still
actually eating juiced long time yeah
and it made a huge difference so what
you want to do and and all of these
things that I'm saying you want to do
you probably put in your RC local file
in slush in fact all cat slash Etsy such
RC local this is a file basically it's
your startup in fact here's the command
echo off to this file here insist
colonel debug VGA switcheroo switch if I
cat that file right now
oops if I pseudo cat that file right now
you're going to see that discreet is off
well integrated is powered if I hadn't
set off to it if I hadn't echoed off to
sis kernel blah blah say powered it's a
tower and then and it'll be taking up
honey juice it made thing it really did
make a difference that alone doubled my
battery life yeah on this machine that's
crazy yeah which is huge I wonder if I
have one in the background I'm pretty
sure on your little i3 you don't have an
Nvidia graphics your switcheroo file
maybe you can play tux racer Oh scape
for it's a good idea is the other big
thing that you can do if I come back
over to my power top you're gonna see
okay the biggest resource here is my
network interface I can't do a whole lot
about that I have using laptop mode
tools I am it's set up to actually try
to use a lower power mode for Wi-Fi to
set why if I had to sleep more and
things like that but that actually
depends on whether or not the access
point on the other end supports such a
feature in this case it seems like the
hack 5 AP that we have doesn't I'm
running 10 watts so that's just one of
those things I guess I could turn off
Wi-Fi but then it would be online yeah
the other thing though you'll notice is
cinnamon that is the desktop environment
for mint yes yeah yeah well it's either
Monta or cinnamon when you go with mint
but it's using nearly 6 Watts that's
huge right
in fact now it's using 7 one of the
things even at the lower wants to I and
I'm actually booted into the 2d version
of cinnamon so that's another thing that
you can do is you know if you're using
gnome 3 use the 2d version ok there's a
2d version of unity there probably is if
you really want unity but something that
you can do to really use a lot less
power is to use a very lightweight
stripped-down
Desktop Manager kind of like you know
when you boot into Puppy Linux yeah like
I don't want all those god-awful well
one that you can use is I three this is
you know it's a yeah it is in addition
to a Windows environment that looks like
this it's a tiling environment and so
it's pretty cool I'm gonna try this one
out this was recommended to me by drag
warned of kismet so yeah this could be
one potentially for me I love the idea
of a tiling one yeah the other one that
I'm looking at is LXDE it's a
lightweight x11 desktop environment it's
as you can see not necessarily the
prettiest but whatever look when I've
boot up I want to do two things I want
to open Chrome and terminal yes so yeah
that's pretty much all I do on my
computer too so I don't need some sexy
when doing environment yes like cinnamon
and hopefully that you just take care of
five watts that I'm losing right here
cuz man all right so those are then
finally finally if you really want to
get crazy you could do you could go with
watt OS watt OS is a very fast very
lightweight operating system there's six
the release just came out it's based on
Ubuntu 12.04 operating system they claim
it runs great on anything up to 360 or
anything as low as three sixty six
megahertz with 256 Meg's of RAM oh my
god yeah so back in the I don't think
that was nineties yeah late my knees no
no seriously really needs to pee when
did the when did the Pentium come out
the 366 is pretty pentium or first
pentium I think that's first pentium now
I'm gonna say no now first penny one was
ninety what am I thinking or was there a
66 I don't remember
anyway I'm thinking Pentium 2 and the
max with the 400s but regardless 366 is
slow yeah it was like my first gaming
rig for Unreal Tournament 19 I guess
somebody made me use one of those
computers right now I would probably
throw it out the hole
hey not if you're running water less
uh-huh okay so
we should because this seems like I mean
it has built-in stuff like it's got
chromium with Flash supports it's got
you know a audacious player it's got you
know all of the all the basic stuff you
would want in a distro yeah so it seems
like one this could breathe new life
into old machines but also it's
specifically made to be very power
efficient so worst case scenario I might
try just booting into this on a USB
Drive to see what it can do with my yes
alright so I at this point I would love
you guys to send your power management
tips over to feedback at hack 5 org
because I'm trying to get anything I can
get to get the life of this machine to
last longer than myself eventually and
if you send this to me maybe we can do
another round up and I get those out to
everybody so that would be good stuff
alright well in just a bit you're gonna
be getting your encryption on huh I will
