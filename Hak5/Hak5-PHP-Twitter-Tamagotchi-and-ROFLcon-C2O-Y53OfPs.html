to you by the HP mediasmart server
powered by microsoft windows home server
godaddy Netflix and brandy the Dahle
shredder now version 2 point 0
hello and welcome to hack 5 is you
weekly does the technol us i'm darren i
met and i'm shannon and we have an
awesome show for you guys tonight we've
got some interview with uh with our
friend JLo from revision3 the head
honcho CEO man Jim ladderback are as we
like to refer to as J Lo and now we're
talking about all sorts of like new
internet television stuff and whatnot we
were up at the raffle con in New York
City this weekend so if you're not
familiar with it go ahead and check out
the rapha condor dorg see what's going
on there yeah there were a lot more
people than I was anticipating go under
that this was like mad sold out and like
a lot of internet people like exactly if
they said there was Tron guy and there
was a know the guys from felt you should
suck at Photoshop oh you you had did you
get your picture taken with drunk guy no
i didn't did shannon uh yeah oh that's
going up on the west all right oh you
have to do that well you said his suit
was falling apart and I didn't say that
who said that no oh balls note of that
here without all right well apparently
he he needs money for his suit and he
has a plane so how long yeah that's cool
yeah i wish i had a plane I know you
were very envious when I showed you this
yeah I am I want to fly I just to
inflict some ex aww they laid off the
whole flight sim x-team Microsoft how
could you that's right I'm going to
explain the funny thing was is you know
you and I watched a video on the making
of the next flight simulator like they
were already working on it they had huge
boards full of ideas I want to that they
can just take like cuz you know how some
companies have like a non-compete thing
I don't know how legal they are but it's
like you can't for three years after you
work for us do the same thing you what
it's like but that's all I've been
working out that the last ten years
that's all I know you tell me I can't go
work for another flight sim Korea that's
like if you quit hak5 and I said that
you can't work on another video pie
anyway whatever um so oh we actually
have other content for this episode in
addition to the interview with Jim I'm
going to be explaining to you guys what
this is this is a tamagotchi I'm tying
it in with twitter i got some PHP code
for you guys is run with VLC back and
you're gonna love it well we were
supposed to use it for awful con but
those bastages over at rocketboom never
showed up with the projector so yeah we
pretty much called them in there lie
oh yeah by the way we're on our way back
to Boston ah oh well so I think it looks
like a good time yet had a lot of fun
the highlight of the whole weekend there
was NBC yes yeah it's good to have
friends that will take you to the studio
just gotta give John yes oh yeah we
spent pretty much the better part of the
weekend in hoboken and yeah at the 30
Rockefeller is like checking out SNL
stage and and Rachel Maddow's stage and
like you and I got to sit in Conan
O'Brien's chair oh my god behind his
desk physical and so it's just these
little star on the stage and be like
what a mark I stand where Conan's Dan
all right so it's pretty epic I'm gonna
stop fan bullying but unfortunately no
pictures what the only thing we got a
shot of some carpet but ya know I've got
a tradition we've got a foot shots I've
got a shot of how crazy their network
ceilings are was ridiculous hmm yeah i
thought i thought i've seen some data
centers and anyway um so Shannon what's
going on with LAN parties our land party
is coming up this week actually on
saturday Saturday january thirty first
we're going to be playing battlefield
two and you can play with us over at be
of two dot hack five dot work so
definitely join in the game I gotta say
I'm pretty excited and I hear you can
get bf2 for pretty cheap these days so
if you don't have it yet like me sorry
guys then definitely go get it complete
and I also want to thank our sponsor the

got a little bit of a tamagotchi going
off on over there some Oh Tamagotchi yes
God thanks Shannon now when we were
approached by the whole r awful thing
people about coming up and doing the
event one of the things that they asked
us to do is see if we could put together
some sort of interactive media
installation for the after party and
that's hot oh dude what would be better
than like taking the technology of the
USB missile on turn putting paint balls
in it and then the lawyers really didn't
think it was a good idea so what we
ended up with was harnessing the amazing
power that is Twitter and finally using
it for what it is intended to and that
is to control a tamagotchi we all
remember those lovable little digital
pets I'm really going to use this as an
example to show you guys some code
techniques that you can do I'm
particularly using PHP and VLC is my as
my delivery mechanism but i'm sure you
guys might learn something so let's get
right into it this is really where it
all begins I've got a video folder here
full of all of these AV eyes that are
created just using Photoshop and a
little bit of Sony Vegas action and it's
this cute little character here and then
they can do different things like you
can dance or I can make them sleep stuff
like that so great I got a tamagotchi
now how do I control them so I wanted
people to be able to tweet something and
then have a program that would just like
look for special tweets and then tell
VLC my presentation mechanism
to change the video clips the coolest
thing about VLC is that it has an HTTP
interface in it that allows you to
control what's being displayed over the
web so if I come down here and a so the
first part of this is this command right
here so I just going to start VLC and
i'm going to point it at this directory
here where my videos are and the TAC
interface HTTP with the full screen and
then I want it to repeat each clip so
I'll go to going to go ahead and do that
right and it fires up and here's my
little Tamagotchi guy and he's just
doing whatever the first video was this
he's going to blink here and that's
video number one Idol blink if i head
over to the HTTP interface at 127 0201
it by defaults on port 8080 and it's a
beautiful little interface here but the
problem is everything is in like
JavaScript it's all web two point oh
it's beautiful but I can't really easily
interact with it from the command line
so what I want to do and this is the
greatest thing about VLC is they kept
the deprecated HTTP interface in the
package you go to slash old and we've
got a different interface this is the
old interface and what we see here is
the playlist see I just specify the
directory so it's going to put
everything the AV eyes in this playlist
and if I hover over these I can see down
here in the bottom left that that what
it's really going to do if i click on
this idle cry here is it's going to pass
the parameter control equals play and
item equals 6 great so I can do the same
thing and I think this is still playing
yet still playing here so I can pull up
a command prompt here and he's sitting
there doing his thing let's find a video
let's see let's tell him that he needs
to fight so that would be control equals
play an item equals 11 so in my prompt
here I'm just going to use curl and
coral is just a command line program
that'll allow you to do to hit up web
pages and stuff and it's similar to W
get I'll have links to more information
about curl but suffice it to say
we say curl with 127 20 20 21 because
it's where a web server is on port 8080
slash old and we're going to use the
tech d option to say control equals play
and the tech d option with item equals
11 tech g and whatever dot exe great so
it goes ahead and does that and bam our
video changes so now we've got a little
not kind of like ryu inspired Tamagotchi
action so now the question is how are we
going to take this and extend it to the
web and this is where i start my my
programming code gets a little bit nasty
but that's ok follow along and feel free
to criticize me on the forms but we're
going to start abusing search twitter
com so let's come over here to search
twitter com I've gone ahead and created
a query careful roffle bot that's what
I'm naming the little damn creature so
I'm going to be just looking for tweets
that involve the name brothel bot and if
I just do that at search for twitter com
I get this great little result and I can
also get a feed for this query you can
see squeegee here has already been
playing with it so I've got this well
chrome renders it all nasty but that's a
beautiful little RSS feed otherwise and
I can pull that I can pull that that RSS
feed using a beautiful little PHP class
called Magby RSS and mag p RSS is used
in a lot of different open source
applications most notably wordpress to
handle all of its RSS features so let me
take a look at the code here all we have
to do to invoke Maggie RSS is make sure
that we have the package directory and
the route where our code is and then do
a require once here for the RSS fetch
include and then I do to other things
down here that make this work and that
is to tell Maggie RSS not to cash
anything you see if we were to cash
stuff then we really wouldn't get new
results every time we pull the RSS feed
and more than our Twitter Tamagotchi
really wouldn't be doing much good would
it um so then I've got a little loop
counter here that I use to to do some
idle stuff and everything pretty much
lives inside of this while here this
while loop is just going to do whatever
I tell it's going to do all this stuff
as until of course the
title of the RSS the parameter that it
passed to Twitter if you will is pound
raffle bot asterisk ask exit asterisks
so that's like the kale command right so
then down here all I really have to do
with mag p is these couple of lines down
here which say okay this is the URL of
what I want to query and that's like I
showed you the the RSS feed from source
to Twitter and then we're only looking
for the first item and this is the idol
thing that I told you guys about I've
got a if here if the loop count is over
32 go ahead and randomly pick a new
action for the guide to do because what
I envisioned was this was going to be
projected on the wall at the after party
and if somebody twittered him and told
him to eat I didn't really want him just
stuff in his face until like I don't
know the cows come home so I said after
30 which would be about five minutes
because i looped this with a ten-second
sleep then then it would go here and
just use rmd to this function rd and you
give it two parameters and it picks
randomly a number between those two and
then based on that i'll tell the Tama
guides you what to do but really all the
magic comes down here where I go through
and I you know parse the RSS and I'm
just using a switch in a case here the
switch being a dollar title that is the
variable for what I actually receive
from Twitter the the RSS it's an RSS
you've got your like title you've got
description you've got the published
date and stuff like that really what
we're interested is title and we say hey
case if roffle ba if the case is ruffle
bot dance then I want you to pass this
youth system to pass this curl this you
know i'm going to say see URL in the
command prompt and tell it you know
control equals play an item equals 10
and I've gone ahead and made sure to
correspond all of the different item
numbers with all of the different
actions that I wanted to do and I've got
a couple of you know this is this is
really down and dirty I'm not even you
know if somebody uses different case
it's not going to really respond well
with this so if somebody had like an
uppercase D and dance I didn't bother
going ahead and making it pretty but i'm
sure you guys could on the forms and
then we reset my loop counter because
it's gone head
done its thing and that's pretty much it
i just got to have another case and a
break for every action that he does it's
about a dozen little actions and and
then at the end here I just sleep for 10
seconds and I'd do it again i increased
the loop counter and and that's it so
you know that is basically it's just
combination of videos VLC with an HTTP
interface and PHP using the mag p RSS
and then i'm just using the system
command to tell ceorl to press the
button over on the old VLC interface and
now we can interactively play with our
Tamagotchi bought i'll go ahead and
start them up here again actually I'd
closed the VLC interface what I have to
do is come here and two min page until
plc to shut down and that went hadn't
happened and i'm going to start him
again alright so i'm going to pretend
he's full screen for just a moment and
i'll bring up my twitter and i'm going
to say ruffle bot oops too many l's
roffle bot fail i'm going to tweet that
from my zoo my god no WTF account if i
go back here and my PHP whoops i need to
invoke my PHP oops alright so I've got
that running and so anyway to invoke the
PHP we just run PHP with the file rather
than actually going to it like from a
web page we just invoke it from the
command line and this is what it looks
like it just sits here and it says oh it
found fail and zero and it's going to
wait 10 seconds and then it's going to
keep going and going until you know
either somebody else to do something
different or five minutes goes by and
then I randomly select something else to
do so there we go we have a tamagotchi
that is failing just as epically as my
code so if you guys would like to check
out the source code it is up on the
forms a hack five org slash forms I
welcome your criticism and i hope you
you know picked up something from this
so uh you know hit me up give me some
feedback i'd love to hear what you guys
think of my epic code so now we are i'm
just going to go ahead and kick it back
over to Shannon see what's going on land
party before we talk to Jim all right so
last week's trivia was during initial
rdp key exchange this
server sends the client a certificate
where is this certificate stored and
this was correctly answered by Beasley

49 when you check out using the code h
AK 3 next step i think we're going to be
talking to mr. jello but first we're
going to be taking a break
so you were just recently had a whole
bunch of uh television conferences right
what's the feel they're all so these
were a lot of guys from the cable world
likes to the old world and they're
trying to figure out what's going to
happen to them as their businesses go
away so there are people from broadcast
and cable and they're there it life is
tough for them because less and less
people are watching more and more ad
dollars are moving over to the Internet
and even though a lot of people still
watch broadcast a lot of people watch
cable it's less and the less people
watch the less money they make so what's
going to be their final doom their final
doom I I you know I don't see them going
away I completely all of them but I
think what we'll see is a fewer of them
and more choices so the big cable nets
are still going to be there ESPN always
going to be any SPN even if you have to
pay five bucks a month to stream it over
the Internet they'll still be an ESPN
but some of the smaller marginal cable
networks I would worry about so I mean
not to name any names but I will like
the wisdom network or the hallmark
channel but but isn't that what this is
all about is that we can scratch these
little niches how is that any different
on cable well on cable you look at your
expenses you've got to get satellite
transponders who's got to shoot your
signal up into the sky and back down you
got to pay big money to you know dag the
bounty hunter whoever they've got going
on there the Internet yes your
distribution costs are lower and you can
actually do smaller niches profitably
well I first started doing ZD TV I start
going these cable conferences you know
chance I used to go to tech conferences
i was going to cable conferences and
this guy would always come up and he was
like yeah i would like take the mic
during Q&amp;amp;A of the sessions i was doing
and start talking about the puppy
channel it's like I'm doing the puppy
channel and I'm gonna put that out on
cable and it's gonna be all puppies all
the time this is his course before
YouTube yeah well this was before yeah
before well internet video was like a
160 160 postage stamp five frames a
second so he couldn't be on the internet
but the puppy channel is an ideal thing
for the internet because you can put it
out you can stream it and people are
going to watch and you know what's the
number one thing that people are
watching now on the homepage you stream
it's that stupid dog yeah there's
there's puppies at matts in love with I
don't think he's going to get the money
to buy them yeah well and you know you
guys you
got a cat in your basement you got 50
people watching that it's something a
little more elaborate than basement
thank you I know cat house that that's
what we are now calling it the cathouse
the hack has just didn't ring so um
you've branding even online video needs
to brand all right well you've been
recently talking on your blog about the
dirty little secrets and numbers you
want to share anything with me about
that yeah well um so here's what happens
the when you watch a television program
on TV or you know you got Nielsen and
they will tell whether you watched or
not online there's a group called the
IAB which is the advertising standard
board for websites and measurement and
all that and a view of a video online
you can count it according to the IB if
you watch it for three seconds and
here's what happens here's what people
are doing so on a website you know you
go to any website in the video autoplay
is you know it's so annoying all of a
sudden starts auto-playing and you know
you may go because you want to find a
recipe or you want to find news or you
want to get some particular piece of
hacking lore but all this in a little
video is auto-playing you don't even
know where it is and you got to search
around for it and maybe it's down below
the fold well by the time you find it
and make the stupid things shut up more
than three seconds have gone by and
that's a view that's a video of you so
there are people out there who are
putting these videos out and like we've
got five million views a month you know
because they're auto playing on a site
that gets five million pageviews say but
who actually counts these I mean what
are the sites that count three seconds
as of you everybody like like YouTube
revver blip Jesus so many of them now
yeah absolutely that's the all of them
because that's the IAB standard actually
I was talking to one side who will
remain nameless one of these sharing
sites and I was talking about the
three-second rule and they said oh I
just I kind of you when somebody clicks
play they don't even counted it three
seconds so the reason why I think this
is a problem is because if you have a
sponsor an advertiser in there and they
happen to show up you know in the latter
part of the video you know anywhere
that's not in the first three seconds
there you're claiming to them that
somebody's seen their ad when they
haven't what that means is that i may go
to you let's say you're I don't know
samsung and you've advertised on one of
our shows and you say I want to get
want my message to be seen a million
times and I'm like okay I'll do it and
if it's just that three seconds and
people don't see the message the
response is going to be terrible don't
look at that and they'll say gosh this
internet video stuff just isn't working
because i'm not getting people coming to
my website i'm not selling anything and
i'm just not going to support internet
but we're not talking about direct
download here we're talking about the
flash player that's embedded in the
website now flash is amazing piece of
technology because we get all sorts of
interesting stats about when the drop
off was and and all sorts of interesting
things about people's playing habits so
don't we know if they tuned out in three
seconds yes we do yeah we still can as a
view that's what the IAB says of you is
and they're the end estare the standard
you know the advertising what so there's
there's a lot of the upshot of it is and
it's not just the three-second rule
there's a lot of funny business going on
with Internet views and what we found is
we talked to various different people is
that when we talk to people they tell us
what their views are we generally cut it
by about a factor of four or five to
figure out what actually they're really
getting raised like multiplying her age
by 1.5 something like that yeah get to
use an analogy anyway so um you've also
been talking about reach and and and
depth it and what are these metrics
what's going on so here's why people
want those numbers to be so high because
advertisers typically buy ads based on
something called reach and frequency so
reach means how many people see my
message so and frequency is how often do
they see that message that's why if you
watch football or sports you've seen
probably more cores like commercials and
you ever want to see in your life
because they want to reach all the
football fans and they want to have that
message ingrained in their head over and
over again the trouble with internet
video is because the numbers are not as
high as people are claiming it isn't as
big as traditional television it doesn't
have that reach now if you have a core
group 100,000 viewers or somewhere
around there you can certainly hit them
with frequency over and over again but
if you can't hit a million two million
ten million people that's what that's
what the advertisers traditionally want
so that's why some of this funny number
business i think is happening but what
we found is that when it comes to
internet video there's a third dimension
so you remember your old high school of
mathematics or you the xboxes and the
y-axis there's a z-axis which is depth
of experience now when you look at a
a banner on the web you're not going to
a depth of experience at all it's going
in one eyeball and out the other when
you see a 30-second ad on television
typically you see it but you know it may
if it's funny it'll make you laugh but
it's not going to make a huge can't do
that much in 15 or 30 seconds I mean but
with internet video and you know this
when you have a sponsorship your fans
love you guys they watch they you guys
are well let's not go too far okay some
of them do okay well there they they
trust you and they believe in you and
they enjoy watching and spending time
with you guys so when you guys or any of
the internet video programs that we do
do sponsorships there's a depth of
experience where they trust you and even
though it's really clear that it's a
sponsorship and yes there's a quid pro
quo these guys are paying so that we can
put these shows on the air that time
spent with those products or services
whether it's GoDaddy or budweiser or
whatever it is is much deeper and
there's a factor that because you guys
are talking about it the audience is
more likely to wake up and be like well
pay attention to that at least I may not
ever buy a zune but at least all I'll
hear them out and so so what are some of
the factors that you use to measure
depth a couple of different things I
mean it's hard to measure oh but how
long is the how long is the spot how
much do they do they talk about the
product but also you can look at
mentions on twitter or facebook or other
social nets to see if a conversation is
starting and if its continuing so we do
this a lot of times where will you know
we'll look at a brand and the show so
and then we'll just track conversations
online to see if that conversation
needle was moved and most the times it
was so you know whatever it is we know
that when people people are watching it
on hak5 or diggnation or tekzilla or
whatever they are then talking about
their experiences with the brand and
sharing it with their friends online
it's now the question everybody's mind
when is the gym ladderback show coming
well I I you know it's kind of hard to
run a company I'm sweating a lot of time
come on deals for the win when we use
these I don't know what we'll see that
but I did just get this this is my it's
actually going to come all the time
because this is a new HD flip camera
that I got I bought it myself so this is
my flip this no it's Kodak it's
kodak and it's HD and you know it's got
the little it's got the little pop-out
USB and i'm still playing around with it
like you don't want to do this and shake
it around cuz it's HD but so i figure
i'm just going to do it anytime so this
is it this is the beginning of the
little myspace shot action going on more
like you too but i don't really do that
myspace ok so what you going to start
live streaming yeah i'm going to be
streaming my life at HD I got what I'm
gonna get a little iJustine thing it was
stuff it right here I think you would
look great with a with a camera mounted

his head gear on I am ready to life cast
my life great now you're gonna go
lifecast you bind any drink right uh
yeah and i'll be able to use this as a
record so i can expense it perfect
alright guys so that about wraps it up
for this episode of hak5 but we do have
a viewer question for you and we also
have some information about the next
convention that we're going to but first
of all I want to thank our sponsor

and please don't forget the www and our
question and rewrites 2feedback at hak5
org if you want to ask questions as well
is there a way to change the IP address
of the windows command line boys the
gangers wanted to know if we can change
the IP address of windows from the
command line kind of similar to the way
we do it over on linux with like
ifconfig and whatnot yeah i think a lot
of people are familiar with using IP
configs to do your release and renew if
you're doing dhcp but you can actually
specify an IP address from the command
line using net sh so i've got links in
the show notes to the exact commands and
whatnot but netted h is a great little
utility you can you can specify your IP
address you can even configure your
firewall so this is a great little tool
that if you're doing systems
administration you want to roll out some
doohickeys get your scripting on net SH
is the way to do it thank you for the
question Andrew that would be pretty
epic what to go through like a reappear
entire network and create some script
auto increment and then it no no I need
to do this i just realized cuz i'm on a
192 i need to move my company over to a
172 or attend that something right and i
could just put a batch script that would
say at the stroke of midnight on this
date BAM and then I've got everything
already mapped so I don't have to go to
me oh that's all Wow mid-show but how is
that going to work because you cuz i
tell the batch script to check you know
the date and then you know running the
door or I schedule it with apps but how
are you going to specify multiple
computers I'll roll it out to all the
computers beforehand it's just a
scheduled task you type right space
whatever
time space you know this thing and then
you run this batch file that will change
the specific you know it's sent years
but you're specifying an IP in the
script yeah and you're rolling it out to
multiple computers now can you force an
update well you can wear any with it
anyway somebody's but the end that's
half of its done half of its done all
right so uh yeah that just blew my mind

wrap this up well first of all I gotta
give it up and give a little bit of
titanal less love into the dig real it's
the show that features the funniest
viral videos on the web this week host
Andrew Bancroft is on vacation but we've
got a couple of guest co-hosts that you

Rose are filling it catch what they
think about some of the top dog videos
of the week the digg reel is served up
weekly on mondays at three pm eastern
guys as usual we're reminding you to
trust your Tecna lest see it
I mean seriously how many chances will I
get to ride a ferris wheel that involves
my little pony squeegee wrote in a limo
with us back to hoboken yes we G did and
then we ditched him after we got bangla
why did we not get a picture of squeezy
with us in a limo and now oh we're
pretty drunk on New York I mean ok so
we're here hacking in hoboken and i just
thought i'd give you a quick little tip
it turns out if you leave your laptop
overnight doing smack injection and
doing a little bit of air dump um you
just want to make sure that maybe you
have like an external hard drive like
500 gig or something like that because
it turns out after about 13 million
packets I'm getting a cute little error
here called fwrite packet data failed no
space left on device so just the tip to
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
