domain.com today i am following up on an
episode of hack tip virtual machines 101
with virtual box today we'll be mashing
up two of my new favorite tools multi
boot USB drives and virtual machines now
while back on hacked if we played with
VirtualBox and a Linux distro I was able
to get a bun to running on my Windows
laptop with pretty much no problems and
a few weeks ago on hack 5 I demonstrated
how to build a multi boot USB Drive with
expert I loved these multi boot USB
drives as they save you money and space
on your keychain allowing you to earn
multiple ISOs and your favourite boot
CDs like off crack Clonezilla Puppy
Linux all from onedrive check out hack 5
episode 9 24 all that sort of info of
course when you're making these multi
boot USB drives there are some trial and
error in the process and let's be honest
rebooting is a total drag if only we can
boot a virtual machine off a USB Drive
well you can't not directly anyhow but
what we can do is turn a USB Drive into
a file a VMDK which as we learned last
week our virtual machine hard disks
download and install VirtualBox version
4.0 point 6 if you haven't already and
hit the key combo windows key + R to
bring up the run dialog now I say 4.0
point 6 because if you download the
newest version of VirtualBox it's
probably not going to work whenever you
try to boot from a VMDK they did
something in the update of the recent
version that just kind of messed it up
so just go back a couple of months on
the website and download 406 now I'm
going to go into Windows key R and go
into run Disk Management which I already
have pulled up here and bring it up on
this one so this is going to pull up
your disk management tool this tool is
built into Windows and is generally used
to do things like format partition and
delete parts of your hard drive but you
can also see and mess around with your
USB drives as well so if you scroll down
you can find your USB stick - the drug
that I recently made into a ume multi
bootable drive on an episode of hack tip
so I'm looking here it looks like it's
one called multiboot fdisk number 2
number 2 is actually very very important
in the future of this segment so now you
want to open the command prompt again by
holding Windows key R and then typing in
CMD and starting to run it as an admin
and then hit enter so I've got mine
pulled up here and you're going to type
in CD space program files with the
backslash or a cool backslash virtualbox
and it enter so this brings up the
VirtualBox folder and then you're going
to type in this really really long piece
which I'm just going to copy from the
pen drive Linux website because it's a
lot easier so I'm going to go to pen
drive Linux which gives you an awful
awful nice version of the steps as well
and go right here where it's bold copy
that over to my command prompt ok so I
put in the box manage internal commands
file name user profile which is snobs
for myself
VirtualBox UN USB dot VMDK physical disk
drive is number two which we figured out
earlier from disk management and I'm
changing USB I'm just gonna change it to
USB to be M D K because I already
created one already I don't want it to
try to override it or give me an error
because there's already one existing and
then I press enter created successfully
ok cool now that you've done the really
hard part you want to start up
VirtualBox as an admin as well and
create a new virtual machine new and
click Next when prompted for a virtual
hard disk make sure that you check use
existing hard disk and select the USB
number to VMDK and I'm gonna call this
USB 2 VMDK
and I'll give it a little bit more
memory why not use existing browse to
USB 2 VM DK click open click Next and
hit finish
once you finish creating your new
virtual machine you're ready to try it
out so hopefully why it's gonna work
I've got VirtualBox open and I'm about
to try booting off my USB Drive in the
virtual machine so I'm going to press
Start and after waiting a few minutes it
should boot off my new VMDK so let's see
if it works
press Start ok I am booted off of my
multi boot VMDK or my multi boot USB as
a brand new made VMDK this is awesome
it's a great way to get around having to
restart your computer every time that
you want to test out a USB bootable
Drive coming up soon will be answering
your viewer questions but first let's
take a break and then check in with
Darin for the nibble if you want to
build a video site or if your website's
got a play button I totally recommend
getting yourself a dot TV domain you see
a dot TV website lets you showcase your
original content and create a unique
site not just another YouTube channel
just go on over to domain.com and search
for the perfect TV domain or your new
idea then use the coupon code hak5 at
checkout to save an extra 15% and if you
need hosting for your new TV website
don't forget about domain coms web
hosting plans they start at less than 6
bucks a month and have everything you
need to build maintain even promote your
site remember when you think domain
names think domain.com got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com
semicolons aren't just for C++ compilers
you know or Winky faces I guess anyway
in bash they can be used to string
together a set of commands for example
say you wanted to start downloading an
archive with W get and then extract it
when the download completes you just do
your W get blah blah blah and then
semicolon thar xvg blah blah blah
whatever it was you wanted to do and
then what would happen is as soon as one
thing completes the next thing would
start I mean sometimes I know like a
background process like a render job is
going to take an hour and I want to
upload the resulting file afterwards so
what I'll do then is actually string
together like this I'll say sleep 3,600
semicolon upload SH file MOV or whatever
it is right so in this case the sleeps
man will actually wait the specified
amount of seconds which is 3,600 for an
hour anyway once I'm free hack five swag
