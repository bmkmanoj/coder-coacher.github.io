command and this hack tip is brought to
you by Eero welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are talking about the find command so
one of my viewers reach down in Twitter
and asked have you done an episode on
the fine command and I was like I am now
so here is your fine command episode sir
it's sort of like locate and grep but
find it just happens to be well pretty
powerful I mentioned it in a previous
episode but it does make sense to repeat
it here locate depends on an ever
changing database so it is fast but it
is dependent fine searches on the fly
and you can specify search criteria it
is slower but it can do a lot more than
locate can so let's go through some of
the options that are most useful well at
least I consider them most useful with
find so find searches recursively
through directories starting with the
top directory and on down so you can
simply type something like this find dot
tack name and I'm gonna use wallpaper 2
dot PNG is an example and this will find
my wallpaper PNG file
how exciting now if I type something
similar find dot tack name wallpaper
with no two dot PNG after it it won't
find anything because I did not include
any kind of wildcard after it so it was
expecting to find something specifically
called wallpaper another thing to keep
in mind find includes folders because
folders are also considered files so to
add a wild-card
you just gotta stick it in quotes
something like this I would type in find
dot tech name wallpaper add asterisk and
then close out those quotes okay so this
will find all of my files that have
wallpaper in the name in this case using
the dot tells fine that I want to use a
relative path for output you could also
use a forward slash which tells it to
use an absolute path instead so I if I
did that
go ahead and try testing it okay so that
found a lot of information so I think
I'll just clear that out and stick with
the period instead because it's much
easier to understand on camera at least
so we're going to stick with the period
next up you can search by ownership so
to do this you simply type in something
like find tack user and I'm gonna use
myself as an example
hit enter alright so this will find
everything that is owned by that user
alternatively if you have another user
that you want to search under or if you
want to find anything that is not owned
by snubs you can add a exclamation point
right after the period and then hit
enter and it's not gonna find anything
because I own everything on this system
so no surprise there but this is going
to search for files that are owned by
anyone that is not snubs
in this case so this can be super useful
if you need to change the ownership of
files with CH owned for example and I
spoke previously on CH owned in a
previous hack tip now you can't do the
same thing with groups as well you
simply take instead of putting user you
would change that to a group so I'll
type in Group and for this example I
don't have a lot of groups on this
machine I'll just use Samba share and I
don't think it'll find anything actually
I'll use the exclamation so that is
going to find everything that is not in
the Samba share group because just so
happens I don't have anything in the
Samba share group right now but if I did
want to find something that has a group
that I need to change I can simply go on
from there and use chgrp which is
changed group for anything that's in the
wrong group now I will give you a few
more examples to find right after this
break when you're looking to improve
your wireless network making sure that
your entire home has a strong signal is
a definite must that's where Iiro comes
in they are launching the very first
second generation mesh Wi-Fi system that
comes with one ear oh and one to two
beacons
these are mesh access points they're not
extenders they're much smaller than the
originals they plug into an outlet they
have an ambient nightlight in case you
got to get up in the middle of the night
and they are more powerful than the
originals as well but if you already
have the original Eero devices that
totally cool too gyro has your back
these babies are backwards compatible
and they can be purchased separately so
systems start at 399 for all of the
components together but if you just want
to buy one beacon to add-on you totally
can and those are 149 each we've gotten
a chance to test these in the warehouse
so I can honestly say our Wyatt Wireless
usually does not reach from one end to
another but the ero mesh does a really
great job of fixing that headache and
giving me the speeds that I pay for from
my ISP plus it's very easy to set up
it's really reliable to gyro is also
announcing the ero Plus subscription
which includes advanced network security
monitoring supplementing the features
that are already built in that you get
for free with the device and content
filtering which is also really great for
houses with kids now with any system you
get automatic updates you get two-factor
authentication for your admin access you
get eros backing with a bug bounty
program and they also do third party
audits which is awesome we also have a
coupon code for you for free overnight
shipping to the US or Canada you can
visit eurocom and at checkout select
overnight shipping enter hack tip ehh a
tip to make it free check it out and
learn more at eurocom we are now back
with find so next up is searching by
file size this can be super useful if
you're looking for a larger file on your
computer maybe to save some room you
want to find some files to delete or you
want to find a specific video that you
would download it or something like that
so to do this you simply type in find
period tack size so I'm changing that to
size this time and I'm gonna use an
example that's very specific
8:54 k in my case so that doesn't show
anything why that is because it's
looking for a file that is exactly that
file size and I don't have anything that
is exactly that file size if I want to
find anything that's larger than 854
kilobytes I can add the plus right in
front of the number and that will find
anything that is larger than that 854
kilobytes I could also do the same thing
if I want to find anything smaller with
a minus instead of a plus and of course
we're going to find a lot of info there
so let's stick to plus and stuck because
it's a great example
the K in this case stands for kilobytes
that's probably very obvious then we
also have a B for 512 byte blocks that's
the default so if you don't put a letter
after your number it's good just gonna
stick with 512 byte blocks C is 4 bytes
B you itës k is 4 kilobytes an
uppercase M is 4 megabytes and an
uppercase G is 4 gigabytes I don't think
they have anything 4 terabytes yet we'll
see in the near future comment below if
they do but I'm pretty sure they don't
lastly for today I also wanted to touch
on the type option so type allows you to
look for a specific file type be it a
regular file a symbolic link directory
or whatever it might be so remember that
everything on a UNIX system is a file in
some way shape or form I covered this
really early on in my series of Linux
hack tips so check out our YouTube
playlist playlist for those older
episodes so to do this I can use find
again I'll type in find dot tack type
and I'm gonna use D to see all of the
directories start that are currently
available on my computer if you want to
search for file types in a specific
directory you can also do that by
changing the period to the directory
name so instead I could type in
something like let's see if this works
I think it's like that yeah test so test
for slash we'll find test and then test
2 which is the second directory that is
inside of there you can also take it a
step further by sorting a long list and
to do this you would type in I'm gonna
use that example again and add a pipe so
I'm typing that command over to sort and
this is going to sort it so now you'll
see this patreon stuff folder at the
very end well you see my hack 5 stuff
folder way at the top cool I'll tell the
- a few more things you can do with find
on the next episode in the meantime
practice these get handy with them be

got some good info out of this episode
until then I want to hear your feedback
