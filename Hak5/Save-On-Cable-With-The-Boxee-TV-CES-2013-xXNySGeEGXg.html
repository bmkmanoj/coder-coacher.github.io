go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2013 a digital
experience and I'm here with will at
foxy TV I got to give you a hug
we love you guys let's we do we chat
with you guys every single year now I've
heard about this Boxey TV I haven't seen
it in person and I've been wanting to
and finally I get to see it tell me
about this baby well this is the Boxee
TV device here we announced it in
October I believe and it's now live it
went live in November first with Walmart
is our exclusive retail partner which we
were very excited about and what we've
actually done here is we've created the
first cloud DVR
you've got coaxial cable the coaxial
port at the back which actually has two
tuners connected to it you connect an
antenna which we provide one of the box
or alternatively you can connect it to
the wall outlet for clear qualm and from
there with the antenna especially you
can actually record two TV shows at once
send them up into the cloud and then
pull them down on your laptop on your
tablet or your other device and on top
of that we can also place shift so you
can actually watch near live TV in
another location away from your home so
you know if you were traveling overseas
or you're on the bus with access to LTE
so so it's really great and then on top
of that we also give people access to
all the best internet apps including
Netflix and Vudu YouTube etc cost $99
and with that $99 you get three months
free cloud DVR in the available marks
we've got nine markets open at the
moment and then after those of those
three months it's only $10 a month which
is which is very aggressively priced
that's awesome that's so much better
than the cable that I normally pay at
home on Comcast so I'm pretty sure you
just ran through everything I was going
to ask you including the price so I
don't have to have cable to actually use
this I could just you could just use a
regular antenna so we provide one in the
books but we also recommend
if you're not in an area that gets great
reception you can also purchase another
antenna we recommend the mo who leave
but there's also other ones that you can
put on top of your on top of your roof
like a clear stream but the best thing
to do would be to go to antenna web
first just to see what channels you
should be able to get in your location
and that will help you make a informed
buying decision and you have Netflix and
Hulu Plus on here and all those awesome
applications that we all love I wonder
is revision3 on here yet there's no
revision3 at the mote but we are here
that we are very very close to the
application being ready it may have even
been approved but yeah we'll be
launching very soon so does it have
wireless already pre-installed in it or
do I have to have an actual inline
Ethernet yes so this has Wireless
anything it included and the great part
about it is it still has many of the
features from the regular boxee box even
though we've gone in a different
direction it'll still play a most of
your local files as well do I have to
have an actual cable box to use this or
can I just replace it with this no you
don't need a cable box in fact you know
although some may choose to keep it for
live sport and other and other things
that you can't get with TV you know 89
other top 100 shows are available over
broadcast and you can get them all for
free with Boxey TV dude you just saved
me so much money I I'm kind of like in
love with this new product and where can
I find this because I'm gonna go out and
buy one like right now so best place at
the moment to finally is either at
Walmart go into a local brick-and-mortar
store or alternatively boxy TV is the
best place probably boxy TV you can
actually enter in your zip code and it
will tell you whether you're in a DVR
market and then from there you can
basically go and purchase the TV and
antenna if you need a more powerful
internal than one we provide and also
HDMI cables because they are important
to set them up to the TV no HDMI cable
included cable in the Box note but we do
provide a really cool antenna which as
you'll see is very snazzy indeed yes
even Eustace the point of things is a
pointer absolutely thank you so much
William it's been a pleasure chatting
with you and with hak5 again I'm Shannon
and you can find all of our information
and more CES coverage at revision3.com
I'm here at the Ford booth at CES 2013
with Edie
how you doing ahead and asean and we're
checking out the TDK what is a beauty
can just do an sdk was ready to be cash
Tbk is a technology development kit that
developers can get for you know app link
enabling their abs instead of you know
buying a vehicle or if they already have
one they can use an existing one so this
is a TDK you basically have all the same
interfaces as you would a normal vehicle
you got the screen you got a center
stack with all the different buttons
pre-sub on sport bag as well as some
moss car simulation toggles so you can
turn the car off open doors set it to go
forward and reverse have it parked or
not part so what kind of partners have
you guys I teamed up with to enable apps
to come to 40 right so I mean everybody
knows you know a lot of the music
streaming apps like Pandora air radio -
slacker NPR we also did some navigation
base apps
scout from TeleNav we have our own sink
destinations and we'll be at bat a whole
slew of more coming out you know every
every few months awesome working our
hackers find a developer network to
start coding up some awesome stuff
things are pretty easy just like
everything else developer 4.com there we
go all right and with all of that I want
to thank once again Ford for powering
our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
