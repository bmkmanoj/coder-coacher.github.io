drives in linux and this hack tip is
brought to you by Eero welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Shannon Morrison today we are
mounting exFAT drives in Linux now
before I get started make sure to hit up
hak5 org slash RSVP for our October 20th
launch event in San Francisco we're
gonna be announcing new products tickets
are limited but the first 100 guests
will get something new from hack 5 for
free and again that was hack 5 org slash
RSVP now onto today's segment so today
we are chatting about mounting exFAT
drives which can lead to some
complications within Linux
once you fix the problem though you
shouldn't have any issues after that so
let's get right into the fix and then
after the break I will actually go into
explaining why this happens now if I
pull up my computer here and I'm gonna
go ahead and stick this flash drive into
the port there we go I'm gonna wait a
few seconds and then ok this error pops
up it says unable to mount Riker that's
the name of my flash drive because Star
Trek error mounting dev SDA one at media
snubs breaker command line Mountain dash
T exFAT tak o exited with non zero exit
status 32 Mountain unknown file system
type exFAT bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
okay we get the point it didn't work in
newer Linux operating systems though you
can easily fix this error by pulling up
your terminal and then typing in sudo
apt-get install expect - feos exFAT -
utils now you just have to wait a few
seconds follow the prompts and then
you're done ok so this command installs
a couple of packages that allow exFAT
drives to be read and written
accordingly now anytime you plug in an
expat formatted drive it should
automatically work and work like normal
now if it doesn't if you're on an older
operating system for example there is a
way to fix that where it does auto mount
for you as well all you have to do is
plug in your drive again and then in the
terminal type in
sudo make dir make directory mkdir slash
media / exFAT and you can actually name
that x fact folder anything really it
doesn't really matter this is going to
create a directory as a mounting point
for your flash drive and then after that
you want to type in sudo fdisk tak l so
this will show you the location name of
the flash drive which in my case it just
so happens to be SD b1 which stands for
the first partition of the second device
hence B and one learn something new
every day now I know this to be the case
because if I actually unplug my drive
and then I do that command again that s
DB one disappears from the output all's
together alright once you have that
figured out and what your flash drive
location name is called and you've made
your new subdirectory type in sudo mount
tak T X fat slash dev slash s DB 1 slash
media slash exFAT so this is going to
mount an X fat filesystem from location
dev SD b12 media X fat now your X fat
drive will automatically open up on your
Linux machine and to unmount it you
simply type in sudo you mount slash dev
slash SD b1 or whatever your location
name is and that's it now you're done
but why in the world is this a problem
in the first place I'm going to discuss
why exFAT breaks and Linux right after a
word from our sponsor when you're
looking to improve your wireless network
making sure your entire home has a
strong signal is a must that is where
Iiro comes in they are launching the
very first second generation mesh Wi-Fi
system that comes with one arrow and one
to two beacons
these are mesh access points they are
not extenders they are smaller they plug
into an outlet they have an ambient
night light and they are more powerful
than the originals but if you already
have the originals that's ok too
Eero has you covered you can get these
they are backwards compatible and they
can be purchased separately systems all
together start at 399 for all three
components but if you want to just buy
one beacon you totally can and those are
149 each we've gotten a chance to test
these in the warehouse where our
wireless
usually does not reach one end to
another the ero mesh does a great job of
fixing that headache and giving me the
speeds that I pay for from my ISP plus
it was very easy to set up and it was
reliable arrow is also announcing the
ero plus subscription which includes
advanced network security monitoring
supplementing those features that you
already get for free built-in with the
device and they also include content
filtering which is great for houses with
kids now with any system you get
automatic updates two-factor
authentication for admin access and eros
backing with a bug bounty program and
third party audits we've also got a
coupon code for you so for free

hack tip that's a cheeky tip to make it
free check it out and learn more at
eurocom we are now back with exFAT in
linux so as I teased previously why does
this format for external drives seem to
cause such a headache with Linux
machines
exFAT stands for extended file
allocation table in it's a Microsoft
file system they introduced a way back
in 2006 and it's proprietary and
Microsoft owns the patent for it
exFAT is best used whenever NTFS isn't
the best option or fat32 formatting is
pretty much out of the question because
of its file size limit of 4 gigabytes
SDXC cards that you use in digital
cameras these days are defaulted to
exFAT since they allows for larger file
sizes this is often the best scenario
especially if you're saving larger files
for example like if you're recording
videos at a convention like I do all the
time I need more than 4 gigabytes per
file SDXC cards also use exFAT because
this allows for faster write speeds
because exFAT reduces the file system
overhead so it seems awesome but
unfortunately since Microsoft owns the
patent and Linux is open-source they
don't quite agree with each other
Microsoft has not released the complete
spec and holds a restrictive license
over exFAT and since re-implementing
exFAT functionality requires a software
patent agreement with Microsoft Linux
isn't able to build this into the
operating system so now we have
reverse-engineered implementations that
were made by third parties to allow you
to work with exFAT in
the one I used in particular was called
fuse which was created in 2010 and short
for file system in userspace
which allows you to work with file
systems without going through the kernel
this also means that you don't need root
to be able to use the system exFAT which
is pretty cool exFAT utils of course
includes all of the utilities that are
needed to work within that format as
well you might still run into some
limitations when using this package but
generally you can read and write to the
drive as normal now since this is a
sticky subject when it comes to
legalities of using exFAT within linux
you should definitely consider your own
uses and needs and with that I think
we're done so be sure to subscribe to

you get some good info out of this
episode until then I want to hear your
feedback comment below be sure to check
out our sister show and I hope to see
you at the event on October 20th it's
going to be so much fun I'll be there
along with all the Internet's as usual
reminding you to trust your techno lest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
