long live the king we review backtracks
successor kali linux then human
interface device attacks with ease
darren checks out the USB rubber ducky
payload generator then hacking at 55
miles per hour we hear your ideas on
hack across america all that and more
this time on hack 5 this segment of hack
5 is brought to you by goto assist hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse
hey welcome back to the show thank you
yeah it's good to be back everything
went well last week and I got some good
news on Easter so I'm very happy and I'm
in a very good mood I'm happy to hear
that
Greg missed you I missed Greg you know
he's he's such a good supporter of hack
5 and I really appreciate the fact that
he keeps on filling in for us remember
we're out so and even though his teeth
really hurt whenever he decides that
he's he feels like eating meat but it's
cool yes I like Greg yes and you know
what we're we've got the hack wall back
with us not just reg we got dv3 and hibi
and tea and cosmic seed oh yeah so you
can find all of that at hack 5 dot org
slash alive and we pretty much just
tweet it and put it on Google+ when
we're shooting the show so you can come
in say hi
so yeah that's cool we have a lot yeah
we really do have to cover so what are
we getting into so I am checking out the
new successor for what's it called
backtrack what's it called backtrack
Cali Lewis oh nice are we going to
penetration test Cali Lewis well we
might kali linux heli linux that's the
one is the new successor to backtrack so
I would just wanted to basically just
give it a bit of a run down and tell you
a little bit of about the history where
the heck this came from I'm excited
about this cuz I'm using it in my
segment a little later in the show
talking about fun ways to make USB
rubber ducky attacks with ease
awesome alright so I'm gonna go ahead
and boot into it cuz I think we should
just get right into it what do you say
alright let's tour Kali look how
halli linux see now we need to get Kelly
we need to get like video of Cali Lewis
running Kali Linux now and just make it
all recursive and very confusing so
while I'm getting this booted up I
wanted to go ahead and give you a little
bit of the backstory we're all really
familiar with that track right yeah I
mean it's been around for seven years
now
exactly so offensive security basically
took it under the under its wing and
they made backtrack what we know and
love and hold dear to our hearts but
where did backtrack come from that was
originally based on Debian and GNU and
it was aimed for penetration testers and
it was aimed for digital forensics so
it's not something that you would live
in every day you know and it had a whole
bunch of tools that you can actually use
for penetration testing and so that's
the thing about backtrack into these
other security distributions is there's
pretty much two takes on it right you
leave there got the distribution that
you just boot into for when you need to
do pen testing like backtrack where
you're always running his route which
would never do all the time and then you
had things like you know back box and
then there's there's I think there's a
crunchbang version of Linux that's made
for yeah pen testing and we've talked
about some of these in the past and and
I think what's interesting though is
that the reason for all of this is
there's so many awesome tools and we see
these you know debuting at you know the
def cons and the black hats of the world
and you cover these conferences where an
author will come out with some really
awesome prove a concept code that does a
pretty wicked hack and then it's not
always maintained as best as you might
hope and so sometimes it's like still a
really useful tool like editor cap up
until recently hadn't been you know it
in fact it was only because it got new
ownership yeah and so that's an example
of a tool that that does something
awesome does it well and it doesn't
necessarily need to keep adding features
as long as it keeps working except the
dependencies that it uses are kind of
all over the map and so you and it ends
up just being such a pain to just get
all of the tools you want to use all in
the same place and this is why live
Linux distributions are so awesome
because you can literally have a
different
just for different in this case a
different tool penetration testing now
you did speak on a couple of things that
I'll discuss a little bit later on into
the segment regarding Kali Linux itself
but first off with backtrack backtrack
one of the reasons why it came to be is
because they merged a couple of
different distros and they made that
into one they took the first one was wax
which was originally based off of wah
fix which is right not so so wax is a
slacks version of Wapping yes yes there
was i'm alois fix papac's was a fork of
knoppix and an optics popularized live
cds at the time it did and one of those
is the auditor security collection which
is a live CD or it now a live USB based
on topics that had all sorts of tools up
to like 300 different security tools
that you could use for you know security
and penetration software for you know
testing so what is Kali Linux so this
one is also built by offensive security
and it's made by makers of the backtrack
software that you know and love the OS
now backtrack was basically redesigned
from the ground up with Debbie and
standards actually so it's a little bit
different from what we're used to right
because previously there was your slash
pen test directory and backtrack and
that's where all of those tools lived
and now all of those tools are just
standard Debian packages which makes
things a lot easier to update that in
fact previously it was like one of those
things where it's like don't update its
gonna break everything you know and then
sometimes you could and sometimes you
could and then there would be different
revisions like backtrack 5 r1 r2 and and
whatnot so so now is I know this is kind
of surprising for some people it's
actually Kali Linux is actually a
successor of backtrack so this is the
pretty much new version Kali Linux is of
what you're going to see but they're not
calling it backtrack sets not because
they say that it's so different and it
is it's very different and this one was
just released last month so it's brand
brand new in its open source of course I
mean how
not be has 300 tools tools that all
automatically work in the callee
atmosphere now the first thing that they
changed about this is the file system a
filesystem hierarchy standard compliance
so that means that you can locate
directories and binary is like you
normally would in a Linux OS that you're
used to which is a little bit different
also
they claim that it has vast wireless
support so I'm sure you're familiar less
of course things break unless of course
you're rocking a Broadcom yeah I heard
that Broadcom that what you have right
here I do but basically I was able to
get on the wireless welcome problems on
mine so maybe they have already updated
it with the the new bug the new bug
information that they've been getting on
their website so cool you know they're
working on it daily so I wouldn't be
surprised also it's really really secure
of course it's reliant for penetration
testers and it has armed support
surprisingly so you can use this with
the Raspberry Pi chromebook things like
that so backtrack 5 introduced arm
support and that's one of the beauties
of all Linux is is the whole idea was
never like oh let's make a cool little
x86 thing know it's like it's adaptable
and so you can put Linux on we've seen
it all we've sitting on the Zipit you
know for example yeah I don't remember
if that was necessarily arm of all of
these features the one thing that does
excite me the most is the Chromebook
because you can get one of those guys
but with 200 bucks you can add in $200
and what we're talking about a Linux
distribution being scale a being a tool
it's not you know something that you
live in day to day yeah rather than say
having you know live USB that you or
live CD that you boot into when you need
well hell I mean 200 bucks and you got a
Chromebook that runs Sally that's your
now that's a hacker box and then you've
got your regular box now speaking of
which with live builds Debian live build
scripts are automatically included with
the kali linux distros so you can create
your own custom ISOs if you want to so
easy so I could take photos of Kirby and
then set them as the wallpaper in Kali
if you want to use these live build
tools to make Kirby Linux yeah yeah
pretty much it
oh yeah Kirby Linux wait there's a puppy
linux yeah there's puppy yeah I must be
thinking of Kerberos Oh idea which is
which trivia Kirby is named after
Kerberos the authentication protocols
true yeah as well as Cerberus the
three-headed daemon that protects the
river Styx underworld - anyway we're
totally off topic now well we are
talking about so we're talking about
Kali Linux and I just had it booted up
I'm running this in forensics mode on my
machine
alright let's switch over to it okay so
as you can see I have already booted
into it this is the Kali Linux forensics
mode not the default mode but this is
basically it the same thing it's pretty
similar the first thing I noticed is the
background of course yes
it's very much harkening back to wafak
sand it shows some of that lineage if
you look at like walk pix 2.7 same kind
of wallpaper yeah and in fact that
little dragon II guy has been part of
backtrack for quite a while so I left
the track at McNeese adorable also keep
in mind the password is tor of course
yes so figure I mean that's the default
I forgot when I walked out of it and I
was like wow god I can't get back into
something like conference about that
pass anyway so um so you have your you
know your regular menus up here
terminals up here right so this is a
gnome to base yeah so its own gnome and
then down here under Kali Linux is where
you're going to find all of your
different tools and they do have lots of
tools pre-installed for you that they
have tested they know work with the
program so if I go up here to top 10
security tools we have Hydra of course
multigo Metasploit Metasploit is awesome
that it's pre-installed Wireshark and so
that menu though follows the the same
you know hierarchy that we've been used
to in backtrack which is important
because the offensive security training
material then doesn't really change yeah
so every time they say backtrack you
just substitute with Kali
so they don't have to worry too much
about that that's yeah that's a good
point
so what else can I mention oh yeah
you're running his route automatically
so liquid said this is not your default
everyday OS so this is definitely not
what you want to use every day but for
penetration testing it's super easy
everything's pre-configured for you and
one of the nice things that I like about
offensive security with either backtrack
or Kelly now is that you can download a
VMDK you can download a VMware image
straight from their website rather than
getting an ISO and booting off USB yes
if you want to go that route I have
heard anecdotally some people have some
problems getting VirtualBox you guys
know how I like my box but I'm sure all
of that stuff will get worked out
because it is a new codebase this is
really exciting for them it's only been
out for a couple weeks but on their
website they have adamantly been
updating it there's an IRC channel
there's forums they have a bug tracker
so you can let them know about any kind
of bugs that you run into while you're
installing this on your machine so
they're really really adamant about
making sure that this works on you know
everybody's machines cool well hey you
know I'm going to be using Cali Lewis
here and just a bit in the next block to
put together some hit attack goodness so
stay tuned for that and in just a bit
we'll be right back after this more and
more people are working from the cloud
using different devices working from
anywhere and if you're an IT supporting
all of those customers and employees I
can be a real challenge and that's why I
highly recommend go to assist by Citrix
it's an easy-to-use cloud-based platform
that allows you to assist anyone
anywhere on any device go to assist is
one integrated toolset that includes a
service desk making it easy to log and
track incidents remote support to
quickly resolve people's technical
issues on any PC Mac or mobile device
and monitoring to proactively scan your
entire IT infrastructure and picks those
issues before they become a big problem
that's when you're going to want to do
it now not then and with go to assist
you'll be equipped with those powerful
tools so you can easily adapt to your
customers needs and deliver remarkable
customer experience if you're an IT you
need to try go to assist I used him for
years when it was a Systems
Administrator let me tell you I would
never go back to IT without this in my
toolset tool kit and you can sign up for
your special 30-day free trial today
just visit go to assist com click on the
try it free button and use the promo
code hak5 let's go to assist com promo
code act 5 you guys know I am a huge fan
of the USB rubber ducky of human
interface device hacking and I figured
that given that we're checking out the
new Kali or Kali Linux this would be a
perfect opportunity to use it with the
tool that's custom built for backtrack 5
slash backtrack 6 slash colleague bye
skies fly from our very own community
called the simple ducky payload
generator and with all of that let's go
ahead and get into hacking our own box
so let's dive right in I'm in Kali Linux
here and I've already gone ahead and
downloaded the latest version of the
simple ducky payload generator it's now
got the International keyboard mappings
this is really cool out on the hak5
forums it's also here over on
code.google.com you can pretty much just
grab a copy it already has all of its
already made to work with batch r5 and
Kali and there's really not a whole lot
you need as other than perhaps updating
some dependencies but all of that is
done for you in a menu driven interface
which makes it really easy to generate
payloads of course what we're talking
about here is human interface device
hacking a you know a tool that will
allow you to emulate a keyboard because
keyboards represent humans and if
there's one things computers trust it's
humans so let's do that I've gone ahead
and already downloaded here to my
colleague Linux distribution and if I CD
to turn off num lock
there we go and we should be able to see
this pretty well here now and if I go to
encoder and we can see I'm in slash
route slash ducky slash encoder and
there's my simple ducky script here if
you want to change the directory you
just have to do a find and replace
within simple ducky SH but otherwise
with it living right here and go ahead
and fire it up so it's all menu-driven
it should be very easy to navigate and
set up if you've used something like the
SE toolkit before it ties in with
Metasploit to go ahead and create this
meterpreter shells and all of those
other fun things right there and I
really like how extensible this is it's
just basic comp files to go ahead and
add to this so I'm really excited about
having you know a tool for basically
automating the generation of payloads
rather than you know just sharing them
on the forums and doing a lot of copying
and pasting and tweaking them to your
own so let's go ahead and first clean up
the directory to get rid of any of this
stuff that I've done in the past and
I've already updated my JDK it does not
replace the one point six that comes
with Kali Linux and then so after this
we pretty much just choose if we're
gonna do a Windows reverse shell if
we're gonna do some Wi-Fi fun we're
gonna do some Linux and OS 10 hacking
that'd be fun but let's just go ahead
and own our unbox with a reverse shell
I'm going to as you can see I actually
have Kali Linux here running inside of a
virtual machine inside of my windows box
so we're going to have the we're gonna
have my guest own the host as it were
but that should be fun alright so let's
go ahead and create we've got a couple
of different choices here when it comes
to reverse shells we've got a persistent
reverse shell which is really nice
because that one is basically going to
be set up so that every time the
computer boots it's going to try to
contact the mothership and give you a
nice little shell which is really cool
we could also just do like a regular
drop a shell right now without ever even
needing to download any code where it
just goes ahead and injects base64
encoded ASCII right into the command
prompt and then using a little C script
to compile it over into a binary and run
it which is really nice because then
you're not setting off any IDs is about
some download or whatever as well as
having
one of my very favorites thanks to mu
Bix over here the PowerShell download
and execute it's just such a simple
thing as basically the Windows
equivalent to double you get and run and
then all of these you get to choose
whether or not you know your victim has
UAC enabled or not and as you can see
there's also compatibility with both
Windows Vista slash 7 as well as the
newer Windows 8 stuff but my host here
is running Windows 7
I do have UAC and I would like it to be
persistent so let's go ahead and choose
number one and this is really nice all I
have to do is go ahead and answer a few
simple questions like who is going to be
the admin for this account that we're
creating we're basically adding a
backdoor that we're always going to have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
