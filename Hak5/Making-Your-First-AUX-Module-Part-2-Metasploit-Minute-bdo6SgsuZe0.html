time on Metasploit minute Metasploit
minute is brought to you by viewers like
you if you get value from this show and
can spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in
I'm your host Rob fuller but you can
call uux today we're gonna be finishing
off or or polishing off our module we
started with a basic template from
another module we also got the the
Wireshark and burp level request to see
how things work so let's go back to our
module and and just finish this off so
the first thing that's most important
obviously is to change the title so it's
something that we can actually find so
PHP my admin login utility and then it
doesn't go to the dr don't dole abar CMR
so we changed PHP my admin' and then we
remove the rest of this then we change
the author to you because it's gonna be
you writing this hopefully in the future
these are the registered options these
options are what show up and what this
is is is actually a list of options that
the user will see so these are great
defaults but the problem is that it sets
these default answers to HTTP default
user pass and I really don't feel like
in this particular module that I want
any of these defaults there so I'm going
to remove this as a default
and it also makes it a lot easier to
just read the code so just removing
these defaults in here and the default
URL for ours is slash PHP myadmin so
we're just going to copy out that and
put the same thing right here alright so
we have all the metadata done and that's
the importance part so the next part is
getting the token and as we saw in the
request in the first request we don't
have any cookie setup obviously since
it's our first time going to this
website but it does send back a number
of cookies back to us most importantly
is this PHP myadmin
token cookie so if you look in the post
request when we actually log in it
actually has that cookie not only in the
cookie value but also in the submitted
form value this is very important
because we have to actually mimic the
exact same way a login happens now this
is specific to this version of PHP
myadmin there might be other
idiosyncrasies for four different
versions and and what you do is is you
test on different versions and make sure
they're right and and anything that
needs to be tweaked or just removed
sometimes some of these values don't
even have to be there we're looking
through the code we're looking through
the code and we really don't need this
def run because this defines the run
thing to add a slash at the end if if
there isn't one in our auto response and
we really don't need that so each user
pass automatically sends for every host
that logs in the user password to this
thing and it says trying ok that's great
we're going to keep all of that we're
not going to remove any of it so then we
go up to do login here's the user
okay there's some commenting don't need
the commenting for now so the first part
is CID token gets it in token so in our
requests we don't need anything but a
token so I'm just going to remove the
get token part of that and get token and
it's going to just return the token all
right so now we have a function that
gets the token so this sends the request
raw and sends her a get request
normalizes the URI that's great if
there's no cookies gets it so then this
already has a this already this module
already has a thing that pulls out the
token from the cookie so we don't have
to do much else than just use what's
already there so so the get cookies
match now dole session ID is not what we
want we go back to our burp session and
we see that the PHP myadmin token is the
token we want because that's what's set
here and we can copy that or we can just
type it so we don't need all this
regular expression stuff because it's
not based on anything we need PHP my
admin' ID equals nil it's just asking if
there's anything so we don't need well
it just makes sure that M isn't blank
and if M is its then one and get the
token so we already did that with with
the with the ID portion so we're going
to call this token instead and we're
going to return token
that's it so for now we're gonna we're
going to use a block state a block
commenting feature to comment out every
other piece of this module just for now
so we commented everything out and we
just want to make sure that that token
actually works put so we do a print
status token okay
now we go back into our module and we
reload it show options so actually I'm
going to exit and just go back in
because we removed all of these we
removed all of these defaults so that
way the size of my screen just so that
you guys can see it easier isn't all
messed up so I'm going to go back in and
it should automatically reload
everything
okay so use dot star PMA login because
it's the only one see now this is a lot
easier to read set our our hosts to ten
dot 73 231 155 set our our pork to 8080
show options and rerun it and it says
that there's an array instead of a
string okay so we go back in and we work
on this and we work on this and figure
out why why that doesn't work so let's
try dot inspect so dot inspect is a way
that you can say hey what is this
what is this thing and print just as
much as best as it can into a string all
right so let's reload reload reload this
module we don't actually have to type
reload we can rerun it which will
actually reload the module and then run
it again okay so it's nil-nil
so something we're doing is messed up so
it's not actually getting the right key
back so it is requesting PHP myadmin
sending back a token but it's not
getting anything back so what I'm
thinking is that there might be an index
dot PHP somewhere in here that's not
working or or something
so request it doesn't know what the URI
is because I don't I'm not giving it the
correct URI so this is actually a
variable from the original the original
module was had an at variable so we can
actually use data data store target URI
for it okay so then we go back we saved
it and we rerun it all right so
undefined local variable get cookies we
don't have to do is that there was
something in the module that did get
cookies for somehow so why is that not
showing up because it's supposed to be
part of it so Otto's missing was a res
dot because actually the res is the
request variable so when it did the
request it got back a res object and I
had failed to make sure that this res
was in there as well so then the token
comes back and now token has is a is
literally a cookie token object match so
what I want to do is figure out how this
can how I can actually debug this and
how I do that was is with pry so prize a
is a module that allows me to allows me
to actually stop in the middle of an
execution of of a module and then see
what I can see around it so I'm gonna do
binding dot pry and hopefully I have pry
installed require pry okay
so rerun so I've rerun this module and
I'm now at the token level I'm right
below where the binding dot pry is so if
I type in token it shows me that there's
match data called token then I can do
methods - class methods just like we
learned earlier and we can see that
there's a bunch of stuff in here and we
can say dot size one so there's
something there's something in there
that's dream okay and there we go
we see that there is all of the all of
the PHP myadmin cookies in there and
what we want to do is just extract that
token out of there so we can use it and
actually get it so token string dot
split
and we want to split it on spaces so
don't have to do anything so now that
now we split it on spaces now we split
it again on an equals and we want to
just split the first one so split 0 dot
split yeah so what I've done was take
the token the string for the token split
it and then took the first array item
and then split that array item on equals
so now I have the equals over there and
the token here and now I just have to
split it on the equals then take the
first or in a second array item so
that's the actual token and then we're
going to chomp off that that semicolon
at the end so we're going to take this
now that we know that works
we're gonna copy that out and just put
it in our module so we're gonna actually
change this to cookies I change that to
cookies and then we're gonna say token
equals and then we're gonna do and every
Ruby person on the planet is going to
hate me for how I can do this but you
know what it's going to work
so that returns the token and now we
save okay you've already saved we're
gonna exit our IRB our potpie method and
type rerun and hopefully we'll get our
token out yeah we have a token so now
that we have a token we we actually have
to do the login portion so let's look
back at our post in here a request and
the post request is is pretty
straightforward the cookies in there now
what we can do is we can send this to
repeater hit go see the response now the
the bad thing about this response is
that it's hard to tell if it's an actual
login or not success because for PHP
myadmin
302 you no matter what and those 302
look almost identical and it's all based
on this token so since I'm using an old
token but a successful login the root
password login it's actually showing me
that it's a 302 but the tokens already
been killed so it's taking me back to
the login page alright so what we're
going to do is we're gonna we are going
to go back to our module and we're going
to take our begin block set lock stuff
out and we're going to take our end
block commenting out we're going to move
on to the next stage so print status the
token
we're gonna remove that just so that we
don't have to have it if CID or token
equals nil we're gonna remove the CID
portion if token equals nil unable to
obtain session mmm
token so it's it's really that easy what
we're doing is just modifying this stuff
return abort else we print session ID
move that okay so we're on to our next
request and this is the post request so
normalizing URI index dot PHP that is
exactly where we're actually going so
we're gonna keep that this cookie thing
is for the CID now I don't know for sure
if we need that or not and we're
definitely not going to have a CID so I
don't know if we need this cookie thing
yet so I'm gonna comment that out for
now
and then our VARs post is our token oh
look it actually for this it actually
has the hole token so we might go back
and just remove this portion so we're
only splitting and getting this the
first tok cookie so that our token is
actually correct our login function is
not something we need we'll go back to
this so the PHP myadmin one is one we
need oh no we actually need that we undo
we need that because we're gonna call
this PHP my admin' so these strings are
X X the things before the equals sign
and just for making it nice and pretty
there it is so we don't need this login
function but we might need that space so
let's go back and we need PHP I I'm in
PHP myadmin
p.m. a user so p.m. a user p.m. a user
and it's another score p.m. a password
so we're gonna put that underscore back
p.m. a password pretty it up again so
we're gonna have to find out what this
there it is so that token is what we're
gonna have to have so this is another
thing we're gonna have to parse and you
can see how this can get can you know
get a little engrained right so we're
gonna have to pull that token out and
that is in length so that's part of the
data request alright so in the magic
world of time and TV and amazing stuff
we ran into quite a few snags and
getting this module set up and and I'll
take you through some of the snacks as I
went through so in PHP myadmin
specifically this version you have to
make a request then get a token from
that request submit your login attempt
with that token and then it gives you
this 302 and this 302 is exactly the
same no matter if you log in correctly
or not so we then had to make a third
request to get with all of these tokens
and cookies to get into making sure that
this is correct or not so how we did
that is we will go we'll walk you
through where we kind of left off so we
submitted our request the second request
with the token
okay so we've submitted a request with
that token and then we have to do this
check word check success request and
that check or success request we
actually made ourselves so we go up to
here and we're passing the headers so in
these headers will actually put a
binding dot pry in here so I can show
you how this works and I'm giving you
sort of a preview of it already on the
back end but we're gonna rerun this
module now that binding nut prize in
there yep bind Dean I can spell okay
here we go finding that pry
so if we look at our we look at our
headers so that's coming in via that
variable so we look at our headers and
we can see that this is a 302 but it's
exactly the same all the way through for
for success or failure right so what we
have to parse out of there so that we
can continue on is where it's going the
location that it's going in and all the
cookies that it has so um in there in
the response we have all of these
cookies including their path HTTP only
settings and everything like that but we
you only really want this the cookie so
if we look in here when you make an
array then we parse the array for the
set cookie option then we say okay
anything ending in Y with a cominis
space and you can see back over here
there's HTTP only and the reason why I
didn't say it's to be only like this is
because it's not case-sensitive
throughout the whole thing so here's an
all lowercase one and here's a camel
cased one so this is what breaks up
different cookies that we're actually
looking for so we go back and here's
each do set cookie so this is the cookie
so we're going for each cookie that
we're going through and then we're going
okay primary cookie equals set cookie
dot split so going back over here you
can see that I'm splitting on this
semicolon because I don't want the rest
of this stuff so all I want is the
actual cookie data just that part and
then just that part and then so on and
so forth so I split it out and get the
first item in the array and then add
those items the the cookie and its value
2 in a cookie array and then I joined
them back up with the semicolon in space
because I'm just pulling out the rest of
that garbage so now all of those cookies
are back together and I'm going to make
another request forget going to the
exact location that it specified
so the only difference here is in the
location it has the HTTP colon forward
slash four slash IP address and port and
fortune s so what we're doing is
splitting on forward slash then we're
removing the first three items and
saying I want everything other than the
first three items and join them back in
together so if you see over here I am
taking all of this out so that I can
just put in the request in the URI
because the send request CGI option in
the HTTP libraries will allow me to do
this and this is Metasploit soar
libraries alright so now that I got a
cookie set and I got the all of the get
parameters set up there I make the
request and if it returns a page that
includes login now the actual logged in
page as you can see here does not say
login anywhere on it has logout as other
things now if there was this would this
would actually fail if there was a
database called login right if any of
the options in here was was login it
would fail but it doesn't so what we're
good and it'd have to be selective case
so returns false or returns true if it
does recurrent and conclude the login
then it's it's false if it doesn't then
we've successfully logged in so let's
try it out we got to remove our binding
not price so we don't have to do that
again
we run it
bad login for route bla so we set our
password to the actual one password
really good password by the way we rerun
it and login successful tada we've
actually fully made our own Metasploit
module now so go out and try it yourself
try to make a module that logs into
whatever application that you already
have this is great on pen testing where
you can actually pull down a copy of
whatever software you're trying to look
after set it up make a Metasploit module
out of it and the great thing about this
making your own modules about things is
you get all of the awesome abilities
that Metasploit brute-forcing module has
so you can use database credentials you
can set threads so you can thread it out
to a hundred threads if you want you can
tell it to use a V host you can say use
a password file or a user name file and
and the sky's the limit on these options
which is great that way I don't have to
Cody any of that all I really have to do
is figure out the logic for step one
through three to log in and then
Metasploit does the rest so tell me what
