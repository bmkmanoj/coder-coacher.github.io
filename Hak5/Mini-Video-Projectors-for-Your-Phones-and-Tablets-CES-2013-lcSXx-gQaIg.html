go further prac 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 and we're talking to
Texas Instruments hey Frank how are you
good how are you doing Darren not bad
listen um DLP is the name of the game
here that's what we're talking about for
those not familiar with the technology
what one what does it stand for and what
does it do for us d LP stands for
digital light processing it's an all
digital technology and we have been in
cinemas and in front projection products
for a very long time you've probably
seen us on your conference room you've
seen us in cinemas so this is a cinema
chip and we've taken that technology and
reduced it down to something that small
that's our pico projection technology
and now you're seeing this going to cell
phones into tablets into into things
like notebooks in the future and also
into a wide variety of standalone
products so how long is a deal as texas
instruments being in the dlp business
the deal p business we started in around
a 1996 time frame but the pico business
is less than five years old now pico is
really blowing up what is it what's the
driving force behind that and what was
the technical hurdles that it took for
us to get to this point well the driving
force behind pico is simply we're in a
world with a lot of mobile devices and
digital content is is actually pervasive
and so what pico does is it allows you
to get this big picture from a very
small device and that's really valuable
when you've got devices that have
limited screen size like this phone and
you want to get a bigger picture and a
better experience so that's really
what's driving this whole fascination
with pico biggest picture smallest box
and now we're seeing some of it go into
the very smallest spaces as well and
then we had to take the technology and
go from something that was very you know
that works in an environment where you
didn't have any power constraints into
things that really involve battery power
and so it's a lot of
changing how we did things to structure
it so that it would work in those kind
of power environments so it's the
classic story of miniaturization how
long as as TI been at the the picot side
of the business and you know what did it
take to get the kind of resolution and
package size that we're looking at today
well the picot sides been around since
since about the end of 2008 early 2009
and and its really an ongoing process
you know we just announced for example
at this show a new pixel architecture
that's going to shrink things down even
more really get you to X the resolution
that we have in the same space today so
these right now these are 1280 x 800 so
just you know somewhere between 720p and
1080p right these are 1280 x 800 this
phone is using something like 640 x 360
and then we've got 854 x 480 so
depending upon the size of product
you've got how small you want to make it
how big the image you want to make what
kind of power constraints you have then
the developers can use those parameters
and figure out what kind of chip they
want to use what kind of product they
want to make and so do you envision this
being something that will as the cost
drives down as the technology gets you
know easier and easier to actually
manufacture it being kind of one of
those checkboxes where right now I don't
think you can buy a cell phone that
doesn't have a camera in it you know see
what I'm saying yeah certainly we love
the analogy that talks about how pico
can be analogous to a camera this is my
personal phone and i use the projection
literally on it about once or twice a
week do one of those things where you
didn't know that you need it until you
had it exactly that's exactly it and in
a world where you've got two operating
systems maybe three operating systems
and hardware that's becoming very very
very you know comment across platforms
pico is a differentiator to the hardware
of these devices it opens up new
experiences for manufacturers and for
the users it's really valuable and so
what's unique about the the texas
instrument dlp designing a Utah
about about different light forms and
such what's the the special sauce in
this particular chip uh well it all
starts with with a silicon wafer and we
take the silicon wafer and we build a
superstructure on it and then that those
structures are simulated and we package
it it's a really involved process but it
gets to the very tiny devices that we
need to be at to make these products
work I think it's going to be
interesting to see how the social once
you know these really get down to the
cost where every manufacturer is just
kind of putting them in as a de facto
future what that's going to mean to
social and the social norms of just like
you know we had with oh my gosh you've
got a camera on your phone and you're
taking that to the gym and now we've got
pico projectors on the plane and things
of that nature it's going to be fun have
you run into any interesting
circumstances as since using one on your
phone actually I have just recently in
fact I was visiting my parents in
Florida and I live in dallas and i saw i
was going by an art gallery and i saw a
painting that i thought was really cool
and so i took a picture of it and then i
went home and i projected it over my my
couch that I wanted where I wanted the
picture to be and so I could I could see
the picture without actually purchasing
it and see how it would look in my whole
environment and then I ultimately
subsequently purchased the product so
for for things like that where you
wouldn't even imagine using a projector
was all there in my hands on my phone
the camera the projector and it all
worked together so so there's tons of
applications like that moving forward
that's really cool thank you so much I
really appreciate it likewise well for
continued coverage of all things CES
2013 be sure to head over to revision
3.com sink is about helping keep you
connected while on the go one of the
most useful features of sink is its
ability to control what you listen to
and sync applink gives you the power to
control apps like pandora and slacker
radio with your voice sometimes
listen to your own tunes well sink makes
it so easy it gives you hands-free
control of your music files for your
digital music player USB Drive or other
compatible devices and even better if
you ask it to play similar music sync
even uses your own tunes to make a
playlist thanks again to ford from
powering this hack five CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
