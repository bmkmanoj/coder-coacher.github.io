all-terrain skateboards from eagle-eyed
in Santa Monica the segment is brought
to you by crash plan so the eighty bores
because because they they can write them
anywhere you know we shipped twenty of
these the one of those for the most part
our customers are guys in the 40s and
50s
that's who buy these power boards so
it's not like you know 20-somethings
nothing to work no no not at all 4750
sums commuting to work not twenties or
thirties forties and fifties all of them
all of oh yeah sure we get them yeah but
I would say three four percent are not
in that group Brazil it's different the
young guys you know they're young guys
in their 20s and 30s and they're all
over the place
so that's what's happened and these
boards have completely taken over and
then we have our GI which is our
ultimate carving machine you look at the
hardware on this and it's it's it's
really all super high in you know two
hundred dollar trucks hundred dollar
wheels you know the plate systems are
all welded by military spec shops in
gardena this this out cars anything that
I know of motorized or non motorized
it's amazing it's all about the car
how did this come about there was a
product called the cardboard okay and
it's it's a it's a pneumatic skateboard
that you go downhill on it's got really
really loose trucks great big pneumatics
those are actually like those in the
stack right there are pretty pretty
good-sized pneumatic tires and how you
regulate the speed going down a hill is
by increasing a decrease in the air
pressure and the tire if it's a real
steep hill you decrease the air pressure
and you're still carving you know like
this but slowing yourself down with with
tire pressure and I actually wanted to
come up with something like that
motorized and I motorized the cardboard
and the trucks broke in like a week they
were really not made for that
application so that's how this project
began I wanted something that would
really carve with pneumatic tires and it
evolved into the GI rather than the
changing speed based on the air pressure
and the tires just regenerative braking
exactly okay exactly
switch it over quick and so how does
your braking and control system work we
have a gun
okay and so that allows you to vary
speed yeah it works just like you'd like
the Tesla like an electric vehicle would
obviously if you pull the trigger it
goes goes like hell in this case and in
our the way our system works when you
release the trigger it will go into the
acceleration mode regen and it'll go to
a slow coast forward for full braking
and it takes doesn't take much time to
get use to our system which beautiful
about this system is this full
engagement it's not like okay now I'm
gonna put my brakes on at 20 miles an
hour where am i which which is not not a
good thing
you have full engagement you always know
exactly where you are there are no
surprises you go down a hill with this
board with controlled acceleration like
you go down a hill with a stick shift in
first gear
always full control and that's we love
that aspect of it so that's how our
system works it's all works and regen
you know how that works we've
experienced boards with with disc brakes
and all that it doesn't work well on an
electric skateboard the regen is the way
to go on these things and so that's just
like you know Toyota Prius or any other
modern-day electric vehicle yeah starts
to go into D and it regen deacceleration
and works really well and so the ends
i've been proving your uh your range
that's not nothing
I don't think measurably but it's better
than wasting the energy but what it does
is it allows for a smooth braking and
that's that's really what we care about
is smooth braking and you know smooth
the acceleration and fully control
precise so is that why you go with wired
because it gives you more precision well
first of all first reason we go with
wires we were the first guys to use
besides ex gate nine years ago we
started off with wireless electronics
and it was just it was a hideous
nightmare it was it they didn't work
right if they were unreliable everything
we shipped came back it just didn't work
right now this was nine years ago it's
probably improved a little bit since
then then we tried to cable systems and
they were reliable I like the smoothness
I like the fact that there was no noise
I like the progression it wasn't like on
or off it was like a real accelerator
and so we started with the cable and we
still test everything Wireless guys
bring stuff into the shop all the time
everything that's out there comes in
these doors and we write it and there's
nothing nothing Wireless that is any
as smooth and predictable as this it's
not out there man and you have to ask
yourself have you ever seen a wireless
throttle application where there's a
human at risk it does not exist it's
cable it's rod its hydraulics you look
at airplane to look at cars you look at
anything it's not a wireless throttle
transmission it's always something
that's direct connection and we found
that for a Power Board now you got these
guys riding these these power boards
with these Chinese electronics and I've
heard so many horror stories man these
things are potentially dangerous they
are if you're going 20 plus something
miles an hour
and all of a sudden the electronics
decide to shut down and lock up man the
guy is going to go flying off the board
and we've heard so many stories with the
Chinese systems where this happening
they are ours
they're not even RC quality electronics
the Chinese stuff is really subpar it's
cheap you can buy this stuff for like 50
bucks with a gun the receiver the whole
thing the main PC board that's that's RI
drivers 195 by itself and that's before
a gun and our cables which are made by
conquest sound labs so it's one is a toy
yeah and one is one is a serious machine
well talking about serious between the
components in that that being the
quality and you know offering you the
the reliability can you walk me through
the components of your system absolutely
let me tell you make sure you click
history here this is what we used to get
from China right yeah yeah that's the
kind of stuff we would get from China
back in nine years ago pretty hideous we
evolved from this to Kurtis instrument
motor controllers which were a lot
better than the Chinese stuff I mean you
know thousandfold better than the
Chinese stuff but we found something
much better through a Belgium
distributor we discovered a company
called PG dry technologies and we use we
use our motor controllers this is this
is the new generation this thing right
here puts out 70 amps itself checks
itself 250 times was a microsecond or
some damn thing we we set the parameters
up on this we have about sixty four
parameters that we plug into it to make
it work optimally for us we can get
these back if there's a problem and
diagnose
if a customer has a problem you can send
us the electronics we put it on our
system we can find out exactly what's
going on with the board we can find out
if there's defaults trip codes all that
kind of stuff we're on this board we're
using MBS Pro matrix trucks the base
plates are all cnc aluminum there's
their spring loaded they work better
than anything that we've ever used we
could make our own but these work as
good as anything I've come up with so we
use their trucks we have you know plate
systems that are added to the trucks we
have six machine shops in gardena that
make parts for us one of the parts that
they make for us on the GI we use a
change ride we just we just like the way
it works on the GI customers seem to
like it do you stand drive on all of
them Allen this is the only only board
the other boards all have belt drives
this is the PG Drive I drive motor
controller everything plugs into here
battery pack with special electric
vehicle the vehicle rated batteries and
that's pretty much it we flip it over
okay and then what we've done in this
board is we put put the motor in the
back so we can bring the deck absolutely
as low to the ground as we can but the
lowest center of gravity possible so you
want the but why do you want the board
low signaling carving it handles but
it's like a sports car take an issue of
vu take a sports car the Lord of the
ground the veteran handles take the
Tesla all the batteries in the bottom of
the car it out handles anything on the
road because the center of gravity is so
low so we've done that we're using the
smallest pneumatic tire that I've that I
found and it happens to be a really cool
street stick made by Kenda we use MBS
aluminum wheels and that's the ultimate
carving machine right there is there a
you know what are the pros and cons of
belt vs. chain well the biggest the
biggest Pro for belt is quietness as far
as I'm concerned I like I like the it's
it's much more quiet sound you don't
hear it chain your here Shane will last
much longer the chain won't break down
like a belt might break down it's more
rugged but the belts that we use though
on our on our 80s are pretty pretty
impressive this is a this is a this is
the eighty dry belt we use right here
and it's a pretty good sized ride belt
and these less pretty well too right
it's not really made for true off-road
use you can write it somewhat on grass
but if you look at the tires they're a
narrower tire this this board you
wouldn't want to take it in dirt and
beat it up it's it's the the motors more
open in the back it is a smooth surface
concrete carver that's what the G is you
can use it for commuting on concrete and
asphalt and things like that but you
don't want to take it off-road you don't
want to take it dirty dusty places like
that any more than you would a Ferrari
you know it's just a high-end board with
quality component tree and it belongs on
the concrete in the asphalt this board
has a range of 15 plus miles as opposed
to eight to ten for the GI this board
has much larger tires it's suitable for
writing on virtually any surface except
for soft sand it has about the same
amount of speed and torque as the GI but
it's more usable because you can you can
transition from concrete to grass to
hard packed sand to dirt to gravel and
and just blast off you don't have to
worry about it you can go over any
surface with this you have the clearance
it's a simple board it's very easy to
work on you can change out a tire in
minutes you can change a motor in
minutes you can change battery pack in
minutes it's it's it's it's a very
simple board designed to be reliable and
service very easily if need be whereas
the GI isn't exactly quite that and the
guys just like the aluminum board the
aluminum deck it has spring it has a
place to put your foot in the back and a
place to put your foot in the front to
brace yourself for the extreme
acceleration this board produces and
this board will spin that rear tire if
you if you give it full throttle from a
standing start on concrete it'll spin
that retire on con group for about 10
feet well how did the the deck come
about because that's pretty unique yeah
it really is I wanted to come up with a
deck with a with a drop deck and
actually the the first designs we had we
had a plate system we had a deck just
shaped like this with with another plate
that bolted on with spacers so we could
actually raise and lower the deck and
angle the front or the rear end and we
played with that man and screwed around
with that and this is this this is what
really happened is we had these guys in
gardena that can make amazing stuff they
can do amazing stuff so these decks are
laser-cut
and we have a we have a artist out there
he's a hydraulic press artist that
column and he presses these into shape
for us and it just came out simple it
works it worked better than any plate
systems that work better than any angled
ends it exceeded our expectations
because the Flex is just about perfect
on this but when you write it manages
you just never want to stop I mean it's
just so much fun would you say that you
have like a you know fundamental design
philosophy when you put these together a
little bit I realize we're having a lot
of fun here man okay and now really I
couldn't tell where we do this because
we love it it's not about oh this let's
make something to make a lot of money
you know it's like a surfboard company
you know we have a passion for the
boards that we make we're not trying to
sell a million I'm we don't really want
to sell a million of them you know we're
happy the way things are but we what we
want to do is we want to build the most
reliable sought-after power boards in
the world and we want to be able to keep
our customers happy and you have to be
able to do both and we do that so I love
how hack across America is totally a
proving ground for this kind of like
videography that I love I'm shooting
with some weird stuff here these are
actually HD glasses I'm using a DSLR
some POV cameras on like the extended
guy and one of the things that I'm doing
that this whole time is collecting so
many assets so it's really important for
me to be you know serious about my
backups and I actually got very serious
about my backups a couple years ago when
I switched over to our latest sponsor
crash plan I can't tell you how excited
I am that these guys are directly
supporting hack 5 now because I've been
using it for years I have terabytes up
in their cloud and so I wanted to talk
about their client because here's the
beauty right their service their cloud
service is amazing but it pales in
comparison to the cross platform plot a
client that you can use for free to do
so many cool things Windows Mac Linux
and Solaris so already you can see why I
love it like not just that check this
out if I go over to my backups here you
can see that I've chosen my different
files and one of the things that I do is
I actually choose my SD cards so it's
as I put my sd card in my laptop it
starts backing up continuously those
files which is great because it makes
the process a breeze to take all the
cards out of my cameras just pop them on
here and it starts backing it up but
where is it back it up obviously it's a
cloud service right so they do backup
over the Internet to their secure
facility but what's so cool is if you go
under destinations and I love this about
them not only can you backup to the
cloud but you can backup to other
computers that are running the crash
plan software and they make it really
simple they give you like a code and
then you take that code from one
computer put it on another vice versa
and they backup to each other so you
don't have to think about like IP
addresses and port forwarding and rsync
and all of those other things which I
love as well as the external folders so
what I do is I actually backup to an
external hard drive because you know
while I am going to hackerspaces to have
a lot of bandwidth from time to time in
between I really want to make sure that
everything is on the same page and so I
just use a couple of external hard
drives for that and then you know
finally you can you can choose different
folders that's what I'm doing here and
different computers even so I use a
family plan so I have like five
computers all using CrashPlan it makes
it really easy for me to just kind of
like sync everything between each other
the other cool stuff that I'm really
stoked about is under settings you can
actually set it up so that it will tweet
you or email you alerts about backups
which is really cool if you want to get
nitty-gritty but my favorite under
settings is the security because here's
the thing right these guys did it right
for 48 bit Blowfish that's the open
cypher standard by Bruce Schneier that
allow you to secure your stuff before it
goes up in the cloud and not guilts they
don't just store your key in the cloud
to what's beautiful is you can come up
with your own custom key using their
software you can either import a key you
can generate a key you can set one up
with a passphrase and then you can
export that key I do I export my key
into a TrueCrypt volume that I keep on a
thumb drive so yes I love that there's
actual security in this from the get-go
here's the thing the start set 59.99 a
year for unlimited backup Slyke truly
I've got terabytes up there but they're
giving us the hook up because they
believe in hack five hack across America
and then when hook you guys up so all
throughout July
all you have to do is go to crash
plan.com slash hack it up because it's
never too soon to start backing it up it
comes out to like less than four bucks a
month so I've been using for years I
truly encourage you guys to check it out
even just get the free software right
now and start yourself some backups and
then you'll probably love it so when you
do go to CrashPlan com
slash hack it up we thank them again for
their support of hack 5 and hack across
America it is time for the technology of
the week and this one comes from Jason
he sends us this photo and says here's a
picture of mine set up well deployed in
Afghanistan there's always the saying
support your troops but know that the
nerd troops are supporting you it's hard
to see but there's just about everything
from the hack 5 shop on the table with
the addition of a few extras like the
Raspberry Pi and the Nexus 7 and of
course I do have to say thank you so
much for your service I'm a military
brat and I really appreciate everything
that you guys do and of course support
your troops especially the nerd nerd
troops now you can send your photos over
to feedback at hack 5 org with the
subject line techni less if you wanted
us to show your pictures next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
