if key-based disappears free SSL

prison for withholding your decryption
keys all that and more this time on hack
five hello welcome to hack five my name
is darren kitchen i'm shannon is your
weekly dose of Technol us and we were
talking about one of our favorite things
today ponies
encryption encrypting ponies encryption
keys for all sets of good and evil
ponies no uh there's awesome story we
just talked about on threat where it
Krebbs a security blog you should go and
check it out to where he went to Mexico
and discovered all sorts of interesting
things about ATMs were familiar with ATM
scams were like there's attachments on
it I'm obsessed with his blogs about ATM
skimmers so he recently went to Mexico
he found out that there's this whole
gang of people that have been installing
these ATMs with Bluetooth embedded
devices inside of them and it turns out
that it's not just happening over
plaintext whenever they're collecting
this information via bluetooth onto like
a smart device nearby but it's actually
encrypted so even if you hack the
Bluetooth around these ATM machines you
have to have some kind of it makes sense
though right you don't want like know if
you're organized crime and you're like
skimming ATMs the last thing you want is
some like you know like rival gangs
stealing your legitimately stolen ATMs I
know that would just be like whoa we're
also talking about other fun iOS
vulnerabilities including stuff about
airdrop as well as some Android
lockscreen hacks that are really fun
check that over out on threat wire which
is on the hack 5 YouTube channel it's
your source for security privacy and
Internet freedom and we're very very
proud of it so yeah definitely check it
out it's so much fun yes but first off
we really wanted to talk about feedback
because we talked about key-based last
week which we've talked about before but
this time it was discussing how to use
it in the CLI right for file encryption
not just text for email so it was called
easy file encryption with key bays we
got a lot of great feedback and
some ones that like spur some
interesting discussions that I'd love to
have so let's go ahead and just start
off yeah so our first one comes from Jay
he said great vid is there a Windows
equivalent and it turns out yes there is
yes and this is one of the really
beautiful things about using open
frameworks as such since key base is
built on node.js which is available on
multiple platforms as well as the
prerequisite most notably GPG are
available for Windows Mac and Linux and
so if you're on the Windows platform
here's what you're going to need to do
grab yourself a copy of GPG for win this
is the same GPG that we know and love on
the linux platform it's just the Windows
version and GPG for window org slash
download is yes and it comes with this
nice little front end tool called
Cleopatra which is a nice little GUI to
help you manage keys and do encryption
and decryption things of that nature
otherwise you're going to need no js'
and that's pretty easy to do you just
basically get yourself the nude ojs org
and there is a download for Windows
right here and it's pretty simple it's
it's a nice little installer you know
click click next next Bob's your uncle
and once you have all of that it's the
same exact commands that you might
expect that we showed off last week as
far as installing yeah that NPM command
the NPM install tak G key base installer
all you have to do is make sure that you
open up your node J s command prompt so
this right here will be go get a node.js
command prompt and from here go ahead
and issue those commands what is it
again NPM install space tak G space key
base
- installer which I've already done on
this machine but you know why not do it
again and it should look very similar
and there we go now I can run key base
installer just as before and we should
also mention if you run into any errors
whenever you're using this make sure
that the GP G is in your path
environment variable right so that's
good stuff and hey look at that now you
have GPG which kind of brings us to some
other questions I show we had we had
another kind of I guess there's better
ways to do NPM installs yes there are
ours
this question was from and I'm probably
going to like just annihilate this name
I can't pronounce it you know we'll just
put on this no we're gonna put it on the
screen let's not even try I I don't
speak so really so he said do not pseudo
MPM tak ji install change NPM path to
your car / yes / and p.m. or something
less pseudo is better of course that's
always true and you can replace install
to a simple ISO MPM iTAC ji ki base will
just work and since you typed LS Kirby
JPEG you could use a xdg tak open Kirby
dot JPEG from the same terminal or even
add alias open equals x DG tak open to
your slash bash RC yes aliases we've
covered those shinning as on hacked if
there's a great one in one series if
you're new to bash aliases are awesome
thank you for providing those awesome
tips good stuff and we got a message
from the caps tur who says what de are
you using on your Ubuntu box because it
looks sweet that's right I'm a huge fan
of gnome 3 you can find that over at no
morg
it is the sexiness and if you're doing
it with Ubuntu it's probably easiest to
just install Ubuntu gnome and find that
over at boon - no morg
it's a good desktop and right perdy good
known you know what I really also is not
totally off track but I also love
elementary OS if you guys haven't really
checked this out it's basically like the
equivalent is it's okay so imagine if OS
10 an Ubuntu had a baby that's that's
pretty much it is it's just like well
okay so I like it because it's pretty I
like it cuz it's pretty but I also like
it because the dude went under the hood
which I know and love and so as far as
like newbies getting into it I feel like
it it's like the new up-and-coming like
I'm reading this over mint now I should
mention that on texting I will also
point out that if you if you like to
fiddle under the hood it's really easy
to break so just you know that huh yeah
from experience
haha so kind of like a Mac you
get what you get and you know if you
want to have fun well prepared be
prepared to have a lot of fun okay
anyway she get back to it alright so I
really like this question it was from
samurai 1200 he said what happens if key
base disappears I have to agree that's a
great question it is we hate relying on
proprietary stuff and this is why key
base is so great because it's built on
open standards in particular open PGP so
here's the brilliant thing about this
and you know also the fact that key base
is open sourcing yeah and there's all
like that installer that entire program
the CLI that is up on github right now
and you can peer review it and you can
continue it to your heart's content and
so even if it does disappear what's
really cool about the way that it's
creating like a social network of
encryption is that it's building on
these open standards yeah so if for
instance key base were to just disappear
all of your encrypted files that you
used key base to help you generate would
not disappear you'd still have them on
your hard drive because you can keep
using like GPG for example right and you
can since there yet since they're
encrypted with GPG it's really just a
front end so jpg is not going away
anytime soon and even if Cubase
disappears your messages will still be
a-ok and because it is open source it's
less likely to just disappear overnight
because as long as there are developers
and maintained errs that want it to
exist
it well well well and we also got a
message from he said what's up with the
UK thing oh yeah maybe I just kind of
slipped that by a little you kind of did
sounded like a diss on the UK it's not I
love the UK and actually I fly through
London Heathrow all the time because
it's wondered like well you fly through
the airport
no-one's London Heathrow because it's an
inexpensive way to get into Europe so
you start in the UK and the new bands
around the Netherlands it's also pretty
good as well
Amsterdam's people the regardless I
actually like the tinfoil hat me is all
like I wonder if all the flights are
really inexpensive through London
Heathrow as a means to catch would be in
crypto criminals that's right because as
we know from the NSA if you're
encryption cross borders well we're
gonna have to store copies of that
because obviously you're doing something
you shouldn't what have you got to hide
which brings up an interesting read on
key disclosure laws specifically there's
mandatory key disclosure as well as
mandatory decryption and both of those
are very scary yeah so specifically to
the UK the regulation Investigatory
Powers Act of 2000 otherwise known as
right paw it requires persons to supply
decryption information and/or keys to
the government representatives when they
have a court order and failure to do so
carries a penalty maximum jail time of
two years in prison that is some scary
stuff this provision was first used
against animal rights activists aka
error so wikipedia says in 2007 and
since didn't used to jail at least three
people have been prosecuted over this
including like one developer who was
just not going to give up his encryption
keys so he ended up serving 13 months
there was also a minor same thing
happened to him so yeah I was just
reading the articles on this and so
messed up so they jailed a schizophrenic
person for refusal to decrypt their
files
that's the developer so so screwed up
and then the second one yeah and then
they put it yes this is it's kind of
messed up it's it really varies by
country the United Kingdom is a good
example of like what happens when things
really go wrong but you know check out
the Wikipedia article on this because
it's not just the UK it's also Australia
and Belgium and Finland and all of these
other places thankfully in the United
States we have this amazing thing called
the the fifth amendment to our
Constitution which protects witnesses
from being forced to incriminate
themselves which is really good you hear
it in the Miranda rights every time it's
like you have the right to remain silent
and so remaining silent is really good
and also includes giving up your
decryption key or at least that has been
the case so far hopefully case law did
not change that anytime soon suffice it
to say yes when I when I go through the
UK with my encrypted laptop as I always
travel internationally with an encrypted
I am aware I'm keenly aware of the risk
and that sucks because that's where your
morality and your ideals hit up against
the harsh reality that is the law so
maybe I should start going in through
another country speaking of which I was
I was just doing research on a veracrypt
the basically like the baby of TrueCrypt
and they give you the ability to do
hidden volumes so you can encrypt a
volume and then do a hit and volume
inside of that that's also encrypted so
when they unencrypted the larger volume
it looks like there's nothing else right
this is an amazing response to that
which is called plausible deniability
yeah and so the reason being ok so maybe
you don't do full disk encryption or
whatever but maybe you have some volumes
on your hard drive where you've got
veracrypt yeah volumes and when you go
to decrypt them you have two passwords
one password unlocks the source codes of
the stuff that you don't want the
government have and the other one
unlocks photos of ponies and then
they're all like oh well we get it
you're just one of those Pony encrypting
people you should be a pony encrypting
PA speaking of encryption oh my god free
encryption for everyone this is so
exciting let's encrypt this is if you're
not aware of the let's encrypt project
you should check it out over at let's
encrypt org this is put on by the e FF
as well as many other awesome people who
are coming together to say hey you know
a Mozilla Akamai's cisco EF f they're
saying hey like why is it that SSL
certificates are so complicated and so
expensive and so it's like why don't we
change the whole thing and make SSL free
as we should all be running SSL I know
we are on forms a hack 5 dat Oregon hack
5 dot oregon hack shop calm and all of
the stuff that we do but it can it's
expensive and complicating you have to
pay for these certificates and you have
to keep them updated and there's renewal
fees and this complications and depends
on your web server there's all these
different ways to install them correctly
and incorrectly given and so the concept
here is to create a free and automated
and open
system for providing encryption keys
everyone and it's not quite live yet but
they didn't do their first one though
yes the first one you can actually head
over to hello world let's encrypt organ
you'll get this it works you just have
to go to advance and proceed because
it's not basically the certificate
authority there needs to be an
intermediary that is the is RG root
certificate it needs to be installed in
browser or needs to be supported by all
the browser people and that is coming
and then everything will be happy
yay chains of trust hmmmm with that we
were gonna take a quick break and when
we get back Ponies domain.com and Doc
Club came to hack five with a great idea
build a club all about learning stuff
making things and having fun so we've
been hosting open houses at the hack 5
warehouse through hack house Club and
with the help of domain.com and dot Club
we've taken it to the next level with a
quadcopter arena of doom from LAN
parties drone racing and battle arenas
to 3d printing software-defined radios
and let's not forget barbecue hacking is
just plain better when it's social doc
Club gets it and they are the perfect
social domain whether it's IRC or clubs
in RL it's all about coming together and
having fun so what better domain to do
it than a doc Club it's perfect because
a doc Club is universally and globally
understood so if you're looking for the
ultimate social domain consider a dark
Club so join us this summer in the San
Francisco Bay Area and bring your mini
quadcopter to the arena for drone battle
club we're setting up the leaderboard so
show us what you've got
and what's your doc club let us know and
we'll share it with the hak5 audiences
help spread the word get yours over at
domain.com slash club they're only $9.99
a year and there are thousands of great
domains available and be sure to use the
coupon code hak5 to get 15% off and let
them know we sent you so when you think
domain names think domain.com that just
better wraps up this week's episode of
hack 5 but before we get going I want to
invite you all here to have fun with
quadcopters and have a little
party goodness and you can find out all
the deets over at HACC H a K how stock
club so you can sign up you have to get
in on the newsletter action so that you
can know all of the tasty deets about
how you can come down here and barbecue
with us and bring your puppies it's
gonna be a good time mm-hmm also
feedback at hak5 dot org have you heard
of this email I have that's where you
can email us all the things that you
want us to hear about yes as well as
only a lively comments I love that we
get such great and insightful and not
not troll comments they're really great
cuz I can't roll with that hack $5 word
size follows where you can find all the
social networks and stuff that we hang
out on get banned by Shannon on Twitter
it's good stuff you have not lived until
you have a bad you yet so you haven't
lived yet
yeah you win yes yeah let us know what
you'd like to see and with that we will
be back next week until then I'm here in
kitchen I'm Shayna Morris truster
technologist
you just got back did you do it what
what no your unban just for now your
