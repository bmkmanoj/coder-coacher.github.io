encryption access on your Android device
and a high-altitude balloon lift off all
the and more this time on hak5 this
segment of pack 5 is brought to you by
domain.com hello and welcome to this
episode of pack 5 my name is Shannon
Morse and this is your weekly dose of
technol s and as you can see my co-host
is still nowhere to be found he's still
over in Europe hacking his way across
Europe and you can find all the
information about that down at the link
below and I wanted to go ahead and start
it off talking about and CFS now I did
have a segment about that back in 12 25
episode 12 25 so you can find that on
hak5 org and that was basically rundown
of how to install NC FS on your own
linux machine and how to run through it
and basically how to make it work with
dropbox so you can actually have
encrypted files really really easily in
your dropbox that you can access from
any other pc problem with that though is
n CFS doesn't necessarily have an easy
way to do it from an android device or
an iOS cell phone so there's no really
accessible way to get your encrypted
folders or files on your android device
so enter kryptonite so now there's this
this kryptonite thing it sounds like
something from you know Superman but
it's not it's actually an Android app
that's available in Google Play it's
completely free and it brings n ZF s and
truecrypt as well over to Android so you
can do everything like browsing
exporting you can open n CFS encrypted
directories and files on your Dropbox on
your phone very cool now that the
truecrypt version of this is only
available as a command line version at
this time but the app is still in
development so I'm sure that's going to
become come to the the application very
soon at least I hope it does now another
thing to think about this is it has a
really really nice and easy GUI so it's
very
use it only takes a couple of seconds to
set up and it's wonderfully open source
so I'm sure makes everybody out there
very happy because you can read the code
and you know exactly what you're getting
yourself into it's also based off the
original n CFS code and it's fully
compatible with all the and CFS features
so you're able to do everything that you
you actually want to do on your Android
device for example you can do
downloading and uploading you can create
n CFS volumes on your Dropbox or in or
on your phone as well and of course as I
said it's still under development so
experienced Android users only if you
don't know what you're doing you might
not want to play with this quite yet
it's still under development now let's
go ahead and test this out I have nexus
4 from episode 12 25 I already have n ZF
s set up for my account I'm going to go
ahead and put in my pin code log on here
right so here we have my regular home
folder right here is cryptonite you can
just find it in google play it's spelled
with a see instead of the K it does tell
you dragons ahead oh noes winter is
coming this programs under development
use at your own risk it's distributed
without any warranty so make sure you
don't do anything that you wouldn't want
to do and break your cell phone because
that would not be very good now first
thing you need to do is link with
Dropbox so you just click this little
button at the top click allow if your
law already logged into dropbox there's
no login username and password that you
need to do from your phone if you
haven't already logged in to draw blocks
you'll obviously have to put that in
after that you want to decrypt your
Dropbox folder right here so click on
that and it shows me everything that I
already have lined up in there now so
most of this stuff is not encrypted as
as it is right now most of this is just
you know junk that I threw up in dropbox
so that it can easily access it from any
pc it doesn't really matter but I do
have one encrypted folder down at the
bottom it's called encrypted so if I
click on that you'll see i have an CFS
XML which you never want to delete and
also have this random little series of
letters and numbers right there which is
completely encrypted
I can't really do anything it with it
it's not going to open and then these
two folders at the top are just going to
bring me to my main folder down here
select current folder this is selecting
the encrypted folder not the actual file
right there you want to enter your
password whatever you put in whenever
you set up n CFS on your machine so I'm
going to type in my password which is
incredibly easy but I don't really care
this for testing purposes only it's
going to run and CFS
a moment
and then i will say successfully
decrypted and CFS volume now if you do
get an error when you do this you
probably just typed in your password
wrong and it'll just bring you back to
your regular Dropbox folder it'll just
say something like a password and
username were incomplete or unable to
access and CFS folders so you probably
just have to put in your password again
alright so now that i am linked up I can
see local though is this is for any kind
of local encryption that you want to add
you can forget the decryption since I
already have it turned on I can also
mount and CFS if I had a rooted device
and then over here under expert Rick I
can also start a terminal and start a
root terminal you fun stuff I'll let me
go back over to dropbox if decryption it
was default now I want to browse the
decrypted folder and now tada you have
my example text file which you can
actually access there we go and I can
export the selected I can upload a file
to this folder so i can also upload a
new folder or files if I wanted to and
if I export it exporting can be slow its
going to copy decrypted files to your
phone so you want to proceed yes it's a
tiny one so I don't really care about it
being slow it's going to be all right
see where should I put this
an SD card yet that's sad wish I put it
where do you think call yes I'll just
put it into your
other stuff in here oh that's cool
guess I could do that downloads export
current folder cool so it's successfully
exported the folder it or the file and
now I can access it from my phone or i
can just reuploaded to dropbox or do
whatever I want with it I could send it
to people for example now this does have
a couple of bugs to keep in mind since
it is still in development first off
mounting only does not work on some
Android 4.2 devices it for the most part
will work just on your regular device
but keep in mind there might be a
problem with that on your own machine or
on your own android smartphone also
there are a couple of features that
require fuse and route mounting and CFS
volumes require root and Colonel few
support which is found in some cyanogen
mod roms and then offline access to
dropbox volumes is available with rooted
phones that support fuse so to access an
encrypted dropbox volume when you're
offline you can sync the encrypted
volume to a local folder with one of the
many apps that are available out there
there's a folder sync light there's drop
sync so you have plenty of options and
then you can mount that local volume
with kryptonite and there you go you're
ready to go there's also a couple of
different permissions that are needed
internet permission to access dropbox
obviously and then the SD card access to
read and write files and that's about it
so tell me what you think of Kryptonite
I thought it was really easy to use it's
very simple and as long as you had no
problems installing in CFS on your linux
machine you shouldn't have any problems
getting this to work on your android
device but let me know if you had any
issues on your own android phones or let
me know if you found any really cool
tips with kryptonite or if you have
another app that you'd like to share
with me and with that we're going to
take an ad break and after that we got
