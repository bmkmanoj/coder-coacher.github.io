vulnerable to a hack and apparently so
is that air gap PC plus several hotels
in the u.s. get their credit card data
stolen all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for August 16 2016

grow patreon com on to the news first
off with volkswagen volkswagen vehicles
are at the forefront of a research paper
published by university of birmingham
team explaining how the keyless entry
systems used on millions of cars can be
easily manipulated to gain access
without the actual key fob nearly 100
million cars are vulnerable to this hack
allowing a thief to wirelessly unlock
tons of vehicles that volkswagen has
sold for the past get this two decades
because apparently they've been using
the same keys on two decades worth of
cars this includes adi Skoda alpha
romero citreon fiat ford mitsubishi
nissan opal and puget also i apparently
probably pronounced a few of those wrong
I'm not really a car person so sorry the
hack requires a thief to clone the key
fobs radio signals and transmit them
with an inexpensive Arduino and a few
pieces of radio equipment totally a
whole forty dollars the researchers
found two vulnerabilities the first one
requires the thief to clone a
cryptographic key that is transmitted
over radio and is the same key shared
across millions of Volkswagen vehicles
then they would have to also intercept a
special code that matches up to the
specific target vehicle but this key is
the same every time a driver presses
their key fob button now you combine the
two keys and voila you gain access so
far the exact information on the
interception technique has not been
publicized the second vulnerability uses
a cryptographic technique called high
tag 2 which requires rolling code
to work a key fob sends a car a
different code each and every time the
fob is pressed but if that key fob is
blocked from transmitting by an attacker
the attacker could then collect a bunch
of the young use keys and then reuse
them on the car now hi tag 2 is not
secure as once a few codes are collected
the rest can be figured out the company
that sells chips using high tag 2 has
been recommending car manufacturers not
use this algorithm since 2009 due to its
vulnerable crypto now currently driving
off with the car itself is not possible
with these hacks but obviously somebody
could steal it by towing it away after
sticking it in neutral that would
definitely work electronic hacks are
becoming a more and more common way to
steal valuables from inside the cars I
even talked to a cop at Def Con in
person who has had this happening in
this town so he was at Def Con learning
about radio hacks and so far the best
suggestion is not to leave valuables in
your car and use mechanical keys instead
and hopefully you have that option
otherwise auto manufacturers need to use
better algorithms for their key fobs now
to prevent theft that is currently
happening at least 20 us hotel's run by
hei hotels and resorts have had customer
payment card data stolen in a breach
these include Marriott hyatt Renaissance
intercontinental and Starwood Hotels
like Leigh Meridian Sheraton and Weston
just to name a few several thousand
transactions happened on in person
point-of-sale terminals while they had
malware loaded on to them allowing for
data to be stolen all the way from march
first 2015 through June twenty-first
2016 the full data stolen could include
names credit cards expiration dates and
see Vivi's the verification codes now
hei hotels and resorts posted a notice
and states that the incident is already
contained and the point-of-sale
terminals are in the process of being
moved to a separate network also the
malware is no longer in existence on
those machines now for customers they
recommend checking credit card
transactions in they also posted
identity theft information ok let's talk
about some weird here even air gap
machines could be susceptible to a hack
because of the noise that their hard
drives make so weird so what a hard
drive is access
the arm which is called the actuator
allows for reading and writing of data
and as it moves it also generates sound
and that sound could potentially
transfer sensitive data to a microphone
or a nearby smartphone for recording and
analysis researchers from ben gurion
university published a paper describing
the vulnerability called disk filtration
and how it works so in this specific
scenario malware would need to be
installed on the air gap machine so it's
use case scenario is actually kind of
minimal a person would need to be very
close to the target computer to have
this work now to keep your own air gap
machine from being owned researchers
recommend using solid state drives or
sound muffle enclosures for the hard
disk drives instead thank you again to
