Metasploit minute Metasploit minute is
brought to you by viewers like you
if you get value from this show even a
little bit and can spare a dollar please
consider contributing at Metasploit
minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me mix today
we're actually going to write our own
modules auxilary modules in this case
it's a the scanner module and and most
of the modules that I write are all by
need if I look inside of Metasploit
search PHP myadmin
I noticed that there isn't a PHP login
utility or anything to scan and try and
authenticate against PHP myadmin sites
and I can do this by hand if I want to
but it's kind of a pain in the rear so I
have a PHP my admin site and I want to
login to it now I can type you know
continue you type different logins and
that's great but I'd rather have it
automated inside of Metasploit and the
brute-forcing utilities inside am a
display is actually pretty cool so first
off before we start what we're going to
do is we're going to look inside of the
inside of the Metasploit directory
hopefully this shows up in a second here
for any kind of module that is similar
to to what we're trying to do and why is
in this there you go
so we're going to go into Metasploit
we're going to go into modules and then
auxilary let's go down scanner scroll
down to HTTP and we see that we have a
bunch of different modules there's over
a hundred different Metasploit modules
inside of Jeff scanner HTTP so I've
already gone through a couple and kind
of looked at which ones a little simpler
there's a bunch of them that use basic
auth or NT
and you kind of want to go right away
from that because that's not how PHP
myadmin works and how do you know that
because you can look at how the protocol
works on PHP I met my admin by doing a
couple things the first is just go and
try and follow the TCP stream inside of
Wireshark and see how a post request
happens so I've already done that I've
listened on port 8080 or listen our
Wireshark on port 8080 and you guys have
learned from about Wireshark on hack tip
with Shannon Morse
so if you look in there and you see
here's the post request that happens
when I try and log in and you can see
that there's some cookies there's some
exact values there's all this crazy jazz
and then finally p.m. a username root
p.m. a password blank and there's a
token so that actually failed since
we're just trying this out and we're
trying to write our module that failed
but this is kind of hard to copy and
paste and to get right because you have
to start over here instead and Wireshark
isn't the best way for HTTP on on other
protocols it's a lot better but for HTTP
I like using Burk so going over to burp
I just sent all the requests through the
burp proxy and now you can see a
successful login on this post request an
unsuccessful login on that post request
so what we're going to start with is we
are going to copy our auxiliary module
one that I found that just uses HTTP
based login over to a directory inside
of our dot MSF for directory if you
don't know about Emma MSF or go back to
our our episode on the directory
structures for Metasploit you'll find
that and then a modules directory so
I've created inside of that modules
directory on auxiliary scanner MSF
minute directory
so all you really need is the auxilary
level and then you can sit call it
whatever you want but I like putting it
in somewhere where I can find it easy
so we've copied over that PMA login now
I open that in leafpad and you can see
that this is the dolibarr erp CRM login
utility and the reason I selected it is
because it uses the send request CGI
with a post request with this login
utility so and it also has a token so
I'll be showing how that token is
important in in the next episode so we
have all of the required items to start
on this module so we're gonna actually
step into the the first step is to see
and get this loaded and then once we get
it loaded what options are there what we
need to remove what we need to put in
and then in part two we're actually
going to start writing it we're gonna
start modifying this this already
working module to customize for PHP
myadmin
so since it's in that directory and I
can go in and either load path the home
MSF for modules directory modules or I
can simply exit and go back into
Metasploit and since it's in that dot
MSF for directory since it's in that dot
MSF for slash modules directory it'll
actually automatically load in this is a
great way to share modules so if you
want to make it so that you have a bunch
of your own custom modules that you keep
everywhere that dot MSF for slash
modules directory gets loaded everywhere
so you can rsync it across systems that
way you always have it or BT sync it or
however you want and Metasploit itself
will never overwrite that directory so
now if I search for PHP myadmin
it didn't show up because I didn't
change the module name but if I use
auxilary scanner its msf minute minute
you can see that the PMA login is there
if I type in info the reason why I
didn't show up is it still says Dola bar
CRM so it's all there so in part 2 we're
gonna clean this up a lot make it nice
and neat remove all the Dola bar stuff
put it in the PHP myadmin things and and
make this really work for a login module
and really the best part about this is
that you're using a template thority
there so it's going to be a lot easier
you don't have to go from scratch and
look everything up so tell us what you
think email me MSF at hack 5 org and
stay tuned to Metasploit minute at comm
for more shows like these and a huge
thanks to everyone who supported this
show so far and in the future we can you
can find more ways to donate and get
awesome Metasploit swag at Metasploit
minute comm every dollar goes towards
making this show better for you and I'm
deeply grateful for that so until next
time i'm rubik's an ugly hack into the
cows come home
button pushed okay ready hey there yeah
you thanks for watching all the way to
the end I really appreciate all the
awesome feedback and support we've
received from viewers exactly like you
not as cool but you know you get the
