are being hacked and a product recall
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for Tuesday October 25th
2016 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
first off a big thanks to our patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat why're
you guys fund the making of this show so
thank you for letting us bring you
security news every single week this
week I would like to focus on something
that we've kind of sort of been
discussing for the past month that the
security industry has kept an eye on and
is probably now screaming I told you so
so apparently Friday was a terrible day
to be on the internet but it also marks
the day that IOT or Internet of Things
security started becoming a mainstream
concern remember a couple of weeks back
when I reported on Krebs on security
being hit with a huge distributed denial
of service attack or a DDoS for short
yeah that same malware hitting his site
is the culprit behind a mass outage on
Friday of last week when several popular
websites seemingly went offline for
quite some time the DNS infrastructure
company called Dyne DNS reported friday
morning that a ddos was hitting their
servers and engineers were mitigating
the attack sites that went down included
twitter paypal reddit spotify Shopify
Netflix Zendesk and there were quite a
few other ones as well the DDoS attack
was eventually resolved later that
evening after three different attacks
occurred Ondine DNS so how did this
happen it's the same way that it
happened previously unprotected Internet
of Things devices like connected
security cameras and DVRs and Printers
and I don't know refrigerators more are
being used in large botnets and this one
in particular is called Mirai to send
huge amounts of data at servers to
basically crash them and make websites
go down flash point a security firm
identified IOT devices amongst other
device botnets to be in use dine DNS
makes it possible for us to type in a
website address like Twitter comm and
then have that human speak translated
into computer speaks so that the
computer knows where we want to go on
the Internet
so basically if that doesn't work then
we can't get to the website correctly
and then everything gets jumbled and the
website seemingly looks like it's gone
down it's not very fun basically and
since so many sites rely on Dyne DNS to
make their addresses work they all went
down by Friday night dine DNS had fought
three DDoS attacks throughout the day
and the DHS and the FBI are both
investigating the DDoS although no one
is sure who's behind the attack even
though some people on Twitter said they
were but nobody really believes them cuz
there's no proof so what do we know the
Mirai botnet now infects a total of over
1.3 million devices worldwide and
Intel's malware tech heat map shows a
good view of their locations and how
many are currently online Krebs on
security reports that the attacked use
products that use and I'm sorry if I
mispronounced this I don't speak any
Chinese Chinese Zhang my technologies
components in their manufacturing the
components are cheaply produced and
they're sold on a much larger market by
vendors who use them in security cameras
etc and then they go unfixable as long
as they're on the internet and in the
consumer market now while some allow you
to change your user name and password
that may not necessarily fix the problem
to quote Brian Krebs quote that's
because while many of these devices
allow users to change their default
usernames and passwords on a web-based
administration panel that ships with the
products those machines can still be
reached via more obscure less
user-friendly communication services
called telnet and ssh the passwords on
this kind of access are usually
hard-coded into firmware meaning that a
consumer can't necessarily change them
in a post published by the Chinese
manufacturer zhang my products sold
after April of 2015 do not have the
vulnerability because they closed till
Net ports that were open to the web but
a product could still be vulnerable if
default username and passwords were not
changed XM is young my first short XM
I'm just gonna say XM because it's much
easier to say also states that they will
recall any known vulnerable devices
lastly they go on to state that they
would sue any company that defines them
by naming them as a part of the botnet
ddos attack on friday ok
so well it DDoS this big happen again
it probably will and it'll probably keep
getting worse until we have a way to nip
the problem where it starts as a
consumer you should care because the
DDoS using your device could slow down
your connection but also be used by
attackers to snoop at you I mean think
about it security cameras
yeah kind of don't want people peeping
into your household that's a little
creepy now even if a patch or a recall
is sent out plenty of folks won't even
care or won't know how to fix their own
product or send it back but I will say
this again you can vote what you with
your wallet before buying a product
research their security know what you
are buying especially if you are
connecting it to your own network that
is such a huge component and this is
just the beginning of some a very very
big problem that we're going to see a
lot of thank you again for being patrons
of threat wire you can contribute to
patreon.com/scishow if everyone that
watches this show donates $1 per month
we would successfully cover all of our
fees like rent electricity my time plus
we will be able to put in more time to
the show so that we can do upgrades like
bring you a new camera and bring you
more content every week if you can't
contribute you can give the show a
thumbs up you can subscribe on YouTube
comm slash hack 5 I would love to see if
we can get this episode over 1,000
thumbs up that would be awesome
and it really does help with our
analytics and brings more people to the
show so we would love to see more people
sharing this and subscribing and you can
find all of our episodes links to our
social networks and other ways to
contribute over at threat wired net and
with that I'm Shannon Morse
and I will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
