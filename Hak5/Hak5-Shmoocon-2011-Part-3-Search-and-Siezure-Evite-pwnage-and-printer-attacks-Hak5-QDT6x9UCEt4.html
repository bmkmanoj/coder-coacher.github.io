hak5 season 8 with the last of our
conversations from security experts at
shmoocon 2011 search and seizures
cross-site scripting and owning network
printers all that more this time on hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you

got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain calm and go to
assist express support smarter would go
to assist express so on the general rule
in the united states is that the
government has to get a warrant okay
before searching something that you have
a reasonable expectation of privacy in
okay and this is is right that's
guaranteed by the Constitution beyond
the fourth amendment specifically and so
you know what that means is that for
example if the police want to search
your house they have to tell a judge why
ensure they have probable cause to
search your house and then get a warrant
and the thing that's tough though is
that at the border the rules are a
little bit different and well um while
the Fourth Amendment does apply at the
border searches there are generally
considered reasonable simply because
they occur there which is that like
they've searched my car before but right
we're actually like pulled out my laptop
uh-huh well yeah the the customs agents
are the border agents generally don't
have to have a warrant or you know
suspicion of anything really to search
you know stuff that you bring over the
border yeah unless it's like a really
extraordinary search like a search of
your body or something right really like
the interior of your body like you know
I think you're like smuggling drug
cavity search yeah exactly like that's
you need they need a little bit of
suspicion for that yeah but um but you
know unfortunately you know the courts
have said that when it comes to
computers and you know border agents
don't need any suspicion of wrongdoing
at all what to tend to search none to
search your computer so you know that's
I think it is scary and I think a lot of
people don't know that
a lot of people of course travel with
their computers yeah especially for work
inside oh absolutely you know a lots of
people travel with you know work laptops
and you know laptops that have a lot of
delays of really really secure
information right like really
confidential information and you know
you know they can have lots of you know
really private information on their
computers to you know I mean you know
years of archives you know email
conversations and you know you know even
like tax records yeah I mean there there
can be a great deal of information there
that you know the government want them
to see that right exactly so you know
that's something that I talked about in
my talk because I think that that's
something a lot of people don't know
about and you know I a little but also
about you know some of the things that
people can do to protect their data at
the border Oh what can I do well and so
I encourage you I courage everybody to
visit our website and we have like a
long guide that we've put up there for
four people to all over and think about
it and decide whether you know it works
for them but you know to just kind of
summarize it okay and you know some of
the things that you can do are for
example don't take data over the border
that you don't need to take so so just
like copy it over to a hard drive or
something your regular PC that you have
at home all right you know one thing you
might think about is having a laptop
that's really just for travel but you
don't keep much on and on you know when
you need to travel you put the data on
that computer that is only the data that
you need for that trip and then take it
over the border and then you know
perhaps consider you know securely
wiping your computer before you come
back that's yeah yeah so that you know
agents um you know might you know not
see the things that you wouldn't want
them to see there's nothing there to see
and even that they did check it i have
heard that people would get their
computers taken for like hours and days
on end right it wouldn't take them as
long well exactly and if you have your
data elsewhere you know on your computer
at home or you know a you know a backup
stored somewhere else it's not such a
big deal if the agency's your computer
at the border and then don't give it
back for a while yeah so you know that's
something to think about as well and of
course encryption is really important
too oh yeah yeah like truecrypt and
stuff yeah encryption encrypting your
data can
go a long way toward you know helping to
secure your data at the border now if I
do put a password on my computer are
they allowed to ask me or to make me
give them that password or open up my
computer so they they can ask you for
the for the for the they can ask you for
your password or for your on your
passphrase your encryption passphrase
and you don't have to give it to them
really nope you don't have to give it to
them I get in trouble well you know this
is something that's difficult right
everybody always wonders like well gosh
if I don't give them if I'm not
cooperative if I don't get them what
they don't give them what they ask for
what's gonna happen are they gonna like
live and arrest me right are they going
to like let me into the country or they
know and so you know I think that this
is something that's you know sort of a
personal trade offer every traveller
right i mean if you if you are worried
about you know being detained for some
hours and being questioned or if you're
worried about and you know getting your
laptop seized you know you know i think
this is a call everybody has to make for
themselves you know whether they want to
provide the passphrase whether they you
know are comfortable doing it but you
know the important thing to know is that
you don't have to if you know if the
government really really wants it you
know they can ask a judge to you know to
force you to disclose the word a
password to it but um it's it's possible
that you know in order like that would
probably be unconstitutional you know
you have a Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination which means that you
don't the government can't force you to
give testimonial evidence or you know
evidence that would you know just close
your thoughts the contents of your brain
in a way that would you know make it
more likely or possible for them to
prosecute your for something so if you
have any concerns along those lines you
can raise your Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination and you know
it's likely you know based on what the
courts have done so far it's likely that
the court would find you know we can't
compel you to disclose this password
because it would show that you have you
no control over the contents of the
computer and so you know that's always
something to keep in mind now our
constitutional rights don't exactly say
like they can look into our laptops or
any of our data because you know it was
made like four hundred years right
exactly what do they what do they call a
laptop and all of the data that's on the
laptop is it physical to them
yeah you know it's a really interesting
question because you know the
Constitution was written a long time ago
yeah the people who wrote it were never
contemplating things like computers and
oh yeah yeah and and the courts have
developed you know the rules over the
years but they've always done it in the
context of you know the physical world
yeah like when you're in the police
search your house or your car or right
and so you know what courts tend to do
is you know when they're faced with a
new situation and you know they've never
really thought about it before they'll
look at what they've done in the past
and say okay so this was a similar
situation so the rules there should
probably apply in this situation too and
so you know kind of by using those kinds
of analogies and you know the courts
have kind of come to different
conclusions about how to apply the
Constitution to things like computerized
at estate or well if frankly just court
to court and wow I mean you know they're
there can be you know differences in in
you know federal courts and the way that
they come down on things but you know
some courts have said okay a laptop is
like a kid's like a box it's like a
container right and the stuff inside it
is you know the stuff that you would you
know find in a container so it's kind of
like a filing cabinet or a briefcase or
something like that yeah like a like a
like it like a briefcase right okay so
that's you know what what some courts
have said and as a general matter if you
have a reasonable expectation of privacy
in a container and they need a warrant
to look in the container so the court
said okay well you need a warrant to
look in the computer but then you know
other courts have said well you know the
different disks in a laptop or a
computer are different containers and
other ones have said you know different
files on a computer are different
containers yeah do they actually have
the right to go through all of my files
and everything just to find one certain
thing that they're looking for well you
know it's it's an interesting question
it depends on the circumstances right
Wow and as a you know as a general
matter you know the the government has
to have a warrant to search something
there can be all sorts of exceptions to
the warrant requirement and if you're in
a situation where one of those exception
one of those exceptions applies then you
know you could be in a situation where
and you know the government has the
right to look at everything on your
phone or your laptop without a warrant
at all so on
you know these are these are things that
are I think evolving all the time yeah I
know the courts are constantly
struggling to try to figure out the best
way to apply the law yeah also to to
things like laptops and phones yeah you
know it's it's kind of a you know it's
kind of a new world right and you know
they're they're still figuring out the
rules what about things like cloud data
and just email like on my gmail account
can they look through that kind of stuff
so the courts have been really really
slow to try to figure out the way that
you know the Fourth Amendment applies to
data held you know your data held by
third parties you know aside from the
Fourth Amendment issues there's this
whole big complicated series of laws
that you know requires the government to
to have certain you know to meet certain
standards but before they can get
certain types of your data yeah like for
example if they want to you know
intercept you know your email if they
want to you know actually get your email
as it's in transit from point A to point
B you know they're supposed to get a
warrant I hope so yeah and but if they
want to get stored email like let's say
you have a gmail account and they want
to get you know email of yours that's
you know more than six months old all
right archive stuff yeah your yeah your
archive stuff then they may not have to
actually meet that standard they may
have a lower standard and really there's
a whole you know complicated scheme and
it depends on whether if the data
they're interested in is you know
content you know a real content of an
email for example or I am yeah or
whether it's it's non content like you
know information that doesn't really
reveal so much about you right like for
example the data the routing data that
gets information you know gets an email
from you know point A to point B I know
that there's a lesser standard for that
kind of thing but and then they're like
there are laws in every state that cover
this ground too so it's all very
complicated but you know aside from that
statutory framework and there was a
court um you know a fairly high level an
appeals court that just last month found
that the Fourth Amendment protects your
email that is stored by commercial ISPs
and that's a really big deal yeah you
know this is something of course that
that the Electronic Frontier Foundation
has been hoping for for a long time and
you know we were involved in that case
and we were very very happy with the
outcome and you know we think that's the
right result yeah yeah and you know but
you know it calls into question you know
some of the laws that are on the books
now like the one that i mentioned that
says that you know the government can
get you know email that's older just
stored email that's older than six
months old with less than a warrant
because you know if the Fourth Amendment
protects it then you know they really
have to get a warrant before they can
get email from into the provider for the
most part so Wow yeah you know I'm sure
that you've brought up a ton of
questions for a viewer is like a ton of
stuff that they probably want to google
now do you have a website where they can
go and find out more information
absolutely an eff work eff torg awesome
thank you so much thank you thank you
for having me if you are an IT or
software consultant you're always
looking to compete with the big guys the
problem is you may be a one-man show you
need a remote support tool and the best
is go to assist express the faster you
can connect to a customer the faster you
can move on to the next challenge reduce
the travel time and increase revenue by
supporting multiple requests brought to
you by Citrix you know go to assist

special offer visit go to assist calm /
hak5 again that's go to assist calm /
hak5 or a free trial trans good to see
you again I know you guys do lots of fun
stuff over I hacked last time we spoke
it was all about zombies yes what are
you breaking now we're breaking evite
now we have discovered some issues and
just like kind of like basically their
API that we can call into and dump out
data and alter data become different
users and make comments as people that
didn't say certain things we can delete
users from the the invitation how did
you stumble across this problem in the
evite well I actually received my first
evite back in 2006 and ever since that I
was picking on it just having fun you
know me
comments that's people and I decided to
turn it over to evite and they said well
we have this new version coming out
which is their kind of a clear just went
back in 06 yeah okay well I only
disclosed it like last September all
right but because I've been you know
it's kind of fun to just like it was it
was harmless but then when this new
version came out I found so many other
bugs with them that you know I turned
all that data over and I gave him I mean
less September we had a while that's
when I gave full disclosure to them and
I told that I was going to speak at
shmoocon about yes so there must have
fixed everything before shmoocon because
as soon as you give your talk
everybody's gonna know how to you know
hack evite and then it'll be mayhem
right the end that's exactly but yeah
you know how the security and business
don't go hand in hand so so they hired a
you know team to come in and fix the
stuff right oh yeah sure you you would
think that but no that did not happen oh
that's no good well what is the extent
of the problem and how do you stumble
how'd you originally even stumble across
it we're just viewing sores or trying
we're using tools like chick toe or
nikto or that basically i was just using
chrome because chrome has that inspect
element function inside that yeah it's
kind of like firebug for fired exactly
so where I'm able to look at the raw
code of as it's being dumped out and I
was seeing what is like a GI d which
means it's a guest ID that's what makes
up their security so i was able to grab
all those g IDs and plug them back into
the browser oh just like in the URL
right and so then what would happen is i
would actually become that user and I
could make a comment that they didn't
say whose do not need a password no I
mean there isn't a pass the GID is that
basically the password so that's the
fundamental flaw in the entire structure
of the website is that and I can
understand on on their aspects it's like
oh we want it to be the barrier to entry
you know lower the barrier of entry so
you can invite your guests and they can
just click the link in bad comments and
stuff like that exactly and not have to
log in right they wanted to make it very
easy to do that but in doing that if
let's say the user said hey come to my
party and posted their URL out on like
we'll just say Twitter then even if
their party was private you're still
able to go in the back and dump out all
that data how do you see it well it's
written in JSON so it actually just
dumps out in like text and I just wrote
a PHP tool that parsed all that so I
could have all the email addresses and
the users and if they said they're
coming or not coming or undecided and
thing that's really scary is like I even
found like I think it was a democratic
party for all the sponsors so people
like big name yeah who like made
donations so I was able to see their
personal information if they were coming
or if they posted a message to the hose
like Oh we'll be out of town just stuff
like that it just became really scary
that's privacy violation that's so tell
me it's not like they have like an API
so you're saying you just built this PHP
to lure do that yeah i mean it's it's
really all it is is a mean it does act
like an API but basically the website
when you go to evite it looks for this
that string and it parses out what
should be shown based on what's in this
Jason script like if it says private
party then the website knows okay don't
show this information but if you
actually go to that script you just get
every all the whole entire gamut of
usernames the g ids events who's coming
all that sort of stuff and how would you
go about like you know logging in is
well i mean obviously the guest doesn't
have any sort of security but the person
you know running it they're gonna have
some security right i mean it when you
create an event you have to sign up for
the service with the username and
password right correct they do have a
just where they get the host as the
event ID and that will ask you to log in
but i was able to i guess the main thing
that i wanted to see was if i could
become the host and make a
as them yeah and I did determine that
when posting to evite I could just use
the the guest ID of false and put in any
user name so i could put in the hosts
name and say like we could change the
party to say like it's going to be a
costume party now oh yeah so no
absolutely yeah wedding reception in
like yeah they're just like oh yeah I
thought it was a costume party but
everybody show up is a zombie any even
if I do that to a user the user is not
able to change that comment because it's
it did not formulate correctly so only
those guests ideas can alter those
comments but luckily the host is kind of
like the mothership that can delete any
comment okay but I did find that I can
delete the host from their own invite
and mellow your own party so yeah when
they click on the link for their party
one if they just sign in normally
instead of clicking on the link that
comes in their email it doesn't show up
anymore it's not in their profile but if
they happen to know if they happen to
click on the email it will say like
you're not invited and so you can add
and bring back people and just add
things like host equals yes and stuff
like that what's really interesting as
you say that you know you get the email
addresses of them you know you got the
email address of the host spoofing
emails you know really easy you can
create comments you're even showing me
how the site susceptible to cross-site
scripting attacks so as far as like a
vector for fishing is concerned
especially like the spear fishing where
you're really trying to exploit like
human trust you know if you're like a
guest to a party most likely you have a
relationship with that person and
probably wouldn't think twice or like oh
here's an update to the party you know
and then you may have a size and make it
almost look like a you know an evite
link yeah you bring up another great
problem I mean just like it's going on
and on and on but they have a capability
to email all the guests from evite
themselves so as the host you can send
out an up
to everyone and you as the hacker can
not do that yes I can as long as you i
have any authenticated it doesn't matter
if i'm not if the host cookie i can use
any authentication cookie and send
everyone that's invited and even leave
the host off so they had no idea that i
sent all their guests a link that says
you know now i'm selling viagra click on
this link you know you could do click
fraud and stuff like that or a
client-side attack yeah just and yes a
fake AV and owned the Democratic Party
yeah it even it because it even comes
from the ho it has the host email and it
just says you know the invitation from
evite and update I'm i can put code in
that post as well so i can have it have
an image in the email one thing when i
was doing the research on here when i
got my invite i did see that evite logo
showed up without me clicking display
all images and i was like how is this
done there's a function called cid and
what they've done is that that's
actually trailing in the headers so they
just put the image in the headers and
they source it out instead of having you
know WWE google com / gif source that
way they just do cid and then evite bar
so i was able to mimic that same image
just shrink it down as they please click
this link below and they think it looks
like the evite logo you made it to just
kind of build that trap that trust even
more interesting you're also mentioning
something about facebook how does that
come into play with this well facebook
has kind of like a would be like a
skeleton key if you have an event ID and
a GID that's what allows you in to view
the invitation but on facebook they've
given them just FB as the guest ID
that's like how they post out to the
social network all right because when
you do that you don't have to like add
it as an application you know you just
you just you can send it out to like
little off yeah so once you you do that
though you're kind of exposing your
email list as well as like anyone else
that's coming
comments stuff like that so if you just
have the event and your guests ID equals
FB you're able to access the invitation
wow scary stuff and they had so what is
what's led you to disclose this way and
what kind of concerns you had as far as
a hacker and disclosure and
responsibility well the problem is is
like all those fundamental errors got me
some ways they just broke yeah they
stack up on topic of each other because
I can even ask them about users because
they have profiles on there it will tell
me out the window yeah I will tell me if
the user is currently signed in it will
tell me your birthdate like all your
information that you use to sign up is
also just blatantly open if this was
facebook and naughty vite this would be
like all over every media outlet exactly
and I mean if I it's still really you
know important because people have been
using this for I mean it's not even the
greatest you know invitation type of
online software anyway but it's just the
one that people have been using for last
decade anyway so it's just like common
name Kleenex yeah it's kind of your de
facto standard in that case when you
contacted them but they just not like to
just 10 days ago to rewrite their entire
you know well actually when I wrote them
they immediately wrote me back and they
were very interested but um you know
time and money I don't know I'm if it
works good then why not why fix it
something like that but we'll see what
what all this turns out because I really
would hope that they would do some type
of authenticating at least a cookie sort
of speak to fix something some of this
stuff yeah great well you know thanks
for for talking to us yeah no problem
it's getting the right stuff but what
can people find out more of the stuff
that you guys do with I hacked we're
actually going to be launching a brand
new site it's gonna have some really
cool stuff so and then the next few
months but the site is WWI
hacked in past tense calm awesome thank
you so much right thank you kseniya
running your own server doesn't have to
cost fortune domain.com virtual private
server start at just 3495 a month and
include all the tools you need to manage
any size website in fact our very own
site hak5 org is running on one now take
charge with cpanel classical even ssh in
with root access get a domain for under
ten bucks and reliable hosting 45
support hak5 by supporting domain com as
a hack 5 viewer you can get an
additional fifteen percent off your
order when you checkout with coupon code
hak5 your next big idea starts at
domain.com so bed thank you for joining
me today um what is it what is it
exactly that you do um security
contractor security contract okay so
kind of help manage projects look at
them see how they're working try to make
sure that the they're doing being done
the correct way gender kind of a jack of
all trades master of none hey Joe about
being a janitor because I just gotta go
in clean up all the businesses it's fun
okay understandable yeah now I I know
that you did a talk the other day about
like printer well printer ownage
basically how did you figure that out um
ultimately I was originally asked to
actually try to steal documents from
printers and so we started playing
around with that and that was about the
only thing I couldn't do on the
particular one we read the print data
yeah yeah it comes out okay certain
manufacturers you can the particular
ones we were playing around with were a
lot of the big HP printers that you find
all over the place in fact it well yeah
six or seven of them there was at least
seven of them behind hotel registration
here yes and I will bet a lot of money
that they are vulnerable yeah i actually
had i used to work at a bank nameless
bank and they had the HP like the
network printers so the prayers that you
hack these are all the network ones yeah
yeah not your moms like ink jet well
some of the multifunction printers the
MF piece okay um they've got some
storage at space that we can use so yeah
those it's starting to blur the lines
between an enterprise device a home
device
yeah all the newer ones that could do
like scanning and faxing whatnot yeah
okay so ultimately what I was trying to
do obviously we still documents I can do
that so I start looking some of the
other features i had their there's some
pjo hacks that been known for years I
mean I remember mess around the stuff
back when I was in high school no it's
PG 00 p GL stands for printer job
language it's a formatting language that
you kind of wrap around a print job when
you send it to the printer in it and
parcel of you and says okay I need to do
this this and this okay um there there
are some interesting commands such as
uploading and downloading a files
listing of directories I there's a SNMP
back door well I've been calling it back
door it's actually a documented feature
hmm back door yeah yeah I have no idea
why they would do this but they chose to
so anyways using all of these commands I
started saying okay well I've got one
printer here and it's only got 20 banks
okay I've got 50 of them so let's
aggregate all that storage together into
kind of this and I hate the word cloud
but cloud-based storage device and
basically you end up with a little tftp
terminal style kind of tool and you say
upload and it compresses the file
encrypts the file stores the file under
a random generally randomly
generated file name on two devices okay
and the reason why we do two devices is
because most of the time you're storing
these files in a ram disks which means
if you reboot the computer great yeah
poof there goes all your files there
that's kind of a double-edged sword
because I can remotely reboot them which
means by by forensic evidence or you
know somebody can flip it off and I was
all my stuff so I simply store in two
different locations with an attempt say
okay fine you know I've lost this one
but maybe it's still over here ah it's
kind of interesting the space adds up
really really quickly I ripped through
two small buildings of the place where i
work at and all of all of their stuff i
had some 50 I'd gigs with the storage
Wow no I got kind of lucky because I got
a couple of the MFPs the MFPs will
actually have full hard drive sometimes
okay so you'll get 30 40 gigs out of one
of those verses maybe 20 or 30 I didn't
even know that they were that vulnerable
to attacks
it's not necessarily vulnerable it's
just a poor design i mean p jl the
documentation that I'm working off of is
from 97 out some of the other stuff
serious yeah wow so it needs to be
updated older than dirt I've been told
that it's going away but when you figure
that these people are spending it's not
something that anybody thinks out of
date three to four thousand dollars in a
big network printer you don't replace
them yeah until they break when I work
for an HMO and we had stuff there that
was probably 12 to 15 years old oh yeah
we had some old stuff where I used to
work too you know it's a prayer so you
know it's kind of neat when you can
aggregate all the storage locally um
what's really interesting is I was
sharing you know some of the stuff I was
working with a couple other people they
came back to me and they're like so do
you realize this works across the
Internet really which means ok you can
aggregate storage across multiple
countries that's getting really
interesting okay show me about that
event um that that's really all there
was to it it was one of those things
like oh okay thank you we're gonna mess
around with that again okay all right
yeah yeah it's I actually took a look at
the IP chains and real quick testing
somebody was doing for me in there there
they came back there like a Giga storage
16 devices five different countries
that's kind of cool Wow yeah they didn't
know that was possible so yeah there
there is actually a lot of Brenner's
that are just open on the internet port
9100 you know what's really cool is this
is all unauthenticated stuff so you know
you've got print FS you've got the p jl
PFS password i'm mixing all the tools i
had the the PFS scanner which is
actually what goes out and determines
whether or not a printer supported and
it's really cool because it's kind of
polymorphic it's multi-threaded
functions get called and random mortgage
with random sleeps and so the idea being
that the network traffic well similar
you can't compare one scan of one device
to another and have the same so it's
just kind of a hey this was fun to write
and I'm going to laugh the IDS guys a
little bit so what kind of fun stuff can
you do to other people's printers um
some of the other things the LCD rewrite
has been done
for years I simply took it right the LCD
on the outside of the machine yeah I
took it a step further and said okay
fine let's update it in mass so social
engineering hacks is kind of funny on I
had a we did an animated roflcopter
dropping all their skaters and fished it
out to whole bunch of devices oh that's
great oh that would confuse the masses
yeah I Nazca penis looks God what's more
it's going on with my printer oh it's
kind of interesting from a social
engineering standpoint you know you
start I was picking on somebody and I
said hey device broken please call X
number for support Tillich 7th realized
it's his number so you could actually do
some kind of funny interesting things
that um you can actually break all the
devices you could either send them into
a mass reboot loop you can essentially
connect to these devices and stay
connecting the only accept one
connection at a time so nobody else can
talk to them yeah so you could
essentially shut them down if you really
wanted to UM all sorts of really just
kind of nifty annoying stuff the printer
file system is what I really kind of
enjoyed out of it yeah say you know I
and somebody else mentioned in one of
their other talks of leveraging hey now
we've got this free storage you know I
get into this network why go use ones
trip wires or a server with trip wire or
something out it's for my files when I
can just store it on the printer ignores
it so it's just kind of this mystery
covert storage that nobody ever really
thinks about Wow exists yeah when you're
done you've collected and you want and
simply exfiltrate out to the internet
and yeah that's kind of hilarious yes
but for now is this open source like are
you still working on it um it is open
source it's all written entirely in
Python it's all extremely documented
I've gotten kind of bored working with
it so I figured I'd release it and say
okay here's how you work with everything
come there there's a back-end pjl
library there's the there's a pjl
password that can be set on these
devices to actually lock the discs right
to them yeah the problem is it's one to
65535 which means it's really really
easy to crash so I've got a multi sort
of cracker for that oh so i'll be
releasing all of that stuff it's a fun
tools yeah the the support tool like the
user interface for it's a little broken
right now as soon as i get it fixed i'll
be releasing that code i'm just horribly
horribly busy
I understand so it should be up in on
the remote exploit website here within a
week or so okay well make sure you let
our viewers know what the website is
remote exploit org it's where they used
to host backtrack sweet so I'm sure they
all know where that's at oh yes yes
probably every single one of them knows
where that is then thank you so much for
