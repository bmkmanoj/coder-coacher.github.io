by domain.com hello welcome back to hack
5 I'm still here with Peter and we are
putting together to drum you're getting
it all wired up now and I'm super
excited it has been following along
we've taken the Lisa AM with the
paparazzi and we've been building out
this bumblebee quadcopter and we should
we should get to the air but before then
I guess we need to plug everything in
right yes yes so we we assembled most of
it in the last segment and we want to we
didn't plug in the brains so we need our
copilot as we as we used to call him and
we have several parts that are necessary
to to actually get into it in air so
we've already talked about some of the
basic hardware as far as the motors the
electronic speed controllers on our
flight controller but we need this to be
able to get sensory input and also input
from us the primarily yes yes
so one thing we already have the motor
controllers on so what we just did
between we just mounted the Lisa M onto
the board so as I was saying we have
four bolts and I added some nuts
underneath and then we just plug it in
and screw it on so it is nice and tight
yes nice so when the aircraft moves the
Lisa will move which is good because it
has the gyroscopes and the
accelerometers and the magnetometer
that's exactly right there is also a
different approach to this to actually
decouple it a vibration decouple it some
of the auto pilots do that and our our
phase velocity or paparazzi philosophy
is actually give it as much sensory
input as possible and also studentid as
safely as possible because then you
don't get harmonics into the airframe
that are vibrating in the wrong
frequency so here you have if you have
vibration they're very high frequency
because it's stiff something stiffen
makes high-pitched sound when you would
you say it's like more precise than if
you were mounting the flight controller
with foam yes it is more precise because
you are not make
oh no machine is no machinist and so we
already have a couple of servos going
into these leads here what are these so
these are the signal outputs from the
autopilot to the motor controllers so we
have a wire go to the servo several
connectors here so there's the signal
going out and there's ground power and
signal in this motor control is actually
there is no power on them so they don't
provide any power that's why we need an
additional component that is actually
taking the battery voltage and stepping
it down to because batteries are like 12
volts or more depending on how many
cells you have sure and this is why we
have this guy here so what is this this
is a micro BC and there's a B EC it's a
battery elimination circuit and what
exactly is a battery elimination is just
a voltage regulator okay what did you
just say it's a voltage regulator it's
its historical it's like I see modeling
stereos what it is yeah that's right so
this is a three amp one it is a
switching voltage regulator not a linear
it's nice and efficient right because
these little jst pigtails here come out
of our Dean's connector at the back and
this is what actually ends up getting
plugged into our in our case a 3-cell
battery and this is gonna provide around
12 volts you know yeah between 11 point
depending how much charge we already
used up and we could just feed it the 12
volts yes we could probably better to
give it a consistent voltage yeah it is
it is definitely a better thing to
provide your sensitive electronics with
a consistent source of power so while
this pigtail here is breaking off into
these different connectors which will
that eventually go to our motors we have
this fifth one here free so let's plug
that in alright and then you we have to
BC plugged in we select it there is a
jumper you can select five volts or six
volts it doesn't really matter much for
the for the Lisa M it can it can as we
said we could plug in directly the
12-volt battery it load
be able to deal with it but it is a
better choice to do otherwise and we
just choose one one of the free
connectors okay because they are
connected together so we provide it with
power and let's let's plug it into the
last one so the negatives on the bottom
the positive is in the middle and then
the signal is always on the top it's
always on the top yes if you if you
forget what it is you can look on the
board and the silk screen down to the
board on the PC board we're gonna switch
okay so how are we going to talk to the
Lisa now yes so to talk to it - as we
were mentioning before we decided to use
spectrum okay there's a couple of
different protocols in fact as far as
like your remote controls are concerned
and spectrum has two very popular
flavors it's the DSM 2 and DSM X both of
them operated at 2.4 gigahertz so it's
unlicensed spectrum and it does some
really cool like a frequency hopping and
it's a resilient protocol so we're just
gonna use it because it's kind of a
industry standard there are some others
but this one's the nice part is compared
to some other brands they also have
receivers and transmitters what spectrum
has is are these satellites so instead
of having air so when you say satellites
I'm thinking about things orbiting the
Earth but what you really mean is this
isn't a traditional receiver and so yes
so traditionally in RC you have a
receiver that looks almost like the
design itself it has a lot of connectors
on it and it is quite big and bulky and
it is needed because you are using it
directly to connect to servers on motors
okay in our case we have the Lisa I'm
doing that for us so we don't need all
those connectors in the additional book
so the Lisa so the paparazzi actually
has a dsm2 receiver in software yeah and
it really just needs a radio a radio and
the radio so spectrum is using those as
their diversity solution so that you
connect to the main receiver these
satellites oh that's really nice because
these satellites since they are made to
plug into a main
caper which is usually around 5060 I've
seen even seen him more than that these
these guys are like $10 yeah these are
these are you can get them in China from
from many stores and since we're putting
two in this actually is really nice
diversity we've been talking about this
on a radio series essentially what this
going to allow us to do is mount both of
these one of them say horizontally and
one of them vertically so it doesn't
matter if our transmitter is polarized
vertically or horizontally when we're
holding it it's going to you know use
the best signal that receives yeah yeah
the donuts that you were talking about
you have hope then then to donuts is
offset by 90 degrees Monday we haven't
even had lunch yet so where does this go
so this one plugs in into this 6-pin
connector we have a premade pigtail
that's has plenty of connectors on this
board yeah I'm so surprised I'm
realizing it is really like a
development platform that's like yeah we
we have a plenty of stuff so we have
this connector for the two receivers but
we also have besides the telemetry port
this is we were talking about that in a
second and GPS connector we also have
SPI connector for high-speed
connectivity and we have i-square see
actually two of them and and also
control area network so come really this
is this is really hacker and developer
friendly as far as like if you want to
throw in some accessories nobody thought
about before
yeah for you UAV development board say
that this sure let's hook up an Iridium
satellite modem I don't know whatever
there's actually a driver for that so
next thing so we are receiving some
commands from our transmitter right for
example this DX six or junior or
anything that speaks the dsm2 protocol
that's nice so we're not actually though
we're using spectrum we're not kind of
limiting ourselves as far as like a
vendor is concerned we're really using a
vendors protocol and there's a couple of
different people making part making
different and different a double dose
yes exactly it's the day
an ecosystem oh all right the next thing
we want to do is also to get the
telemetry out of it yes you remember
that before we were connecting directly
to the board over a USB - so we're not
going to use a really long and USB
extension cable - it's called tethered
but I think it is easier if we go to the
wireless yes there are several different
options so what you actually want is a
serial radio modem and there are several
solutions like one of it's the way this
is just a wireless UART this is a
wireless yes serial link yeah that's it
that's it so it's like bits through the
air that nothing more yeah not
complicated at all yeah and there's
there's again a plethora of different
options that you can choose out of so
what is this guy so this guy is using a
different is M band than the 2.4
gigahertz ok so again it's an unlicensed
spectrum unlicensed spectrum it's 950
megahertz
it is for us use because this right
that's totally legal in the United
States if you're elsewhere you may need
to consider some alternative in Europe
for example you can get the same module
for 433 megahertz okay and for Europe
for example and then you use that
frequency and you're a good janitor as
well can I recall okay yes and so this
is one it has an open source firmware in
it so you can also hack on the radio
modem itself and but it's a pretty much
plug and play if your radio modem yeah
the other solution is using ZigBee they
are they are also available 60 is a cool
protocol because it's over 2.4 gigahertz
and it does all the you know spreads
back yeah and all of it sodium or what
but yet so the interesting interesting
thing is because you have the
transmitters the RC transmitters also on
2 / 4 2.4 gigahertz this is on also on
2.4 gigahertz one could say well it
might be better to use different
frequencies that's why we are using the
915
megahertz one use all the spectrum I use
all the spectrum and just spread your
spread your wings
yeah okay so where does this guy go okay
this guy and we also have a pigtail here
and the nice thing is this guy it's
again I think hobbyking sells them
already with a molex connector so all of
these all of these right here are molex
connectors very similar to what I was
used to on you know building pcs back in
the day except it's just the smaller
it's the brand or the type of the
connector is called pico blade okay and
you can find the pre crimped wires for
this and housings on the internet so the
connector for this is here
of course everything of that is
documented in the wiki if it's like all
the i/o so we just plug in and plug it
in here and the other receiving site
would be a USB dongle like this oh nice
so we'll just go ahead and plug that
into our computer and then our ground
station will receive the telemetry from
here yeah very similar to when we had it
plugged in USB yeah it's it's a wireless
serial cable that's all it is like USB
through the air yeah and last but not
least let's plug in also a GPS it's it's
a standard u-blox yeah
so this is a company out of switzerland
that is making chipsets and there's a
lot of different manufacturers and
vendors produce this kind of modules
that you that have serial out okay so oh
is it this is so it does all of the GPS
receiving in math and then it just
provides you with a serial data link of
what it's seeing
yeah it's give you like NEMA or an enemy
and then yes you never pronounced that
yeah so you can choose to use anaemia
but in paparazzi we also implemented the
proprietary binary protocol of you
blocks the reason for that is Annamayya
is a text protocol that you have to
parse so this is faster this is faster
more reliable because it's just the
binary protocol it is also stable for
already a very long time so there were
not real changes so we have a very
stable driver that does this nice also
what we
also have is a special driver so you
don't have to configure this using your
PC in some other cases you might need to
and you just plug it in and the Lisa and
will send all they needed commands to
configure the GPS to or its needs what
it needs for example when you're
estimating the position in GPS you want
to have a model of what you are so it is
switching to an aircraft instead of a
car and so you have a better better more
accurate position oh nice
because that's the case with GPS is
going to be different like as far as you
know on the ground versus our altitude
yeah the dynamics of your thing that you
are measuring the position of plays a
role in in calculating out the
coordinates where you are yeah alright
so that exactly everything else here
another another small connector and so
now the last thing is we just need to
find a way to actually get our
transmitter to speak to this so we can
yeah so first of all we probably should
power it so we have the battery okay so
that's just gonna go in oh one thing
Dean if you have access to a lab supply
lab power supply that has
current-limiting mm-hmm it is a very
good idea when you're putting it
together for the first time instead of
using a battery that if you want 100
amps out of it and probably would
deliver and if you have a short it's it
might end in a disaster so a limiting
power supply is a very good thing to do
then you can limit it to a few hundred
milliamps you connect it and if it is
shorted so you did something wrong you
crushed some wires you will not cause a
fire okay but we already tested this we
know that this should work famous last
words
there we go I love that although I don't
remember plugging in a speaker to this
so the motor control is actually they
oscillate to one of the two phases just
two phases of the three and then cause
the motor to vibrate and the more
is actually making this out the the
moderates yeah the motor is the speaker
now unplug apply again I have to see
this so you're saying that this motorway
here is acting as a speaker yes go ahead
okay this is really subtle very subtle I
totally saw it like wiggle it's like
it's it's moving yeah Wow fantastic it's
like those the motes are from a disk
drive or something like that yeah that's
that's the way to do it and in some
cases you can even program the EEOC's to
actually play the music that you compose
yourself okay and then I guess after
this point we've got our receivers here
yeah and so what we need to do is the
next step would be so we tested it it
powers up the motor controls the the
pattern of the beeps means that it is
receiving a signal so the outer pilot is
sending some some basic commands to it
so it is working fine
this particular motor contrasts it
really depends on the brand which one
you choose what the sound patterns are
there is not really a standard but some
beeping pattern normally in the
documentation if there is one you will
find out what it means in this case they
will just stay silent if they are not
getting any signal okay in some other
cases they will make one beep and so on
and so on so check check your
documentation of what the particular
motor control is - so we have it powered
on it's all blinks everything is great
so we want to bind it to our remote
control now so that they because we are
using 2.4 gigahertz so let me tell you a
little bit history I mean previously in
all their systems you were using 72
megahertz band and you actually were
putting a crystal for a certain
frequency into your transmitter and into
your receiver and you were based -
that's the way you were connecting them
together so somebody also the same
crystal it's had the same crystal you
had a clash so there were on so if you
get out to the flying
and your buddy here is using the same
frequencies you you have to unsolder
your crystal pop a new one in only in
sockets but still still Wow so you had
boards and clips that you were attaching
to boards to to say I am using that
frequency and put it on your hand and
then if somebody else like shows up
doesn't know that that's what you're
flying with turns on stomps on your
control are you falling at this guy
yes so you had some organizational and
logistic challenges to deal that I
wasn't in the hobby then yeah so this is
much easier it is digital and digital so
it has a key that they exchange and they
know okay you are you I am i and we are
meant to be together
okay it is a pretty cool protocol yes so
then then how do we bind this okay so we
need to tell the autopilot to actually
tell the satellites that they should
bind okay so what we do is let's unplug
the battery once again and in this case
we have a bind plug that we plug in into
this central connector here okay this
this is all changeable and I it might
change when you're watching this video
so we might change where it is okay but
this is very this before it's like a
jumper it's a jumper okay it's just
telling it to please do bind okay we
plug in the battery Oh what we get they
they start blinking like crazy yep and
that means they're waiting for a
transmitter to be switched on in bind
mode okay and pair and so you just do
that with your transmitter so this one
is like I have I use the gr and it again
depends on the transmitter you check
your documentation press the button on
the back switch it on and then it you
will see that they just stopped they
just stopped another they are in colder
solid and they go out and come become
solid that means they are bound and now
we can unplug the bind plug mm-hmm and
if we and now we can check that it is
everything all right in it remember it
everything so let's switch off the
transmitter
unplug the battery plug in the battery
in again and switch on the transmitter
and we will see that these should go
solid that means and there they go there
they go great though we're bound we
about alright well in the coming segment
we are going to go ahead and get this
guy calibrated because he does have a
lot of sensors that kind of need to know
where they are and that means once
that's done oh yeah we will I yeah yeah
we are we are really close to the maiden
flight we will connect it to the
computer get some telemetry data to see
that everything is configured right do
the calibration as you said and make
sure that the transmitter is being
received correctly so don't make
physical things happen before you don't
don't like you know ignite this and
throttle up right yeah not like you've
got propellers plugged in but yes so
coming up maths but until then we're
taking a quick break you know it doesn't
matter if you think that open-source
encryption software has been
circumvented by the government or if the
open-source encryption software has been
made by the government the whole time if
you have a conspiracy theory you need a
website a website needs a domain and you
can get those over at domain.com and
with their quick fast discovery system
you can discover all sorts of domain
names that you can check out with with
their easy checkout processes have your

and it's now time for the tightening
last photo of the week and this week's
comes from ilari ilari said I was
reading about polarized films for my
computer to stop people saying what I am
doing this would be super helpful on an
airplane then I found Instructables page
on how to make a spy screen and decided
to use it on my old laptop it looks
super awesome and I personally loved it
so thank you so much he larry's for
sending that in and we have the
instructables link as well in the show
notes for you guys if you want to check
that out of course if you guys have any
photos that you want to share with us
email them over to feedback at hak5 org
with the subject line titanal west we've
been hearing a lot of information lately
about TrueCrypt and a lot of people
think that well it might have been
hacked or others think that the
developers might have just left the
entire project in other people's hands
we don't really know what's going on
with TrueCrypt just yet at the time of
this episode's recording but since a lot
of people have been asking about
alternative encryption techniques and
what else can I do to protect myself
against you know the big guys up there I
decided to take a look at something
interesting with Kali Linux so there is
a way to make Kali Linux not only
persistent on your USB so that you end
up keeping the same files keeping the
same customizations and everything every
time you boot off of it but also
including Luke's encryption l UK s
encryption so I just decided to go ahead
and go at it and make my USB persistent
and encrypted yay so this is actually
pretty easy it requires Linux and then
it requires about a 8 gig thumb drive as
well as the ISO off of Kali org and this
in particular is Linux Kali Linux
version 1.0 point 7 so that's the brand
new updated version that allows you to
do this encrypted aka and also
persistent version of it so first off on
my terminal I have gone ahead and moved
over to my desktop and you'll notice
over on my desktop I had the kali linux
1.0 point 7 already downloaded as an iso
folder and I also have my Corsair thumb
drive already in my computer it doesn't
if you have any files on your USB Drive
already because we're going to use DD to
reformat the entire thing so you'll be
fine now I've gone ahead in my terminal
and went ahead and switched over to a
sudo su so I'm root for the entire
process if you don't do sudo su space -
and then put in your password so your
root for the whole thing it's going to
require you to put in sudo before like
every single command in this process so
just do it at the beginning and you
won't have to deal with that so moving
on I have moved over to my desktop since
that's where the ISO is and I'm going to
go ahead and do DD so DD to reformat the
entire drive and then you type in if
equals kalise and then I just tab over
to find the ISO folder ISO file and then
I press space of equals slash dev slash
SD B and I believe this one is - and I'm
going to check that with mount I believe
it is yet mount whoops yeah here's the
Corsair and it's SD b1 okay cool so SD
be I actually don't even need that SD be
one or two on there I can just leave it
at SD B and then I type in B s equals
one
m and then hit enter so this process
takes about I'd say three minutes or so
so while you're waiting just don't have
a beer and then when it's done I'll
continue okay so we see that 3.1 gigs
has been copied and this is the total
size of that file I have checked it and
also if you do want to watch the
percentage of that increase while you're
flashing your entire flash drive you can
use the kill command it's kill Tech us
r1 and then whatever the number is of
the flash drive now we are going to
create the lux partition in the flash
drive so this is going to be a
completely separate partition on the
flash drive that's going to be encrypted
and it's going to hold all the contents
so first off for this I'm going to
choose a size so I'm base
creating a sighs and we're gonna make it
five gigabytes press ENTER and it just
enters through so the next command we're
going to type in is going to basically
just create a new variable four bytes BC
M Kelly and we look for the ISO file
we're going to pipe that to tail TAC one
and also if you are unfamiliar with any
of these commands that we are using we
talked about several of them during the
Linux terminal 101 series on hack tips
so it would be a good idea to check
those out as well so let's see make sure
I wrote that right so we're going to
read bytes to do BC and Kali Linux ISO
that's correct
pipe tail tack one and that's a
semicolon echo bytes perfect okay to 997
so we want to remember that number and
the next thing we are going to do is the
parted commands we're going to part
slash dev slash s DB which is the flash
drive and we're making a partition part
make part primary with the bytes stated
above and the size stated above press
ENTER and this is going to happen your
will get a couple warnings during this
so just hit yes during them and ignore
and they will be just fine
no yes we know yes we know okay so after
that you have made a new partition so
now can actually set up the new
encryption that we have we are going to
create so you're gonna do that with
crypt setup
and we're going to use the verbose
command to make sure that we see
everything verify password or passphrase
sorry so this is going to let us create
a new pass phrase for the specific
partition that we're creating Luke's
format which is the type of encryption
/dev slash s db2 and then hit enter this
is going to erase overwrite data yes I
am sure now we can move on to the next
step which is more of the encryption
technique this is going to be crypt
setup again we're going to open that
encryption so looks open with that
capital o and then slap slash dev slash
s DB to my underscore USB and if this
does not work correctly ok cool it
worked
yay so that might not work you might
have to nano into this new file to
create information inside of the file
and I'll let show you that in just a
moment
the next command looks like this mkfs
ext3 a capital L tech capital l
persistence so this is creating the
persistence slash dev slash mapper slash
my underscore USB press ENTER and this
is going to take a few moments for it to
complete there we go and then we're
going to create the label of this
persistence so we're going to call it e
to label slash dev slash mapper my USB
and you should be able to tab complete
for that persistence and then press
ENTER and that was easy enough
now we're going to make a new directory
tack P and it's going to be slash mount
slash my USB press Enter
so that directory is completed now the
next step is mounting your USB so we're
going to mount slash dev slash mapper
slash my USB whoops
I forgot like half of that command so
that was dev map map map / my USB and
then we type in slash mount slash my USB
that should work okay there we go now we
want to move on to creating that my USB
file and having something actually
inside of it so for this command you use
echo if echo does not work we have Nano
as well that I mentioned previously so
we have slash Union is what you want to
include inside of that file we're going
to move it over to slash mount slash my
USB slash persistence awesome so it
looks like that worked and actually I'm
going to go into my directory and make
sure cat okay it worked okay so just to
make sure I went ahead and I catted my
file so I can make sure that slash Union
is inside my USB and now we're going to
unmount our flash drive alright so now
we type an unmount or you mount I'm
sorry about that you mount slash dev
slash mapper slash my USB hit enter and
it should be you mounted and then we
type in crypt setup space looks
close so we're closing out the
encryption slash dev slash mapper slash
my underscore us be okay hit enter and
it should be done alright so now we can
close out of our terminal and we can go
ahead and restart our computer and login
to Kali Linux and hopefully when you do
that you'll have the option to go into
your encrypted setup which will ask you
for your password of course and then
it'll go right into your persisted flash
drive and hopefully all your files
should be there so I'm gonna go ahead
and restart restart okay there it is yay
encrypted persistence
password
yay it works I love it when things work
correctly it's so exciting so now I have
my kali linux running off of my flash
drive which is persistent so it's saving
all my stuff's and it's also encrypted
so nobody can see my stuffs which is
great that's super exciting anyway if
you guys have an alternative method or
