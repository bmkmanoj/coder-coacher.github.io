by domain.com it's okay guys
we understand you didn't make the choice
it's just what they gave you at work
you're stuck with it you run a V on the
home it's totally cool listen you can
still keep your stuff up in your cloud
encrypted and all happy and get to it
with your secure SSH cells you can't
notice with putty yes buddy was free and
easy putty and I use pageant made my
little I don't even need to spend this
later oh go on get on right by that okay
so I can do my own sshfs program and
this one is called expand drive expand
right calm it's a free well free for 30
day trial executable file you can buy it
it's 40 bucks for just a regular license
but so I don't know 40 bucks how do you
feel about that well I don't know how
much to pay for Windows you're on the
window side everything that you do yeah
hey you know I could play tux racer all
day long so take that battlefield -
that's true actually I would rather be
playing battlefield 2 although I guess I
would rather pay 20 or 30 40 bucks
instead of pay for like 25 gigs and
Dropbox
oh yes that's per year there's no this
is a one-time fee yeah now so like you
know whatever your is at your virtual
private server when you're dedicated or
whatever shell you have up in the cloud
you got to consider that I think it's
less expensive and you get more cuz as
we've shown you you can do socks5 proxy
to secure your stuff you can do your
storage there I've shown yes seem like
runs IRC bouncers we're gonna be doing
so much more with stuff in the cloud and
I love you guesses for that so alright
so sorry on the side yeah starting off
so it gives you this nice little page
here you have the choice of your drive
type SFTP FTP which is not very secure
Amazon s3 and strong space I like to say
that like strong bad because you check
the email with your box yeah exactly so
I chose SFTP and then down here you type
in your server for example ours was
cocoanuts Oh pack five burg and then I
put in my username whatever that might
be
oh you haven't set up SSH key pairs for
this so you actually so I haven't SSH
key pairs in this program yes you can't
so oh I should not say password that's
no so down here you have your port
nickname of course and then you can
choose your drive letter that it will
show up as your Windows Explorer which
is pretty cool so I'm gonna choose you
know as for snobs or whatever the heck
you choose and then right here password
public key or you can also choose
pageant yeah so very very handy I'm
really glad that this works with public
and private keys that makes it much much
more worth the price right so this is
like not piggybacking on an already
established SSH connection from putty
exact creates its own creases therefore
I don't even have to have patio open for
me to be able to do this or any that's
nifty I can see why if you were using
both the shell and the filesystem stuff
you might want to use pageant because
then you only have one thing they type
your passphrase into and then they both
can get access to that key yeah
regardless that's really cool that you
can do that and so that was it what else
that was it and then you just you can
choose to eject your drive or you can
show it in your Explorer so now if I go
to whoa my computer hates me when I
record there we go okay so now if I go
to computer I have this what looks like
an external hard drive yeah awesome as
far as your applications are concerned
that thinks that's one guy thinks it's
basically another external drive of some
sort whether it's used USB or whatever
so click in here and I have a nice gooey
access to all of my files which I only
have one in here of course but we don't
get mean what's to say there isn't like
a bunch of stuck in our graphic stuff it
could be like an entire GPG encrypted
message inside that you could have like
any way to that later but I just love
the fact that this is so easy it's only
40 bucks if you decided to use it you
know after that 40 days or 30 days and
yeah it's simple I like simple a detail
so there you go
you know options vac now you've shown
servers for Windows and clients for
Windows in both sides
clients private and service clients we
are gathered here today people join the
server isn't that wedding I would see
this past weekend the way the best man
during his speech he went marriage
marriage was just like yes all right
look at that we're gonna come back here
in just a bit with new trivia and
technolo suppose the week stay tuned
we'll be back after a quick break I'm
gonna take a quick moment and thank

Microsoft developed a 3d graphics arch
architecture in the late 1990s this
architecture was called what so what
you're not talking about DirectX you're
talking they actually create it up or
apparently so it was called talisman
which kind of reminds me of Sailor Moon
Sailor Moon yes that is anyway this
week's question
is both 4G technology is 3gpp LTE and
mobile WiMAX rely on this to make
efficient use of the available wireless
spectrum what's this called are you
