time on Metasploit minute this
Metasploit minute is brought to you by
hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at HHH all calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in
I'm your host Rob fuller but you can
call me moe Bix in this minute we are
breaking down what is Metasploit
essentially that's all it is like what
like what are we what are we talking
about
and really what Metasploit is is is a
exploitation framework and what I mean
by exploitation framework is that it's a
group of tools and utilities put
together to make exploit development sis
administration and and honing stuff
easier so in 2003 HT more decided that
the current state of exploit dev and it
was really sucky I mean he you have to
go out on stuff something like security
focus or or full disclosure and pull
down an exploit someone created and
Trust it all over their code doesn't RM
car f you compile it and just hope that
it works and a lot of the times it was
designed directly for specific Vernet
version or or specific language of an
operating system and you'd have to do
your own tweaks and and stuff like that
well what Metasploit did at that time
and it was in Perl yes we all hate Perl
was it made all of the generic pieces
like shellcode and and TCP connections
and it removed all of that into a
framework like instance where you could
use all of that and just concentrate
solely on that exploit now let's define
some terms before we get any further
what is an exploit well an exploit is is
when you take a vulnerability and we'll
just find vulnerability in a second take
a vulnerability and you chain take that
vulnerability into code execution or a
lot of other things that could be
exploits but your what you're doing is
exploiting that vulnerable you are
taking advantage of that vulnerability
so what is a vulnerability vulnerability
is any chance that you can you do
something on a computer or a system that
you're not supposed to or wasn't
intended so if you go to a website and
you can increment a an ID number for
your user ID from five thousand to one
and become an admin that's a
vulnerability and you are exploiting
that vulnerability by changing your ID
so what can Metasploit do and I just
kind of went over some of what
Metasploit do but can do but let me give
you a few examples so at home I get
calls from my mom all the time on fixing
her computer so what I would do is use
something called meterpreter and we'll
talk about meterpreter in later editions
is I would give her a binary or an
executable that would call back to my
Metasploit instance and it'd give me a
ton of different things that I could do
with that one of the funniest ones is
webcam snap well webcam snap command
allowed me to take a picture of my mom
while I was fixing her printer
supposedly and I sent her that picture
and from then on she never clicked links
and I never had fired virus problems so
that's one of the fun ways that you can
do system administration with it but
Metasploit is a lot more than just
mature peter there are tools like SPS
exec and sysinternals has a piece exec
version and it does much the same thing
but for instance there was one time
where a steam game I had going was froze
my entire system I couldn't do anything
so what I did was I PS exact and I will
explain that in other additions if you
don't know what that is PS exec to the
system from another system that I had
and killed the process for steam now
unfrozen system now I can actually
operate it without having to restart so
that's kind of some of the things that
you can use Metasploit forces
administration for and we'll get a lot
more into the exploit development and
exploitation stuff later
so where do I where do I get Metasploit
well I get Metasploit the development
version from github
and github is where they do all their
development but you can get it and where
we're going to be going through the
installers versions for it from rapid
Metasploit comm or rapid 7 comm so let
me show you what that means so the pro
version Express version community
version framework you can get all of
these versions off of Metasploit comm
and rapid 7 comm and the differences
here are in the versions is let's start
with framework on the right hand side
framework is just the Metasploit
framework it has only the stuff that is
open source free BSD license so you can
take and modify however you want the
Community Edition is is is a still free
version of Metasploit but it has a GUI
and does a lot of a lot of automation on
top of what you already have with MSM
with Metasploit framework then we get
into the paid versions which is Express
and Pro Express adds more automation to
it it allows you to do some password or
automatic password auditing some smart
quote unquote smart exploitation and
some reporting stuff when you get into
the pro version you get some awesome new
features like the VPN pivot where you're
doing an in-memory only VPN inside of an
exploited system which is amazing you
get some web app testing stuff and some
fishing so that's it for the the
versions that we have going and that's
it for what Metasploit minute is today
so upcoming topics that we were talking
about is the installers how to get it
installed in different versions
including how to just get it started in
Kali and that's it thank you for
watching so what do you think hit me up
at MSF at hack 5 org and stay tuned to
Metasploit mancom for motion rows like
these until then I move --ax I'll be
here hacking til the cows come home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
