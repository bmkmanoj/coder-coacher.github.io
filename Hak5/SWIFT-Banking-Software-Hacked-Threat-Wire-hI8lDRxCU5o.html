their internet freedom scammers use DDoS
claims to make bank and more today on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for Wednesday
April 27 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security our privacy and
our Internet freedom we are inching
towards our next goal on patreon which
will help us fund a downloadable version
of the show in podcast apps and you can
help by visiting patreon.com slash
threat wire now onto the news so we back
in February the Bangladesh Bank was the
victim of a cyberattack where hackers
got away with 81 million bucks it was a
lot of money now it would have been even
more money if the hackers hadn't made a
suspicious typo on their attempted
transfers which ended up making the bank
end up canceling the rest of them and
then looking into it so it turns out
that these hackers may very well have
been hacking into a part of a financial
platform software suite by a company
called Swift for the Society of
worldwide interbank financial
telecommunications Swift is a co-op
owned by 3,000 financial institutions
and their software facilitates
communications to over 11,000 banking
institutions for payment orders and
transfers so Swift users must be
authorized banks so it is suspected that
the Bangladesh Bank hacker used their
lack of a network infrastructure to gain
access to the bank network and as such
the Swift network as well which allowed
them to receive several compromised
transfers from the bank 81 million
dollars worth could have been 1 billion
bucks if they did get caught so Swift
reported on Monday that they were aware
of malware in their systems which they
suspect is being used to target their
clients a part of the software suite
called Alliance access server software
is the suspected vulnerable vector the
malware used would modify access
alliances database of transfer logs
along with deleting account records
manipulating account balances so nothing
was suspected
and it even manipulated hard copies of
transfers that were printed by the
bangladesh bank's printer so Swift
released a security update and a press
release about the malware on Monday
while the only instance of this malware
being used
in the wild is with the Bangladesh Bank
it is a heist on a huge scale so if
s'what clients do not update their
systems with the security patch they can
easily be next if they don't take proper
precautions as well like not using a
ten-dollar network switch for starters I
feel like that would be a good idea yeah
on Wednesday of this week the lower
house of Congress in Brazil will vote on
seven proposals to combat cyber crime
which critics are saying will restrict
open Internet freedom and allow law
enforcement to censor online discourse
and delve into personal data of its
citizens similar cases have been made
into law in other countries which in
turn has a negative effect on the free
speech of bloggers activists and
journalists who speak out about politics
in their countries the proposals include
giving the government the ability to
block Internet services as they deem
necessary require services to give law
enforcement IP addresses which by the
way is not a person they would also
increase general law enforcement funding
by diverting public funding from
infrastructure in telecoms and expands
hacking penalties along with
criminalizing risks of misuse even if it
doesn't actually happen
which sounds eerily like thoughtcrime
not gonna lie it's I know it's in 1984
thing but come on so many companies have
banded together to petition this series
of proposals and are currently
attempting to work with the Brazilian
government on a compromise that will not
only help law enforcement with cyber
criminals but also keep the security and
privacy of brazil's citizens in place
today's seriously moment is from a blog
post published by CloudFlare this week
explaining a recurring email sent by
extortionists calling themselves the
Armada collective two companies warning
them of a DDoS attack if they didn't pay
up in bitcoins by a certain date
so far the schemers have gotten more
than get this a hundred thousand bucks
in bitcoins and they haven't ddosed any
body they're just threats in fact not
any single instance has been reported of
the scammers actually pulling off a DDoS
we don't even know if they know how
reacting out of fear companies have paid
them at least 10 bitcoins each which is
almost 5 K in today's USD now if it
smells like a scam if it looks like a
scam
I'm gonna say it's probably a scam two
hacks have occurred two popular services
this week including Spotify and
beautifulpeople.com Spotify has not
clarified at the time that a hack of
their systems has actually occurred but
many users have come forward publicly
saying that they've gotten locked out of
their accounts and they have their email
addresses and/or their passwords changed
so more in this story will be shared on
our social networks as it unfolds
secondly beautifulpeople.com is a dating
site for and I quote attractive people
which has fallen victim to a hack of
over 1.1 million users sensitive data
including private messages email
addresses weight height job phone
numbers location data habits and
interests and encrypted passwords no
financial data was thought to be stolen
according to a beautiful people comm rep
the breach involved members prior to
July 2015 no new members have been
affected if you suspect yourself to be
