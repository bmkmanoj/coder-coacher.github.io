right after DEFCON a vulnerability on
older Amazon echoes won't be patched and
hackers are using online repos to get
developer creds all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for August
8 2017 this is your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom real quick make sure to
subscribe and hit that little
notification bell button to see the show
as soon as it goes live and check out
patreon.com/crashcourse stop the attack
by registering a domain that hacker was
Marcus Hutchins aka Mauer tech blog or
Mauer tech on Twitter who is a UK
information security professional and is
known for his work in software
development and cyber security Hutchins
went to hacker summer camp like the rest
of us and was arrested on US soil on
Wednesday during his departure from Def
Con and Las Vegas now I want to preface
this story by saying that there is a lot
of false information about Hutchins
being shared and I will do my best to
partake the most accurate information
possible at the time of recording if you
find updates on this story please leave
links below in the comments and I will
make sure to pin the valid source
material if you are wondering where my
info comes from check the show notes
now Hutchins who's 23 years old was
arrested and held in Nevada Nevada
Detention Center before being moved to a
different facility the same day much of
his friends and family had no contact
more information on where he was being
held according to the US Department of
Justice Hutchins was arrested after a
quote grand jury in the Eastern District
of Wisconsin returned a six count
indictment against Hutchins for his role
in creating and distributing the Khronos
baking Trojan the charges against touch
ins and for which he was arrested relate
to alleged conduct that occurred between
in or around July 2014 and July 2015
now Kronos is a Trojan that when
installed will it allow an attacker to
steal banking login details from victim
computers using what is called a form
grabber to steal that kind of data
Chronos was trying to be sold for 7000
USD to buyers
strangely enough Cronus was released on
July 1st 2014 and Hudgens asked on
Twitter for a sample of Kronos on July
13th thirteen days later Hutchence does
a lot of reverse engineering of malware
to monitor botnet traffic and that's
basically his job so why does the DOJ
say that he had a role in the creation
and distribution of Kronos the
indictment claims that Hutchins and
another unnamed defendant were involved
in transmitting the program information
code etc and intentionally caused damage
without authorization to ten or more
protected computers during that time
period of 2014 to 2015 the DOJ also
claims that they advertised the malware
on forums they sold it and they receive
money for Kronos and Hindi acts of being
involved with Kronos itself the
indictment also says Hutchins created
Kronos his co-defendant demonstrated how
it worked on July 13th in a YouTube
video which just so happens to be the
same day Hutchins asked for a sample on
Twitter and the other defendant offered
to sell it in August for $3,000 USD and
both parties updated Kronos in February
of 2015 the second defendant advertised
it on the dark web marketplace called
alpha bay in 2015 and sold it for $2000
then offered services related to Kronos
in July of 2015 I should also mention
alpha bay was recently shut down by feds
a few weeks ago and this ties into the
sudden indictment the indictment then
specifies which titles of US law the DOJ
believes the two defendants would be
found in violation of including
wiretapping and violating the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act he could spend up to
40 years in jail if convicted
Hutchins appeared in front of Judge
Nancy cop on Friday as she set his bail
he spent the weekend in jail as of
Monday Hutchins bail was posted at
thirty thousand dollars USD and
supporters have raised over twelve
thousand dollars USD as of Sunday
updates to money raised are being posted
by Tara wheeler an information security
professional and a good friend of mine
at Tara on
she also has linked a funding campaign
that others can donate for his legal
fees and she and a co-worker of Hutchins
are managing the campaign is linked
below and Hutchins co-worker Andrew
mavet plans to pay his bail a Monday and
hired defense lawyer Adrienne Lobo Lobo
has denied the counts and said Hutchins
will plead not guilty on the other hand
prosecutor Dan Cal Hague has stated
Hutchins admitted he created the
software since these two stories
obviously don't match up we will likely
hear his formal plea by the end of day
on Tuesday as he is set to appear in
court in Wisconsin at that time now
during the court appearance on Friday
prosecutors explained that Hutchins was
caught in a sting operation when cops
bought the code prosecutor Cal Hague
also claimed evidence via chat logs of
Hutchins expecting payment from his
co-defendant for selling the code a
lawyer wanted Hutchins held on the fact
that he went to a touristy gun range in
Vegas which honestly is so popular of
learning Def Con attendees I'm even
surprised they even tried to make that
threatening but luckily Judge cop
disregarded that allowing him bail
Hutchins cannot use the Internet
must be monitored by GPS and must render
his passport while he's out on bail till
his hearing which happens on Tuesday
he's also not allowed to speak to the
co-defendant now according to IT
security consultant Robyn Edgar Hutchins
code was incorporated into the malware
but Hutchins had not done anything wrong
and did not actually create the malware
some reports have focused in on his
risky vacation in Vegas during hacker
summer camp asking where he got all his
money from and obviously creating a
leading question about funding from
Kronos which mavet rebutted with
clarifications posted on Twitter the
whole indictment brings to light a
serious problem with the bias hackers
received from general public and
criminal justice
officers and what should be considered
illegal or legal activities it is not
illegal to download or create malware
but it is illegal to use it for
malicious activities if the intent can
be proven but how do you prove that
intent was there and how do you prove
that someone wrote a program or that
just their code was used for a malicious
actor to create malware currently we do
not have the full evidence in support or
against Hutchins and his co-defendant
just an indictment and the
in proceedings in US Court we will keep
you posted though as we learn more whoa
that was a doozy so let's talk about
Amazon echo yes Amazon echo devices sold
in 2015 and 2016 can be exploited with a
physical attack allowing an attacker to
listen in on users without any knowledge
the device has been tampered with
according to mark Barnes a researcher at
M WR info security these models could be
compromised by removing the bottom part
of the speaker exposing 18 debug pads
which could allow you to boot directly
into firmware with an SD card they could
gain root access to the Linux operating
system that echo runs on and allow
persistent remote access along with
stealing authentication tokens and
streaming live audio you reattach the
base you'll leave the room then the user
would never know it was messed with by
doing so Barnes says an attacker could
listen in on the echos always listening
microphone which usually listens for a
keyword chilla wakes up in response to
the user now if the user did press the
mute button to turn off the mic the
exploit would not work till it was
unmuted again the newer models for this
year do not allow for booting from SD
card so the hardware exploit no longer
works from 2017 models with older models
though no firmware update will fix it so
they will be exploitable until they are
no longer in use
now physical access is required to route
and compromise these Amazon echos in as
such most customers will probably not be
affected Amazon does recommend that
customers buy from their website or
reliable retailer a not third party or
untrusted sources a great example of
this would probably be like eBay because
of its research Barnes stresses the need
to consider physical attacks during
development of hardware so future
hardware prototype or loss and customer
trust would not be an issue lastly for
today have you heard of typos squating
this is where an attacker will use
commonly misspelled names of
repositories or even sites really to
host malicious code in hopes of grabbing
credentials from unsuspecting users in
this case an attacker use typosquatting
via the MPM online package repository
used for JavaScript libraries which are
commonly used to call code functions for
popular uses
- host forty different packages of code
with just slightly misspelled names to
gain developer credentials from anyone
using these library packages in their
code accidentally thus if anyone calling
these packages in code misspelled a word
they would be a victim of the attacker
NPM which stands for node package
manager heard about the issue via a user
on Twitter and immediately removed any
packages linked to the same malicious
code which was tied to a user calling
themselves hacked ask the developer
creds and other useful data would be
uploaded to the attackers server at NPM
hack task net and at this time NPM is
considering using programmatic detection
tools to find and block packages from
being publicized if they are found to be
malicious in using typo squating thank
