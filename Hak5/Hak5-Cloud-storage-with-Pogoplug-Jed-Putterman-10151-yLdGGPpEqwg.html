joins us for a little file recovery mojo
using scalpel then jedd Putterman of
Pogoplug joins us to talk cloud storage
and kim bash scripts monitor your cpu
temperature plus radiating paul the
camera guy's brain with a 16 DVI yagi
antenna and transmitting Wi-Fi over 500
milliwatts in the US can it be done all
that and more this time on hack 5 this
segment of fact 5 is brought to you by
goto assist express hello and welcome my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
and what are you doing just you'll find
out this is for the d-block when we when
we decide that we were going to radiate
Paul's brain oh yeah that thing yeah so
how's it going man I am kidding cuz I
did I had an amazing Thanksgiving I went
down to LA it was delicious and I had
like basically two different dinners
with all the family that I saw nice yeah
it was fun good times I just I did
Thanksgiving here it was a lot of fun
yeah you did like the How I Met Your
Mother thing where like all the friends
get today oh yeah you need to watch that
show that's really good know where all
the friends get together TV I don't know
I watch it on TV anyway no I watch it on
DVD sure yeah I watch it on easy TV
anyway we're Loki or whoever's got it
this week um let's talk about our
favorite thing in the a block called
what's in the box box oh I guess like
yeah that's that's drumroll please
before we get to the awesome content but
we do love that you guys send us goodies
and you know it's this isn't bag time of
giving so much abou anti-static this is
from must be good all he said I found
this not our Paul he said I found this
the question is do you have a computer
that you can plug it into
first of all oh there's a there's a
booklet beat with beep codes and beep
codes by OC okay what else I remember
when I built my computer and it was
beeping at me and I had no look at the
LEDs is that an is a card I don't know I
have no idea what this is I know
no I'm serious I haven't actually seen
this before the show
am i 2.2 I don't know what this is this
should be the trivia question of the
week do you know what this piece of
hardware Paul Center says mimics ROM
BIOS plus spy or I could actually solder
myself it seems like a debug board it
looks like somebody saw her this
themselves it seems like a debug board
for biases yeah it's got all these
different codes first do you think he
started it himself look at look at that
huh yeah totally does that's good stuff
that's awesome well thank you I will
investigate it war someone will email me
we'll find an is a machine that we can
plug it into it get their blinking beeps
yes Tobias yeah that sounds fun yes I
tell you that there's no keyboard
connected and press f1 to continue does
that it makes me so happy yeah yeah I
had that issue when I built my computer
at the hacksaw it's a hack house really
I see am I the only one that gets sad
with the whole like Oh everything's
going AFI now it's like you're gonna
turn on your computer yeah it's gonna be
a big shot it's like I want to see the
RAM count and the fun happy ones don't
like that but I really like the
prettiness as well you hold down command
ass I don't have a command key because
I'm elite hey yes how he says as I a
lien eight a third of our audience we
like it's called a super key and it
doesn't do anything because I haven't
mapped it I'm hacking now let's hack
right into the next second what do you
say that sounds awesome to me
a tune because coming up 80 of dual core
is gonna be joining us once again for a
little file recovery segment using
scalpel you know we were meant you
should remember we talked about that a
few weeks ago as well as Kirby on again
for the meal of the week but now let's
jump over to our Pogoplug interview
being an IT and not using the right
tools to get the best results from your
clients is like a surgeon not using the
best most reliable medical equipment how
can you expect your clients to work with
you and that's why I use go to assist
Express by Citrix it's the best remote
support tool go to assist Express is
designed with speed and usability in
mind and makes it easy to get in
diagnose and resolve the problem fast in
fact go to assist Express users report
an average of 40% increase in
productivity it's like getting seven
days worth of work out of a five day
work week and with them limited use you
can support all you want through one
flat feet I've used remote support tools
for years and go twist this Express is
the best so fast so reliable start using
go twist Express today and you'll see
why it's the leader in remote support
right now hak5 viewers can try it free
for 30 days visit go to assist comm
slash hak5 given thats go to assist comm
slash hack five for 30 days free trial
today guys we have the special pleasure
of being joined by Jed Putterman the
co-founder of Pogoplug we were just
talking about this which Anna was just
playing with the new stuff how's it
going it's going great we're having a
great time with this product I remember
seeing this when it first came out and
it was all like I gotta say I was like
oh hey that's a shame a blog you know
and and I love that because it's all
like Linux embedded and we love that
kind of stuff what has brought you to
the latest version this mobile version
well we've gone through a few versions
you know always taking the core idea of
what the product should be yeah I have
no longer Barbie pink anymore though
it's listen we have some old ones in
stock and get you a few yeah you could
get me maybe Shannon want some Barbie
pink ones we're yeah it's the colors
definitely changed yeah we are we like
to stand out and be different we also
like to respond to our users so black is
the new pink okay why not
yeah but what brought you what was the
evolution to get to this device here
well we're always worried about a few
things you know one is its performance
yeah and so you know we're constantly
taking the the newest versions of chips
as they come out we're still working
with with the same vendors that we work
in the past for SSC and okay the Shiva
plug was all a marvel you know
system-on-a-chip is this the same thing
yes we started marvelous to see in there
and we've redesigned the board so it's
it's our board now I thought again you
know back it's pretty simple insides
it's you know SSE and it's still pretty
straightforward I mean you just plug a
USB hard drive into it or SD card and
then you plug it into the internet and
now you have an ass and I know everybody
that's watching at home thinking well
grab an x86 box put BSD on it
get some are synced to the cloud and
there you go
at least it sounds that simple until you
try to explain to your grandmother your
grandmother could totally work this yeah
we're on you know so anyone can do is
anyone can do yeah what we've done in
here we just make it really simple so
we're a cloud storage right that is our
that's our service yeah we believe it
should come in different ways and one is
traditional cloud and the other way is
is cloud in a box
those eggs gonna say you're like when I
think cloud I think like okay it's all
up on the Internet
is kind of like bridging that gap
between like maybe it's because me the
geek and a lot of geek friends I have
like maybe I don't know if it's a
control freak thing but it's like I like
to know that I can point at a box to say
there's my data but I also like knowing
that it's also in the up there stuff
hopefully nothing happens you know yeah
but now now is that's that's where
you've gone with the latest
announcements though is now it's in both
places how does that work yeah a new new
cloud stuff with Pogoplug no it's you
know it's a great question so we are you
know again we believe the cloud just
means it's available anywhere right so
whether you're fit your your storage is
physically stored back in your home
which is how this device works or
whether it's stored somewhere else which
is how our kind of you know cloud
offering they're offered now where we
host your storage it's still accessed in
exactly the same way and shows up in the
same places so it's you know one UI for
all of your storage regardless of where
it physically is now how does how does
Pogoplug now differentiate from say a
Dropbox so you know there are some great
cloud storage just you know services out
there was Dropbox and box net and go on
with the list we differentiate in a few
ways one is we want to be your primary
storage for all of your storage right so
we're really focused on mobile you know
what happens when you simply don't have
a computer or your computers your laptop
which is being closed up and packed off
with you so it's kind of the anti sink
model which is don't move stuff around
from one place to another just make it
always available wherever you are and
one of the ways you know wherever you
are with an internet connection with an
internet connection yeah we still
believe you know the world is heading in
that direction you know every device is
gonna be internet enabled but it's
getting smaller so it's it's just the
difference between caching on all of the
devices versus just leaving it all in
one place yeah now it's not in one place
because it's both in your you know in
your server closet or wherever it may be
that you leave your router and your
Pogoplug but but also up in the cloud
yeah that's a girl look you know we
would be naive if we said you know put
all of your stuff up in a hosting
storage when if you look at the prices
that you know everyone's know their
charge you know and you know rightfully
so it costs money to help you know host
hidden somewhere and sure and pay for
bandwidth so we want to offer both so
yeah this is this is naive as it would
be to say oh just put it on an external
hard drive at home yeah that's exactly
right so you know some of your stuff
should be in your house I've got
terrible
terabytes of photos and videos my kids
that I want to make it accessible but I
don't access it every single day and and
it's it's kind of primary storage for
all my my you know videos and photos I
take so I want access but I don't need
all the speed and safety I can keep it
in high at home okay let's talk about
the safety now a lot of our geeky
audience they they can totally build
that BST server they can totally set up
the arsenic and whatever else it is that
they want to do to do that and that's
great but sometimes you know especially
when you're like an IT guy you want to
come home you don't want to engineer
Network you just did that at work but
this is a simple solution for that but
some people point out that everything
like to access your device you don't
have one through the simplicity in the
convenience of I don't have to set up a
dynamic DNS and I don't have to set up
port forwarding on my router right but
now to get to my files and everything I
go to my Pogoplug dot-com or whatever it
may be but not and so everything that
you're streaming everything goes through
the Pogoplug service thus making
basically poems look like a
man-in-the-middle so how do you guys
like when you were developing the
service did you think about that and and
what did you do to make sure that
there's security there yeah great
question so we do care about security in
fact a lot of us and in how many have
backwards in security everything is all
the basics are in place so everything
goes to our service now it is encrypted
obviously SSL between your client back
to our service and you know a few things
there one is if you want your stuff
offline unlike other services you simply
you know you can unplug this device and
you are entirely off the grid at that
point there's always kind of that
failsafe way of just you know hey I'm
not going secure right now let's do
let's take this thing off the internet
when you are on though again we're
following all the industry guidelines
about making sure that you know your
data is is encrypted in the entire way
from from client all the way back to
devices some some services like spider
oak for example they're mainly a
competitor to say Dropbox and and their
model is we don't even want to know what
you're putting up in our cloud and
everything is encrypted on their servers
with your key so you're the only one
that can ever access it as it syncs to
you do you guys do any encryption on
your side does the client have a key on
your side or are your files on the
Pogoplug server somewhere yeah so it's
so you know again we never unless you're
hosting it
if it's storage connected back to your
device we never look at your files we
never have your file so stuff will pass
through our servers in cases where we
can't you know make a direct
peer-to-peer connection okay so when you
go to my Pogoplug comm you try to
establish a direct connection between
you and your home IP we do for a few
reasons one is it saves us some piano
they're always helpful for that and it's
more secure for you so yeah so if we can
make a p2p connection we'll do it
in cases where we can't we don't want to
have you know ever go open ports or
making changes to your network so we'll
play all the tricks around like NAT
traversal yeah you totally natural etc
we're encrypting TCP oh you know the
inside of UDP so it's you know it's a
secure so you'll actually have the
device at home like make a reverse
connection to or something like that
yeah that's exactly right
okay upload it through a client or
through the browser Heidi how can you go
about just dumping meaning on it
yes actually either so we have you know
kind of a rich browser that you can
upload through and we have a client for
Mac when it's Linux and windows where
it'll do sync all your media over or you
can drag and drop stuff over to your
Pogoplug I love that you guys support
Linux I'd love to see the evolution of
this too coming from just a simple you
know almost consumer kind of little
embedded device to where you guys are
were you going next with this well we
know we're continuing to make them
faster and faster so we're looking at
you know how do we improve transfer
rates when you are local how do we
improve additional functionality for
things like the media processing if we
can't offload it how do we improve it in
the device itself might we ever see
maybe something along the lines of raid
maybe creeping into the Theriault of
like Drobo and things of that nature
where it's redundant you know we
actually have a great partnership with
Drogo so in fact we had a release today
where we're there with maybe using our
software as the remote access so they
fiddle so not area that we you know that
we're gonna do ourselves and they're
what we'll partner with people who feel
are doing a great job in the industry
well it's pretty slick firmware I gotta
say the user experience is Bar None some
of the simplest I've ever seen I'd love
to see the the evolution of this thank
you so much for coming by and bringing
us the toys yeah thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
