setting up the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano
using android now to begin let's start
by powering on the Wi-Fi pineapple nano
to do so we need to provide at least 1.5
amps such as from a wall adapter or a
freshly charged pineapple juice battery
pack we could also use the included USB
dual a lead cable which I'll do here
while that boots up let's go ahead and
download the Wi-Fi pineapple connector
app from Google Play so I'll open the
Play Store and install the pineapple
connector app once that's installed
let's go ahead and open and we're
prompted to configure this point all I
have to do is plug in a USB lead between
my Android device and the Wi-Fi panel
and I will tap configure at this point I
just tap USB tethering and tap in the
back now immediately the pineapple is
going to communicate with the Android
and prompt me to go ahead and download
the latest firmware so I'm going to tap
download firmware this brings me to
Wi-Fi pineapple comm / nano and from
here I can download the latest firmware
so I can see here that upgrade bin is
downloading and that download is now
complete so I will go back to the app
and open that and I can now begin setup
so I'll tap begin setup and tap continue
now at this point for security were
asked to press the reset button located
beneath the device we can either press
it once to disable the Wi-Fi radios
which is what we recommend or if you in
a pinch need to you can hold down the
reset button for around five seconds and
that will leave the Wi-Fi radios off so
I will just tap that reset button
and have continued and I can here choose
the file from my documents and from my
recent documents I have the latest
upgrade that bin file and just tap
upgrading at this point I'm prompted to
let me know that since I am USB
tethering that I'll need to re-enable
USB tethering as soon as the upgrade
process is complete this takes about
five minutes and we'll know it's
complete when the LED finishes it's
blinking finishes its firmware flash and
reboot cycle and remain solid once again
firmware flashing is completed now it's
just a matter of unplugging the USB
cable reap lugging that and launching
the Wi-Fi pineapple connector app once
again to configure check tethering go
back and from here we're prompted to
start the setup cell getting started
once again pressing the reset button
and now it's just matter of setting a
password accept the agreements and
complete setup and now we can login and
there we are we're set up with our Wi-Fi
pineapple Nano on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
