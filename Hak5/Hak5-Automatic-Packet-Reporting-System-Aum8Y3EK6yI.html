operator trade Murphy joins us to talk
about automatic packet reporting system
radio licensing and building an AP RS
system on the cheap
this episode of hangman is brought to
you by goto assist express the United
States Air Force and dimmed in easy free
web conferencing hello my name is darren
kitchen and I'm not even gonna say this
is what you expected to see because this
act live you're not even sure what
you're gonna get a subscribe right I am
actually on a motorcycle adventure just
crossing the jamestown scotland ferry
right now on my way over to across the
Chesapeake Bay and then up and around
the Eastern Shore but anyway we have an
awesome show for you guys today
we were talking to our friend Trey
otherwise known as November four Papa
alpha tango who's going to tell us all
this cool stuff about how cam operator
can use pockets and GPS and there's a
really cool data network that I'm sure
many of you aren't aware of and I was
just totally excited about so I think
you're gonna enjoy it not stick around
and I guess you know and if you're into
the whole I'm doing a motorcycle a video
vlog thing of this on darren kitchen
calm with everything but anyway enjoy
the show and i just want to say thank
you to our excellent sponsor the united
states air force
so when most of us think about having
fun with wireless we think about a toe
2.11 you know your Wi-Fi is yours igby's
but there is a totally cool data network
that's been around since from what I
understand the 80s and we have the
pleasure of learning about it tonight
because n4p 80 or otherwise known as
Trey Murphy is down thank you for coming
down here welcome this is a lot of fun
so we've never actually had a ham
operator him radio operator on the show
and I think it's high time because this
is the the you know phone phreaking
scene this is the computer hacking scene
this is you know all of that beforehand
well this is that the network of APRs
was started back in the 80s another ham
Bob Runanga WB for a PR developed it and
it's a packet switched network we use
digital repeaters but the beauty of this
is you basically need a battery a radio
an encoder and a GPS and you're good to
go and you don't have to spend a lot of
money to do it you can spend a thousand
bucks if you've got it or you can build
something that right and you've built a
system where just E or a couple hundred
right and these are just off-the-shelf
parts but before we dive into the the
hardware let's get a little bit of
background here you said that it was
developed in the 80s we're talking about
APRs here not packet radio but it's it's
a system that allows us to do what APRs
stands for the automatic packet
reporting system and it transmits an
amateur radio developed packet protocol
called ax dot 25 I don't know all the
particulars of it but needless to say it
works extremely well but it allows us to
transmit everything from position
velocity time altitude type of data to
weather data scientific data it also
includes messaging and therefore you
have this very robust network that
because it's very distributed can also
be extremely reliable it's all
volunteers this is not commercial at all
we don't make any money off of it we pay
for it all ourselves but it gives us a
method
to have what we call total tactical
awareness of an event of a given area of
all sorts of different things where you
need to know where your personnel are
what their position is what their status
is are they in route or they stationary
and in some cases exactly what that
position is and have an immediate okay I
love the idea of the fact that this is a
wireless network and a worldwide not
just national right and it's and there's
no major telco behind a support of this
that I find that so so interesting what
are some of the common practical uses of
this can you give me some examples of
how this is being waste everybody's
familiar with what happened with Katrina
you had a vast area where there was
simply no communications infrastructure
there wasn't these cellphones there
weren't any form of packet-switched
radio for public service no electricity
in many places yet you can send a PRS
equipped rescuers into this area if
they've got this they don't even have to
know where they are for a command center
with a website that picks up the
information or a receiver and software
on the computer to decode the packets
and put a position on the map and you
know exactly where someone is on a much
smaller scale just last weekend amateur
radio operators provided communications
for a bike ride that covered the entire
county of Hanover from Lake Anna to
Spotsylvania almost down to King William
and the vehicles that followed the bike
riders for support were equipped with
APRs which allowed us to one know which
vehicle was at which without having to
think about it because you can use
tactical call signs if necessary you can
be sad one side to you can be rest stop
one rest stop - and when you've got 700
riders over a weekend and a motorcycle
following them now you know where your
last rider is so you know okay the last
rider is going to pass the rest stop
tell the rest stop they can break down
Oh
a rider just came into a rest stop and
said three miles down the road someone's
been in
we know exactly where the Sag wagons are
the minute of Sag wagon gets to the
rider now we know exactly where the
rider is if we need EMS we can provide
coordinates and address whatever we need
to to have total awareness of where
everybody is so it's very valuable on
the other and the other thing too is
with the messaging capability you can
send text messages much like you would
send to Twitter or something like that
it's about a hundred and forty character
message limit and provide whatever
information you want in that particular
and that's just an ode to notes later
note if I were an a PRS operator as well
you and I could speak now do we have to
go through a server or how does how does
the infrastructure well most of it is
run through what are called digital
repeaters or digit Peters and in the
Richmond area the Tidewater area
everywhere down here amateurs have put
up a very robust network and there's a
large number of them so the coverage is
very good and if you were to go to a
website like a PRS Fi and know a
particular callsign you can put it in
see their position you can see what
digit Peters they have gone through and
to get where they're going if you can
hear a station direct you can message
direct but part of the packet includes
the path to and from that station so
that if you if someone messages you and
says hello there you can turn around say
hello back and it follows the same path
back even if you've hopped to repeat and
if you've hopped repeaters a lot of
times what you're going to find is the
goal is to get your packets to an
Internet gateway and people who have
home-based APRs stations typically will
gate that data to the internet so they
hook up the radio to their internet
connection with some software
essentially a server exactly and then
that is and then the Internet becomes
the backbone for all of the other
exactly Gateway out there well they
don't necessarily hear or see the the
Gateway all they're doing is repeating
what they hear but they're looking at
that path and going okay I can send this
all so you could potentially message
somebody in California right even if you
couldn't necessarily get a signal there
right now radio there's no error
correction on this it's 1,200 ball
bandwidth is very limited when you're
dealing with that so collisions though
occur they do occur and when packet
walls but I'm assuming there's some sort
of there's got to be some sort of
checksum to make sure that if you've got
garbage you know it's garbage right they
the system will check and it's either a
valid packet or it's not a valid packet
but it doesn't care if it's a non valid
packet it just drops it now you actually
use the system on your way down from
Richmond right to the hack house today
and we actually have it pulled up and
this is very cool that we can actually
see your route and we can take a look
here at the different you know the
different point points that you youichi
the the check points that you head in
and so can you kind of show us some of
the other things on the map here well
for instance um when I was up here in
the Richmond area you can see right
there when that purple line pops up that
shows the path it took before it hit the
internet and it wound up being gated
down at ki4 BW j - 12 s house and when
direct in other cases for instance this
packet went through the w4r 80 - three
digit Peter which bounced it down to the
KB for yfk iGate which is what put it
out on this website that is so excellent
I mean you know as a Wi-Fi geek you know
I'm used to dealing with access points
and repeaters and stuff like that but
this is you know that before we had any
of that cool stuff all right and and it
seems very robust and I just love the
idea that it's put on by you know
amateur radio operators so before we get
into the hardware what do I say like I
want to you know I want to start using
this to deploy some you know like I I
first thought hey you know I could you
know pop up you know Fon - with a with
USB hub and a GPS USB adapter and a USB
Abdo card and and then you know update
my motorcycles position when I'm doing
some touring through you know the
mountains or whatever on the Google Maps
this is you know that C you know to me
everything's everything's a nail because
what I've got is a Wi-Fi hammer right or
fawn hammer if you will so that's what
got me interested in this so what would
I need to
hardware wise but license wise what are
using we are FCC licensed so you would
have to have at least a technician class
licensed which now in the United States
is the entry-level license six and seven
year old children earn these licenses it
requires some knowledge of the rules and
regulations some knowledge of basic
electronic theory some knowledge of how
to operate radios at that point when
you've got the license you're good to go
and the modes available to you it
operates in the two meter
wavelength band 144 megahertz the
frequency is nationwide which in some
ways can be goods but it ensures
compatibility right I put this under the
under the seat of the truck and never
have to touch it no matter where I go
with it but that's all you really have
to have all hams are geeks let's face it
there's forums there's websites there
step by step instruction that talks you
through anything and everything you'd
want to do with APRs they're very robust
sites the distributed nature if you lose
one didja peter somewhere your network
is not down because something else is
going to pick it up now in rural areas
just like cellular service you don't
have to drive very far out of Richmond
that you're gonna lose cell service at
least in the holes but as you can see
from the map I always covered all the
way down here I can go all the way over
to Western West Virginia and there's
only a few holes between Lexington and
Covington and between Covington and
beckley other than that you're almost
entirely covered with the network now in
just a bit we're gonna get into the
hardware and all the fun blinking lights
that put this together but first we want
to thank one of our excellent sponsors
so I hope you guys are enjoying the show
especially you know with these odd
formats lately it's just the way that
the scheduling has been working out but
as always we encourage your feedback
Sophie Becca act 5 or give you have any
questions or comments about the stuff
that we've been talking about and in
just a bit we're gonna be talking about
the hardware aspect of this but first
hello yeah everything's cool on the
exchange server well no I'm just out
running an errand we'll hang on let me
take a look real quick what can you get
to webmail excellent I'm sending you an
email right now with the link and I just
want you to go ahead and click that and
I'll be on your computer in just a
minute to take care of that point you
probably already know that go to assist
Express by Citrix is the easiest way to
provide instant remote support to
clients anywhere in the world let's see
it in action from my computer I launch
go to assist Express and send the
support URL to the client they click the
link click run and click yes to join the
session back on my computer I'm greeted
by their screen and can control their
computers mouse and keyboard best of all
in just one click I have a thorough PC
diagnostics that I can troubleshoot that
PC from or in two clicks I can reboot
their PC in a safe mode without ever
losing connection and let's face it that
beats the heck out of driving or flying
any day sign up for your free go to
assist Express trial at go to assist
comm / hack 5 so I go out I get my you
know operator license I actually for
once and finally learn Morse code and I
have to learn Morse code you know
anymore know it away with the
requirement as something holding me back
when I thought about it years ago but
but I now I'm assuming that I have to go
out and spend six hundred a thousand
dollars on an expensive piece of kit to
get me going or do I know you really
don't now one application I didn't
mention earlier in death was search and
rescue groups they have a need when
they're in the field to know where their
people are and typically they have
two-way radios that can do their
community their voice communications
form but they want to know where that
person is 48 dollars buys you a pick
processor encoder that you can build
yourself it requires some soldering
patch GPS receiver and a basic handheld
radio
all you have to have to send the data
okay so what do we get coming out let's
just walk it through okay we get coming
out of they're given arrows not USB but
the serial GPS receiver you're getting a
standard in in in MEA string okay
standard GPS sentence comes out of that
then the pic processor turns that and
modulates that into audio that a
standard FM transmitter can transmit
okay so this is just you know an
inexpensive radio film handheld radio
and you say that just it just converts
it into audio I mean would it be wrong
of me to kind of draw Sandler D between
this and a modem very simply 6k modem
exerts 1200 baud exactly and it even it
handles the push-to-talk on the radio so
it pushes to talk sends a packet if you
hear it you're hearing a brac and it
sounds very much like a modem
handshaking and transmitting data
because that's basically what it is it
is all good to have a lot of different
tones or do we just have two tuners I
believe is what they're using
okay so we're telling for a 100 years
exactly oh that's awesome yeah so you
know that whole kit we would maybe run
you a hundred bucks to get up and go
hundred that handheld was actually given
to me because somebody didn't want it
anymore so 48 bucks here and I think I
paid close to $40 $50 for the for the
GPS okay so what if we want to get a
little bit more advanced with this
saying that we can do text messaging we
can you know see waypoints you've got a
GPS you end up here I want to know how
this all got together because this just
looks like a consumer GPS that's exactly
what it is so what what is this here
this particular unit is a Garmin Nuvi
350 they've been discontinued they're
still available okay this one came off
eBay for a hundred and four dollars
including the power cables the cradle
and software with it so you've got $100
there the key to this whole thing is a
terminal load controller which in normal
geek speek is basically a modem okay
it's it's again it's taking the data
from the GPS and it's turning it into
data it's turning into audio that can be
transmitted over an FM radio and so in
that case this radio could do just as
well
os we had the if it had the ports and
what now it needs a different cable
let's in other words so
how do how does this how does your modem
here get the data from your GPS unit
well it's using this particular set up
is sort of a Rube Goldberg device if you
will
Garmin made units that worked with what
they called a fleet management interface
so if you were a delivery business or
needed to dispatch vehicles or bike
messengers in cars or something I don't
know how to explain that right right but
if I'm UBS and I've got a ton of trouble
everywhere I need to know where they all
right you need to know where they are
where you can know where they are with
something that simple okay but you're
headed to your third stop and suddenly
they need you to immediately go left and
go pick up a package that hasn't be
picked up right now okay how do you let
them know well you can message to this
unit using that fleet management
interface and commercially there are
thousands of dollars there's been
proprietary software written
high-powered radio systems and networks
and things like that in this case the
Pam who developed the open tracker wrote
code into it that translates this fleet
management language that comes out of
the Garmin into because the Garmin is
just speaking at Mei it it includes that
in enemy a data okay but it's
encapsulated in a Garmin binary string
it's it's somewhat different because
NMEA has no specification for messaging
so it's the same type of thing you can
use the keyboard on this unit and if you
go to dispatch and you go to messages
and you go to create a message you can
use the keyboard create your address and
then a space in your message hit Send
and off it goes and and this just
interfaces with the fleet management
cable right and that's essentially just
a you know rs-232 a USB USB with a tiny
little translator in the middle to
translate the USB to 232 excellence like
a TTL yeah exam and then right from that
it just goes right it comes right out of
another port on the TNC goes to the mic
and push-to-talk
and then it listens because the other
beauty of this particular setup is when
the TNC decodes valid packets
it can place those objects on the Garmin
screen and that's why this particular
garment is important well this
particular Garmin is important is
because as we understand that there's a
an actual flaw with the firmware because
if you notice on the big map there's a
breadcrumb trail right once I've moved
position that a new packet has been
transmitted the old one stays in place
well imagine if you had a string like
that and say you're traveling down the
interstate and or a mountain road
because I actually use an algorithm in
this called smart beaconing that only
transmits when there's a significant
change of direction which is one reason
while they're sitting out to spamming
your signal every couple minutes right
because it just adds congestion it's a
real smart way of cutting down network
congestion so if you're on someplace
busy and you're you're transmitting all
this time imagine leaving your
breadcrumb because if you're heard by a
digit Peter and your signal is digit it
puts you back up and if you were to come
back and look at the map you can almost
see underneath the icon for my Jeep the
callsign and that's what's come back
from the digit Peter so you know where
they are now imagine you've got another
ham a GPS next to you and they just
leave into breadcrumbs down the road
right but on this one since it's it's
two-way you actually see the other
operators right just like we do here in
the Google writes on the AP RS - Fi we
see the same thing here on your guide
but on the Garmin you don't see the
breadcrumbs
now get the last updated position and
that's it now if you drop off the
network it maintains that last-known
position okay so if you get home and
park the car it's going to stay there
until it moves again hmm but still a far
better system yeah and a far less
expensive as I understand exactly well
the Garmin was a hundred this particular
open tracker - was right at a hundred
dollars I think the cable was 28 now
this happens to be a new radio because I
got geeky and wanted a new radio yeah
but I've got a 20 year old radio at home
that by changing the connector would
work just as well and cost me five
dollars
and I'm assuming that these are
something I mean basically you just need
you know if you wanted to weather
balloon or some scientific buoy or
stationed in the mountains or something
that gathers data and needs a reliable
way to transmit it back sounds like an
excellent platform for that sort of
thing because cell signal isn't
everywhere that's right you could I
could see you there feasibly being like
a system on a chip that's just got a GPS
chip and a pic and a radio all built
into one like the size of a soda can
they're available excellent now they're
not as high wattage right but for
instance we have an amateur in the in
the club who enjoys sending up
high-altitude balloons with a camera and
a GPS and a system very similar to this
it's got to be lightweight and he gets
altitude position and velocity and
course data can chase the balloon and
recover the camera when the thing comes
now
that's just gonna be the miserable
awesome videos oh it's absolutely
phenomenal so you know you can get into
this for 50 bucks to show P or 100 less
less than 100 to show people where you
are now if I wanted to get into this
obviously here being local I would go to
one of the the you know there's
organizations worldwide right where
would I go here locally though there are
clubs here in this area there's a club
here in Williamsburg I didn't do a real
good job with my homework and I don't
know what its name is but if they go
you've got one in Richmond we happen
there there's several in Richmond the
Richmond amateur telecommunication
Society runs the system that you see the
the w4r 80 callsign oh that's our club
call along with voice repeaters and
voice over IP internet relay linking
project nodes so that you can use a
handheld like this and talk to Australia
attack so all your viewers that are out
there if they become hands we'd love to
hear from them we we regularly talk to a
ham in Melbourne Australia the couple of
weeks ago came over to visit that's
awesome you know this guys doing this as
cool as the ones from Sydney oh
absolutely you know most yeah but it's
the American radio relay League the a
double RL their website is ARRL org and
they have a club finder on there so that
wherever you happen to live in the
United States
you can find a club that's near you hams
are social people
yeah I'm sure if you just showed up at a
club and said hey I want to get
certified and I want to buy some kit
I've got 150 200 bucks help me get
started oh you know sounds like you know
land party before it existed oh
absolutely absolutely you know we have
presentations on everything from
emergency communications to APRs
antennas you know amplifiers people
bring in their projects that they built
and show them off and believe me
you know when you build something like
this suddenly you're you're a hero to
the new guys because they they're still
thinking in terms of run to the store
and buy radio in a box right and they
start seeing that there's a whole world
out there APRs is a tiny tiny part of
ham radio but it's one I particularly
like because there's so much hands-on
stuff you can do with it you can this
was a kit that I built this was all put
together by me though it was all
commercial components but you can I
think you can actually still buy the the
open trackers as a kid if you wanted to
build yourself so you can build
everything - some of the top level
transceivers that we use in our home Pam
shocks as kits or you can turn around
buy it built that is excellent and it's
so much fun getting your in building
that oh yeah well tray thank you so much
you of like you know opened my eyes to
some it you know like it's it's nice to
look at some of the other spectrum
that's going on this is you know your
typical AK or Wi-Fi geek yeah I hope
that when this airs and we get a bunch
of feedback if we called on you to maybe
come back and get a little bit more
detail if we get some questions very
interested thank you so much it's been a
real pleasure yes sir thank you so for
for more information about getting
involved in in amateur radio where's the
place they can find the clubs hey or RL

of day 3 and I am back in Williamsburg
to end my adventure and I guess ending
another episode of hack 5 this being the
second in a row of non-traditional hack
5 so of course we're looking forward to
your feedback especially with the ham
radio stuff which I thought was very
cool if you've got questions about the
packet radio stuff whatever just sent it
by feedback at hackpad org we'll try to
put those together and I have Trey back
on really cool guy very glad that he was
able to come down and show us and it
just introduced us to something you know
stuff that as the typical you know
hackers computer geeks may not be on the
forefront of our mind also I wanted to
let you know about a new show on
revision3 called web zeroes it's a
sitcom about a true of guys that are
trying to become a famous and it airs
October 7th so the Wednesday that this
release is and while I haven't seen it
yet I am a huge fan of nonfiction on our
I'm sorry fictional you know shows on
the web I mean I I can't think of
anything other than pure ownage honestly
so I think there should be more of them
and I'm looking forward to seeing that
as well so give it a shot revision
three.com slash web zeroes and we will
be back next week back in studio with
Matt and Shannon and Jason Applebaum
will be joining us
hey there to put together a touch screen
LCD hack which i think is going to be a
lot of fun and I don't know if math
commutative playing with the fire that
week or next but there's bound to be a
whole bunch of fun stuff happening in a
more traditional and studio show
so anyway that is it for me and on
behalf of Matt and chin and the rest of
the gang I had five but we're wishing
you to trust your Tecna list
oh this is a dead end I don't think I'm
at the right place
authorized personnel only beyond this
point excuse me Jack Sparrow looking
chap can you point me in the way of the
Pirate Bay
I hear they have Torrance I have pure
Guardian is it here in the putt-putt
this could be so much fun
can't wait to see all the water that man
take at the Tesla easy pass
wait
start happening
