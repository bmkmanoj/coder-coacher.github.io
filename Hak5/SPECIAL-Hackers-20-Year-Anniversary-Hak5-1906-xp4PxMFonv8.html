for those late packs
domain.com cola these soft drink of the
elite hacker so find a payphone in a
remote location that's right this is a
payphone
don't ask and as you can see it's just a
simple Radio Shack tone dialer replace
the megahertz crystal with the six point
five five three six yeah program five
asterisks in a row so make the sound
that a quarter me and never again pay
for a service that would be dirt-cheap
if it were run by a bunch of
profiteering gluttons remember hacking
isn't just a crime it's a survival trait
zero cool crash override acid burn these
were the names of the characters of the
1995 film hackers and if you are on IRC
in the 90s they were the handles of just
about every other kid joining the scene
watch your mom buy you a beautiful
Christmas as hackers reaches its 20th
anniversary we are celebrating the film
that pays tribute to the hacker culture
itself you see behind the cyberpunk neon
pagers and rollerblades insanely great
28.8 bps modems and the far-out network
visualization is a treasure trove of
hacker history and lore baked in by the
real hackers and technical directors
behind the scenes there are many images
to the various notable people and
elements of the scene and these are a
few of our favorites serial killer
phantom freak and Lord and icon all of
the hacker handles in the movie were
actual handles used by real hackers
whenever the master of disaster huh the
hopeless man utterly hopeless ultra
laser dr. doom remember the game the
hackers playing in arcade turns out it
is called wipeout the graphics were
created on a high-end SGI server and let
the development team try hacks and
gameplay before the game was actually
ported to PlayStation some features and
gameplay from the movie don't exist in
the Finnish game an example being the
high score smashing sequence William
Gibson has a bunch of associations in
the movie
he coined the term cyberspace in 1982
for his book Neuromancer the word cyber
space is used multiple times in the
movie the computer the hackers have to
break into is called it Gibson as well
and lastly Eugene Belford used the term
keyboard cowboy which could have been
derived from the Neuromancer book where
Gibson used the terminology console
cowboy this is our world now the world
of the electron and the switch the
beauty of the body we make use of a
service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap but wasn't
run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons
these are the words recited by the FBI
agents posted outside Joey's apartment
in the film the text comes from the
conscious of a hacker which is also
known as the hackers manifesto it's a
short essay written by Legion of Doom
member the mentor and was made famous
being published in the e-zine frack
magazine in 1986 it's coming bullshit
the rainbow series is a set of books
published by the DoD and some are shown
in the movie as date names them one by
one while all of the manuals are
actually real two of them the pink shirt
book and the UNIX Bible were not a part
of the rainbow series there are also a
few famous names worked into the film
Eugene Belfort or the plague as he's
known to the hackers uses the pseudonym
Babbage at the end of the film this is
of course an homage to Charles Babbage
the man considered the father of
computing in 1822 he developed a
mechanical computer known as The
Difference Engine it's on display today
at the London Science Museum just in
case you need yourself an 8,000 pound
calculator and serial killers IRL name
Emmanuel Goldstein is another amage so
may be quick to point out that that's
actually the name used by Eric Corley
the publisher of 2600 the hacker
quarterly he was indeed a technical
consultant on the film so there's no
surprise there but the name Emmanuel
Goldstein is actually taken from George
Orwell's famous novel 1984 there's
another orable referenced by serial
killer in the film as well and your name
goes to like 17 computers the day 1984
you ready there that's a typo or
and now he's living large we have no
names man no names we are nameless
douche go fry
Penn Jillette plays a character named
Hal in hackers this is a reference to
how nine thousand from 2001 a Space
Odyssey
we got one person online the workload is
enough for like 10 users I think we got
a hacker the virus is at the end of the
film are references to real-world
Trojans and proto viruses arf-arf gotcha
is a reference to the 1985 Trojan horse
program egg beater it was disguised as a
graphics utility aimed at improving EGA
performance but actually deleted the
hard drives file allocation table
leaving along the arf-arf message Cookie
Monster was an actual bit of malware
developed in the 1970s and used at
universities to annoy fellow mainframe
timeshares and PDP mini computer users
the program would block user processes
and demand cookies it's only when the
user would type cookie that the system
would begin to respond the official
website of the movie was made to look
like it was hacked into around the time
of release graffiti and instructions to
see the net instead were added the net
was another movie about computers and
hacking that starred Sandra Bullock and
came out in the same year both movies
got mixed reviews phone phreaking played
a heavy role in the film with scenes
featuring would-be red boxes to bypass
automated coin toll systems and get free
phone calls from payphones we also see
the Phantom freak using the switch hook
dialing method in prison to route a call
to the operator yes this method still
works today or at least here in the
United States just rapidly switch the
receiver hook 10 times the pulse dial is
zero
good luck getting a human operator
finally the gang uses a set of acoustic
couplers late in the film to route their
calls through a bank of pay phones on a
different level in New York's Grand
Central Station
this buys the crew a bit of time before
eventually getting busted you see The
Onion Router just didn't exist back then
and finally my favorite scene in just a
few seconds on the final hacking scene
is a tiny yellow poster in the
background reading
trust your techno list while it was
never actually set in the film a couple
of podcasters in 2005 quite fancy the
sang and started using it here and there
perhaps you've heard of it
so these are just a few of our favorite
trivia about hackers but what are yours
leave them in the comments below
