bitbucket by Atlassian welcome to HEC
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IP ninjas before I get
started don't forget to hit the
subscribe button if you are watching
this on YouTube so you see all of our
newest tech tip episodes
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are discussing packages and Linux in
most common operating systems these days
software that you run in the operating
system itself
update on a routine basis and sometimes
automatically with new features now
usually if you want to manually update
those you can do so through the
graphical user interface but a cool perk
of Linux is being able to do a lot of
this stuff through the terminal updates
are called packages and maintaining them
is called package management packages
come as dot de B's for Debian style
distros like Ubuntu as I am using here a
package consists of its packaged files
which is a series of files that make up
the software repositories which are
basically different versions of the
software package and dependencies and
you guys know if you watch hack 5 how
much I just love dependencies I'm lying
I hate dependencies dependencies are
commonly used programs or libraries that
your package depends on to work now one
way to think of dependencies is how for
example if you're watching an online
video like right here on YouTube
sometimes it won't work if you don't
have html5 or installed or something
like that if you don't already have
Flash installed which we do not
recommend using here now some packages
won't work without having those
dependencies installed first now in the
terminal packages use D package or
apt-get or aptitude to run an
installation in Debian and I'll show you
an example on my computer you can type
in apt-get update to update the packages
on your machine now if you are like me
and you don't run in superuser you
definitely need to add sudo before the
command to run it and type in your
password and then it will update for you
now a lot of times you can guess what a
package file is called without looking
it up for example Firefox is most
likely Firefox so let's try it here sudo
apt-get install Firefox hit enter and
you'll notice I already have it
installed otherwise to search the
repositories available for your
operating system you can use sudo apt
cache search Firefox and you'll be able
to find all the different repos
available to install often times I have
to install dev files for software that
I'm testing for my various shows so it's
a lot of installations that I do if they
aren't found in the Debian repositories
I can install them with deep package now
to do so and check it out on my computer
it's dpkg so d package tak tak install
and then the name of the file whatever
it is dot de Bie so make sure to add
that dot Deb at the end now chances are
pretty high you will run into dependency
errors so you will want to run sudo
apt-get install pack F now lastly a pro
tip for you guys if you want to install
several packages at once you can also do
that which is super useful you'll type
in sudo apt-get install and then package
one whatever it might be
package two and I have a lot of browsers
on my computer so I'll use brave and you
could install all three at the same time
now after the breaks I'm going to show
you how to uninstall packages from the
terminal but first a quick word from our
sponsors let's be honest your code is
your world you create it you tweak it
you lovingly obsess over it every single
day so picking the right repository
management tool is super important only
the best for your code right I mean it's
your baby you want to make sure you have
the best that's why the team Atlassian
created bit bucket the bucket is the get
solution for professional teams helping
over 5 million developers build with a
purpose the bucket gives teams of all
sizes free yeah that's right I said free
private repositories with
state-of-the-art features like the
world's best pull request algorithm
built in continuous delivery and
integration with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and sure what you get 0
integration since it is from Atlassian
giving your team everything you need
take your code from Khan
all the way to customer we have used
bitbucket to share private code and
collab on it so that the code is
extremely perfect before we release it
into the wild bitbucket is for the code
that takes us to Mars decodes the human
genome or drives your next car or maybe
it's for your next InfoSec tool you can
visit bitbucket org flash for the code
to start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try bitbucket today what will your code
do we are now back with more software
package management you can use sudo
apt-get remove and then whatever your
package is called to uninstall software
just like I did here I'm going to hit no
because I don't want to uninstall
Firefox you don't need to add dot DB to
it if you noticed I didn't type in
Firefox dev or whatever the newest
Firefox file is called I just put it in
Firefox and then it was going to
uninstall it but I said no obviously now
to see all of your packages installed
you can type D package and then - - or
tech tak list and it's going to be a
very very long list it's a really big
list because it shows you everything you
can also see if a very specific package
is installed with B package - test
status and then I'll use Firefox is my
example again or you can try app cache
show Firefox now lastly to see which
package you try to install that needed a
specific file type you can type in deep
package search and then whatever that
file is or that file type now stay tuned
because coming up on hack tip we are
going to chat about using flash drives
with your terminal because surprisingly
there's a lot to cover with that until
then I want to hear your feedback how do
you keep your programs up-to-date do you
do it manually through the terminal or
just assume that they're going to do it
in the GUI hit me up in the comments and
be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 sister show hack 5 over at
youtube.com slash hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your tech no less
