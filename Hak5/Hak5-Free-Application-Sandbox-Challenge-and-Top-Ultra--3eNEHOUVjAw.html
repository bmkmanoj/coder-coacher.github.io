detection the top ultra software and
more I'm Shannon Morse and you are
watching hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by netflix go to assist Express
remote support made easy and domain.com
got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is Gerren
kitchen and I'm Paul device and I'm I'm
over I'm getting I think I think this is
the last day of my cold you said that
yesterday well alright I woke up and
it's still kind of I try not to do that
in the a block yeah so but L great
episode today we have the very first
snowboard right yeah that's not
unwatched a little premium yeah yeah
well she did really well with the
lighting and everything so we'll have a
little bit of Shannon on a little later
I am back from the British Isles yeah
how was jolly old England it's good good
the weather sucked yes yeah I was riding
through rain and while each show least I
actually with the winter to go to
England it was my birthday it would get
a better birthday I you're right mom
why did you do that nine months -
February anyway so it's his fault -
anyway point being but how was the
actual drive it was good you're on the
other side of the road which I mean
you're driving in a trash it could be
honest that was not the difficult part I
just kept on saying in my head drive on
the left drive along not a big deal once
you get on the motorway it's like
whatever right there's that there's a
divider but but when it first got on and
I'm worried we've driven through Toronto
before in Canada well yes - yeah well
they don't drive on the left but we're
used to you know European things like
km/h and stuff like it so I get on there
and I'm looking at like I'm like aha oh
well okay so alright 50 no problem I'm
gonna stay in the right lane right lanes
the slow lane go fifty fifty kilometres
an hour no problem
why is everybody on my ass yeah so once
I realized I was going half the speed
limit in the wrong you know in the fast
lane you
I got that all figured out but no it was
actually absolutely brilliant they've
the the road between Sheffield and
Manchester was the most gorgeous I've
ever written on Bar None absolutely even
though I was riding in the snow so like
I'm reading like this
driving while you're in the country
didn't have to stop and meet the locals
no no I didn't know I had to stop for
some sheep that we're crossing the road
because those are the locals and
literally was counting sheep I'm not
nodding off I'm just like there were so
many frakking sheep especially in North
Wales but but like I'm writing like this
with like one hand on the accelerator
and one hand just doing like this like
swiping my helmet the biggest biggest
problem but other than that absolutely
brilliant had a phenomenal time and I
was so worried about riding through
London like the city proper it was
actually a breeze yeah there was traffic
stopped on the m4 I think for like two
miles straight and I got to take the bus
lane
no-one's on it just meaning yeah it's
like the reversion of the HIV but only
you know caught motorcyclists no there's
no buses that take the bus lane that's
the problem and and you can Lane split
so when traffic gets bad you can get in
between the cars you can do that in
California too I'll find that out and I
won't grab the medicine Oh Sam oh that's
oh it's great it's no no it's not it's
not dangerous at all when you're when
they're going really slow and you're
just going 10 15 20 in between
everyone's great I didn't have to pay
congestion charges while I was in I just
watched something on that that sounds
ridiculous that you have to pay for the
traffic it's got a really suck if you
live in that congestion thing it's like
wake up in the morning yeah and there
goes eight pounds but but the coolest
thing was the bike box and I knew that
they've got this in Thailand but they
also have this and in Britain and and
it's the coolest thing so you come up to
the roundabout because they can't do
intersections they just want to drive in
circles and right before the light is
this green box for bicycles but also
scooters and motorbikes and use it so
you Lane split all the way up the line
so there's like all these fracking cars
are you skip all the way by and then you
get to get in the start so you're always
the first one off the line
and you can skip the green light to I am
okay so in I know this is totally not
what you tune today this is not what you
tuned in hack five four you're probably
expecting some technology sooner promise
is coming but but let me just get off
this rant real quick so you know how in
the state's it's like you know it's
green and then it's gonna go yellow
before it goes red well it also in and
there they blink yellow before they go
green letting you know hey we're about
to go green but if it happens to be
clear go ahead and blow through let's
get back onto the tech stuff what what
do we have coming up well I did need to
mention something about the DHCP rogue
servers that we were talking about last
week with Robin wood it turns out our
very own Tim Ashley a member of our
forums has written together an awesome
tool here for detecting possible rogue
DHCP servers on your land it's a Windows
tool pretty easy to fire it up go over
to Tim Ashley dot M E and that's where
you can find it yeah you you have a
problem with your helmet that I remember
you bitching that as soon as you came
back because I'm like where's we're at
where's your well I didn't take as much
video as I had hoped just because I was
going through a lot of rain sleet and
snow I figure you would have had
something I know I had mentioned and I
was so happy that I got a couple of
clips in Dublin but uh but yeah normally
my my camera sits right here right and I
had actually modded the helmet somewhat
where I took out this little piece of
plastic that sat here and it turns out
that that little piece of plastic quite
important I hadn't run into this problem
before in the summer but it turns out in
the winter what it's for is to keep your
breath like from not going onto the back
of the visor here so well it was like
grit and salt and sand and snow and
stuff on the outside of my visor it was
fog on the inside so it's pretty much
riding with my visor like half open the
whole time tears going down my eyes and
it's not dripping down my nose it's not
a pretty sight
but it was still you know excellent fun
seven hundred and seventy
miles I don't know how any of this
sounds fun but it was okay it was a
challenge it wasn't you know it wasn't
what you would consider it's just a real
real man just driving in the winter I
think that what is made of yeah stop
yeah everywhere on the CBF's and getting
sick you know but it was worth it
I keep telling myself that because I
caught back to 13 voicemails and find
out I was retroactively leaked and but
anyway well I'm still going to a club
whoo as the caning we have to start
selling stuff we're on one camera now no
no no I had the other cameras I left the
other sets we've ripped stuff up Ward's
came in and even the lights will be
going pirates came and they still poor
gonna sell this no stop it
no I gotta go stubborn we gotta finish
the show you can't do it down yet but
yeah yeah keep an eye out on the hack
shop if you're looking for some act 5
stuff some we were the part of that's
actually already been taken well it
could easily become a set for anybody
yeah 30 for the right price there you go
yeah 190 K and you can have the hack
House I mentioned I mentioned in 701
we're gonna you know the transitions and
everything and then I said I'm gonna go
on a vacation and I didn't know that my
employer was gonna give me a little kick
in the boot but then I found out that me
and half the other employees they just
can't afford to pay anymore well oh well
so that's it yeah thanks everybody for
showing up at the meet up sided fabulous
time and let's go ahead and just kick it
off the proper find out what's going on

a great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com application sandboxing
can it really save users from themselves
this week Darren is taking to frisian
boxes and taking them on a spin around
the red-light district with internet
explorer 6
but first what is application sandbox
name Thank You DK take it away right now
imagine that this playground is your
hard drive and this adorable lovable
monkey here is the retarded Internet
Explorer 6 I mean sure you could let him
run apeshit but you'd end up with poo
flung everywhere and into registry and
eventually your system would run as a
crawl I mean remember this monkey
represents ie6 what a whore so since we
can't tame the monkey let's go ahead and
restrict him to the sandbox
let him fling poo and get herpes ollie
once meanwhile your hard drive in your
registry are absolutely clean and when
you're done it's just simply a matter of
taking out the litter and replacing it
with a fresh poof Rhys and box it's a
novel idea but does it work so to find
out I've taken two free sandboxing
solutions to the Internet's famous
red-light district there's actually
nothing in this I don't know why I'm
holding it first up is Komodos internet
security
for release candidate you can pick it up
with registration at the comodo forms it
installs fairly simply offering secure
DNS and opt-in to its premiere club of
paranoid virus fearing nitwits a simple
reboot later and you're off sort of it's
unclear how the sandboxing feature works
in this new version so I went poking
around now the program itself isn't
exactly what I would call intuitive I
mean sure the antivirus and firewall
bits all seem to be in order but where
is the sandboxing feature right-clicking
on the system icon reveals that it's
enabled but that's not all that
reassuring back in the control center I
poked around the more heading no defense
plus yeah there it is sandboxing so with
all this I can choose what programs are
in the sandbox and toy realm of the
settings are specifically run as program
in the sandbox
now the sandbox settings were lacking
imagination the sandbox security setting
let me choose from enabled or disabled
why was it a slider I mean that kind of
suggests that there are more settings
but there's not it's just on or off so
what was wrong with the checkbox I
digress if you really want to find the
fiddly bits you have to enter the
programs in the sandbox menu and from
there you can add a program and finally
get some sort of explanation about what
the levels of sandboxing are untrusted
restricted limited and unrestricted and
if that's not insightful enough there's
a Help button which is broken so let's
just go meet the competition sandbox see
it's slogan trust no program it's been
around for a while and we may have even
featured it on the show but with over
three hundred and fifty segments who
could keep track still let's put it to
the test first getting set up a
brain-dead installer followed by a
simple enough application that sort of
mimics a task manager you can create
multiple sandboxes and from within there
run programs whatever you'd like opening
the whore that is ie6 was made simple by
a desktop shortcut and any arbitrary
program can just be run in the sandbox
by right-clicking on the icon and
explorer and it's got a little
integration there in the context menu
and yes of course I had to try running
sandbox II in sandbox II and no that did
not work so now that we've got two
sandbox Windows VMs let's add a third as
a control with no protection whatsoever
and then send all three monkeys off on a
couple of challenges set
the fine folks over at irce hak5 org so
first up to find a serial key for
battlefield 2142 and while we're not one
to promote software piracy we will
browse blatant scam sites in the name of
science
remember kids winners don't do where's
our Komodo VM started by launching AI
explorer.exe in an untrusted sandbox
which was an adventure in itself with
all the hourglasses it might be 2142 by
the time we actually start browsing here
when we finally did find the key gen
crack serial where's thingy
we were prompted to install an ActiveX
program so we did and eventually we were
offered a dubious zip file which we
saved to our desktop but it wasn't there
a glance with explore should the filing
question didn't exist
downloading again in Internet Explorer
showed that it was there obviously the
Komodo sandbox was working but what
about sandbox sandbox C's Internet
Explorer was also hit by the same
ActiveX program which we probably
accepted and moments later we were
downloading the crack serial key gen
thingy which sandbox he offered to
immediately recover before running the
program we ran it through virustotal
comm to see what it contained and sure
enough it was busting at the seams with
backdoors Trojans hack tools you name it
and of course we ran it sandboxed knew
all his signs of infection so far but
how was our unpatched system handling
not very well things started out fair
finding a crack but along the way we
were bombarded with ActiveX requests
soon in our browser had extra toolbars
and without warning we were downloading
popular screen savers and hunky guys
started showing up on her desktop
wallpaper no matter we had found our
crack serial set of thingy and moments
later were bobbing their heads to the
cheerful chip tunes of P gen music and
then things turned for the worse
dll's started crashing and consoles
started popping up and then we were
aided by this new XP antivirus program
and for just $50 we could have 6 months
of protection from this evil spyware
with our sandbox VMs still alive we set
up for the second challenge which
involved a monkey some bananas and
something called a lesbian spanked
inferno
suffice it to say after a half-hour of
research it was time to check on the VMS
the Komodo protected Internet Explorer 6
crashed a few times one time displaying
a message about malware or something so
we clicked ok and it restarted ie6 and
took us to a page with an animated gif
that looked like antivirus or something
and it offered us a file to download
which we tried to say yes but once again
Mota wouldn't let us touch the file
system sandbox II on the other hand
allowed us to download the file which
was great because we were greeted with a
nice little dialog telling us the
security tool it successfully installed
hooray this security tool told us that
we had 26 infections and for just $80.00
we could have a lifetime software
license and a security tune-up for only
$30 more and lifetime premium support
for an extra 20 bucks using Internet
Explorer is really expensive I decided
to keep serving unprotected and the
security's will even offered to save a
report so what was this report well a
text file of file names and descriptions
of various trojans so let's check the
scoreboard Internet Explorer 6 with no
sandboxing at all completely hosts
sandbox he fared ok in the where's round
but then picked up something nasty in
the battle chicka wow wow Dept and
Komodo is still run smooth so we decided
for a last test was what we really
needed for these boxes were some Windows
updates and to lend a hand in an awesome
link we got ours from mark from hack 5 s
very own IRC GV gamers code CC / update
yeah that's the Windows Update address
alright so let's fire it up and see how
they fare the unprotected ie6 box wasn't
going anywhere anytime soon and the
sandbox T box well it browsed to the
fake Windows Update page no problem
downloaded the critical update dot exe
and even you know ran it no problem just
terminated unexpectedly go figure so how
did Komodo do well just as before the
file system virtualization kicked in and
nothing actually downloaded or touched
the file system
so what's our conclusion well obviously
if you were trying to get owned ie6 is
the ticket and if you're just looking
for some basic sandboxing sandbox is
actually not a bad choice just keep in
mind it's going to allow you to save
files back to your actual file system
very easily which is a good and bad
thing just mainly don't do any of that
and you should be okay and if you're a
complete noob comodo actually might even
save you from yourself or you know maybe
put it on your mom's system with Firefox
or Chrome and keep it updated and well I
don't even need to go there and I guess
at this point I'm going to go ahead and
toss it over to Shannon see what's going
on with trivia this week's trivia is

few weeks ago is talking to Shannon and
I mentioned how I thought something was
krad ultra elite and this of course led
to a tangent about how deadly speak is
and cool like kewl and software codec
mega packs and notepad + + + now with
more ascii so to find out just how
relevant software of this nature is
Shannon went on a mission to find the
very best windows ultra software
take it away snubs thanks Darren so I
set off recently to find out if there's
any merit to all of these titles that
claim to be ultra there's a couple of
rules that I set the first one it has to
be Windows and it has to be free like
freeware open source or shareware like a
trial version so let's set off and check
out the five top ultra krad elite super
ultra software for Windows number 5 it's
the super ultra krad elite ultra
screensaver maker you can find this at
ultra screensaver maker com
it's pretty basic what it does you can
fire it up toss in a whole bunch of
pictures of mom and the cat and the dog
and the children and the hamster and the
rat and the snake and whatever else you
have toss in a
it's very nice legal mp3 add in some
transitions and the text effect that
says I'm naughty money and then send it
off to your mom for Mother's Day after
you click one button
BAM you have a screen saver you can try
it for free for 21 days or for $20 you
can keep it forever and send your mom
those every year to be honest I would
probably save the 20 bucks and give my
mom something that actually is very
useful and then make her a free slide
show I'm gonna pass on this one
remember 4 is pong ultra sounds pretty
sweet huh it's hung you'd
sourceforge.net this is the only pong
game that I know of where you have a
level editor and power-ups but I'd still
really need to know why you would need
power-ups the website hasn't been
updated since 2003 which is fairly
obvious and it doesn't work on Windows 7
so sorry everybody that's already
upgraded the package is also missing the
alleged 40 dll file for some reason it
does work on Dass so you can play it on
the 386 but myself I'm just gonna power
up my old Atari and play it on there
because it's a ton easier and I don't
need no power up number three is the
ultra network analyzers it's basically a
protocol analyzer that helps you figure
out any kind of problems that you may be
experiencing on your network but to be
honest it's so full of fail it's not
even funny just save yourself 30 bucks
for the standard license or $2.99 for
the site license just go do mode
Wireshark use that program to figure out
any kind of problems you have and save
yourself some money
number two is ultra VNC which you can
find at UV and c-calm it's basically
just that it's a VNC that allows you to
remote into a server and fix any
problems you may be experiencing it's
ideal for remote access into servers on
a secured network in conjunction with a
secure layer such as SSH or VPN other
than that it's a little bit insecure and
it's a bit cumbersome from my liking and
number 1 is ultra defrag which you can
find at ultra defrag sourceforge.net
first of all it has fastest optimization
which means it sticks all the data at
the beginning of the disk in seconds you
can right-click on just one file or a
series of files or a series of folders
and just defragment those why spend
hours on end defragmenting your entire
disk when you can just do the couple of
files that you need to organize and
third you can schedule defrag which is
very nice so you don't have to sit
around manually and defrag everything by
hand all in all a very nice piece of
software I can actually see myself using
this one a lot so I would say two out of
the five were somewhat useful ultra VNC
was pretty nice well ran a piece of
equipment and ultra defrag was a pretty
cool piece of program I could see myself
using that one quite a bit but I want to
consider either one ultra if you think
you have an ultra piece of software or
something krad super ultra mega secret
