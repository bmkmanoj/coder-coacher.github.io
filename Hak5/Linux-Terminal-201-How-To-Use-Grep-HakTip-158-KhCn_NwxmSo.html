today on Hot Chip we are talking all
about grep welcome to hack tip the show
will we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IP
ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are talking all about grep you did
request it in the comment section of my
last episode of hack tips so today I am
doing an entire episode dedicated to
grep so first off grunt stands for
global regular expression print and grep
is basically used to print the output of
regular expression texts unlike the
search commands that I previously
discussed grep searches inside of text
documents to find specific phrases that
you request so what is a regular
expression since we are going to be
using these with grep well regular
expressions dot info describes them as
wildcards on steroids and we did do a
previous episode on hack tip all about
wildcards now sometimes you will see
regular expressions shortened to reg X
or reg XP for funsies regular
expressions are basically special text
strings that are used to describe a
special pattern they do get a lot more
complicated than wildcards but they can
also increase your productivity once you
have a few of them memorized now I will
do a separate episode on regular
expressions and how to use them all but
in the meantime let's focus on grep and
you will find that you will learn some
regex just by using grep because of
their close relation so Gress arguments
are sorted like this first you have grep
and then you have your option and then
you have the regular expression and then
you have whatever file you're trying to
search inside of or files if you're
searching in multiple files so let's go
ahead and get into some examples now I
did CDR ready over to my snubs stuff
folder where I have a whole bunch of
test documents so you'll see that on my
computer and in here if I use LS tack L
you'll notice that all of these are just
a bunch of text documents of show notes
that I have done on previous shows and
all sorts of other shows that I do you
should check it out so I can use grep
Shannon
with a capital S texting start exp so
I'm wild carding texting with dot txt at
the end to find the text Shannon in any
file associated with the name texting
with something after it dot txt so for
example I found this one right here and
I'll highlight it so it's easy to see
Shannon mentioned she was taking anchor
battery blah blah blah and this is in
texting space one two three txt so that
is where the wild card came into play is
that space one two three keep in mind
and I'll press up so you can see that
command again whenever you are using a
grep command it is case sensitive for
both the text that I'm looking for in
the file name now if I add attack I so
I'll do that right before Shannon and
hit enter that makes it case insensitive
so it's also going to find any time my
name is lowercase or uppercase like this
example right here but there is a slew
of text here so if I just want to show
the names of the text files that contain
Shannon I can use grep again and instead
of tech I I'll use tack lowercase L
Shannon txt or texting txt so this time
it's just going to show me the names of
the text documents alternatively if you
just want to see files that don't have
the word Shannon in them use a capital L
instead and you will notice in this
occasion that all of my text documents
have the word Shannon in them no matter
what which makes sense because they're
all show notes
now try those out with various words and
I will be right back after a word from
our sponsor when you are looking to
improve your wireless network making
sure your entire home has a strong
signal is a must
that's where Iiro comes in they are
launching the very first second
generation mesh Wi-Fi system that comes
with one arrow and one to two beacons
these are mesh access points not
extenders if they are smaller they plug
into an outlet they have an ambient
nightlight and they are more powerful
than the originals but if you already
have the originals euro has you covered
these babies are backwards compatible
and they can be purchased separately
systems start at 399 for all three
components together but if you just want
to buy
to add on you can and they are cheaper
than the originals at 149 each we've
gotten a chance to test these in the
warehouse where our Wireless usually
does not reach from one end to another
the Ihram mesh does a really great job
of fixing that headache and it gives me
the speeds that I pay for euro is also
announcing the ero plus subscription
which includes advanced network security
monitoring simple menteng those features
already built in that you get for free
with the device and content filtering
which is great for houses with kids now
with any system you buy you do get
automatic updates two-factor
authentication for admin access and eros
backing with a bug bounty program and
third party audits as well
learn more at erode comm we are now back
with more grep next let's add a taxi and
we're going to find out what happens
hit that enter that looks a little weird
so this is going to show us how many
times the word Shannon appears in each
text document you can do something
similar to this with TAC n which would
be like this that also looks a little
strange this is going to show you the
line number that the word appears on as
well as the sentence that it appears in
now if your search for Shannon also
brings up output for words like Shannon
mannequins
eye relation Anakin's is the actual word
or something weird just use TAC W to
just search for the whole words that
match the specific word you are
searching for if that didn't make sense
this is what it would look like TAC W
and if I type in just Shann it won't
find anything because every time the
word Shann shows up in these text
documents is my full name its Shannon
this could also be useful if you are
searching for the word hack which also
has derivatives hacking hacker hackers
etc etc and you don't want those to show
up as potential outputs now wildcards
will also work by themselves so I could
just search for Shannon in any text
document by just erasing texting and
adding an O n on there there you go so
that will also find my name and all my
threat wires show notes for example but
here's a catch if you try to find a
phrase like grep Shannon Morse with a
wild card at the end for the text file
it's going to err RL seeing that there
is no
or file or directory' so if you do that
it would look like this and so far that
looks the same but if I scroll up you'll
see up here if I highlight that Morse no
such file or directory what do you do in
that case well for this example you
would find that quotation marks or
single quotes do output the right search
terms exact matches work with single
quotes if you are just searching for
multiple words as a string but if you
need to incorporate a shell variable for
example you want to use double quotes
instead and you will notice when I do
this in the doc Morse is also
highlighted in red any time it is found
of course it probably goes without
mentioning but you can use grep searches
for just one text document just have
completed also if you have a bunch of
subdirectories and you want to search
them all at once you can use grep attack
our Shannon wildcard txt or whatever
your search is also make sure when you
do that your tak R is capitalized like
so and while this all looks the same
because I don't have many other text
documents it will also find these binary
files so far we have just worked with
literal characters which are literally
the character that you are searching for
there are other types of characters in
regular expressions that you would use
with grep called meta characters which
are so meta and those take a whole
another segment to explain so I'm just
going to leave it at that for today be

that little like button if you got some
good info out of todays episode until
then I want to hear your feedback you
can comment below and be sure to check
out our sister show hacks by for more
great stuff just like this we just got
back from DEFCON a few weeks ago and we
have tons of interviews for y'all to
check out and I will be there reminding
you to trust your techno list
