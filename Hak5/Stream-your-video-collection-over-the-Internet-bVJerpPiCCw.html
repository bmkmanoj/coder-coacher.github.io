okay like a little bit earlier John and
I were talking about ways to stream
audio right well what about video I kind
of stopped watching you know using
RealPlayer and like the 17 oh no it's
not like streaming video like you're
thinking we're not going to like there's
no buffering yeah that's all we had like
an interview or go very well um this
isn't streaming video in the sense that
you're thinking like streaming like a
video of our hard drive ahead if you
want to like take you know hak5 to your
friend's house and play it from there
don't try to stream it over your box at
home just download two copies and bring
one is place alright so I'm a little
skeptical about it what we're doing
minute we're streaming television oh now
see that's and that's an idea right
there yeah we're streaming today would
you live cable television oh its head
alright cool I used to do this because I
work you know for me there's channel
that I used to watch and on my lunch
break I would watch you know this
certain TV show thank you for what did
something happen then they're kinda
longer around but but you know just
imagine you know you're at work i'm at
work well you know the only channel i
really watch was like the f1 races which
the f1 season is over so I what assuming
that it's a silk ok I one per print
pretend that i'm watching f wait wat 1
racing like a sunday afternoon i'm
installing icps I three-point oh and
like I got like six hours of downtime
and I'm like you know got to do
something well yeah I mean watch only
one race i pronounced it number one
sponsor of f1 so that kind of cannot do
right ok I like it ok so you know really
to do this what you need is a windows
machine with a TV tuner card ok how much
does a TV tuner card cost twenty twenty
bucks oh yes we're pretty inexpensive oh
you can find some deals out there um
newegg sure if you want to plug newaygo
wants to give us some money that'd be
great to what ok genuine ok so I'm vian
seed here into the the home theater PC
let's go over there right over there
over there ok you over there it
sits somewhere so yeah so okay so we're
in the we're in home theater PC alright
we're going to start up Windows Media
encoder when is meeting in code or not
it sounds something awful no
is this free it's free yeah you can free
download microsoft and we're gonna show
a ling ling somewhere likes may be over
there be there and put them right down
here where's put the link down here I
like it up there I don't know I don't I
do it's all over the place yeah so we're
gonna broadcast live event alright we're
going to select are you know video
source under audio source for a video
source I've got an ati rage theater
that's the all-in-wonder card that I
have right now much does that cost at
the time it was 200 i'm sure you can
pick it up for like twenty bucks now
it's bad guy so it's a 7,500
all-in-wonder it's nice its job done so
TV tuner TV tuner video tuner right
getting give it a channel 20 now this is
like the TV channel this is just how do
they have to be tuned in to the same now
Jana to pick it up alright so now we'll
choose the line in source on our audio
because that's where the TV tuner is
getting its audio feed okay go ahead
next the most important part pull from
the encoder not pushed to a media server
because a mini server costs like a
buttload there so next we just give it
the bot load being more than I'm willing
to spend yes so we give it a port number
port 8080 that are oh come on Tony the
8088 there there ok so now I've got to
set the encoding now there's got a whole
bunch of cool presets and you know they
work to spine I've got about five
hundred and twelve k upstream on my my
cable connection here so I'm gonna give
it a little bit less than that so is
that like typically a good idea to just
go one night below you know the way if
your roommate is like torrenting then
you don't smack them around yeah so 340
k for me that was fine so nerdy frames
per second three frames a second 320 240
finish I'm a little skeptical I gotta
start encoding trust me this is a lot
better than you're thinking alright so
let's minimize the server there okay and
we're over here on our client now okay
the client what's happening is media
player looks a lot like this openurl and
give it the dime dns or you know the IP
address of your cable connection of
course you can see our dns went a little
bit haywire everybody does yeah well the
lights started flickering okay there we
go it will open the stream and stop
train give it
no no come on me another want to see him
buffering hey that wasn't Duke I wasn't
too long now look at that I Darren what
is this that's the firm oh that's ready
I am honestly and press actually this is
the best seen from the firm yeah well we
watched some more of it but then we get
sued so okay well that's pretty much I
do yeah okay so that that actually is
pretty good quality is it's great
quality it's like I go I can watch them
yeah I could watch from work yeah it's
not bad that way you won't miss your
favorite show you can also their
settings in there to record it
automatically and whole bunch of fun
stuff will have a hole right up in the
Shoshone s wait at once again they will
be we're up here here over there
somewhere right over there you'll see
the show notes all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
