break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and iTune than just
I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm changing
my identity so sudo make me a sandwich
or something like that
BLT that sounds really good right now
now there are three ways that you can
change your identity you can lock back
in and then you could log back out and
change your identity to another user but
that's a long and annoying process in
the GUI or you can do the SU command or
sudo now su which looks like that lets
you start a new shell session as that
user or you can issue a single command
as that one sudo which looks like su doe
aha can define specific commands that a
user can use the choice depends mainly
on the operating system that you're
using as each one works a little bit
differently to start shell as another
user the syntax is su such as su and
then you have your tak l and the user
so it'll be su tech L and then whatever
the user name is Tech L will create a
login shell for that user now the tech L
can be seen as just tak as well so to
change to super user status you would
type in su tak and then your password
whatever that might be now you'll see
that root is in the place of the
username so if I put in su attack and
then it'll ask for the super users
password the root password and then
you'll see at the beginning it says root
now if you don't have a password set for
that you'll have to sudo su tak to go
into root and then you'll need to add a
password just for that extra added
security now always remember to type in
exit at the end of your login session as
we root so that you go back to your
normal username very very important you
can also type in su taxi command to run
just one single command as a super user
so an example of this would be typing in
sudo taxi then I could run and this is
just the one command that I want to run
as a root this is just an example I
don't know why you would have run an
example dot txt attack L like that but
you in this example we will put in the
root password and you'll see that it
shows up just fine now if you did put in
the password wrong or something like
that it will tell you access denied an
admin can also allow users to execute
certain commands with sudo for example I
could run sudo and then ducky script and
then type in your password which will
let you as a regular user run the ducky
script as a regular user instead all you
just have to do is put in your password
sudo tech L will show you what
privileges that you currently have so so
toe tag
shows me any kind of things that I can
currently do as Shannon and you can also
use CH own to change the owner or group
owner of a file and it looks something
like this
CH own and then you would have your
owner whatever that might be and the
group and your file whatever that files
name might be
now if the argument looked like Shannon
and then : users it would change the
ownership from its current one over to
Shannon and the group to users if it
said : admin this would change the group
owner to admins but the file owner would
stay the same so if I wanted to change
the ownership from me to Darrin I would
put sudo CH own and then Darren : so I
would put in you know Darrin example dot
txt and this won't work obviously
because Darrin is not a current user on
my commission and now that you know some
of the reasons why we have passwords for
users let's go ahead and change some of
those passwords yeah fun fun now to do
this you're going to use a syntax that
looks like passwd and then the user to
change it you'll just type passwd and it
will say the UNIX password for the
current user and you can enter your new
password now this is kind of funny
because check this out
now you'll see when I just typed in this
password it tells me you must choose a
longer password because apparently game
is a terrible password so I'll just try
let's try it I'll try this one
nope it doesn't like God as a password
either so now I'll try something a
little longer and it tells me password
wasn't changed because I just tried
tried to type in the same thing
authentication token manipulation error
so it's telling me you need to stop
because you're trying to change your
password way too many times and that was
another terrible one now if you
eventually get one that doesn't actually
come from a dictionary somewhere or is
only like three letters long is more
than you know eight characters at least
please make it longer than that then
you'll be able to change your password
you can check out the passwd man page
for more options for this command now
what do you think
make sure to email me tips at hack 5 org
with your thoughts or you can comment
below about what you think be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 and
check out threat Wire our new show over
