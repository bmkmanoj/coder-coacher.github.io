and Matt awesome oh and Shannon's over
there on the SNES hi hey um we've got a
cool show for you guys today so let's
just get started like yeah yeah she's
doing some game review stuff news we're
going to continue the the phone
phreaking segment that we did last week
put the beige box to use gonna learn
some stuff about some SI t tones which
is just like saying ATM machine but you
know we're going to learn how to get
some free long distance next time you
dial up your board and then we're going
to follow that along with some some
Harris Drake and stuff yeah I'm next
week I'm gonna be working on the rest of
the case mod and there's this whole bar
at the bottom like is everything that's
running okay and um this is like the
biggest thing like if you've been
following some of the earlier beta
builds this is like the biggest thing
that's been changing is this menu now
they actually call it start yet they put
the word start here and they say I'm
smart enough to figure that out well
right I know but they well before they
were saying like click here to begin and
looks like to begin what man like what
are we going to begin my computers
already start I know right so we're
already on already started but we click
start use the deck no no check it out
you get deck options man you get like I
can I can go with the beach dude that's
awesome yeah so but here's the thing
that keeps screwing me up right is this
little X button over here and you're
like all right what it was what am I did
I so double click over here yeah you can
double click on this and hoses just like
you're used to cool but then you can
also do that to smooth look yeah I like
just just go like that and then it
minimizes and okay so in addition to the
minimize and maximize buttons yeah we
got a close button yeah the other big
features it's got
it's got networking built-in dude if
you're like me and you have a love-hate
relationship with trumpet winsock you
are going to love the fact that it's got
IPX SPX so you know yo TCP is big man so
and then that buoy of course right so um
yeah win file man there it is yes so you
can see like all of the other folders
just just like it's you see any one
thing I'm Creator tree and you can set
it up you can split you know how have
you won right um the the file names
though don't look as good and the file
manager it like they do in explorer cuz
long filename support it's not eight dot
three anymore yeah this long filename
it's gonna be weird do I need to do
anything to like my existing files yes
speaking of which let's find out about
some games Shannon tell us what's going
on with the land party all right guys
get ready we are playing doom to skull
tag we're going to be playing at doom
hak5 org on saturday april 25th at three
p.m. eastern and don't forget to sign up
and vote for your favorite games and
check out screenshots from old games and
find out what's going on next month over
at hak5 land squarespace.com and let me
thank our wonderful sponsor Squarespace
Squarespace is dabomb it's a publishing
system for anybody looking to build a
fan page or a portfolio or maybe putting
your resume online anything like that
and it powers large businesses to small
reviewers and it gives anybody the
opportunity to build pages that are just
as powerful and flexible as those is the
big dog so guys forget about gopher go
over to squarespace com and don't forget
to use code hak5 when you're checking
out so you can get ten percent off the
life of your contract talk to you guys
about special information tones or si T
tones if you want to say I'm like that
and how we can use them to get like free
long distance when we call like bulletin
boards like cross state and stuff
not really sure if this will work
enchilada week we've got our DTMF phone
here and and it's important because
we've got the the numbers here on the
handset that actually changed out the
Eclipse from what I was using last week
I've i went with these nice ones that i
picked up a radio shack basically what
we're going to do is exploit a little
tone that happens when so look have you
ever like called a wrong number and you
get this little thing and it goes the
number you have called is not in service
doesn't have that right well the thing
is like that tone it like tells like i
don't know if it's like ESS five like
dms 100 it's going to like tell the
switch that the line you called like
isn't there right that's what those
tones are because like if you called
somebody in like I are like Egypt or
something right like they don't actually
like understand the words and stuff of
like Egyptian so what they do is those
tones like international man it's like
in the blue book dude so they're like
they're the first two tones like they're
different depending on what the error is
and then the last ones like the same I
guess for like error correction or
something but um so if you call long
distance man you don't want to get
charged for like a long distance phone
call if you like called the wrong number
that would be total BS right so we're
going to use that to our advantage right
so say like you want to call the black
ice BBS up in New York and like you know
especially if you're like mo deeply
telephone company that that call is like
not in service or whatever but you can
still stay on for like an hour or
whatever you know getting your time on
on that board and no problem like it's
not going to show up in your bill I
suggest given this a test first do like
a two-person like doom match first and
like call your boy and be like dude
don't type a TA until I you know until
let you know whatever this works great
if you've got two lines but um but yeah
just use your phone and you know play it
back I my sound blaster 16 you could do
the same thing with an all 32 and if you
don't just you know call a line that's
got a disconnected phone number and then
record those on to like your micro
cassette recorder or like a
mark card that has like one of those
little chips so anyway that's my
freaking tip this week next week we're
going to be talking about some hair
straight and equipment like Direct Taxes
test units and maybe a little bit about
time division multiplexing so anyway up

some more reviews and some more news for
you first off a couple of rumors rumor
has it that the playstation by Sony
which is a CD ROM based console it
recently released in japan in december
and it might be releasing in North
America in September which I'm looking
forward to also Chrono Trigger just
released in Japan this month and it
might be releasing in the US in about
six months oh god I really don't want to
wait for that one alright the Sega 32x
we all know about that one not the best
games the developers are moving on to
the Sega Saturn which is releasing in
about two months so the 32x they're
lowering the price on that one go ahead
and pick it up you Sega fanboys then
intend to ultra 64 that's the last one
on my list it's a cartridge-based wine
that we saw a picture of but we didn't
see the controller alright rumor has it
that this controller instead of you know
your regular pad like this it has an
analog joystick like Atari I don't know
brings being back to my Atari youth days
mmm yummy all right guys on to my review
the lion king it's by virgin interactive
entertainment it's this brand new game
for the SNES along with a couple of
other consoles i bought the one for the
s in the ass because well i have it i'm
going to go ahead and get into the game
for you okay so at the beginning you're
just a young simba you go through
basically the movie style of the game
eventually you turn into an adult and
you have to fight scarred just like the
movie the characters and the art in the
background is all based off of the movie
Disney artists actually created this
this art it's beautiful the music what
you can hear if I cut it up
is also based off the orchestra and the
soundtrack from the lion king disney
movie up in the top you can see a couple
of health bars the one in the left side
is your roar bar which can scare enemies
and the one on the right side is your
health bar which you can gain more
health by well picking up bugs of all
things down at the bottom you can see
that I have zero lives I know that's
horrible oh well I'm going to restart it
so I can show you a cheat mode so you
can get up to eight lives and you get to
restart as many times as you want in the
same level not only that but you can
choose which level you get to start on
you go to options press be a RR Y and
you immediately run into this marana
menu in the middle of nowhere you can
change your level and you can change
your invincibility so I can turn this on
so well I still die but I always end up
going back to the same level that I was
on so I can keep on playing as long as I
want it's sweet let's go ahead and play
a game all right also I just want to add
really quick the difficulty is a little
hard on this game even for your
experienced gamers like me so don't get
too frustrated with this game it's made
for you know your teens and your your
children but young adults have a little
bit of trouble with this too anyway I'm
