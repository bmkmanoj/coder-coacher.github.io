by domain.com
it's time once again to check port 110
it's like calls from the public Patrick
rights I currently have a linux server
in a closet that I want to set up to use
with VPN I have found so many solutions
but I really would like it if I didn't
have to use any additional software on
my mac and could just use the built in
VPN connection service do you know of
any of you VPN server packages which
will support this you know you want to
go with the most universal it seems to
be listen my experience pptp I found
like on like all versions of Windows
modern wives and pptp point-to-point
tunneling protocol as opposed I piece
and which is still pretty cool too pptp
of course has its problems with the MS
chap v2 authentication but you know that
aside it's still pretty good protocol
there's easy ways to set it up I know
that there's a great tutorial I was
following for Debian for using both pop
top as well as pptp d so those might be
too that you want to check out and of
course we value your suggestions so if
feedback a hack five dot org if you want
to suggest something other than openvpn
because Jonathan Sarna Jonathan um is
looking for a patrick is looking for at
a VPN servers that just not gonna
require software to be installed so it's
either ipsec with pptp Ron oh cool thank
you very much and our next email came
from Jonathan he writes just wanted to
know if you're if you recommend
disabling the SSID broadcast while
configuring routers does this help
increase security no it doesn't matter
doesn't matter at all no I mean I admit
you can basically see those hidden
networks anyway so I mean you can use it
as a sense that you know I always
recommend use anything at your disposal
to add layers of security yeah if you
want to just do mac address what is it
called um authentication on your
wireless router sure that's another
layer it's not to say somebody can't
spoof the mac address to get on if you
want to do disabling your SSID that
might trip someone up for all of 10
seconds until they see the probe or
something otherwise
you know I think like some of the most
secure wireless set ups I've seen my
ones where people use like wpa2 either
with radius or appreciate key and then
after that it just gets you into a DMZ
where you you know like a previous
question from Patrick have to use a VPN
to then get into the rest of the network
so you know layers it's all pretty good
but yeah I mean you can slow down there
layering we could in fact we could do a
second down pptp and and stealing
wireless from your neighbors I wouldn't
know anything about them okay and the
next one comes from we know highway no
he writes a okay this is how I say it a
pound is technically called a octa 40
just Thorpe octa Thorpe octa Thorpe well
ASCII decimal key 35 or unicode point
you plus 00 23 according to wikipedia at
least is in fact a number sign and as it
turns out this is typically called for
saying it in commonwealth english eight
hash or a hash key as opposed to you
know American English or in Quebec
English where it is considered a pound
sign and we probably just do this to
confuse the British because they've got
their British Pound Sterling signs
anyway that's why do sense so to confuse
matters more in Canadian English the
symbol is considered a number sign
whereas in Australia Russia and parts of
Europe that sign is represented by a
capital n with an underlined Oh next to
it and it's called a numero sign now
there's also the musical symbol sharp
which looks like a number sign but it's
not despite what Microsoft may say about
their programming language of the same
name so you know to confuse everyone
less or more more boyfriend the
telephone engineers in the 1960s
attempted to coin a universal name for
the symbol called an octo thorpe or a
knocked over it actually has several
spellings and obviously never became
popular at least not here so thanks so
much so that in yeah like we are trivial
knowledge I do too yeah I actually uh I
used to be in choir and I would call it
a sharp sure yes he uh you know because
it came up because we were talking about
bash scripting in the shebang you know
she for
or sharp oh right pound sign for for
excellent whatever you want to call it
so I think maybe we should get the
entire Linux community to get behind
this and from now on call an octo sort
bang yeah save me we'll be right back
