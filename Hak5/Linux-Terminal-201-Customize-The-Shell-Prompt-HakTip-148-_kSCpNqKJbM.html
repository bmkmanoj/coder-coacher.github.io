bucket by Atlassian welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas now before I get started
don't forget to hit the subscribe button
if you are watching this over on YouTube
so you see all of our new hack tip
episodes we have quite a few coming up I
am super excited to share the knowledge
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are customizing our shell prompt I am so
excited about this episode the shell
prompt is a little bit of text that you
see whenever you open your terminal so
for example if we look at my computer
mine says snubs at snubs XPS 13 which is
the name of my computer and then a
little dollar sign and that's it now if
I type in echo dollar sign ps1 with a
space between echo and ps1 it is going
to show me the echo prompt for string 1
and you'll get a series of random digits
and characters now mine constitutes a
slash U and H for username and hostname
and then W a for the current working
directory and a little ASCII Bell so the
computer is supposed to beep whenever it
sees the shell prompt now if you want to
edit your prompt you can backup the
original one by typing in whatever you
name you want to give it so for mine I'm
going to call it original underscore
backup equal dollar ps1 or something
similar to that but it is going to be PS
1 now you will know that it works if you
type an echo dollar sign original
underscore backup for my example to see
the original prompt during now you can
also delete your entire prompt by typing
in PS 1 equals and nothing after it or
you can just have the dollar sign show
up by typing in PS 1 equals slash dollar
sign now adding a space inside the quote
marks creates a space in your prompt as
well so you'll notice there is a space
between your shell prompt and the actual
command that you're typing out you can
re add the / H for host name and you can
add a timestamp with flash a and so on
and so forth now if you are interested
in learning all of the different options
that you can create with your shell
prompt make sure to check out the man
page for
- I know it's a really long man page but
if you check around line 2700 or so
there is tons of more information on
this and you can also google all of the
different commands that you can add to
your prompts now I will be right back
after a quick break let's be honest your
code is your world you create it you
tweak it you lovingly obsess over it
every single day so picking the right
repository management tool is super
important only the best for your code
right I mean it's your baby you want to
make sure you have the best that's why
the Tina Atlassian created bit bucket
the bucket is the git solution for
professional teams helping over five
million developers build with a purpose
the bucket gives teams of all sizes free
yeah that's right I said free private
repositories with state-of-the-art
features like the world's best pull
request algorithm Milton continuous
delivery and integration with your
favorite tools like docker AWS and sure
what you get 0 integration since it is
from Atlassian giving your team
everything you need to take your code
from concept all the way to customer we
have used bit buckets to share private
code and collab on it so that the code
is extremely perfect before we release
it into the wild the bucket is for the
code that takes us to Mars decodes the
human genome or drives your next car or
maybe it's for your next InfoSec tool
you can visit bitbucket org flash for
the code to start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try bitbucket today what will your code
do alright now let's change the color
yeah
color is controlled by something called
escape codes these codes do not appear
in the standard out but they will be
read by the computer as specific colors
so for example I want to make my prompt
purple so I would type ps1 equals and
then quotes backslash bracket backslash
0 3 3 and more brackets with 0 semicolon
3 5m inside of those brackets and then
the rest of it is normal I know it looks
weird but that is a color code but
purple turns out it's a little dark so
let's change it to light purple by
replacing the 0 with a 1 instead you can
also alternate colors you can
rainbow you can pretty much do whatever
you want you will notice that your
commands will also be that same color
though so to make sure that your
commands types end up a different color
like for example I like it when my
commands end up white you can add a
color code to the end of your program so
here's my example and I'm going to speed
this up a little bit because it is quite
long and it takes quite a bit of time to
type it out all right there we go now
lastly if you use a number starting in
four X instead of three X like 45
instead of 35 for purple it will then
make the background purple instead of
the text so keep that in mind too if you
want to change the background color and
with this as well you do need to end it
with a certain color so you would end
the line with 0 3 3 and then in brackets
0 m to make it a black background again
and now you know the basics of editing
your shell prompt and there are quite a
few different combinations so have at it
but how do you save it remember the
batch RC file now you can go into there
with either nanovirus yet it whatever
you prefer I prefer Nano so that's the
one I'm going to use and you can save
your new lines to the batch RC file at
the very end as PS 1 and you'll put that
on one line and type it all out or just
copy and paste like I do and then hit
enter a couple of times and put export
ps1 and then make sure to save your file
with ctrl o enter ctrl X to save and
quit out after saving at least in Nano
that's how you do it and you can check
your changes by typing in echo dollar
sign ps1 and hopefully it works right or
you can also close your terminal session
reopen it and see if your colors and
your different changes stayed for your
new shell prompt now for the easy way to
customize your problem now that you know
how to do with the hard way you can also
just go to easy prompt net and that's
easy prompt net yes there's there's a
website for that it's not as
customizable as doing it yourself but
you do have that option I prefer doing
it myself because I like changing colors
very specifically now stay tuned because
coming up next week on hack tip I will
be discussing packages yes that's right
I can hear your comments now so behave
yourself we are talking about apt-get
and B
package for example until then I want to
hear your feedback how to you show off
your shell prompt share your pics below
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 on youtube.com slash hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your
