who were just attacked this is threat
wire I'm Darren kitchen and this is
threat wire for November 25th 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom one use
strong passwords and avoid clicking on
suspicious links to disable gps
geo-tagging on your smartphone's camera
three use cryptocat signal or telegram
for an encrypted chat these are some
pretty good pieces of practical advice
that you can share with your families
this Thanksgiving it also happens to be
part of the ISIS guide on ops a core
operational security the guide that was
originally authored by a Kuwaiti firm to
a journalist and political activists
protecting their identities throughout
Gaza well the 34 page document there's a
link to the PDF in the description was
uncovered by researchers at the West
Point combating terrorism Center and
translated from arabic and it's that
that's the sort of the thing that's
causing problems for the Internet in
France which some outlets are going as
far as characterizing as a police state
this week the French National Assembly
declared a state of emergency
introducing a bill that would allow the
government to order ISPs to block
websites without judicial review and
seized electronic devices without a
warrant and you know while here in the
United States were protected by such
egregious violations of privacy through
the Constitution this action by France
for me at least feels like an attack on
my homeland the Internet so let's not
forget that recent law enforcement and
intelligence agencies here in the US
though have been really pushing for
encryption back doors that would
essentially have the Fourth Amendment
all but digitally eradicated the tech
sector by the way not so keen on this
notion this quote from Apple CEO Tim
Cook a few weeks ago exemplifies a
situation quote if you leave a backdoor
in the software there is no such thing
as a backdoor for the good guys only now
Robert litt a member of the DNA
I or the Director of National
Intelligence knows this an email
obtained by the post in August indicates
quote the legislative environment for
passing a law that forces decryption and
backdoors is very hostile today it could
turn in the event of a terrorist attack
or criminal event where strong
encryption can be shown to have hindered
law enforcement well it only took three
months for just such an incident to
occur as we've learned in a now redacted
New York Times story it was stated that
French officials speaking off the record
said the Paris attackers used encrypted
communications to coordinate their
attacks with Isis that's kind of a lot
of ammunition for the law enforcement
and intelligence communities in the u.s.
to push their anti encryption agenda
many of whom blame edwards snowden the
whistleblower for tipping off the
terrorist organizations that essentially
encryption works despite the fact that
the same terrorist organizations have
been using encryption for the past 15
years anyway point being it really
should be stated here that unlike some
sort of cold war-era school of thought
this is not a matter of like arms
control there is no to turn to
encryption like nuclear proliferation
we're not living in a world where like
some have it and others don't we're
essentially talking about math that's it
just in of itself it's just a large and
complex set of equations that are pretty
good at maintaining privacy and the
modern commerce that our interconnected
globalized world has become dependent on
and as it turns out math math is pretty
agnostic so if anything the revolutions
of Edward Snowden have actually created
a culture where by our rights can be
protected to the point where everything
from baby photos to animated gifs of
cats wearing headphones can be encrypted
in response to the continued violations
of our privacy of freedom and our human
rights throughout the world so remember
math doesn't kill people terrorists do
oh p.s it also turns out that dell
pulled a superfish and pre-installed
some TLS certificate that can be used on
men in the middle attacks snoop on HTTPS
traffic and if you're rockin Adele with
Windows you can either delete the e del
certificate from the cert manager MSC or
you know better yet just fdisk format
reinstall get rid all that crap anyway
also amazon reset some customers
passwords over a possible data leak and
it's now offering two-factor
authentication so maybe you want to go
and change your password and enable
two-factor authentication and do that
for your friends and family during the
holidays as well oh and sam here was
