years ago on hack across America 3d
printers were like the mainstay and Wow
do I have an awesome guest with us today
to help me understand how the market and
how the whole industry has changed Ben
thank you for joining us
glad to be here Dan so from what I
understand
Alif objects builds one of the like most
recognized 3d printers in the market the
lulzbot
mm-hmm yeah we build the lulzbot 3d
printers yeah so we have a couple
different models and you've been with
the company for now three years you've
seen this kind of take off because it
seemed like from from my perspective
from a consumer perspective it was like
the hot new thing on everybody's desk
three to five years ago front page of
all of the you know you know maker
Kaunas eenz right and even like wired
and stuff yeah where where are we now
versus where we were three years ago
um I mean 3d printing as an industry has
continued to grow rapidly the market has
changed a lot it was it was definitely
the hyped thing in the media for a while
there was sort of this everybody's it
excuse me everybody's gonna have a 3d
printer of their home story being told
by the companies that were that were
basically driving the growth at that
point that was a bit of a stretch
3d printing is an extremely useful
technology and it's being utilized in
many many industries for just a
ridiculous number of different things we
have customers you know printing and use
products we have customers prototyping
we have customers doing jigs and
fixtures educational uses I mean just
you name it but there's still a learning
curve in terms of like learning CAD
software and you know for the most part
printers that people can afford print
thermoplastics so there's a limit in
terms of what those materials are
capable of hmm functional standpoint and
so a lot of that sort of it took the
wind out of the sails of that that whole
3d printer and everybody's home but
small businesses big businesses schools
research labs and stuff like that have
continued to adopt you know
that time it's just not yeah at the time
it seems like it was almost being sold
as like this is the next like PC
revolution where there's gonna be you
know a desktop on every you know
computer on every desk right the same
kind of fashion and and you've touched
on some of those stumbling blocks that
have prevented that from happening
mm-hm you know be it the materials or
the complexity of the CAD software and
things of that the the early printers
also they just didn't work very well I
mean there were there were a lot of
companies starting up where very they
they had a good idea maybe they had a
good design but they didn't know how to
run a manufacturing company or they
didn't know how to support their
customers or they didn't have enough
money to do those things so people would
buy a printer they'd get a couple good
prints out of it they'd run into an
issue and then they were kind of right
they're right I'm stranded I'm in that
camp as well and I've tried numerous
ones and it's not that I don't love the
technology I just don't have the time to
dedicate to fiddling or not that I don't
love fiddling right me wrong if I could
just you know spend the rest of my
fiddle there fiddling and hacking I'd be
a very happy person but you know
somebody needs to get stuff done so how
do you think like people have gotten
burned though I mean has the industry in
a slump because of that initial blip I
don't know that it's people have gotten
burned it's just that the the people
that 3d printers are for which would be
the people that you know that have an
idea and they know why they want a 3d
printer and they and they're making use
of them they've got the printers they're
running them every day they're having
good success and the people that we're
buying them because of the media saying
that they should buy one you know a lot
of them have said well that's not for me
there are also really inexpensive
printers out on the market now that
those people that are sort of on the
fence can can try out there are the the
easy-bake of and equivalents would you
say yeah I would say in terms of like in
terms of output too I mean you're not
gonna get like a like a really nice
chocolate cake out of an easy-bake oven
you're not gonna get like a really great
functional 3d print off of a 200 dollar
3d printer there you know I'm sure there
are people out there that would argue
that there it seems that the $200 3d
printer and a couple of years ago was
like it almost seemed like
within the makerspace at least that was
the goal it's like hey let's find ways
to like build a design that uses as few
components as possible it's almost like
there's like a finesse to it and we got
some great results that required like
it's it's kind of like the compression
of a novel versus a movie right you know
one can tell a lot more texture but it
requires that much more processing by
the human to like read the entire novel
rather than like sitting and watching a
movie which is a two hour affair sure
there you're done yeah I mean I I think
it's the it's a it's a reasonable
analogy but it doesn't still hold true
today because three years ago if it was
that I could get it $200 printer but it
meant that I would have to spend 10
hours building it and and tuning it
right to actually get some decent output
from it and just getting figuring out
the right amount of hairspray to use one
end or whatever yeah have you I mean it
depends on it depends on what people
want to do you know a lot of our
customers for example they're buying a
they're buying a lulzbot machine because
they want to make a particular product
or prototype or jigs and fixtures or you
know what have you and they need that
printer to run and they needed to run
when they wanted to run and and do so
reliably that's a totally different need
than somebody who's buying something
just sort of as a novelty and they're
saying well you know I'm I'm kind of
interested in 3d printing but I don't
really know what I'm gonna do with it
you know maybe I'll print some trinkets
for my kids or you know some Christmas
gifts or whatever you know if their
printer fails their business doesn't
fail with it and so that's kind of like
that's kind of become like a dividing
line in the desktop 3d printer market
there's the printers that are sort of
for for fun and then the printers that
are for work and so we we definitely
fall in the latter category not to say
that people don't do fun things with
their little spots describe to me what
would you say like the ideal user of
what if your 3d printers is like either
I mean in general like I said before
like a person that knows why they want
to why they want a 3d printer and what
they're gonna do with it
so maybe they've had other 3d printers
and then has
yeah and you know how to work CAD
software exactly yeah yeah so yeah a lot
of people that buy lulz bots have owned
other printers in them in the past like
a lot of them have you know for example
been been RepRap errs in the past and
they built their own RepRap out of out
of parts and it worked pretty well but
they're always tinkering with it and
that led them to a path where they're
like okay I've I've opened up this Etsy
store where I'm selling these designs
that I ade but I can't rely on this
thing to crank them out reliably yeah so
that's paid your dues tinkering right
now you're actually producing something
with it and it's on the line it needs to
function and unlikely yeah and then on
the flip side are people that buy the
you know the ready-made 3d printers that
are inexpensive and those you know
particularly if they're not open-source
Hardware once they break you know you
may be stuck with a with a paperweight
once it breaks okay so talk to me about
the that kind of audience that community
that is that the makers that use these
products because I know that there's a
lot of creativity in that maker
community but there's there's also a lot
of one-upsmanship there's a lot of like
ooh I see what you did there I can do it
better yeah how does that actually play
into the design of the Lowe's BOTS it
well because we're a totally open-source
hardware company we it plays really well
so we have some users that then
basically you know say well I don't like
the way you engineered this particular
component and so they they fix it but
the cool thing because we share
everything we do they tend to share
those fixes back so if you go like on
the the lulzbot comm forums you can find
post after posted people that have made
mods and tweaks to their machines and
then people will take those mods and
tweak them even more and they're
improving that you know they're
improving the hardware for how they want
it to work which they should be able to
do right because what generation are you
in it's hard to say because it's it's
almost like it's rolling right what
version of the lulzbot are you on now
well the so the Taz platform which is
like which is our flagship machine we're
on Taz 6 now which is actually I think
the seventh version because there was
like a
I think there was a 2.5 in there
somewhere I thought you were gonna say
because you started with zero knows we
all mostly should yeah no I mean yeah
but nobody nobody wants to buy the like
Taz zero the Weaver oh yeah you notice
it's always like the Nexus One and yeah
one like yeah so yeah I know we didn't
start at zero but yeah so we're on the
tab 6 now but it's not to say it like if
I bought at 6 now it would be the same
one but necessarily as the first pad 6
if there's yeah maybe they made opted
remake minor improvements along the way
but more or less you know we we saved
those big changes for when when we do a
full Rev so we might you know there
might be some community improvements
that we roll into the next full Rev but
like tests at s 6 is more or less at at
6 with the exception of changes that we
make to fix like if there's if there's
an actual problem for example like if
we're getting reports in the field that
you know some component is breaking or
something then we would fix that
midstream but otherwise we don't really
roll improvements in in the middle and
the the main reason for that is is
support right because you're actually
engineering a product for like
manufacturability and support ability
which are totally different concerns
yeah then making a one-off really good
design right right yeah yeah so so if a
customer calls in and they say hey I've
got it as six and this is what's
happening with it we have to be able to
say okay well we know exactly what
you've got and if it's got you know if
it's some if we have to keep track of a
bunch of my a real number right yeah it
would get you'd become a nightmare
pretty quick now you'd mention RepRap
that's the concept that the machine can
build itself and you guys actually do
that from what I understand you have
millions that are running 24 hours a day
making your own machines we do yeah so
RepRap was a project that came out of
the University of Bath England started
and let's see I want to say 2006-2007
our company started in 2011 with RepRap
as an inspiration so
from the very beginning we've been
printing components to build our own
printers currently we run 155 machines
both Taz sixes and minis 24/7 at our
Factory in Loveland Colorado so they
those machines just are churning out
parts all day long those parts are then
queue seed sorted and then they they go
down to the manufacturing floor where
they're used to build more printers so
Tazz sixes are building Tod sixes right
do you find that okay so speaking of
manufacturer ability though is is there
a reason behind that like is they do you
find that more cost-effective it's a the
the break-even point for injection
molding we're probably right about there
like we could probably say okay let's
get injection mold tooling made and stop
this
you know 3d printing all the parts
nonsense but there are two two reasons
we don't one I mean the the the cost is
sort of negligible at this point between
the two well it sounds like you've
scaled it if you have a 155 running 24/7
right right yeah but also it's it gives
us flexibility so like I said before if
we find out that there's an issue with
the part midstream we didn't fix it like
that yeah exactly yeah those tools are
expensive like most people don't think
about this yeah right even when we
design you know like like the the packet
squirrel or the land turtle or whatever
have you and you know like you know it's
like 20,000 40,000 dollars for this mold
that that can only make so many units
right
and there's a lot of upfront cost stuff
yeah and if we were to go and get all
the parts on at as you know get tooling
made for all those I mean I imagine we'd
be looking at you know 200 300 400
thousand dollars just for the tooling
right so you would know so you would
save a few cents but it would lock you
in - you're not being able to move as
quickly exactly I know at least when we
go to design something we use 3d
modeling 3d printing to make the
prototype but then we say okay cool well
now since we need to take this in mass
and that's why I asked because we talked
about hey where has the industry gone
from three years ago to now and it seems
like it really has gone to mass because
like you said like the if the goal
you know the mindset three to five years
ago was like hey let's make a $200 3d
printer that doesn't suck and wake take
12 hours to make yeah how is it now like
if I wanted to buy something that just
works off the shelf for a couple hundred
bucks is that available today yeah yeah
well what wait for how much I mean so I
think what I'm getting at is how do you
see this becoming a commodity mm-hmm you
know because we were talking about like
is is the PC era is the like initial PC
era of like oh you know machine on every
desk is that applicable here hey
I don't think so necessarily I mean in
terms of like buying machine that works
reliably yeah like part of the other
benefit of running the the cluster is
that it's sort of dogfooding to to the
extreme because we're using our machines
as a production process and so it's like
we learn a lot about how the machines
work and we can work the bugs out so if
we you know roll in innovation in and
test it in the cluster we can get
thousands of hours on that on that new
design before we ever even consider
making it a product mm-hmm
so the printer itself at this point is
extremely reliable most people can can
pull it as out of the box you know put
it to put it together there's like a
couple thumb screws you gotta break it
or just watch Shannon yeah yeah like
let's take our right it takes less than
an hour for a Taz for a mini it's like
20 minutes and you're printing and so
the the printers have like a
self-cleaning nozzle they're self
leveling so you don't have to monkey
around with leveling the bed they have a
PGI print service which is heated so you
don't have to put glues and tapes on the
bed so most of that stuff is we're a lot
of those are a lot of the like like oh
you got to know the you know the guy on
the forum that knows the tweak to make
the exactly work yeah so now let's take
it out put it on the table load your
logic add into cura lulzbot edition and
more-or-less hit print and the printer
takes care of the rest
it's well you say it takes care of read
those there's still are issues that can
come up though they see those being like
what would you say there's still like so
it sounds like a lot of stumbling blocks
you know self leveling the hidden bad
those things are taking care of
what are the next stumbling blocks that
need to be solved regardless of whether
there's a good solution today where do
you see this you know in three to five
years what needs to be solved to make
this really mass one thing is like
people that understand fused film and 3d
printing they generally know how to
position things on the print bed and how
to even how to design things so that
they'll print successfully you shouldn't
have to do that right long term you
should be able to be able to say I want
to print this shape that I concocted
send it to the printer and walk away and
know that the printer is going to make
that shape regardless of how you
position it on the bed or how you
designed it because in general with a
single nozzle 3d printer you're still
subject to gravity so as an object is
being built you know if nothing is
underneath it it's just gonna fall right
so we use a little smarter software that
knows that the teeth the teacup needs to
be upside down or up or whatever it is
or we need to solve the gravity issue so
as they're working on right Atmos yeah
yeah so so the or auto auto orientation
thing isn't isn't quite you know there's
got to be a little bit of human
involvement there like yeah right
print the teacup well you say that and I
look at like you know going from you
know Microsoft DOS in the 80s to an iPad
and the amount of like you know ways
that a user can mess it up right that's
true I mean it's constantly yeah from
yourself yeah I do think they're like
algorithms and a slicing software that
look at the model and say well let's see
there's an overhang here here and here
but if I print it this way it won't be a
problem I think that will come but the
other thing is is better support
material so one thing we're working on
right now as a dual extruder dedicated
for doing soluble support so you you've
got one nozzle that prints your objects
material and the other nozzle the prints
support that melts away in water so like
that opens up like a world of
possibilities and the designs you can
break yeah they're not like sitting
there you know cutting off right pieces
of plastic right and and one of the
designers that works for us he's he's
he's on the marketing team and he does
like
you know does sample models for
marketing purposes and things like that
and it's already changed his thinking so
now Dave's like instead of thinking like
well let's see I'm gonna have to split
this model in half and then glue it
together at the end otherwise it's not
gonna work where it's not gonna look
good now he's just like loaded and Kira
hit print and it you know it prints the
supports for him and dunk it in water
and it's and the underside looks as good
as the top side which is what you want
so what are those extruders what you
said the dual extruder is like what's
that actual hardware look like it's I
mean it looks just like a single
extruder except it's got two nozzles at
this point yeah so you've got you know
two two different motors that drive the
filament out and that's something that's
like an option when you're going to buy
a lulzbot or is it like an aftermarket
thing how does that work yeah we we have
a lot of different optional tool heads
for the for the printers so you buy the
printer it's got the stock single nozzle
tool head but we've got two heads for
printing flexibles and two heads for
printing we've got one one tool ID
called the Morse true der MOA arse true
der mm-hmm it's got a one point two
millimeter nozzle versus the point five
millimeter nozzle that we usually have
and so that thing can just hog out the
plastic so you can end up taking for
example like something that would have
taken 12 hours to print you can print
that in two hours just it's not
resolution yeah it's not gonna look
quite as good but if you're printing
like big structural things or jigs and
fixtures or we have a one of our one of
our favorite sponsored lulzbot users is
james Bruton x robots UK if you haven't
seen as you YouTube channel check it out
but he he recently broke a Guinness
World Record by printing I think I think
it was like a 16-foot tall self-portrait
of himself with a horse trader so he had
like I think two or three printers
running more orders and he printed this
gigantic statue that's and doing that on
a Taz or the standard extruder would
have taken him weeks and weeks and weeks
now we were talking a little bit before
the show about some of the popular you
know modifications that people make they
liked it you know it's an open platform
right so people just walk out components
as they see fit
you know III D is one of those popular
vendors that makes extruders and hot
ends yeah now help me to understand this
market and how open-source plays into it
be sure from what I understand they had
an open design but it was non-commercial
right right yeah so you 3d they've been
they've been around for a long time in
the RepRap industry which is not a long
time and in geologic terms but they they
make great hot ends they were the first
company making all-metal hotends which
enable printing higher temperature
materials and just better temperature
control and things like that and like
you said for a long time they were
open-source but their licensing was
non-commercial and so for us that was
problematic because like well we're
commercial entities so we can't then you
you know we can't share that file along
with all the other things that we share
which are under totally free licenses
and so we we couldn't work with them
basically this is what boil down to so
as a result our printers weren't were
arguably not as good as they could have
been mm-hm and a 3d wasn't getting all
that revenue from us buying a hot end
for every single printer we sold right
so it sounds like a match made in heaven
right so fortunately earlier this year
they they drop the NC clause and now
we're working together and developing
tool heads around there they're hot ends
and extruders I find that fascinating
how a company can scale completely open
source as you described it how has a
lift Sassari Alif objects scaled as an
open source company like you've been
with them for three years now yeah yeah
and you said that now it's over a
hundred employees yeah we yeah when I
started it was somewhere between 25 and
30 and now we're about a hundred and
thirty six people and we run the entire
company on free software and we share
everything that we do from CAD designs
to bills and materials to shop floor
layouts and production processes all
that stuff is shared freely
and it's basically I mean it's scaled
remarkably well one nice thing about
using all free software to run a company
is that you don't have to
you're not like buying more software
licenses as you add people throw so
that's helpful like all of our
workstations run I think they're all in
Debian stretch now and then we use a
free software ERP system ERP is an
enterprise resource management okay
and our enterprise resource planning got
it management does not begin with a P
sure sure but all of your project
management software basically everything
everything from the design side I know
the engineers using the cab kind of yeah
they use free to support people using
the customer relationship management
story yeah so yeah our R&amp;amp;D department
uses free CAD and kicad and blender our
creative team creative and marketing
instead of you know proprietary Suites
we're using like Inkscape and Scribus
and gimp and blender to do all of the
same things that other companies would
do with with proprietary Suites so it's
it's a challenge but the way we look at
it is that it would be it wouldn't be a
little two-faced to say on one hand we
expect our vendors to share everything
under free licenses and we share
everything under free licenses but we're
cool with like buying software that
doesn't respect user freedom mmm okay
and and it's also so that like if you
know say we're sharing CAD files for a
printer online right say it's like just
all the CAD components that CAD designs
for the task components that are that
are 3d printable and somebody wants to
modify one of those well if we design
that in a proprietary engineering
software in order for somebody to modify
it they have to have that proprietary
engineering software whereas if we
design in free CAD they can download it
they can download free CAD they can make
their modifications and it doesn't cost
them anything mm-hmm and it also doesn't
they're not making compromises in terms
of like sacrificing user freedom which
is like well
we're all about so so where do you have
to make compromises I know that you said
that you know a lot of the components
obviously are inherently open but you've
got things like stepper motors for
instance
yeah separate motors yeah certain
components of the printer there's we do
have to make compromises on on some of
that stuff it's like some of those
things are more or less commoditized
though stepper motors being one of them
I got you know a stepper motor from one
company is more or less the same as a
stepper motor from another company
excepting maybe quality so we look for
the best components we can find in those
situations but were you know yeah those
are those are situations where we really
don't have a choice yeah it's always
tricky when you you know you try to do
like the full open thing is it right now
it oh it seems like you know it's really
awesome that you're doing this because
I'm always curious like how companies
can can make it on selling free make it
up in volume ha but it's it's a
beautiful thing to see like people
actually testing this concept and then
you realize the stumbling blocks where
you don't actually have any other
choices like I'm sure everybody in the
company has a cell phone
mm-hmm we do yeah we use we run Nexus
phones and they're running Omni wrong
and then f-droid for the app stores
that's also our company phones are that
is really cool are totally theirs as
free as we can get him yeah that's
that's the beautiful takeaway there is
as free as you can get him because as
free as we can get it today is different
than rates we can get it tomorrow we
have issues where you know certain
things are inherently lockdown because
of the industry right and because of the
nature of like how those industries have
come to flourish or go to chip industry
for instance yeah so even though your
phone is running open-source software
right it is awesome it still got a
Qualcomm baseband and it or a Samsung
baseband right which is a little black
box and that's yeah and I mean so our
our bet and our hope is that by growing
the company you know by staying
committed to you know to our philosophy
when it comes to like free Libre open
innovation that it will influence others
and we are seeing that happen
you know like III D is a good example
and they've obviously imprinted so like
a decision where it's like okay they've
made all of the risks and stuff and
they've said and actually this is the
best course of action for us right right
so who are your mentors then well
Richard Stallman is definitely a big
influencer so we we pay a lot of
attention to the free software
foundation in terms of sort of basing a
lot of what we do on what would Richard
Stallman think and that you know that so
that that restricts a lot of what we do
right out of the gate and and we
actually have respects your freedom
certification on our 3d printers which
they're very few hardware products and
no other printers have respects your
freedoms our vocation and then you know
there are other companies doing things
doing things the right way
in our opinion like red hat is a really
good example of like a major major
software company that is completely
dedicated to free development so I mean
they they've got like the Red Hat patent
promise for example so they've they have
patents that they've acquired by buying
other companies I'm pretty sure they've
filed for some of themselves but they've
committed to those being purely
defensive so and they've you know
they've made it they've got a public
statement about that we will not go
after any companies they infringe on
these patents provided that they are
also sharing their work freely which is
perfect I mean it's like sometimes
you've got to figure out a way to work
within the system that isn't necessarily
designed to support that kind of
collaboration yeah it's it's a
interesting social experiment in
addition to you know it's a an economics
experiment in social experiment its
software experiment that I mean I've
seen it flourish in so many different
ways and you just wonder like okay well
where are we gonna get to that like Star
Trek world where mmm-hmm you know we
have the replicators that just make the
things and you don't have to worry about
famine or working or any of that
everybody just does stuff there's a
lounge is around
well no they don't go explore the
universe there we go because they want
to you know yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah
the right thing to do right that just
drive and that's yeah I mean right thing
to do is definitely like that's the way
we look at the way we do business it's
like it's the right thing to do but it's
also the smart thing to do because we're
you know we're saving money up front on
a lot of things like software licenses
but we're also you know we built a an
incredible community like our anytime on
you know on reddit or in various other
places online when people ask questions
about well which printer should I get
you know I want the most reliable
printer I could you know I can find and
there's always like a line of lulzbot
fans at chiman get a test six I have one
and I love it mm-hmm you know and that's
like you can't you can't buy that kind
of loyalty but by basically by giving
back you know I think we've earned it so
that's you know it's pretty awesome cool
well you know we we seldom and I say
seldom I mean outside of doing like
coverage of consumer electronics at CES
or something we we never have vendors
mm-hmm as it were on hack five it's not
really part of our ethos yeah but it was
I'm very happy to have you guys on here
and I've you know I trust Dave
implicitly when it comes to stuff so
when david says hey this is the printer
and he's you know dee Randolph he's that
guy on reddit as well that you see yes
like oh that's a thing yeah so I'm just
like you know by the powers of you know
the powers of intrinsic things I will
also say I'm stoked to I want to play
with one of those cool yeah because I've
also done they like you know futz for 20
hours get something to print once and
then never print anything again because
it broke again yeah I mean I yeah a lot
of people that work for a life objects
were RepRap errs back in the day and
it's myself included and it's it's funny
to think about what 3d printing stuff
was then versus
what it is now cuz then it was it was a
lot of like you know like futzing around
with things and you know trying trying
trying again trying again trying again
on oh it's working this time and you
know right right almost seemed like it
was like hey you know the it was like
was showing up with a pdp-11 or
something and getting it to you know
play some music or something and now
here we are where it's like oh there are
personal computers yeah
so we're do use it do you think that's a
decent analogy or do you see like where
do you think along if that were the
analogy where along that path do you
think it would be to the point where we
get to the modern day here's an iPad it
thinks for you and you can't break it
I mean 3d printers are weird because
they they sort of toe the line between
tool and electronics you know a computer
peripheral right so like as an analogy
to personal computers I think it's it's
tough because they're well like
computers can be used to make things as
him sitting behind the editing board and
right making stuff the computers can be
used to like just play video games
mm-hmm right yeah whereas yeah 3d
printers I mean they can be fun but
you've always got to bring like you have
to bring your creativity to the 3d
printer to get anything out of it you
know there's there there there are of
course online repositories and models
you can download but there there comes a
limit where you can only print so many
you know Yoda heads and twisty bases and
you know things like that before you're
like okay well that was that was
interesting but now what so you're
saying the onus is on the user and in
that it's beautiful to see that we're
now living in a day and age where these
are actually in middle schools and
headsman's across the country yeah yeah
totally I like I have a nine-year-old
and his concept of where stuff comes
from it's gonna be totally different
than what my concept of where stuff
comes from was because you know I like
stuff comes from the store if I want a
thing I go to the store and I buy it
like for for him it's like well stuff
comes from the printer if I want a thing
I go to the computer and I model it and
I print it yeah like so ream it up right
yeah the stuff comes from
here mm-hm and then you just have to
realize it right you just have to like
tell the machine to make it and so 3d
printing fits in with a bunch of other
tools to write like CNC machining and
laser cutting and all those different
tools that are in all that are in maker
spaces you know pick-and-place machines
and like just like the ability for the
next generation to basically realize
their creativity is just on a whole
other level and I and I don't think
we're gonna really see that like that's
not playing out yet mm-hmm it's starting
to you know what do you think it's gonna
take to see that it's just I think yeah
I think it's just the kids have to grow
up you know the the kids that are using
all this technology in schools just they
just have to grow up in the world is
gonna change
that's exciting just to know that our
future is gonna be bright and beautiful
because kids are growing up with a
printer today you know I'm I'm such a
rose-colored glasses kind of guy I am
too I feel that I feel that you know you
can't buy into the don't be nice air
well yeah yeah I was I mean there's a
little sarcasm there I mean I there's a
lot of bad stuff going on in the world
right now so we've got to deal with that
too yeah but let's think about it the
wonderful things that are happening
because kids are printing 3d Yoda's that
this is true yeah I mean like yeah my my
kids pointed like a little robot the
other day yeah and he was like he was so
proud of it and you know he's has it
sitting next to his bedside table and he
just thinks it's the coolest thing in
the world and it means so much more to
him this this little robot because it
came from his imagination right it's
kind of like the lego you know or it's
like okay well here's some bricks but
it's not a thing until I put it together
and then you've been it's you have that
attachment because it's your labor that
went into building it yeah and so that's
your you know stuff like obviously we've
all got tons of stuff let me go to the
store when we buy stuff and it's cheap
and it was made somewhere else by
somebody we've never met and it doesn't
mean anything to us right and so when it
breaks it goes in the garbage but if you
made that thing and it breaks you know
you're like cool but I like that that
was my thing I made that you know so
there's like I I think ultimately you
know we're heading towards a place where
stuff is made more locally and
mean stuff it means something to us and
so we we fix it you know we modify it we
change it so this has much bigger impact
than just like hey making 3d printing
accessible you're talking about just
like changing the the whole mindset of
society in terms of like where things
come from yeah and our attachment with
things and changing the whole concept of
consumerism right it's ravu nourish it I
mean the whole like some of the tenets
of the RepRap movement was
democratization of manufacturing that
was the the tenets of podcasting when it
first started five it was the same kind
of contract that was born out of that
mm-hmm
yeah and in it I mean it's it's headed
there I mean we have customers that are
buying 3d printers and starting
businesses around them and the cool
thing is when you buy one printer you've
got the capability to make X number of
objects a day you can double that output
by buying another printer or happen for
3d printing another printer or it's 3d
printing enough man that's exciting cool
well if people don't want a 3d print a
printer and just want to get a printer
to 3d print printers we didn't get they
can get printers well lulzbot com
yeah just just head to walls Broadcom
and you can learn all about learn all
about our company and what we do that's
