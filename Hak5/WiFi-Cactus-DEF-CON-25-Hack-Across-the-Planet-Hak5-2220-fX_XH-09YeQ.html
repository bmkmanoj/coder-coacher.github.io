it's hack across the planet one of the
last days of this trip and I'm I'm so
tired
oh no no were you not plannin happy on
its no she asked me she knew my fire for
this is my life this is snubbed she
hosts high five of that wire and texting
and she kills it a hack tip another boys
report by the way go check out some
through port I've been gone a lot my my
voice is no lock on me because we even
do an interview about Molly so it's the
last day of that problem we're going to
do something really cool beginning
August 2nd correct well I heard about
that I heard that I'm in studio shows
are coming back we are going to do
regular episodes of hack 5 the your
weekly dose of Technol us tonight not
just Darren's vlog day she shoots with
its own now not the shaky blog are you
tired of doing the cheeky vlog what you
don't i but i love the shaky log I feel
like the shaky pocket perfect it is if
you need a simple like my Google at home
I'm going to get schooled in I'm going
back to the studio you know why cuz I'm
going back to Cali to Cali we're going
back to Cali
maybe Kali Linux Cheers
Oh enjoy some impromptu stuffy stuff
that I ran into at the def cons snubs
parts rainbows
I'm about to record a segment oh no no
worries I just have your consent if
you're in the background cool I have his
consent he's in the background okay is
DEFCON 25 and what's better than 25
Wi-Fi pineapples 26 left eye pineapples
and here to prove that it's dark matter
what's up man dude this is insane
tell me about the lifelike actus because
you look like something out of like like
Edward Scissorhands meets Neuromancer
like what's going on here yeah well I've
been getting the Ghostbusters thing too
I got the proton pack on about
collecting instead of the freaking
ectoplasm I'm getting all the all the
Wi-Fi so 25 pineapples tetras and we've
got 50 channels of monitoring all at the
same time out of the 81 bands capturing
all the things it's crazy how are you
dumping all of the packets from all of
the pineapples where are you dumping
them to to an Intel nook so using kids
meant pushing the data over the ethernet
raw drive in it directly to a single
session kismet eating raw pcap I'm also
looking for threats and different things
that are going on so capturing all the
things so how does hizmet save because
the you're not saving to the local disc
on the on the pineapple right you're
saving so like an ass or something what
you got in there so and then tell milk
it's 250 gig solid-state nvme 16 gigs
around that fast enough
oh so yesterday in a demo lab we had
14,000 clients connected at once who
rushed it where we were not connected
sorry Melissa okay okay or not but no I
wanted money I've been acting being them
around me sorry
yeah little flaw I did it up we've got a
future I love this t-shirt says
communicating near me is contempt a
monitoring constitutes consent for
monitoring fantastic yeah I mean would
you say channel hopping is horses oh
absolutely
okay we have to sift all this all the
things every channel yeah
fragmented packaged sucks there's no
reason to have them when you got
something like this you've been getting
some Bush - I'm assuming oh yeah for
sure
like everybody's looking around is like
what is this thing people been stopping
me over the place yeah it's been instant
I always feel bad for all the normies
that happen to be like in
in Vegas at the wrong hotel at the wrong
time when other hackers are here and
it's like so much collateral damage
right yeah and you're like you know
walking through casino floors with this
bag what what kind of crazy comments to
gotten so totally like I was walking
through the Luxor casino and just going
over to Mandalay Bay and some guys just
like looking at me shaking his head
probably broke his neck in the process
so craziness like just everybody
stopping me wants to know what thank
this thing is been insane this is what
is it what are you calling it hashtag
Wi-Fi cactus packs that hashtag y5 check
check it out on Twitter Cheers
because then I can like sneak up on him
and be like oh my god Oh in person in
real life and all along are you doing
yeah we got to get our Awkward hug yes
have you ever have you ever done a blog
pocket no oh I think it's gonna happen
oh are you are you ready for this I'm
ready for okay cuz I am I gotta make you

great
it's a right Pokemon you know you gotta
catch them all you really do yeah it
would go how's it going it's good it's
good I mean your travels and adventures
throughout the world it was a whirlwind
hack across the planet is like coming to
the United States I don't know that part
of the planet is where the planet NOW
any work I literally got in like a week
ago and then it was just like DEFCON and
now we're here and I'm like and then on
top of that I'm moving oh okay so you
know good stuff yeah I can see what
what's right I have it there's so many
crowds around this boot if I lose it
opens I had to sneak in early just to
say hello and get in here but yeah it's
been great I'm just doing the same old
same old just breaking in things picking
out people my talk that I'm doing today
actually I was advised by the Secret
Service that had to censor parts of it
what Secret Service had any problems in
exact because I turns out that you're
not allowed to post Donald Trump social
security number in a slide deck
who knew how long with his birth date
address fresh emails phone numbers and
cause he knows but I mean if you were
able to find it it was on paste bin then
it's out the oh oh PII
okay so as we told people to Google
Donald Trump paste then social security
number yes then they then that would
just be like well no I didn't I didn't
know I did censor the things with a
toilet icon it's like because I'm going
to investigate it anyway let's say right
I mean we all are we're on
exactly and but the pay's I didn't
censor the pace Mission Creek so you can
they didn't say anything about that
oh really you sent a slide deck for
approval no hey check no when I saw what
was going on someone told me I need to
talk to someone so I talked to someone
her death on a Fed if you want to get
insurance are we still doing that I
think yeah okay just like like five
years ago I got the I spotted the feds
here oh they're still doing ice water
the Fed nice now so hard cuz like what
do you gotta defend so students right
arrow a rich environment now it's like
everybody's like a so we um Northern
Virginia nice crew-cut exact aligned
shirt and cargo shorts check the shoes
the shoes always give it away or exactly
yeah overt well we love our shiny shoe
friend you know I mean don't get me
wrong these guys are the best and they
do God's work yes they do
it's like so does the transmission but
hey whatever okay cool well this is
about to open up yes but what's when's
the next book it's working out toward
the end of the year the conclusion to
the trilogy dissecting the hack and I'm
going to announce it here first
for you oh it died in hacks the
interdite network and after see nice
because we're forbidden verboden enter
died all forbidden in different
languages
I heard you did there
okay so where can people find a book on
Amazon look under dissecting the hack
and then there's the two books right
there okay see you've got time to catch
up before the third one definitely hi
man so get some of your brother in Psych
here man
here she is
oh my gosh it is so good to finally be
back in the United States on this hack
across the planet or Canada I've been
working my way over to Alderaan I don't
know if you know that some on a
diplomatic mission
yeah I've been checking my star charts
though craziest thing you wouldn't
believe this I'm not fighting over on I
got to tell you something about Alderaan
you might not appreciate it too much the
rumors girls anymore the rumors are true
yeah yeah Bartman you might have to end
up making San Francisco your full-time
last boss and I'm really sorry to tell
you that but it's hard work you gotta
come back this is heartbreaking cuz I
was I heard they had great beaches the
greatest Beach greater on Alpha hot Bali
is nice I hear you can get a very quick
suntan mmm a massage massage it is
you're right actually
very quick contact very very quick I'm
glad you got that I've had four beers
yes court if you're the person at the
hackathon that brings us giggling I mean
actually if your hack 510 we love you if
you're the hacks left hand that brings
the skiing wings at the hacker con Hey
look what else you run into before the
Horde it scared for Macker warehouse
how's it going next
that's good I'm impromptu vlogging I've
got your permission yes rad what con did
you go through last night we pecan but
really because we were just raging till
4:00 in the morning con all of us not
every single one of us I heard a 5 hour
30 carbine was pretty good I guess did
we all want to die but we're raging -
wait he went
yeah we're are oh yeah no no no no no
sub is still said has the extra German
bones to make him gyrate like a like a
crazy rave boy it's true it's true most
people don't know this the Germans have
extra bones that allow them to gyrate
their yeah I select that fact fact what
are you going to tonight they don't one
okay Aida one party is the place to go
because that's where dual core shows up
and does all of his freestyle which you
can say I did not know about that yeah
yeah okay so Cheers and then and then
suddenly a Johnny long appears yeah for
sure
Oh what do you man oh man so much is
going on back in the u.s. you know your
back yeah yeah living in the year how
long will you be gone though we were in
Uganda for seven years
believe that I can believe that I was
only in South Africa for two weeks and
dude I mean I mean right it is it is yes
yeah so all of our projects in Uganda
are still running like we still have the
training centre in the hackerspace there
we have a leather project - still
running so everything's going to engrave
all funded by the hacker community it's
awesome it's a success but it's time to
do stuff in the u.s. now so I just want
to get involved in get people involved
in projects like locally in their own
communities oh my god we want to go an
idea so much easier - so we don't want
to push projects to people we just want
people to come to us and say I have this
great idea I don't quite know how to
make it work and then we want to
facilitate that you know get the word
out provide resources things like that
so the hub-and-spoke model empirically
it was really well because you know what
everybody knows everybody knows that
this man hacks charities that's
absolutely still getting stopped in
elevators and hospitals or that yes they
doesn't bother us anymore like I look at
a surfer like oh it's okay yeah sweet
but great to see you and like I've got a
whole bunch of goodies for you for you
doing the auction absolutely awesome and
we should come by and take a look at
that thanks so much
oh I'm here to be your voice oh I'll get
it to you all right keep up the great
work man cool love you everybody go and
check out our charities good thanks
there's the other fun mainstay of Def
Con it's the epic schwag because people
come by the booth and this isn't just
people do
Dorian what's going on the road haha why
don't you kill me this is I love this I
love this I don't know how we came up
with that we just we drink a lot and
then come up with slogans for our
t-shirts so this is really one of the
reasons why we drink because you don't
change your default passwords and then
then there's the special bottle for the
wanna cry yes yeah yes like the bottom
just drawer in the yeah and lock drawer
yeah this is for special occasions
nobody nobody would ever leave SMB open
on the internet no idea it was me I was
talking with someone and they were like
well as all these new and advanced
attacks coming out of Def Con a black
hat and I'm like yeah most people get on
because they have Active Directory hey
like the basic fundamental foundation
for why your own is just the simple fact
that that's what you have not how have
you secured it or configured you have it
in there for you as a joke on an episode
of hack 5 in 2005 you should know
because you've also been podcasting
doubled on what 12 years ago did you
we're 12 years old in like two weeks
we're vintage Wachovia's vintage
obviously a debate with aged well
and so I made the joke like it was just
like a little interstitial I was like
how can you tell if your machine is
owned is there a little flag in the
bottom left corner yes and you are
infected and that still holds true today
yeah it's actually one of the the two
biggest issues that I think that we're
dressing on the show least I'm trying to
address is the Active Directory issue
and the password issue because most
people forget those two very people
putting them actually you know why I
ever ran ad other than because I sort of
have to do as I had to because F LDAP I
don't want to I want to get involved in
that any more than I want to get
involved in Samba context yeah your
alternatives were Novell the way just
that you know
well yes Novell Mike McCready spoon
yeah my sympathies to anybody that has
had to Novell just says my sympathies to
everybody who is NT Ford cars that's
when I started and then decided I wanted
to be a Linux and UNIX admin was my
experience with in supernova JIT that
was a very oh yeah yeah oh this is
pretty terrible I don't like and then my
friend taught me Linux and I was like I
like this yeah this is good and then
that's that's how I start get started
security pretty much you ladies and
gentlemen Linux is good use it yeah you
can find out more about that over at
security weekly calm there you go
face there hey thank you it's got a
great idea
bring it to the web the way we do and
head over to domain calm we've got a
slick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process so your site will
be online in no time and the domain.com
guys have been supporting hack five
years and they want to celebrate with a
massive promo code who's a JK jumbo with
35 percent off new domain registration
Mouse through November 30th it's a
limited time offer so when you think
domain names think domain.com Eric looks
like it's not my normal color are there
wait what I'm gonna go what I gotta go
three my kitty supposed to be calm I am
you've been lying to me all these years
