by Jackthreads
it's time once again to check port 110
yes it is gonna pop on okay so David
asks I know there are some pretty bad
routers out there but if you're just
going to be streaming and browsing
mostly is an x86 router really worth the
money if so what would be some of the
benefits well you don't honestly I
haven't seen a good plastic router at
all some of the benefits are quite
obvious I mean your recycling an old
machine that may not be doing something
else and you know no matter if you go
with pfsense or mono wall or smooth wall
or forget the name of the other one that
we tried out couple seasons go up there
are so many there's so many good
distributions for doing a hell even if
you just turned it into a boon to box
with a little iptables lovin it's going
to be so much faster just let orders of
magnitude I don't know how many times
I've had to like reset a linksys router
or something because some torrenting
cause too many connections and then what
you do that too at home don't you
Torrance no I'm saying like don't you
you have a linksys router home right no
we don't we have a netgear but but yeah
you're like same resetting it all the
time right well we haven't had to
recently but yeah I've done in the past
yeah yeah what's nice is like the uptime
of the router here in the studio is
pretty much since we jumped in you know
it's the same way unless somebody screws
it up it's awesome anyway I mean that's
really it it's just anecdotal evidence
that it's awesome I don't have any
benchmarks to back it up I just know
that I'm never going back nice okay well
steve says this kind of goes along with
the last question he says hi chaps I
don't know hello you can say chaps here
you can see me you can say all that
stuff I don't know well anyway enjoy
watching the show and every time I get
the opportunity although shamefully I
have not seen all of your shows i was
wondering with all the cool gadgets and
builds that you have produced and shown
if you have considered your green
credentials reusing an old kit is great
and of course very green so any ideas on
how we can build bespoke systems using
fairly low power consumption or reduce
fan noise
exhaust yeah I'm a big fan of like we
showed last week the DC to DC power
supplies I used those with you know for
low-power computers like like the
computer that's running this IRC wall
here or some of the webcams or even our
router or I always like to go with the
low power stuff and of course even the
stuff that's quote on display part of
the set that actually runs proxmox
pretty well and things like are the
recent build with that full ATX guy yeah
actually do I have it around here no I
do not the Hello Kitty backpack that's
getting recycled into another mod coming
soon that's going to be even more wicked
yeah and a put inside of a fire truck
and make it shoot flames and packets
yeah recycling recycling it is giving
them away to your parents or something
for them to do a build or have to
install linux and then set it up with
some remote assistance yes exactly a
very important you go make you some art
called making some art like some photo
frame case mods you even though they
don't work or or I can make yourself a
triceratops out of old circuit homes yes
I saw that picture too was so cool
technos photo the way it was it was a
habit i go to the week here real soon
but we got one more one more email to
get to Dennis thank you for your email
he says know anything that is free or
open source that will migrate all
programs and files from one pc to
another something similar to PCmover no
do not know the answer to that i do not
know a program that will do that you
know a programmer they'll do it email us
so that we can let him know but honestly
the reason why i don't is because I've
never looked because I kind of use like
a different methodology since I mean
remember I was just showing you that
netbook that I'm on the other I'm
temporarily on an epc I've got that big
15 inch Windows machine I've got now the
the other acer I've got my desktop back
home I've got another mini machine we've
got like I don't know how many machines
I've used in the last while and I got so
tired of trying to keep track of things
and move stuff from here to there but I
just went to the cloud and you know I've
got my own a quickie i I just I sync
with ftp I really should be using our
sink if they are single would be like a
really good
segment for us to be doing but know that
in spider Rock you turned me on to
spider of the spider oh oh oh my god and
thank you for the referral people that
have signed up yeah yeah thing with you
get two free gigs every time like one
for Greg every time somebody signs up
using your early so um gigs gigs are
good I sent out my mind via Twitter and
got some referrals so thank you for
signing up yeah pretty much and what I
used to do when I'd like move from like
when it was just on Windows what I do
from when they move from machine to
machine to machine of course yeah I
would you know partition the drive or
use a separate right that's sorted I'll
just doing like a partition thing where
you like twenty percent of the drive
goes to the operation to your documents
and then like because it's windows si
how did it right very first one yeah so
every six months want to go to redo it
you know at least I wouldn't mess with
my D Drive yeah many went to like
separate hard drive I've tried the thumb
drive thing honestly I like just having
everything synced whether it's Dropbox
or fire over your own nephew yeah it's
so much easier and then you don't have
to worry about losing something it's
just up there yep get a lot of my docs
on a VPS over at domain.com better pay
board lean on that I'm just saying it's
really nice to be able to have things in
one place yes so that's my solution is
to not have to try to move things by
have it either all in sync we're all in
one place oh yeah yeah and if you guys
have suggestions for other cool program
so we could use to I don't know make our
sink really easy to use or stuff like
that that would be fantastic so hit us
