code execution problem that Jack potting
thing yeah it's officially happened in
the United States and is auto scoid just
for noobs all that coming up now on
threat wires greetings I am Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
February 6 2018 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is always the best way to support the
show and will help us reach our next
goal as well and now on to the news so
the first story is all about Adobe Flash
now while Adobe Flash usage has been
declining browsers now block it Adobe
themselves stated that they would remove
support completely by the end of 2020
that does not keep users from still
keeping Flash installed nor does it keep
attackers from exploiting it so last
week South Korea assert which is the
computer emergency response team found a
flash zero-day which they called CVE
2018 for eight seven eight which adobe
is planning to patch in an update this
week the exploit exists in Adobe Flash
Player twenty eight point zero point
zero point one three seven in earlier
versions as well and it could
potentially allow an attacker to take
control of a computer via remote code
execution on platforms including Windows
Mac Linux and even Chrome OS this
includes Adobe Flash Player desktop
runtime and Google Chrome edge in IE 11
now according to Cisco Talos an attacker
had already used this exploit in a
targeted attack by embedding a Flash SWF
object inside of a Microsoft Excel
document which the target victim would
open now once they open it the exploit
begins execution and downloads
additional payloads from a server the
download is a popular rat which is
called a remote access trojan that has
been widely used by hacking groups
Talos points to a hacker group called
group 1-2-3 that's very creative as the
culprits
now fireEye which is another security
company points to a North Korean group
called temp Reaper as the culprits the
true attribution has yet to be
determined now Adobe recommends admins
implement protected view for office and
also mentions that Flash Player 27 adds
the ability to change the behavior of
the player another alternative is to
simply disable or remove flash if you
are not using it on January 30th a
security enthusiast on twitter with the
handle vector SEC released open source
code for a tool called Auto sploit now
from the Twitter post the tool is
written in Python and uses the targeting
of Shonen plus the easy-to-use
Metasploit modules to create a very
simple to use remote code execution his
code is available via github now by
automating the process the tool requires
little efficiency from the attacker
themselves the script that he wrote uses
CLI and text to grab data from the
shodhan database and the api and if you
don't know shodhan is a search engine
for open Internet connected Internet of
Things devices most notably like cameras
after finding open and accessible
devices Auto sploit runs a command to
start Metasploit and if you are
unfamiliar with Metasploit check out
Metasploit minute on the hack 5 channel
or hack 5 org now if an attacker does
not want to choose one specific module
out of Metasploit they can also choose
to direct all available modules at the
device that they are attacking all at
once if the device is in fact vulnerable
they will have access via the remote
code execution now honest boy does have
its limits though according to Ars
Technica choosing your target is
extremely limited functionality the
attacker would still need to understand
what database is required to run
Metasploit as well vector SEC also
recommends a VPS since running a
connection back to your computer might
not necessarily be a good idea honest
plate has received some backlash with
words like script Kitty being thrown
about because of its very low barrier to
entry some security researchers do not
believe that it has any legitimate usage
though other security researchers
disagree with this belief I am a
believer that education in theory behind
any tool is a requirement for fully
understanding how you can implement its
usage in the real world not just in a
classroom or on
tests many InfoSec tools over the years
including Metasploit showed in Wireshark
and map melty go even the Wi-Fi
pineapple have also received this kind
of backlash but they go on to become
major parts of penetration tester
toolkits and some like our very own
Wi-Fi pineapple become notable tools for
forensics and even get listed in the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology yes that is a thing now
arguably these tools also lower the
barrier of entry associated with costs
of working with pen testers because they
save tons and tons of valuable time so
companies could be more likely to pay
for security compliance if the job can
be done faster so I think that the
script kiddie argument is only one side
of a coin of course I still advocate
learning the theory to truly understand
the value of the tool now there is a
link in the show notes if you want to
try the tool out for yourself last week
I had discussed a story about a TM Jack
potting where a thief uses hardware to
force an ATM to spew it all sorts of
cash until it is empty this has been
used worldwide but it had not hit the
United States
well according to Krebs on security this
has happened in the United States but it
was not widely reported in November 2017
three Venezuelan men were arrested on
drug charges after being pulled over
because a cop smelled pot it turns out
that they had wads of cash as well as
drugs and they were also seen in
surveillance videos messing with ATM
machines in Wyoming Colorado and Utah
the so they started with an ATM machine
in Parker Colorado in October in which
they used mobile phones and a small
computer keyboard to make an ATM spew
out twenty four thousand dollars they
later went on to hit ATMs in Utah
investigators found the Plautus team
malware on the ATMs hard drive it turns
out the FLOTUS d-- uses specific codes
to generate cash and these codes are
sent to a third party which is probably
the crime boss who then knows how much
cash is in the ATM he or she sends the
codes back via mobile phone to the
criminals at the ATM who then enter the
codes to withdrawal the cash now while
this is not a new attack as of November
it is new in the United States banks and
ATM owners should restrict access to
ATM machines update their software and
or the hardware wherever possible and be
on the lookout for random hardware
installed on the ATM thank you again to
all of the fine people who contribute to
patreon.com
every single week and we are on the way
to our next goal we're super close now
which allows me to upgrade some of our
equipment but we will also open up live
video QA just for patrons each and every
month if you are already a patron you
get access to an audio RSS feed first
looks at the show topics and discussions
and just for patrons and a lot more any
little bit helps us grow the show and
hey check out these super cool fur
babies as well sent in by our patrons I
love checking them out every single week
so thank you so much for sending those
in to me check out the perk levels as
well on patreon and thanks again for
keeping this show completely independent
and of course if you cannot donate you
can hit that subscribe button you can
share this episode on your favorite
social media page and let me know and I
might even retweet you and with that I'm
Shannon Morse and I will see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
