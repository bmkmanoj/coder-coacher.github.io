you by go to Asus welcome to hat tip the
show we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus a19 ninjas
I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm checking
out netcat for banner grabbing now
banner grabbing is a little bit more
complex than just chatting or
transferring files on netcat this is
something that you can find useful if
you need to do a penetration test or on
a specific port or you need to find out
what version or patch is running on a
server but well can't you use telnet for
that Shannon well yes actually you can
but alternatively netcat can be used
which will not alter the stream of data
unlike telnet so to do a banner grab
let's check out my Windows machine I'll
do all my examples over here on my Acer
Aspire s7 so this one we are going to
type in NC 10 dot 70 3.30 1.1 and then
port 8 1 so this is going to open up
netcat to our routers IP address on port
81 and next after this we will type in
press ENTER and then type in HTTP
forward slash 1.1 200 and then a couple
enters cool and you'll see down here
Apache 2 222 so it gives us not only a
little bit example of what it's running
but also which version of Apache is
running it won't respond to anything
until we give it a specific request
because Apache just works that way now
obviously this may change a little bit
for your own setup what kind of version
of what software you're running
everything changes it just a little bit
port 81 for me is an open port for this
network so I'm freely using it and this
is not a very stealthy approach so
anything you send out will be logged on
to the server that you're sending it to
now you will receive some basic
information about your server once it
has replied no matter what I can also
connect to our ssh server for this
example i would type in
nc 1073 dot 31.1 port to to to this is a
different port but it is the same
internal IP so you can see that it's
running SSH and it gives me version 5.8
cool now you can also do something like
you can ping Google you can do a banner
grab from Google for that it's very
simple as well you would type in NC
google.com port 80 and since this is
going out to Google we're going to get
HTTP slash 1.1 and it should give me a
whole slew of information from Google
there it goes so it doesn't look like
anything but gibberish to us but that's
basically Google's website now after the
break let's check out how to do a banner
grab for an actual real world setting
how does this work
working in IT means constantly jumping
from one program to the next each issue
needs to be solved fast and every minute
counts so don't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data

and we're back now let's talk about the
real world why would this be useful what
could I use this for as a systems admin
so here's a really simple example we
have several products running in our
office using SSH but I don't know which
ones have been updated I know that we
have an SSH server running on 10 73 31
one on one port we also have a Wi-Fi
pineapple running on dot nine on a
different port now what I can do to
check those servers and make sure that
they're all up to the most up-to-date
versions so I can type in NC 1070 3.31
dot 1 port 2 2 2 so this is the ssh
server running 5.8 i can also type in
for the Wi-Fi pineapple ten dot 7330 1.9
that's running on port 22 and that one's
burning 6.1 so I can obviously look
right there very quickly and say ok I
need to update my ssh server so that
it's the most up-to-date version and it
doesn't get hacked so if i look at both
of these versions it's very easy for me
to tell which one needs to be updated
and which one is currently up-to-date so
that's one very quick and easy way to do
a little bit of homework for your job
now do you use netcat send me a comment
below or email us tips at hack 5 org and
by the way here's a quick tip I found a
printable card with all sorts of netcat
commands and relays that's available
online for free I put the links down in
the show notes and be sure to check out
our sister show hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
