and a whole lot more this time on hack 5
this segment is brought to you by
domain.com hello and welcome to hack 5

anyway super excite so this is the first
one we're like you know we've got the
whole team out here I'm so excited I
went like last year with Colleen now you

mean I'll yeah yeah all right so he sent
some what are these zip a symptom and
some CDs he said inside you'll find a
few items the first is a floppy disk
size expander called Zip disk 100 from
Iowa Omega the second is something I
know nothing about but it's called doc
you'll and personal edition version 7.0
from Xerox and I'm sure you guys can
figure out what it does I'm really
curious to find out since you guys like
cats I'm also including an image of the
late shin Kok Shinnecock he lived to be
23 and I in world I one day decided to
get a picture of him listening to my
first ipod an iPod nano
keep up the great work and this is a
picture of his kitty cat well prompts to
the kitty I mean pretty cool cat the
kitty looks like he's not really
enjoying the iPod you know he is he's an
angry kitty yeah he's cute though happy
kitty it's kind of like my new kitty oh
I got a cat yeah I heard about this
what's up with that
her name is Starbuck and she's like 13
14 weeks now and she's a she's a bit of
a terrorizing little stinker but she's
adorable that's what you're trying to do
so trying to encroach on Kirby's meow of
the week I'm happy now we're like I mean
Starbuck is really cute so I got I gotta
admit I'm adorable you know she is
alright Darrin picked her up the chipper
bros and she started licking his nose
anyway well hey we got great stuff going
on this week I am showing off a really
nifty trick you can use to bypass some
windows restrictions get yourself a
little shell on computers that you
otherwise wouldn't be able to you're you
hate the mouse don't you uh yeah okay I
know that because I watched you do all
your crazy Keele this is all about alt
space X and then ctrl shift escape
whatever except well he loves keyboard
so I have a nice little launching
application for all your programs called
achi that I'll check out later okay and
then we got some awesome nibbles and
tips and viewer questions and great
stuff so stick around we're getting to
all that you need to go prep that yes
I'm about to get into this guy here I'm
taking these Smarties with me Smarties
rail they're delicious
hey wait wait explain to our Canadian
viewers though oh yeah
Smarties in america are america united
states okay here's our in America North
America if the United State Smarties are
not chocolate filled things they are
just little bite-sized candies that
taste like yet they're just sugar
they're sugarless
now for the technology on tenth I'll see
ya all right so you may have been in
that situation where I don't know you're
on a public computer you're at a library
University what have you maybe there's
just something broken and if only you
actually had I don't know access to the
command prompt you could probably fix it
yourself then wait around for an
administrator or something like that of
course we're not talking about anything
nefarious here but sometimes you'd like
to bypass some restrictions some of
those restrictions whether it's group
policies or many other ways that we've
talked about here on the show to kind of
just hide things like I don't know
access to the command prompt and we've
got a fun way to bypass that this week
this was sent in by operator and I
really love just kind of you know the
essence of what this hack is so I
figured let's just go ahead and and jump
into this because it's kind of a fun
neat little hack alright so say like
you're on this computer here and you
just don't have access to the command
prompt but you can get to mspaint
who doesn't love mspaint so many fond
memories of like windows 31 right
well it turns out if we just go ahead
and create a new image and we make this
image one pixel tall by six pixels wide
we can use some RGB values to make a
really neat file here so we're just
going to go ahead in Windows 7 and
change this size here under where is
that it's resize or its properties
all right so properties we're going to
make it six wide one tall we're going to
make sure its color we're choosing
pixels and okay and we've got a very
small file now so head over to view and
zoom in a whole bunch and back to home
and we're going to need to create some
custom colors here you're going to see
why in just a second here are the RGB
values so we want to click Edit colors
over here and these areas right here red
green and blue we're going to just go
ahead and change these to our own and
we're going to use for the first color
10 / red zero for green zero for blue
and we're just going to hit OK and there
we go we've got a color that looks
pretty much black we grab our pencil
tool here and we're zoomed in as far as
we possibly can and just click on the
first pixel our first left pixel is now
black now let's go ahead and fill in the
rest of the colors okay so this is you
know pretty easy we just go back over to
our edit colors and again this time we
want to enter in 13 10 and then 13 for
our RGB values of a dark purplish thing
do that one more time and this time
we're going to use 100 109 99 as our
lucky lotto numbers so that's 1 0 0 109
and 99 okay kind of a gray and then
again one more time we've got 121 and
146
kind of a brown there and then we have
zero zero 101 and our final color is
actually just zero zero zero or dead
black so there we go and pop that color
right there and we're just going to go
ahead and save this as bitmap file we're
going to call it command dot BMP and
make sure I choose my save type here as
a 24-bit bitmap all right
so save now we come over here to our
bitmap and hit f2 to rename the file
we're going to rename the extension here
from BMP to be 80 we're going to say yes
we want to do that and if we run this we
have a command prompt how cool is that
how did it work well turns out we're
actually telling it to run CMD inside of
CMD you see normally when you run a
command in this case a tree and B J if I
were to just type in BM j it would say
that's not it that's nothing if I say
command BM j well normally if you run a
command like say dir CMD dir whoops CMD
see dir it does that dir but then it
just disappears right well what we've
done here is we have a command prompt
that's going to stay and here's how it
all works I'm going to fire up my
favorite hex editor here H XD this is an
excellent tool you're going to want to
go ahead and grab this if you don't
already have it it's a freeware tool for
Windows and basically and yeah just go
ahead and grab this over from mah nexus
de so thank you everybody over there for
this we're going to go ahead and open up
this bitmap file here that we've renamed
to dot that and you can see there we
have is cmd.exe if we've actually done
that with the colors we'll do this again
so you can see in the example let's see
I'm going to
go ahead and create a new painting again
one by six zoom in all the way and if I
do those same colors this guy right here
this guy right here let's do half of it
and then that gray in the middle
and again save this as a 24-bit BMP
we're going to call it command two and
let's now open that in our editor you
can see we have CMD right here and as we
go ahead and add those colors we're
actually putting in the apex editor
we're entering in the equivalent of CMD
and when we rename it to a bat there we
go we get a command prompt you could
actually come in here with a hex editor
and do like say at the end of this we
want to do space a /k I don't know any
command you wanted I'm going to just do
pause right I'm going to save that now
come back over to our batch file and
there we go it runs CMD /k with the paws
command of course i could be any command
you want anyway i thought that was a
really nifty way to kind of bypass some
restrictions of course isn't going to
work on like everything but it's kind of
a cool tip to know in your arsenal maybe
write down those numbers and keep that
around for that special time in every
hackers life and we need to bypass a
little bit of restrictions anyway coming
up shin is going to be showing us how to
navigate windows like a pro a power user
if you will but first take a quick break
and check in not with Kirby now or
checking in for some cat 5 yeah it's
more cats if you want to build a video
site or if your website has a play
button I recommend getting a dot TV
domain you see a dot TV website lets you
showcase your original content and
create a unique site that's just another
YouTube channel just go over to
domain.com and search for the perfect
dot TV domain for your new idea then a
check out use coupon code make a 5 to
save an extra 15% and if you need
hosting for your new TV website don't
forget about domain coms web hosting
plans they start at less than 6 bucks a
month and have everything you need to
build maintain and promote your website
remember when you think domain names
think domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
