Linux laptop with a lab stock this
segment of hack 5 is brought to you by
domain.com hello welcome to hawk 5 my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us yes
it is and you know what last week I saw
you carrying around this cute little
laptop and I wanted to find out what
this thing is
cause it's adorable okay remember when
we went to CES in like 2009 and 70 was
showing off like some $1600 netbook that
no one was gonna buy yeah well turns out
no one bought it so now it's like 300 on
Amazon I would totally buy this thing I
could stick this in my purse masculine I
can carry it with me and it'll be a
little purse it will be my purse laptop
this is an air-gap machine used for -
you don't even ya know I can adjust yes
well that's the idea um I like air-gap
machines I have a small laptop too
inexpensive in fun I love cheap thrills
so lay it on me he would
so you remember Kali Linux right Kelly
Lewis yes exactly so when would that put
that back in fort it was 1408 so I did
this whole episode about a review of
Kali Linux which is basically a
pentesting Linux and it's a newer
version of backtrack as well this new
name of backtrack and it's based on
Debian II so this means that we can also
put it on a Raspberry Pi
that's so cool to see all of like the
the amount of architectures that Kali
has been ported to yeah you've got you
know builds for all these tiny little
arm devices which is fantastic because
we've kind of certain to live in an arm
world like yeah have you seen it on the
note 10 it's really cool oh it's insane
yeah yeah I want to try putting it on
the note 10 that would be really well
I'm glad that you've been able to take
and actually this is the what is this is
the Raspberry Pi
yep that's Raspberry Pi a little piece
given to me by the wireless village from
Def Con what's it a Sebastian and I can
talk there and that was like the coolest
gift and I'm glad that we were able to
put it to good use and it seems only apt
that would take the Wi-Fi items a day
um wireless village resident hi and turn
it into a Kali Linux box that's perfect
so my first thought on this was why
don't we try putting the Kali Linux on a
Raspberry Pi and then porting this on to
the Motorola Atrix lab doc so that we
can use it as a laptop alright thanks a
lot of sense cuz this is gonna a kind of
a headless device you just HDMI out and
USB you still need some like a monitor
and a mouse and a keyboard and since it
takes USB mouse and keyboard and the
monitor which is HDMI out I believe I
can plug it into the Motorola Atrix was
which is just a a trick slap doc and I
can run everything on Kali Linux on to
this monitor right here so I remember
when these laptop when these first came
out the idea with these was like oh you
you get this and then you know you plug
yourself yeah you've gotta get a special
cell phone but you've got the one
special cell phone for you plug that
into there and now like this is this is
like one of those things in server
environments where you find we like pull
out and there's a keyboard and a mouse
and a monitor that flips up exact it's
the same kind of idea it is except they
had some funky proprietary connectors
yeah since it was only for the Atrix we
ran into that issue where the Atrix got
discontinued and all this feel bad yeah
I'm sorry motorola but bit cool idea
maybe if there was like a universal
standard for it to work with all Android
phones and may have done better
yeah I agree that would be cool but
since we found a second device in a
second way to be able to use this now we
have quite a few of these maybe that we
could put in the hack shoppers okay so
we got a couple of them I mean the thing
is I love the idea of breathing new life
into old art air that it was not
expected to perform me to UM and now
that they like--they I forget what they
were like three hundred dollars of their
they're like oh yeah 80 bucks now
they're nothing it's so great so you
know they were way too expensive back in
the day so I have to running right here
so the first one we have running off of
its charger and then we have an MK 802
yes beautiful yeah so we just plug this
in via the HDMI out and then we have USB
right here for power and then we also
have this one for the mouse and
keyboard so this actually been done
before I've seen an article on like how
to do this but we took a totally
different take here didn't weigh yes we
did so with this one and it's a little
bit jittery because this is an older
device that I have but the Motorola
laptop you can see on here yeah
oh that's Android yeah I'm running
Android I have the mouse working so I
can play Angry Birds on here or whatever
I want you know get into the Google Play
Store simple simple easy easy and it
runs for like I think they tote eight
hours on the website for the Motorola
Atrix lap doc so I have to test it a
little bit more to show you how long you
can get out of the MK 802 in the
Raspberry Pi
well the internal battery on this guy is
basically running both of these either
of these devices either the MK de 2 or
the Raspberry Pi or whatever have you
just over USB and we've been running it
for like half the day so at least by
chance I can't imagine that it wouldn't
be somewhere near the claim like if
they're claiming eight hours maybe a six
but still it's pretty cool so another
interesting thing about this is since it
has this proprietary craziness going on
on the back of it you need a couple of
weird cables unfortunately you can't
really buy these cables anywhere so
either you can make them which oughta
fruit they made this entirely really
good tutorial online and we have a link
to that one in the show notes or we also
created these ones ok I must say like
this was one of those things that is
born out of necessity like any geek
where I was talking to Jason I'm like
dude how cool would it be if we could
you know like make this a little sexier
because it was like six cables and
adapters before and we've been able to
do this with three and he's like there's
it's that would be stupid to make one
set so he's like well how about I make
you a hundred and I'm like so these are
the most expensive cables ever if we
don't get rid of 99 of them so let's
hopefully do that later yeah yes but
otherwise yeah a pretty cool basic idea
even if you know you don't get the sexy
ones just with uh you know it's like
it's like when you just go to RadioShack
and be like I guess it's to go to that
they're like well we don't have with
this to that but if you go to this and
this nutnut mm-hmm oh yeah yeah yes
RadioShack yeah yeah
so we got these cables working and then
we plugged it into the Raspberry Pi and
the first thing we needed to do was
actually install Kali Linux onto a
little SD card now the thing about this
is you really want to get one of those
class ten eight gig SD cards or or
larger than that so that it installs
correctly and it's nice and fast on the
lap dock once you start using it so to
install it you want to use DF tech H to
check what basically which SD it is
because you don't want to erase your
entire hard drive because that's no fun
right because in Linux plan unlike
Windows you don't get like a drive
letter C D E whatever yes if you get um
you know is show up as a device and /dev
yeah a lot of times like SD SD a is not
the one you want to form and so it's
gonna differ depending on how many hard
drives you have in your system or
whatever have you excite always found DF
Tech H to be the most convenient because
it you can see the name of your SD card
so for example minds was canon because
we use it for our Canon cameras there
you go so I automatically knew SD B is
the one that I needed so after that you
use D D another command in the terminal
to actually port your image onto the SD
card and you know make it a nice little
you just grab this image off of Oh golly
yeah yeah yeah so it's um D D D space if
equals Kelly whatever the image is
called and then of equals /dev /s DB for
me and then BS equals 512 K ifs info
file and Oh F is output file exactly
yeah in Linux is a fireman outfit slash
dev slash s DB is treated as if it were
a file even though it's actually a SD
card yeah that's so cool I love it's re
esoteric geekiness on that this is the
stuff we do hack tips this is not Linux
terminal one right this is the stuff
though that takes forever I love DD you
can really an F up a system with DD if
you do it wrong but I love DD it does
take a lot and apparently I didn't know
this but you let me know that DD
actually does bit for bit copy so
there's no reason to format it
beforehand yeah I'm like interesting
unetbootin or any of those things you're
not actually like making a fat32
filesystem copying over your years
Linux and then making it bootable you're
actually like if you were to do a DD
from this SD card to another similar SD
card it'd be exactly the same so once
you get everything installed on your SD
card and it does take a little bit of
time will probably take I think mine
took up to 10 minutes or so to actually
come in here it was probably less than
that but I left the room so that's it
might have been like 511 yeah I mean
it's not like it's not like this thing
is like a quad-core but you know it's so
it was just copying to the SD card from
my Linux machine so no no I'm talking
abou teen booty oh yeah off of this it
takes like is it's not it's it's ok it's
kind of in the middle I mean Raspberry
Pi is they're not the fastest machine on
the market so you're not going to get
crazy speeds out of it but obviously
it's it doesn't have that bad of lag out
actually just like opening up programs
but once you get into your programs
you're fine cool so yeah it's not that
bad at all so a couple of little notes
also to mention your host key all of the
host keys for the Kali Linux image are
all the same so you might want to change
that and I also have all of that
information in the show notes as well
and you can also change your password
with passwd in the terminal and that's
super easy but if you like keeping your
password as tor oh yeah you can keep it
as course you lose fun again you know
keeping your Wi-Fi plan up with
pineapples are yummy how's the password
cuz that's super smart never got in
trouble yeah exactly so once you
actually get Kali Linux installed and
we'll go over here to my little camera I
actually have wireless our wire shark
running on here and I also plug this
into our local Ethernet so that we have
this running I'll go ahead and choose to
start and I'll already see packets
running so what I noticed was like you
know Dropbox keeps on trying to update
and stuff like that don't yet Dropbox
lion sync discovery protocol BAM wow so
cool it works just fine I had no
problems with it it comes with all the
normal applications that you get with
Kali Linux so there's really no big
changes as far as it goes
it even has this nice top 10 security
tools so you can easily get in there and
fine whatever I love it yeah I love it
you just turned a $40 Raspberry Pi B I
guess we should say this only works with
the B obviously because you have to have
the HDMI out and I guess the 512 of RAM
will help a little bit more than I don't
know if this would work on the at
slightly smaller version but yeah that's
so cool thank you yeah Danna for
breathing this is super told hardware
and I love this because this guy I could
turn this into an air-gap machine if I
wanted to hey that's not a bad idea
actually I've got a right yeah I
couldn't use other person great PI on
your desk for DEFCON totally yeah
yeah it's lightweight the thing weighs
like less than two pounds
sure I could totally take this to DEFCON
with mmm okay cool well we'll do that oh
now stay tuned because in just a bit
we're gonna have trivia but first a
quick word from our sponsor

last week's trivia question was what
foundry created the moon to typeface
font found in Ubuntu operating systems
and the answer was Dalton Maag now this
week's question is the key size used for
an AES cipher specifies the number of
repetitions of transformation rounds
that convert the input called the
plaintext into the final output called
the ciphertext now what are the first
three number of cycles of repetition you
can answer that hak5 gorg slash trivia
for your chance to win some awesome hack
