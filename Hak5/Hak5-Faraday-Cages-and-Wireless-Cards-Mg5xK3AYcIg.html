Jackthreads now at the top of the show
we teased how we're going to start
having fun spoofing some geoip locating
api goodness that little fun thing you
see in the top left hand corner of the
google map that finds out where you are
even though you don't have a GPS in your
laptop and if you're not familiar with
we're going to be using a Faraday cage
you know what is a Faraday cage it's
basically a metal or mesh box and it
blocks while among other things radio
waves it was invented back in the
eighteen thirty sixes by an English
scientist named Michael Faraday and as
opposed to a paint bucket I decided to
go with and I can't put your frame
design because you know how I feel back
in ikea anyway first and foremost before
any before we go any further stand down
ham radio operators i know this is not
absolutely the best in fact this is my
rev one of my Faraday cage but as you
can see I fit two radios in a box and
I've basically folded a whole crap ton
of tin foil until it blocks everything
out you do you know a IW list your
interface and then you grep for ESS IDs
and you see nothing so it's like whew
now inside of here are two radios one of
these radios is going to be the my
typical normal pay every day this is
what I connect you know this is my
regular radio and then of course we have
the radio here with the monkey because
he's evil and he's going to be having a
lot of fun and they are going to live in
this box together and they will not be
able to see anyone else that's the idea
ok so that little evil monkey radio and
that's going to be running MDK 3 the MDK
3 is a tool that exploits weaknesses in
802 11 protocols it was created by a spj
with the help of the aircrack-ng team
and their libraries of course an empty
k3 can be found over at Pedro lyrics
homepage and is built into the latest
version of backtrack from backtrack
linux org you guys know I love that tool
so in with this using MDK 3 we're going
to try the beacon flood attack mode and
and that we've gathered from wiggle net
we can head over to wiggle dotnet here
and let me just log in and using wiggled
out which is a database of you know
people have come together to go ahead
and share their wardriving finds they
support uploads from you know
netstumbler mini Stumbler kismet a whole
bunch of other awesome tools and what's
so great about this is we can come down
here and say search and we can say i
don't know uh 5412 her rancourt state is
virginia a zip code is 2 3 188 and say
quarry and yes I'm harkening back to the
hack house sometimes you miss
Williamsburg mainly just for the cheese
shop but but here we go I have a listing
of the BS SIDS and SSID names of
wireless access points that were in the
vicinity of the address that I gave it
including there's one down here
williamsburg patriot net Victor's pizza
and deli BS Williamsburg I don't know
what that's all about one of them in
here is the pineapple house which was
pretty cool next to a astronomically
delicious pancake house anyway so what
I've done here and let's head over to my
console and cat my WM B G dot txt you
can see that I've added the bssid zor
mac addresses of and the SS ids of the
networks that were in that area ok so
that is going to happen on the monkey
radio in my Faraday cage while the other
radio is just chillin and we're going to
use I've got this in a screen we're
going to use MDK 3 and we're going to
use mode B for beacon and we could do
like a we could do
what is it tak tak help be to find out
more about or what is it not tech tech
help but well you can do mbak three tek
tek full help and pipe that to less and
you can come down here and find out
about the different test modes b is the
beacon flood mode and we can see that
there are various different options one
of which being tak v it reads max and
SSID is from a file and of course we
have a file over here with just that now
we can do all sorts of other fun things
remember i said that these do these
these databases basically map you to
nearby access points based on the
characteristics of those access points
so we're talking not just the bssid or
the SSID name of the network but also
you know things like what channel is it
on you know what kind of encryption is
it using now mind you these things may
change but overall if you've got a big
enough data set things should be
relatively same you know from from year
to year at least you would hope so on
access points so i know that i think
there's this this entire concept is kind
of a hack and that's why I'm trying to
hack it so let's see if we can spoof
this now using MDK 3 and what interface
are we going to use that on well I've
already brought up Mon 0 using airmon-ng
in fact I can just airmon-ng and i can
see i have mon 0 and that is based on my
wa and to interface the monkey one in
there and i'm just going to go ahead and
say B and then tack V and then my
Williamsburg txt file and so it's going
to start broadcasting out fake access
points these aren't real these aren't
actually you couldn't associate these if
you wanted to there's nothing on the
other end all these are or just raw
frames that we're injecting into the air
that are beacons and say hey I'm an
access point and my name is pineapple in
and housing center and my mac address is
you know this one right here right so
let's go ahead and get that going
awesome because like if i come over here
and do like I w what is it w land to
we're on or w line three
or it's IW list right I have it right up
here so I w list w yeah I w list abelian
three scanned in the grep for the SH IDs
we're going to see the networks in the
area so there we go we have successfully
created an environment within this box
where as far as the computer should be
concerned it's seeing what it would
expect to see around that area in
Williamsburg so I'm going to go over to
google maps now and let's see about
clicking this little button in the top
left my location I'm going to go ahead
and hit that or let's let's hit that to
find it and that's what I was afraid of
let's zoom out to go to the center of
the country and its snapping to this
area that's what I was afraid of if I
try again with this sample and I'm going
to go ahead and clear my location data
by saying clear for future visits this
is just a little bit of JavaScript that
will attempt to pinpoint me and if I
just go ahead and refresh this page and
it's going to say hey do in track your
physical location and say allow and yet
saying richmond california that's where
i'm stuck what a bummer right i mean
we've simulated everything else so
something isn't quite going right here
I've disabled the WLAN 0 that's the
internal wireless network card in this
machine I you know I guess I could have
just built a bigger Faraday cage run an
ethernet cable out of it V&amp;amp;C it into
this machine but that's where I am
wondering what you guys think is this
even you know is this even something you
want to see me continue to tried you
want to see more experiments like this
and what are your thoughts what do you
think I could do to make this better and
and are you familiar with the API and
how other how other wise you think I
could attempt to spoof it since it is
done client-side that's what I'd like to
know and that's why I'm asking you to
hit up feedback at hak5 org or just
leave us a little something in the
comments ok now stay tuned because we're

book if you haven't read it before this
week's question is this company that
existed in the late 80s and early 90s
created the software called procom and
was prominent before tcp/ip
came popular so answer over at hak5 org

last
when Mike is on do that on the show no
let's go check the network closet for
cat five don't forget cuz I always seem
