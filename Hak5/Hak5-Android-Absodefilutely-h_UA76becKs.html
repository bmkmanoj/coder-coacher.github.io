hello and welcome to hack 5 i'm darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
techno us this is of course week 2 of
the hacker cross America tour I'm here
in a radioactive dungeon in Canada and
we've got a great show for you guys this
week I'm talking to Dale chase the North
corner decor rapper Shannon's got file
utility file transfer utilities that I
think is just going to make anybody that
deals with windows so much happier as as
well as Jason Applebaum backed with some
mobile application development more with
the Android SDK I think you guys really
gonna like it and it just a little
update about the road trip this is I'm a
little after to see I'm in the second
week now and so far I've gone from
Williamsburg Virginia to Annapolis that
was last week's episode and then from
there I've been to Philly and Hoboken
New Jersey New York Derry Pennsylvania
and now I'm in Toronto and yeah it looks
like Detroit and Cincinnati are next and
I'm looking forward to all of that and I
want to say a big thank you to everybody
who has generously offered their
hospitality on this trip I you know
wouldn't be able to do it without
everybody's support and I think it's
great that I'm able to so yeah that's
what's going on with me um and fallin on
my ass on the ice and I blame Jen cutter
for that so if you're interested in all
of those little tidbits along the way
I'm doing daily videos there's photos
lots of tweets and stuff and there's a
new friend feed that's been set up to
organize all of the content so you can
find that over a hack across America com
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get into it the first I'm gonna kick
it over to Shannon for this week's
trivia this week's trivia is founded in
1994 the graphics card maker
3d effects introduced scanline
interleaves AKA sli to the gaming market
with what graphics port and two for your
chance to win a autographed copy of the
hack house set by entering your answer
at hak5 org slash trivia i have cows
miss you and now a brief word from our
sponsor
so as you guys know I've been on the
road for over a week now and I cannot
speak highly enough about the Droid that
just apps built in alone have just made
this trip considerably more enjoyable
especially considering that the
navigation feature in Google Maps will
pause music that's running in the
background to tell you what exit to take
oh so anyway let's hear more about the
other apps that you can get on Verizon's
droid the Ryze Android apps have access
to every tool the phone has including
the compass GPS accelerometer video
player image capture all of it the power
of the Android apps allow you to run
them in the background for multitasking
give background notifications and
enhance each other's performance
Verizon's dominant network and 3G
coverage create an unparalleled mobile
data solution to keep you connected to
the web and allow you to run heavy data
rich features anytime anywhere and with
the ever-expanding Android Market you
will always be able to quickly download
apps you need to get the most out of
your droid see droid does calm to learn
more I got a lot of feedback from the
Android segmented a couple of weeks ago
on the hello world of Android and most
of the feedback focused on you know you
wanted to see more in depth and I
thought what better place to start a
more in-depth look at Android then the
GUI the most visible part of an Android
application so to talk about the GUI
there's two ways to go about doing it
GUI the XML which is the preferred way
by most people out on the web and Google
themselves I believe prefers using the
XML layouts or you can do the Java code
layouts they're both equal off to the
same performance it's just how you want
to do it
XML is a little bit easier to visualize
the Java is a little bit convoluted so
let's go ahead and jump right into this
and take a look at the XML way of doing
this so inside the XML what we have here
is the linear layout which is your main
layout your mainframe for everything and
then the tax views this is a very simple
hello world but what you got here is a
couple different parameters for your
linear layout orientation vertical
orientation horizontal orientation
horizontal is just Langer items out from
left to right orientation vertical top
bottom pretty straightforward the next
two settings are actually really
important layout height and layout width
they've got two primary settings fill
parent or wrap content wrap content
wraps it nice and tight around what you
actually displayed so if it's an image
you crop it cuts out all the black space
and if it's a text it wraps it as tight
as it can to the text then you have fill
parent fill parent will just fill it's
the its parents window so if you are at
the top level it'll go ahead and fill
the entire screen the other option you
have is to actually put individual pixel
size in there but I don't recommend that
because you know Android has a lot of
different screen sizes to deal with so
moving on throughout here what we have
is text view text sees the label the
Android world and there's also another
one called edit text but for more clear
definitions on on all what these are
check out the Android developer site
really really good documentation there
and it's fully detailed and described
here we'd like I said we have the the
layout hind layout with again for this
textview as well as an extra one called
set text you don't have to do that but
in this case we kind of want to because
we want to set the thing to say hello
world this string hello is actually kept
in here in a bunch of definable strings
this is so that you don't have to define
strings inside your program you're gonna
find all your strings here reference
them by ID the important thing to
remember about Android is since
everything is nested you have to be
careful in what order you put things X
everything's executed from top down so
in doing that if you a fill parent is
your first thing it's going to
completely take up the entire screen and
you're not gonna be able to fit anything
underneath unless it's a nested inside
so just be careful of that so let's hop
on over to the Java code version of the
same thing so here it is pretty much
exactly the same thing linear layout we
call it view
except for this time since it's in Java
code you have to pass the context of
what it is the context I use this
because it's the current activity and
same thing with textview I just couldn't
went ahead and create a textview and
gave it the same parameter of this
meaning it belongs to this class so that
it knows where in the world it is so the
the nesting comes in right here where
I'm adding the label to the view which
is done right here I just click just do
an ADD view then next we want to go
ahead and set the label of the text to
hello world so label dot set text hello
world so the important thing now would
be to tell the application that this is
its view so set content view right here
and label so that will give you the nuts
and bolts of the GUI development and you
like I said you can check out the
Android developer site for more detailed
and different types of widgets is what
they're called Android widgets the text
view and the edit text so let's go ahead
and talk about the Android program
structure the important thing to
remember here is everything's being done
inside the oncreate method and that's
called by the Android constructor so
when the Android application loads the
first thing it does is call the on
create event and now I create event
everything is defined right in here
there's also ondestroy so when an
application exits and on resume so when
you since Android multitask when you put
it in the background and bring it up it
calls on resume so now that you know how
the Android kind of dataflow and
workflow goes the other thing to note is
the Android manifest inside the Android
manifest it basically specifies what
activities run in a certain order
so when I say run in a certain word I
mean which one launches which one's the
main activity which one can launch and
what properties does each have as well
as setting permissions for your
applications so if you use the camera
you need to specify that you use the
camera inside the manifest so the phone
knows what you're doing so inside the
Android manifest like we have here it
specifies you know what version you are
what's the naming a plication what's the
package name the application name the
application label which will appear on
underneath the icon on the dashboard so
when you launch it and the more
important thing what actually gets
launched so as you see here we've got
the intent filter
this basically states what activity is
of what class and does what things well
we only have one activity for this but
if you had multiples this is how you'd
set them up
so from intent filter you've got action
main that tells the phone that this is
the main application or main activity
for the application then the next we've
got a category what category does this
activity fall under everything's done
off activities so what category it's a
launcher it's able to launch the
application get everything started that
basically covers everything you get
started with Android gooeys and if you
have any questions email me jason hak5
org or hit up the show notes at hack 5
org if you guys are gonna be in the Bay
Area May 20th through or May 19th to
through May 20th I'm gonna be there
attending Google i/o so hit me up on
Twitter at Jason Applebaum this week I
wanted to tell you guys about a program
that I found called teraCopy
and we all know how troublesome and how
annoying it is to copy files and windows
where you have multiple files and you
copy them all to a different like hard
drive or something and one fails and
then you have to start all over again
and pretty much babysit it until it's
completely done it's a it's a royal pain
with teraCopy pretty much anybody can
use it it's good for multiple files and
it's super super fast and very accurate
with Windows we all know how slow that
one is so let's try tear a copy tarry
copy is a must-have you can download it
at code sector comm slash tear a copy
dot php' the free version will fit
pretty much 90% of your guys this needs
I'm pretty sure and it's still better
than like nine hundred percent better
than the original native Windows tool
which we all know kind of sucks the pro
version is 15 bucks while 15 euros or
$20 us and did I mention that there's a
portable application that you can use
yeah
we all know how I feel about the
portable apps so this one definitely
ranks pretty high on my list by
dynamically adjusting the buffers it's
faster at copying than the
native windows tool especially when
copying between separate physical disks
which is great you can also pause the
file transfer and if there's an error
that will retry lots and lots of times
before actually skipping over the per
the problem file and it won't interrupt
you to ask some kind of stupid question
that you don't really need to ask like
are you sure you want to delete this
file or are you sure you want to
continue or any crap like that I hate
that stuff in Windows oh so annoying
also if there is a problem file it'll
show you a list at the very end of your
file transfer so that you can choose to
either retry it again or delete the file
or try to fix the problem yourself so
you actually have that choice which is
very very nice and so wonderful because
I don't have to babysit my stupid
programming anymore ok it also has a
copy queue system which lets you
prioritize which files you want to do
first and you can see where in the
process you are the estimated time is so
much more accurate than the regular
Windows tool and with shell integration
you can actually replace the native tool
very very easily so what do you think do
you like this tool do you use it
yourself or do you have a separate one
that you like to use email me at
feedback at hack 5 org I actually read

able to reply to every single one and I

is everybody how long you been doing
this it sucks I mean a long time since
definitely since the days of summer camp
it's how good actually you know when we
get on the bus you know going to
wherever I guess it was I'd actually
have something written to get up and get
on the intercom and oh okay so
definitely since like those days so I
and then how did that lead to tail chase
the you know nerdcore rapper a was wrote
in that style even before I knew it was
Newark or you know
that's kind of why it is really fit into
like
the regular hip-hop scene you know I've
been and you know and so finally when I
actually was watching at 5:00 and I saw
expose on dual-core and I was like
that's what I need to do our girl
we should be doing this that's because
you can't you can't really go to school
for this but it sounds like you know
you're passionate about it and been
doing it since little what about what
did you go to school for what do you do
outsider nerd for rapping didn't
graduate from college Bob well I went to
a trade school certificate there but I'm
an audio engineer by trade audio post
production engineer
doing stuff for teenagers Billings
so that's kind of where my cue card
comes from a little bit and we got a
little bit of a programming background
for me breaking it's a Apple to seeing
games do basic basic a little piece
peacocking
like it keeps me entrenched in
it's a good culture and like the whole
harvest up kind of meant already like in
the brief time that I've been doing it
ever been all they're all cool cats you
know it's just such a great scene well
all creative professionals are really
really kind or so I've done so you're
doing shows now you've got a show this
Saturday
yeah Mehta puppets Janice in Brooklyn
Park Slope my second gig very jazz
influence yeah so it's a really cool
fusion of the SteriPEN guys it's a lot
what is the audience reaction to the
nerdcore when you know they're not I
mean are people coming out to see
nerdcore or you know you just happen to
be doing a gig there and people are like
what is easy really talk about NES like
yeah I mean so far a lot of folks are
coming out to see me and I think they're
enjoying it it's I mean hip hop and jazz
in itself is it being done that
so working you've got your stuff like
out for free though right people can
just go and listen to it right yeah yeah
right now actually you know right on my
site we'll see Mac Bob comes out every
