the OPM waste taxpayer money oh my
goodness hack advice satellite danger co
these and more it's Monday I am wired
for sound and we got a lot coming up now
on threat wire Hey happy Wednesday
people thank you darren I'm Patrick
Norton and this is threat wire for 9 9
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
and my thanks to everybody that supports
the show by a patreon calm / threat wire
if you're running windows run windows
update like I did this morning and it'll
update for a while because there are 12
patches being dropped right now 17
Internet Explorer flaws are corrected
one patch for Microsoft edge of graphics
patch for a hack that's already in the
wild and well just run windows update
because Krebs says quote five of the
patches fix flaws they could get pcs
compromised with little to no help from
users and five of the bulletins have
vulnerabilities that were publicly
disclosed before today including one
that reportedly has been detected in
exploits in the wild also dump adobe
shockwave player if you haven't already
okay while we're floating around Krebs
on security com he also reports that
quote the Office of Personnel Management
the OPM has awarded a 133 million dollar
contract to a private firm in an effort
to provide credit monitoring services
for three years to the nearly 22 million
people who had their social security
numbers and other sensitive data stolen
by cybercriminals Krebs that adds that
perhaps the agency should be offering
the option to pay for the costs that
victims may incur in freezing their
credit files a much more effective way
of preventing identity theft seriously
if you're worried about identity theft
and you should be put a freeze on your
credit files makes it much harder for
thieves to do anything gnarly with them
and they'll go bother somebody else
whose credit files aren't frozen great
quote from Krebs quote no matter how you
slice it 133 million dollars is a
staggering figure for a service that in
all likelihood will do little to prevent
identity thieves from hijacking the
names good credit and good faith of
breach victims seriously meanwhile the
cleverly titled ARS technica article
many new top level two
have become Internet's bad neighborhoods
reports that surprise new TLDs are being
exploited to impersonate legit calm org
dot whatever tlds I eat top-level
domains and covers a really interesting
set of studies by packet inspection tool
vendor and netsec firm blue coat the
list of the worst ten tlds from
malicious domains zip review country
chem cricket that science that work
party GQ that's a equatorial Guyana and
dot link go read the article if you want
to find out how that zip made number one
despite the fact that it's never
actually been publicly released for sale
in other cheerful news the IBT reports
that whatsapp web the desktop version of
the hugely popular medicine app owned by
Facebook Incorporated has a major
security flaw that could allow hackers
to infect user systems by simply knowing
their phone number potentially putting
200 million people at risk and quote the
register says quote fissures have been
targeting security researchers with fake
LinkedIn profiles built on repurposed
photos of models and company logos
according to f-secure hacker Sean
Sullivan why quote connecting with
researcher profiles would help attackers
map relationships between targets view
otherwise hidden personal information
and potentially open lines of
communication through which valuable
data may be disclosed and quote what do
we call that social engineering several
sources report that bugzilla Mozilla's
bug database was hacked richard barnes
firefox security chief said quote we
believe they use that information to
attack firefox users mozilla has
conducted an investigation of this
unauthorized access and we have taken
several actions to address the immediate
threat we're also making improvements to
bugzilla to ensure the security of our
products our developer community and our
users and quote we're talking about
something like 185 major flaws being
examined I think if I have that
information correct and in perhaps the
most awesome story of the day and
certainly the densest infographic Cooper
skis threat post blog has the story on
how the turlet apt group that's the
Russian cyber espionage crew used quotes
poorly secured satellite based internet
links to hide command and control
operations exciting stuff that because
especially do you think quote satellite
based internet receivers can be located
anywhere within the area come
by a satellite and this is generally
quite large so satellites huge area easy
to hide hmm before i head out i want to
give everyone who has supported the show
on patreon a big thanks we're currently
