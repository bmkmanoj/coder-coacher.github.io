standard Windows password in less than
six hours with a massive GPU cluster
building a home theater PC for around
$300 in blinking lights all that and
more at this time on hack five this
segment of hack five is brought to you
by domain.com hello welcome to act 5 my
name is Darren kitchen and I am Shannon
Morris it's your weekly dose of
technolog was your Santa hat I thought
you were wearing that one this week
no I'm say that you're supposed to have
a Santa hat you know I think so yeah and
I was gonna wear my bad sweater awkward
yeah that's okay cuz usually right I'm
so stoked
what do you sucked about about this
right here I am so excited you know that
home theater PC that I've kept on
talking about for like half a year
you're finally doing it building the
crap out of that thing good
well I'm stoked about that because you
know it's important yeah get your media
on and it's important to get it on the
way that you want it yeah I love the
idea of like there's all these different
boxes there's all these different cool
things you can do like you know you've
got your Roku's and your help me out
here or someone's Google TV Roku there's
the Apple TV there's the Xbox 360 that
you can do like the media I guess all of
the consoles at this point yeah but none
of them are perfectly what I want so I'm
just making my own I was like I'm so
down with that yep so I guess we haven't
done this on the show in like years so
oh it's great to get into it I'm stoked
that you're diving into this and so we
also have a really cool segment for the
holidays a little a little holiday
password cracking action that's gonna be
yeah so get this cracking it's actually
crack them well GPU enabled password
cracking so using graphics cards to you
know harness through this very
specialized computing power of those
guys in parallel like lots of graph
cards 25 in this case to take advantage
to basically brute force those one-way
hash functions that we're always talking
about you know your your md5 sha-1 x'
your NT LMS for Windows all of those
ways all those ways in which passwords
are stored in databases right which we
went over and severals what's that
several seasons ago we've talked about
them plenty and we've talked about the
merits of salting passwords and things
of that nature and this is and we've got
a great interview with Jeremy Cosme
because he's built a massive password
clack cracking GPU cluster I got a
chance to talk to him about the latest
in password cracking technology and so
Ghazni if you're not familiar is the CEO
of strict Consulting Group and they
recently showed off their latest
cracking rig over at the password 12
conference in Norway this rig get this
25 AMD Radeon graphics cards it's able
to bust every single possible 8
character ntlm hash in about five and a
half hours and that's the hash that's
been used in Windows since 2 Server 2003
it replaces that ridiculously weak LM
hash which is I guess the password
hashing equivalent of like WEP it's kind
of a joke yeah yeah I'm stoked about
this his rig is super unique in that it
uses VCL virtualization so that is a way
for a single controller to communicate
with multiple machines all just
jam-packed with GPUs and then he uses
hash cap + to make those rigs just
really turn out a whole bunch hashes so
in this case ntlm he's able to do 350
billion attempts per second rachelle one
that's 63 billion times per second and
even for like md5 we're talking about a
hundred and eighty attempts a hundred
billion attempts per second now bcrypt
the Chop 512 corrupt those safer for now
is it a lot safer for now seventy one
thousand and three hundred and
sixty-four thousand respectively so not
in the billions yet which is pretty cool
so if you haven't go ahead and make your
password more complex and thinking love
of God stop using the same one in every
site yeah but at this point I think we
should just go to head throat over to
Jeremy because this is kind of a long
interview and we
geek out about the nitty-gritty cool
let's check it out
if you're setting up a website to start
a new business showcase your portfolio
publish a blog domain.com is the best
place to go for your next great idea
need a new domain name we'll consider
getting yourself a dot-com
I'll name is the original we only know
it the best it's globally understood
it's recognized everywhere no matter
what you choose gonna lend credibility
to your content plus if you're into
investing in like buying and selling
domains you've got the highest after
market value and you can find a dot-com
name over at domain.com
Jenny and I love them because they are
so affordable and reliable and easy to
use plus domain.com has such an active
social media presence on Twitter at
domain.com and great customer service it
makes it a really fun place to do
business and get this they're huge fans
of hak5
and they want to hook you up so you can
get 15% off they're already affordable
domain names and web hosting all you
have to do is use a coupon code hak5 at
domain comms check out that's 15% off
and big savings so don't forget to use
the coupon code hak5 when you think
domain names think domain.com so what
brought you to hash cat and what role do
you play in that project so I've been
using hash cat for about two years I've
been into password cracking for about
ten thirteen years now and with the
advent of GPU password cracking there
really is no other alternative aside
from hash cat most the other GP crackers
out there just don't have the maturity
or the speed or the flexibility of you
know the hash cap provides I'm not
active with this development cat I'm
actually fully being developed by one
person right now and that's Adam so I'm
more of I guess you could say kind of a
community leader I'm one of the few you
know senior moderators like on the hash
cat forums and stuff so yes you can say
like I'm a hash cat power user and I
assist Adam with things like the website
wiki development I was responsible for
adding virtual OpenCL clustering the
hash tag recently when I say I'm
responsible for that I mean I poked Adam
I was like hey have you seen BCL you
should add this so which I'll be
presenting a talk on hash cat clustering
with virtual OpenCL at the
twelve security conference in Norway
that's me oh nice yeah that sounds like
a lot of fun well tell me about your
cluster what's the what's the rig and
what does it take to put something like
that together so my current rig consists
of ten Radeon 7970 s
369 90s or 59 70s and a 5870 throw and
just in there for fun the plus is pretty
large its cost about a little bit over
30 grand at this point and it's mostly
just we use the funds you know it's it's
it's corporate back to you know buy my
LLC so I didn't have to pay for all of
us out of pocket but it was mostly the
money we have left over from our
embedded Linux development efforts we
spun into this cluster and yeah it's it
runs a hash cat and virtual cl2 as an
abstraction layer so basically we have
this virtual machine out there that has
no GPUs on it which is acts like as a
like a head unit with a busser manager
and it has hash got installed and the
virtual seal broke through and then all
the GPU nodes just have virtual cl2
OpenCL daemon on it so that virtual see
up to the individual cluster notes and
then we just kick off hash cat jobs from
the finger broker node and it just kicks
it out to all these different GPUs you
know there's like cuz a lot of those are
dual GPU guards that I mentioned so I
think right now in the question we have
like 20 something you know GPUs
available - cracking and so how many of
physical boxes and how are those guys
networked so right now there are five
physical boxes although one of those is
an open-air chassis it's not really a
box its
I I got a picture up here on Twitter
I've actually just got in trouble by the
data center for having this because
they're concerned that it's an
uncontained unit I'm gonna link you to
this picture real quick but this was
basically a hack job that I did with
some aluminum angle iron and so yeah
that picture there that's best thing
basically just a hack job that I did
with the rack mounted shelf some
aluminum angle iron and
some cutting and drilling and yeah I've
seen see that there the data center got
mad about that haha is in unit yeah so I
just got this shelf sitting there with
some GPS hanging off of some aluminum
angle iron bolted up directly to the
rack but the other boxes are just you
know regular for you servers send you
another picture here we're actually you
can just click to the next picture we
see the eight five seventy nine seventy
bucks there
this box here cost about ten grand
milled dad is just amazing and so you
just use hash cap for this how does that
stack up against things like pure it and
some of those other ones that I can't
pronounce
so period or pirate however you want to
pronounce it hash cat is two to three
times faster then using the pre computed
tables with pirate repair everyone
pronounce that but you know Pierre it
only does WPA doesn't do any other
algorithm right hash cat supports
between CPU hash cat hash cap plus and
hash got light I think it supports
seventy algorithms altogether so
definitely the flexibility there and why
ATI over NVIDIA that's kind of a
complicated question the short answer is
nvidia and cuda suck for hash cracking
and that's largely just due to invidious
architecture when it comes down to is
hash cracking benefits from GPGPU
through massively parallel computations
right and right now ati are AMD cards
have more stream processors available to
do those parallel computations and not
only that but nvidia kind of hides the
direct access to the faders of the
stream process behind their units with
AMD and ati you have direct access to
those stream processors so there's no
extraction going on there if you think
of it like as GPUs are like workers with
ATI you have more workers available that
run it slightly slower clocks with AMD
or started with Nvidia cards
you have less workers available that run
at higher clocks so that's kind of bit
in a nutshell there's other
architectural differences as well that
might be getting a little bit too
technical on NVIDIA has a much better
memory controller then AMD cards but
hash cracking doesn't use very much
memory and the memory that you do use
there's usually localized to each GPU
like the local memory and CPU to think
you look kind of like an l2 cache I
suppose but yeah memory memory speed and
the amount of memory available on the
cards are rather insignificant
especially if you're talking about brute
force reports uses almost more than that
that's a little so does that mean that
you get to get away with buying a
cheaper card
