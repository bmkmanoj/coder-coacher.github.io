thrill list
welcome to hack tip the show will break
down the concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Aaron kitchen and today we're
continuing our discussion on wireless
management frames with pro requests and
responses and as you recall we've set up
a test environment using two wireless
interfaces air base ng and Wireshark
that's allowed us to inspect management
frames and we've looked at the beacons
are friendly little frames that
broadcast the existence of wireless
network and today we're going to take a
little bit further and look at the
probes now probes come in two flavors
requests and responses so we're going to
go ahead and begin with the requests a
probe request is a special frame sent
from a client station requesting
information from either a specific
access point or all access points in the
area specified with either an SSID or
the broadcast SSID now the information
being requested in a probe includes
information such as data rate which also
are included in these beacon frames that
we've talked about that are just
broadcast from the access point the
difference here being that by sending a
probe request your wireless card is
making an active scan of either specific
network or all networks in an area
whereas simply listening for beacon
frames is considered a passive scan now
today we'll demonstrate an active and
passive scan and dissect probe requests
and responses so this brings us to the
responses typically when an access point
here is a probe request frame either
directed specifically to it or to all
stations using the broadcast SSID it's
going to go ahead and send out a probe
response and similar to a beacon frame
will find that the pro responses contain
much of the same information required
for two stations to start communicating
now to begin our demo we're going to go
ahead and start once again by bringing
up our fake access point with air base
ng so let's start by bringing up the
interface with if config the
w land 0 up now okay now we're going to
also go ahead and start it in monitor
mode on channel 11 with airmon-ng start
wlan0 11 all right there we go we have
Mon zero so now we can go ahead and
issue air base ng taxi 11 for Channel 11
tacky we're going to call it Hawk tip
that's a rest aside e in this case and
our interface Mon zero now with the
access point up we're going to go ahead
and fire up our favorite packet sniffer
Wireshark and inspect both active and
passive scans then we're going to go
ahead and wrap up with this week's
giveaway but first let's take a quick
break thrill list zips through the crap
to find the best your city has to offer
every day want to know about a Star Wars
burlesque show a beer garden that
screens 80s flicks or how about a
restaurant with a sushi robot then sign
up for Thrillist free daily email at
Thrillist comm slash hak5 so to recap
our configuration we have our first
radio in monitor mode with interface
mon0 and it's acting as our access point
or base station with air base ng now
we're going to go ahead and bring up a
second wireless card in monitor mode so
let's do that in a new window here with
airmon-ng start wlan0 here and i'm going
to put that on channel 11 it's not going
to matter for right now but there we go
now we have in just a second Mon one
great and that's going to be our new
interface and it's going to be basically
acting as our client or station now we
go ahead and fire Wireshark we can go
ahead and begin sniffing our client mod
1 and then we can see all of the packets
and frames going on in the air for this
card so I'm just going to click right
here where it says Mon 1 and already
immediately we can see that there are
plenty of beacons in there as we've
discussed in previous sessions so let's
go ahead and filter those out and you
know while we're doing this let's also
filter out any frame that isn't
addressed to to or from our inter
so first we need to know the MAC address
of our interface so if config W lamp for
here where's our hardware address going
to just select that copy that all right
cool and now to filter this we're going
to say W LAN addr equals equals and then
our MAC address and we're also going to
go ahead and filter out the subtype 0 X
0 8 as we remember from the previous
time those being our beacons
so amp amp W and FC type underscore
subtype not equal to so bang equals 0 X
0 8 oops
0 X 0 8 there we go now in our terminal
let's go ahead and tell our client card
to do a passive scan of the area looking
for the available access point so we'll
issue IWW Lane 4 scan passive and then
we'll pipe that to grep and look for
just SSID go ahead and run that I'll
take just a second and there we go we
see that we have plenty of SS IDs and if
we go back to Wireshark I'll tab over to
that we can see that they aren't any
probes or responses and this is because
our client card is reporting all of the
nearby wireless networks based on a
passive scan meaning that no data was
sent out our card was completely silent
and the data compiled was done so only
using what was available freely in the
air and in this case those are the
beacon frames now we can and probably
will get more sophisticated with this
type of silent site survey if you will
with a tool kismat but for now this
should suffice and demonstrating what is
available without transmitting a single
frame so finally let's go ahead and
generate some probes in back in the
terminal alt tab over here let's go
ahead and tell our client card to make
an active scan of the area so iw list W
land for scan and again wrap and then
this time it's ESS ID and there we go so
we see that there's a slight difference
in what shows up when we do the active
versus passive in our terminal here but
if we head back over to Wireshark we'll
see that there are plenty of probe
requests and probe responses so let's go
take it for look at the first request
frame so we can actually filter this so
it's 0 X 0 4 is the subtype so I'm going
to put right at the end here in our
filter amp amp and then we're going to
say type I'm sorry w land FC type
underscore subtype equals equals and
we're going to look for 0 X 0 4 ok and
now we can see here that we have our
first probe right here it says probe
request let's open that up and take a
look inside ok and we can see it's a
probe request we can see that it is 0 X
0 4 as I just mentioned and we see here
is our source it's the MAC address of
our card as well as the destination and
that destination address broadcasts or F
F F F F F F F F F F meaning this is a
probe request meant will everyone anyone
who can hear it right and we actually
can come down here into our tagged
parameters we can see our supported data
rate so we can see you know what channel
it's on this one right here current
channel is 1 so we come back over here
and take a look at our next one and we
can actually just do this right here and
scroll all the way down we can see this
one is set to channel 2 as you can
imagine the next one is set to channel 3
the next one is set to channel 4 and so
on and so on
now if we go ahead and flip that last
bit of our filter from subtype 0 X 0 or
4 or probe request so 0 X 0 5 will
actually see the probe responses so I
want to come up here and come all the
way to the end change that to a 5 and
here are the probe responses let me go
ahead and I yeah this one actually is
hack tip so let me open this one up and
let's take a look inside now as much
like before we've looked at beacons
these frames indicates the same kind of
capability information necessary for our
stations to be in begin communicating so
we can see all sorts of data in here as
far as what is available the fixed
parameters including you know that
app is not enabled we've got under the
tag parameter is the SSID tack tip as
well as the supported data rates and the
channels and all of that other
information that begin the first steps
in our access point and our client
communicating now alright I think that's
plenty for this lesson today and coming
up we're going to be taking this further
analyzing the process of authentication
and Association as well as all the other
fun stuff that makes up a station base
station relationship right ok but now
it's time for the giveaway now as you
guys remember last week I asked what was
Wireshark known as before may of 2006
and that answer is ethereal rather real
or ethereal one of those anyway this
week what I'd like to know is what
Wireshark filter will specify whether a
wireless frame check sequence is good or
bad go ahead and answer in the comments
to be randomly selected to receive the
radio I use here on hack tip and as
always we value your feedback and your
suggestions so it would be have a tip go
ahead and share it with me email tips a
hack 5 org or just leave them right down
here in the comments and be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your techno
list in Soviet Russia probe request you
