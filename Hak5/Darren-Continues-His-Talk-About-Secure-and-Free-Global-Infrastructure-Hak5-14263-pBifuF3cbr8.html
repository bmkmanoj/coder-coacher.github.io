CrashPlan the internet as much as it can
transcend this out of order as it
doesn't so now I'm gonna hit you guys
with a bunch of lies Arab Spring changed
a lot of things in terms of Internet
censorship and freedom because Egypt
Libya Syria Tunisia Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain all filtered or dropped internet
access in 2011 when they want underwent
their revolutions right and in these
countries internet access is not like
what we enjoy today where the
proliferation in the United States is
somewhere around 85% in these nations is
anywhere between you know 20 and 30
percent okay and for those people it's
of a different class you have to be you
know you have to have a lot more money
to be able to get access to Internet you
actually you know you may be a lot more
of an intellectual person and so if
you're in Egypt in the internet shuts
off what are you gonna go the streets
wonderful you've got a bunch of smart
people in the streets and so it actually
kind of worked out pretty well however
it wasn't without casualties as we saw
you know Syria used phishing sites to
actually capture Facebook logins okay
and they use those logins to go in and
delete people's accounts to keep them
from being able to communicate and
uprise right totally uncool citizens
were harassed beaten killed Facebook to
their credit I don't normally get
Facebook credit but to their credit
handled this in such a beautiful way
they said oh these people's accounts are
getting hijacked not oh serious being a
douche bag they said let's find a way to
solve this in a technical way and so
they did and I love the solution that
they came up with now be recount get so
you set your passwords change and
anything of that nature well when you go
to log in it just shows you thumbnails
of your friends and you got to choose
like oh I knew who that is I know who
that is on who that is which is really
cool just otherwise the government would
have to have a database of all of your
faces and
yeah kind of cool that they took that
and so we think that couldn't happen
here except for the protecting
cyberspace as a national asset of 2010
Act which passed in 2010 which gives the
president the power to enact a emergency
measure of shutting down for the
government and private sector Internet's
and for the Internet infrastructure now
quote in case of a large-scale cyber
attack trying to finding that oh we're
getting DDoS shut down the Internet I'm
reading through some of the stuff coming
out of Edward Snowden right now and it's
just like or some of the docs that have
been released since and there's just
broad interpretations of all of this
stuff thankfully Congress came in and
they're like whoa
turn off the internet well we're gonna
we're gonna make you know possible or
else I passed the thing that said you
can turn off the Internet
how about turn off the internet for up
to 120 days at which point you will have
to ask us for an extension for another
120 days to go Congress I just threw
this slide in here I've been given this
talk before this broke and then suddenly
it's like you didn't think it could
happen here
what Syria Tunisia yeah sorry
that'll be a bunch a whole nother talk
of its own hopefully in a year
you know but none more fun stuff happens
but continuing on the Trenton flags
can anybody identify this one all right
South Africa is awesome I don't have my
wallet on me or my passport where else I
would show you but I have a friend that
I met
that's from South Africa okay bunch of
cool people are actually come shop at
South Africa and Mark Shuttleworth is
and and he does really cool Wi-Fi stuff
in fact that that we can have some of
the best Wi-Fi community networks
Johannesburg walk or a wireless user
group Pretoria can't pronounce it Cape
Town
Durban two others that I can't pronounce
have awesome community-based mesh Wi-Fi
networks with like you know dozens of
kilometer point-to-point routes just
using off-the-shelf gear with antennas
that they've built at the end so I met
this guy in uh
in Ireland at the target I eat hacker
space if you ever get a chance to go
there and bring them a rubber ducky and
they and I'm talking to this guy that
started this this wireless mesh network
and at the time they couldn't actually
provide internet access because only the
state could provide an Internet access
right well they went through all the red
you know red tape and all the hoops and
they're finally able to provide that to
some extent but even before then they
were providing their own micro blogging
services their own community forums and
social networks and you know all of the
things that we know and love about the
Internet and they actually got it to a
point where anybody could come to a
meet-up grab a little blue router plug
it in and become part of them become
another node on the mesh without having
to you know be a rocket scientist which
is awesome right I think it is a great
example of messages and work in fact I
was actually just giving a talk similar
to this in Seattle and I was talking
about because here's the thing
Seattle totally known for their awesome
Wi-Fi mesh network stuff turns out at
metrics active space the guy that runs
that started the Seattle wireless mesh
movement which is fantastic
to have been there and talking about
that and I actually mentioned this to
this this guy that I met in Ireland and
I'm like dude it's like telling me all
about the Technical College you should
go to Seattle and hang out with those
Seattle you know wireless guys because
you guys could really feed off each
other I think you'd get on there's a
column and I'd love to go but you know
what I'm South Africa
so you're citizen of Earth you're human
right nope can't come here you know I
have two passports in my wallet I'm
gonna have to go back out there and get
one for my stamp I have my hacker
passport and I'm a US passport and I
love the United States because it is the
most free nation in the world but but it
was just appalling to me to realize that
this person couldn't even go to see how
to meet this guy to see this you know
other mesh network and learn from it but
you know we can go you can go online
which is awesome so that's the power of
the Internet and that's the power of
mesh networks and it's only one of you
know many different you know
technologies the is unbanned is is free
for a lot of cool use right we stomp on
2.4 and 5.8 this one we can use in
Canada and there's a bunch of other
restrictions are the other ones like
these guys can only be like really low
power mind you this is the government
telling us what we can and can't do with
a with a natural resource with something
as inherent in earth as the land and the
water and the wind okay all right maybe
I'm get a little too hit me here but
it's just energy you know it's no
different than then you know the photons
of light or my speech right now
modulating air pressure right but in
1947 the ITU bringing it back to this
governmental organization decided that
hey you know what we're we've been using
like spark-gap transmitters and other
horrible things to communicate during
like world war ii and all of those
things it's time to standardize some of
this stuff and they chose 2.4 gigahertz
for microwaves you know they came up
with these different bands that
industrial scientific and medical people
can use eventually 1985 the FCC made all
of this stuff unlicensed for us to use
great up and which is awesome because we
can all set up our own Wi-Fi networks
where you know there isn't
restrictions on what we can and can't
say there is a restrictions to access
there isn't you know anyway they're free
and open and I love them
more clouds fun anybody near this one
this is a Czech Republic okay
so there are some problems with radio
namely permission issues I would say is
the biggest problem with radio you know
I would say if if you want to limit
access to radio use physics you know if
you want to talk to Tibet you're gonna
have to use a really low frequency and
that's going to not be able to provide
as much bandwidth I think those should
be the loss now I'm I'm a little
conflicted about it too because you know
I also believe in infrastructure is like
these roads where you have to have a
license but a license to express
yourself as a human I don't know about
that so these guys in Czech Republic
they came up with a really cool
community mesh network that did not use
radio can even be identify those hard to
see here I don't I never heard of them
called that I know of them as Ron jizz
okay this is using infrared it's called
reasonable optical near joint access and
this stuff looks like that in the day
these guys are able to do full duplex 10
10 base T networks over infrared with
distances of about a mile right so in a
populated urban area this is you could
play Starcraft over this which is
awesome and you know sure it it's
susceptible to you know interference you
know you've got I'm not gonna run one in
the San Francisco Bay Area and expect
across the bag it's too much fog or
small here maybe but but everything in
this project is GNU fully documented
free license you know you get something
like what is it Oh point eight seven
miles on red visible light and point
seven eight miles on invisible
for red light really cool like I said
you know well it's license-free
full-duplex knife it radius less optimal
Fatma sphere aberrations and things of
that make sure there's actually a lot of
study going into this area right now
anybody familiar with life i this is a
really help incoming technology i
tripoli actually just you know certified
or is 30 to certify the first batch of
life I there's a bunch of studies going
on Stanford for this but basically
imagine a light bulb that is you know
flickering at a certain frequency or
something like that
where your computer can use it as a
network but literally it doesn't leave
the room because the walls are in the
way you know using light for you know
transferring information I mean we're
really just talking about mediums here
you know I say I love the internet I I
don't give it if it's over optical or or
Ethernet or token ring or smoke signals
you know this is another awesome network
that's that's being born in Austin it's
called or used to be called the HS mm
mesh thankfully they changed the name
here to broadband Hamnet and as you
might imagine it's a ham radio network
the ham radio operators are allowed to
do really cool stuff with you know
higher wattage radios and things of that
nature and they overlap the is M band in
what we consider channels one through
six of Wi-Fi so using simple
off-the-shelf you know Wi-Fi routers
with open wrt and OLS are for for mess
routing yeah well you can't come up with
something like this and this is a
screenshot from you know a couple of
days ago but they're building this out I
can't wait to get down to Austin meet
these guys
but this is another example of a
community mesh network is working in
fact another one just launched three
days ago or something there's amazing
everybody see this hell yeah I love
Google for doing this kind of epic stuff
the Google X project project loon
launched on June 16th it hangs out
somewhere around twelve miles and this
is a balloon solar-powered bunch of mesh
net radios
to connect together in the stratosphere
create a huge Network and then relay
back down to the ground to provide
Internet access to regions that may not
have it fantastic technology these is
really cool stuff where you know based
on its altitude its able to actually
move around a little bit you know hover
brings up interesting discussions about
airspace about creating global mesh
networks and legalities of that because
people seem to think that they can own
the sky except if it's over 100
kilometers then mm then its face and
them that's okay
where 100 my sorry 100 miles is somebody
correct me later
that'd be a big that would be like up
smashing into the moon difference it's
good thing nASA has never done that
makes about miles in kilometers so there
are a couple other examples commotion
Wireless and project Byzantium probably
share some of the the most similar
things they are basically set up to
create wireless mesh networks very
easily on the fly all you have to do is
you know in the case of project
Byzantium they've got a live USB a live
CD ISO you can burn a boot off of any
machine that's got Wi-Fi and turn it
into a you know a part of this mesh and
what byzantium does is they're really
focused on you know mesh networks for
disaster relief and things of that
nature so they actually build these
networks where you can auto join and
self-healing and they provide already
built into the ice of the distribution
all of these same services like a
microblogging suite a facebook like
social network at you know all of the
different things that we've come to know
and love about the Internet except you
know just consolidated and this is a
little ice so that you can boot off of
and then everybody becomes part of the
net mesh and then you can connect to it
with your phone and actually start
getting some wheeling
around maybe really help some people
which is awesome
and it's all you know GNU it's all open
source it's all really cool stuff the
project Guardian project does very
similar stuff except they're focused on
Internet infrastructure you guys are
familiar with the Tor project that's
another good example that should be up
here but you know talking about how to
build on crypto how to build on strong
crypto that has been proven and that we
can implement in a more easy way where I
can get on jibber bots on my phone now
and talk to somebody else and as long as
I've exchanged my public/private key
pair I can have a conversation that the
NSA can't crack for another ten years
that's fantastic
and so those are technologies while
they're relying on traditional internet
infrastructure can be applied to any of
the other infrastructures that I've
talked about so this is the point where
to get off the rails and if it wasn't so
hot in here I talked about unlicensed
availability of spectrum as driver's
license versus ham radios we could go
off on this thing about you know you
know being civil and polite and you draw
analogies between accountability and
anonymity and you know how that applies
to like IRC and you know
software-defined radio crypto and other
things of that nature I think I'm going
to use this moment though to just ask if
we have any questions and
I have been using CrashPlan for years
and I never thought it'd be this
enthusiastic about backups but let me
tell you the guys over at CrashPlan are
doing it right first of all your data is
for yours ours only we know that and
that's why CrashPlan offers the best
privacy guards using Bruce Schneier
open-source blowfish cipher so you can
generate and import your own private key
so it's never stored on their servers
and what's more CrashPlan is
cross-platform with clients for Windows
Mac Linux even Solaris you can see why I
love it and you couple that with the
truly unlimited backup seriously I have
like terabytes out there you can see why
I am so excited
in fact the CrashPlan software is so
flexible it'll backup any file not just
off-site to their own servers but to
your own external hard drive for free
I'm doing that right now I love this as
hackers as geeks as IT professionals we
all know the importance of off-site
backups and as hack five viewers we're
getting a very special hookup we're
gonna get a entire year of unlimited
backup their normal plans start at
$59.99 a year which is about five bucks
a month but if you go to this very
special page over at crash plan.com
slash pack it up you're gonna get a
whopping 20% off so that's a year of
unlimited backups for less than four
bucks a month it is never too soon to
back it up so I highly encourage you
guys to take advantage of this special
offer music crash plan comm slash hack
it up you're gonna see why I love it
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hack 5 but before we get
going there's a couple of things we
would like to remind you and actually
tbh I want to say first and foremost
this is absolutely not a comprehensive
list of alternative infrastructures as
much as you know it's kind of the
conversation I kind of feel like what
this is is just well just talking about
something that I'm passionate about and
trying to hopefully encourage the
conversation to continue because it's
something that we need to be very
focused on because we are the geeks the
hackers if you look back you know thirty
years ago
idea of a hacker but the neckbeard was a
guy that was inventing the Internet and
it's so cool that these hacker spaces
that have become like they are part of
the social network that meets based
social network before there were you
know before there were social networks
there were computer clubs and and things
of that nature and it's so cool to go to
these places yeah and then those people
at those clubs were all like wait let's
build a networking protocol called IP
and then next thing you know yeah so so
yeah if you're at a hacker space you
want to continue this conversation over
a couple of beers I've got a lot more
that I would love to say it's just
something that you know I feel very
passionate about and I really value
everybody's feedback on this I mean
basically the way that I feel is that
well yes I'm proud to be as free as I
can in this world I believe in this one
I believe in packet packet well this is
a hackerspace passport back this is a
brand-new one so you can have it yeah
there you go yeah just like stamp it I
do like well not everybody has a stamp
but you get like stickers or whatever
have you awesome yeah oh my god what's
awesome backgrounds I just feel like
it's one of those things where I believe
in packets not passports you know I'm
saying like that's packets don't care
they don't know or at least they don't
have to seems like more and more packets
are going to need passports in the
future and that's just not a future I
wanna live in so let's do something
about this
yes so let us know feedback at hak5 dot
org in the comments on the forums were
ever have you were all over the net oh
you know what something cool happen
during DEFCON yes actually I guess it
was during black hot yes I got nominated
for a pony
oh oh that's those are the ones that
they do at Cannes a quest for like
hacking boxes I'm like oh
wit Mac get free milk so they had one
for best song and me and Dale chase did
a song together called SSH to my heart
did you and Dale tereus exchange public
keys we did alright I may have showed
him my private key whoa whoa
Shannon Morris is private key next time
I not know very special hacks but yeah
pretty cool so we got nominated
the winner was dual core of course is
dope or I know I was super excited his
song is all the things and both of those
are available on Bandcamp oh yeah it was
for the song all the things it was for
all the things I love that you're not
gonna like his Snapple as he pops it
with vodka and a cyanide capsule it was
pretty amazing so now dual core has a
little my little pony that was like you
have to bring that over so I can play
with your pony oh my god and also dogs I
love ponies hey speaking of ponies and
dongs I am going to Boise Idaho oh
really I have no idea how that works in
there hack across America is continuing
I have some confirmed dates and some
cities where I'm working on don't have
the exactly yet
but I'm about to leave for Boise Idaho
Jackson Hole Wyoming and then I've got
dates for September 5th 6th and 7th is
back to back Dallas Houston Austin
lookout Texas those are kind of far away
from each other fYI no no that's like a
four-hour drive between each five six
that's what Texas is one of those where
you can only go for 55 yeah yeah you can
go like 80 there sure in a van okay well
maybe not in here okay and then after
that Oklahoma City Kansas City Missouri
Des Moines Iowa don't have dates for
those yet but those will be on the way
in between September 7 gotta Fort
Leonard Wood Missouri no they can come
out to KC and then Minneapolis on
September 19th that's gonna be huge and
then Chicago Chicago September 21st that
sounds awesome and then making your way
over to I'm making my way yeah I'm gonna
do it I'm gonna do a lot more lips
that's awesome man but those are the
gates so stay tuned hack across America
calm for all the details sign up if
you're interested in participating or
hosting a meet-up and we look forward to
maybe getting snubz out at a few of
these - I need
be stuck in a van with you I don't want
to stuck in the van with you either kind
of went to your private key so with all
of that said I'm Darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse
trust you techno list let's move</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
