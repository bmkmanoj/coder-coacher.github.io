by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
thank you my kudos have Technol us yes
and we are back on a hill we are on the
top of the hill it is 90 degrees here in
the San Francisco Bay Area which is like
sanely hot 40-ish Celsius I don't know
it's hot it's really hot surprisingly
and nobody has air-conditioning around
here that's kind of how it works in the
Bay Area and I know some of y'all are
gonna be like wall in the Bay Area the
temperature is usually railed 75 Oh 65
degrees well I don't care today it's
night 95 I want some a/c yes that's why
you tuned in fact we're gonna talk about
the weather for the next hour and I
figured you guys would really enjoy that
how's the weather in your area
it was so tell me about the drone stuff
okay well last week and as we are in the
middle of two different series on
software-defined radio and drones we
tried to tackle a couple of those things
and revisit what we've done on the
mountain top Mount Diablo and we were
not successful I would say that we were
successful in that the new thing on the
: er the the counter point the
counterpoise sorry I don't know why I
can never remember that yeah the kind of
boys really did help
however our all up weight exceeded our
thrust and we're gonna get into that in
the joint areas but essentially drone to
a heavy doesn't fly very good yeah it's
okay though because we've got a lot of
cool stuff in the works to make it all
sexy happy time and we will revisit that
soon but I thought about this um
one of the other problems that was gonna
come up with our you know essentially
what we're trying to do is get higher to
increase our radio horizon right
eventually your battery is gonna die and
you got to come down yeah what goes up
yeah so you can leave it on like a
rooftop somewhere but that's in fact
what we're trying to do with this thing
that the Department of Defense Advanced
Research Project has a thing for this
German competition and one of them is
for perch and stair the idea to drop you
drown on a rooftop and then fire up your
signals intelligence stuff you know
maybe a pineapple or whatever collect
some information power down your motors
you know hang out all day long and then
at the end of the day fly home so that
would be good however there is not a
rooftop 400 feet above us there's not
done
no the batteries it's more like 20
minutes so what do we do I want
something persistent okay huh I just
want something we can pivot into and
that we can always see airplanes from
hella far away oh that sounds good to me
well so that kind of leads me to
thinking well we've been using a DSP
tracker the pineapple infusion so on the
Wi-Fi pineapple we're using this program
called dump 1090 which picks up the ad
SB beacons from the airplanes and we're
able to decode those and see where they
are good you see it on a map inside
sustainable but we actually haven't been
even using that web interface because
every time we come out to the field we
don't have internet eyes yeah so where
do we have internet access which is also
a place where we should have air
conditioning which sounds like I would
say our office mmm quite comfortable
there yes so what if we could have our
software-defined radio here on the top
of the hill okay
but we could just hang out there I love
this idea it sounds pretty easy all we
need is a network link and you know what
we can do antennas yes Annelle zone
between here and the office is like
there's no obstructions oh no we have we
have the SSP what is the SSP it is the
solar suitcase pineapple
oh god no check this out it's a super
excited oh God is this open yeah Paul
and I started building stuff I got I
don't know if you can read that out here
and not get in trouble no no no we can't
old we have permission the Park Service
has said it was okay yeah um cool where
we're gonna leave Paul standing next to
it it'll be fine
so what we have here is a Pelican case
kind of suitcase II guy yeah and we have
a 10 watt solar panel cool we also have
a 14 DB eye panel antenna Wow that's it
you are a theros radio okay so this is
going to be our long-range link we also
have a 90 bi dipole connected to our
Realtek so I don't know maybe we could
also do some guess it wouldn't be war
driving or sitting around not doing much
you're sitting or sitting and then we
have our coaxial collinear and we belt
though a while back now just two seconds
but still you know what the two segments
mis-
fine yes yeah and then inside I check
this out it's cool okay oh my god that
battery dude yeah that's basically a my
super eye that you pried it out of your
motorcycle I took it out of Paul's
motorcycle Paula you're not gonna be
able to get home tonight if you don't
mind but no this is just a lead-acid
battery okay and I'm using lead acid
rather than the for example we have
lithium ion batteries yeah for the
pineapple in fact that'll run for three
days bandwidth this runs
indefinitely oh my guess because this
solar charge controller here is taking
the energy the awesome photons coming
from that giant battery in the center of
our solar system
is beaming down some good juice that's
going to go into this battery so even at
night the Wi-Fi pineapple will stay
alive and yeah well we'll be good we got
our software-defined radio here and then
there we go everything is always there
at counterpoise and Wow everything's on
just an SME extension and it looks nice
and neat you know like if you are a
hiker and you run across just gonna
cross that I just be like yeah that's
nice totally I mean you know it's even
got hot flash sticker right yeah totally
normal done okay so what do you say all
we really have to do is put this in the
Sun okay point it down at the office all
right and then I believe you got some
software I do and with a yagi antenna
yes
and then we can just go and chill at the
office and have Network my god this is
amazing there buzz this guy I can
totally see and still track your place
yes well yes I think that is in fact the
mantra of the hacker
yeah pretty yes let's automate some
stuff let's create some crazy Network
stuff so that we can be lazy that's
innovation my friends well let's set it
up and go down to the office let's do
that right after this quick break
mmm you smell that the smell of a fresh
domain I love the fresh domain it's so
new and invigorating so much possibility
fire up that web server because we're
about to get creative like brand new
from the minds of the domain place where
they dig up the domains it's so great I
love getting a new domain and when I do

welcome back and we are we're doing an
entire another episode not in studio yes
this is we're kind of in student office
that's right well yes studio we're in
your office yes this is weird
it'll come in in my office this is their
goat so we are a kid in fact check this
out this is pretty crazy I've got this
guy pointed out my window yeah and you
know what's awesome about that
what there's nearly nothing in my friend
Elza - I - oh yeah so if I come down
here and actually connect like boom I'm
in my pineapple pineapple I am in you
look at that look at that uh isn't great
so we're connected to Apple just way up
there on the hill so potentially we
should be able to connect to the a DSP
tracker right and get the map in fact
that's what I've already done is here in
the pineapple web interface I've gone
ahead and already started the a DSP
tracker daemon so we can already go into
ListView and see hey got airplanes but
that's not necessarily what we mean
there is a map view but ya think there's
a cooler program in fact yeah you found
yes um I should probably also point out
that if you're going to do this you do
have to just make one little
modification to your pineapple so that
it doesn't so that your computer when
you connect to it doesn't try to make it
its default gateway so that your you can
actually stay online because I'm
actually connected I have two interfaces
I've got you know I'm using an alpha
here I connected to to the Augie and
then that's my Wi-Fi link to the
pineapple but I've also using Ethernet
to the office network here and so that
will be able to download Google Maps yes
so the quick little fix there is to just
SSH in and nan-oh your or Vai or
whatever your network and just comment
out these options under interface land
for gateway and DNS and then also do the
same thing over on DHCP and just comment
out these options here for DHCP okay
that and then your pineapple
longer be the default week gateway to
your connecting clients internet Comus
okay yes so once you've got that squared
away we can then download the program
that we found right and so you found
this really neat program virtual radar
server yeah about it
so this basically brings up a nice
little Google map that you can use to
track airplanes awesome yeah well how so
I've already got it running here walk me
through the the configuration okay so
instead of setting it up with your local
local host you know your local home
address right in fact that's what we've
been doing previously yet some of these
airplane tracking and ESP programs is
before you run the mapping application
you have to first run a daemon in the
background like what a DSP sharp yes
exactly
for instance and then that would collect
the packets from your you know real tech
dongle or whatever software-defined
radio you're using and then pipe that is
a local host as a port on localhost
online you know there's no place like
home one two seven zero zero one so in
this case what we're doing is connecting
to the Wi-Fi pineapple instead and that
is not obviously localhost so we need to
add it to this program so you download
it it's just an exe file and then you go
through all the setup leave the default
port as port 80 and then you will change
the port for your Wi-Fi pineapple when
you actually go into your tools and
options right and when you say leave the
default port is port 80 so it's actually
running as a web server on your computer
yeah so again it's opening a local port
but that's pretty cool because it's a
web app right so this is the front-end
to the web app and how do we go ahead
and add our pineapple okay so if you
want to add a new one you go to tools
and go down to options and down here
you're going to see this data sources
under there you'll see receivers you'll
see a default receiver but we want to
add a new one so you go down there and
you click new when you click on new it's
going to bring up all this generic data
so you'll change the name to your
pineapple whatever that ends up being so
if I've got like a second Wi-Fi pan at
pineapple oh I just realized what we can
add as many sources as we want
that's like a whole mesh radius yeah
camp I know we saw we can or if somebody
else on the internet like port
forwarding or set up so that we can
connect to their base station we could
network all the base stations together
all of the things yeah there's an open
directory of base stations in fact okay
cool cool okay so back to so we got the
Wi-Fi pineapple - is the name and then
you go down to okay data sources fine
connection type is fine
address yes we want to change that to
your Wi-Fi pineapples address which for
us will be one seven 2.16 dot 42.1 okay
and then see under port mm-hmm don't
change that okay um what was the reason
that we found out about that port well
it turns out in fact if I go back over
to putty I'm actually in my pineapple
we're using dump dump 1090 as the the
daemon here on the pineapple and if you
run help you'll see we issue the tak
TechNet option which enables networking
which by default enables all of these
other things like the protocol HTTP
which is local on the pineapple but it
also sets SBS and the default SBS port
for a base station or default base
station port is going to be thirty
thousand and three so we don't even have
to change that we can just leave that to
default because we come back over this
program that's exactly what it's
expecting right here thirty thousand and
three okay so and since we aren't serial
you don't have to change anything under
there so then you can go down and hit
test connection right and it should tell
you that it connected successfully Oh
fantastic yeah and then you just hit OK
and right out of your option since we
don't need a second one I'm gonna delete
that because we already have one right
here you can hit okay okay and we can
actually see it under your feed status
so it gives you the Wi-Fi pineapple it
might not be connected yet if this is
your first time putting it on the
program but up at the top on the top
corner you see a little button that says
take offline right okay so I'll take
online take online and so that online
and offline is actually the local web
app that's running on your computer
which I guess you could then like again
put forward and let other people come
and see what you're able to see I don't
you want to do is bring this online once
you have it all connected and ready to
go and then you hit that little website
the 127.0.0.1 slash virtual radar there
we go that's going to bring up the web
interface for the map oh hey look at
that
so what happens who are you should see
yeah this is perfect
so if it brings you up in the UK or
somewhere that you're not currently at
you can go up to the menu button up in
the corner and go to options there you
go and then change the current location
so say your isolate keishon use GPS
location my set current location of a
check this set current location I see I
have done just that I have point
Richmond perfect fact it's kind of right
there there we go yeah close enough
perfect right down at the bottom of the
hill oh yeah nice yeah so once that's
all set you're ready to go you can
refresh your map if you need to and then
you should start seeing airplanes as
long as everything was set up like this
guy that I'm looking at right now yeah
which is at 10,000 feet this is cool
check this out so you got a Google map
and you also get a couple of googled
pictures of the actual airplane that is
fantastic
awesome automatically does a Google
image search the tail number of the
aircraft so cool so we can see that this
is a Delta flight that's so cool hey
check it's not too hard
yeah this was always I've got even more
on our scope now who are you oh hey look
it's FedEx enough dc-10 do you see not
what is it Oh what awesome it is it's a
dc-8 well it's a column diver those
md-11 F okay but yeah it's the cool one
with the third yeah this is there's a
fun I'm gonna get so esoteric but
there's a fun story about etops and that
so the designation was that you had to
have more than two engines to be able to
like cross the Atlantic in this certain
sort of way I forget what the actual
name is but the acronym is eto PS but if
you ask any airline pilot they're gonna
tell you
engines turn or passengers swim so
anyway Donald Douglas was really cool
and just that's fitted a third engine
read on the tail wing there okay so
there you have it that is virtual radar
how to set it up with your own Wi-Fi
pineapple on a hill this is fantastic
I'm watching him go right over San
Francisco well I'm saying I love this
this was really cool I want to get it
worked yes yes I love it when things
work it was a terrible - okay with a
couple of caveats though we should
probably point out that you're going to
want to make sure that you have
permission from your friends rooftop
that you left your solar-powered
pineapple suitcase on yeah right which
of course we had now um with questions
that said you know this would work with
just about any software defined radio
not just the $20 wheel tech that can
only receive and it's only way 25 to 17
megahertz what if you could for instance
oh boy uh-huh here you guys know this is
what I'm talking about what if we could
start playing with an SDR that is
capable of doing my god that's a
brilliant idea
right right frequency range between 10
megahertz and 6 gigahertz and look what
I just got back around hacker this is
the hack all right
the Osman hacker this is the Mike Osman
how to touch it there you go you've been
blessed yeah in fact we've got it over
at the hack shop right now so that's
pretty cool it's pretty rad board it's
available for pre-order right now and
we're gonna be getting into hey come on
now stop wasn't looking at I just ate it
see did you like my little pin thing of
the hack shop right there at the end it
was a good job that's good that's good
JK shop.com is how you can directly
support the show we should also pimp our
feedback yes feedback at hak5 org if you
like what you see here yeah you don't
that's cool too hey and would you like
to come out and have brunch with us and
check out some of these awesome projects
that we're working you try their
pancakes yeah I tried the pancakes last
we're Germans they're amazing so good
well you can find information about our
monthly hacker brunch here in the San
Francisco Bay Area hak5 org slash brunch
the next one is going to be Sunday June
8th yeah that's a week before my wedding
oh wow there you go see we've got an
entire week to propose to Shannon at the
her brunch scares me back haha thanks a
lot Eric you're welcome um well you know
what you can stay in your nice air
conditioning which we don't have I'm
pretending
uh well I will be in Neah Bay Washington
soaking like nature for tour camp
awesome the dates for that are July 9th
through the 13th and I encourage
everyone to go over to tour camp touring
check it out yeah they do only do it
every other year it's the only hacker
camp that I know of at all in the United
States and just imagine camping and
hackers I mean what more do you want
right
it's a shower fun no bugs well they're
bugs I just got some off spray
apparently that stunt works pretty good
he's not listen there's chemicals I'm
gonna hit in a minute yes uh-huh thank
you so much for watching let us know in
the feedback in the comments what you
think and we will continue on next week
with Peter is back and some more drone
action yay until then i'm darren kitchen
I am Shannon Morse
trust your techno lust everybody
every burner just a technologist take a
last try to check our last I always
don't dance I don't know why were in
tents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
