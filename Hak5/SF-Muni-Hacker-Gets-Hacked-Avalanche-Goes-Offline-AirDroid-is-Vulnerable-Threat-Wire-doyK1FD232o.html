zero-day make story users not so
anonymous the SF muni hacker gets hacked
and the avalanche botnet is taken
offline coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for tuesday december 6 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
good news for our patrons over at
patreon.com / threat wire we are now
offering an exclusive patreon only audio
feed of threat wire you can copy our RSS
link it to your favorite podcasting app
to listen to our show offline now you
found the making of the show so thank
you for letting us bring you security
news every single week airs Royd is a
popular android app that lets you access
your android phone via the computer as
well as send notifications to your
desktop it's actually really cool it can
be quite handy but for the last six
months at least it's been open to code
execution attacks and data theft attacks
if the user is on an unsecured network
this flaw affects up to 50 million users
who have downloaded the app from the
Google Play Store airdroid uses a static
encryption key that's easily detectable
whenever you transmit files to and from
the phone and not all of the data
transmitted is sent over HTTPS now while
the HTTP traffic including updates for
the app itself are encrypted with DES
the encryption key is hard-coded so if
an attacker is on the same network they
can get full control of the phone and
view your imei imsi and other data
information now while researchers at
simpy reham disclosed the vulnerability
to AirDroid in May airdroid developers
have released two updates since then
neither of which have fixed the problem
airdrop CMO wrote that an update is
coming in two weeks to fix the problem
and until then it is advised to only use
AirDroid on trusted networks and updated
as soon as new releases are available
but again over only trusted networks use
tor or Firefox be careful because a
zero-day has been found in the while
being used to D anonymize people using
tor tor has since updated their browser
but tour also wrote in a blog post
that the security flaw responsible for
this urgent release is already actively
exploited on Windows systems even though
there is currently to the best of our
knowledge no similar exploits for OS 10
or linux users available the underlying
bug affects those platforms as well the
same vulnerability was also found in
Firefox and patched immediately this
flaw uses code hidden in JavaScript to
send the target IP and mac address to
the attacker and it's eerily similar to
the FBI execution attacks ran in 2013 to
identify tor users trading child porn
the vulnerability has been a part of
browser code for at least five years for
those using tor and Firefox update your
browsers ASAP and steer clear of running
JavaScript on any sites not deemed
necessary or just don't run it at all
right after thanksgiving holiday in the
u.s. a ransomware attack was thrown at
San Francisco's municipal railway
commonly referred to as Muni which
closed down payment systems and froze
screens on a message displaying you
hacked all data encrypted with hackers
asking for seventy three thousand
dollars in Bitcoin to be sent to a
Russian web service email address
according to SFMTA the local
transportation agency all operations
were restored to normal by Sunday and no
data was accessed from the server's over
the weekend users of muni receive free
rides while the payment kiosks and the
gates were offline according to ARS
technica the attacker gained access
through an oracle weblogic server
vulnerability and the muny hack is not
the first of its kind in an update by
krebs on security the hacker seems to
have also gotten hacked a security
researcher breached the attackers email
account by guessing the secret question
answer and discovered that the attacker
had extorted bitcoins from many other
victims at least 140 thousand dollars
USD worth they also discovered the
possibility of the attacker being from
Iran not Russia based on geolocation
data SFMTA is working with authorities
to find the culprit and muni services
are working without issue again thanks
to backups but this could be a sign of
much worse to come with the hacking of
public infrastructure Europol along with
several other agencies have taken down a
huge botnet called avalanche
has been in operation since at least
2009 in a coordinated effort across five
different countries with arrests and
searches Avalanche has been used for
phishing attacks and at least 17
different types of malware but more than
50 servers for the botnet were taken
offline by the sting over 800,000
domains were seized sink hold or blocked
in this operation wow that's a lot of
domains thank you again for being
