have a problem here at the hak5
warehouse we are this close to being out
of coffee I'm trying to ration the last
bit here it's not looking good it just
got worse the moment I said that Sarah
walked in with a bag of beans we don't
have a coffee grinder I don't know
anything about making coffee but i'm
getting off buying expensive starbucks
and that's important and my office is
coming together slowly so this morning I
checked twitter as i do and i have a
feed for Wi-Fi pineapple because i
always like to see what kind of
interesting creative stuff people are
doing with it there's always people
making youtube videos of stuff that I
never envisioned it's kind of awesome
and every now and then you see some
really weird ones and saying today was
that case you have your usual assortment
of crazy emoji which means girls are
getting very excited about something
let's see what oh hey that's a cute
t-shirt and so it turns out that the
tweet is from this big youtuber named
Meg who I know nothing about but I guess
she has pineapple t-shirts with Wi-Fi
sunglasses which is kind of cool but
this is the thing that I don't get and
it's what makes me feel like I really
suck at social media I don't think I've
ever done one of those self-aggrandizing
tweet at me hashtag retweet this follow
me subscribe and i'll give you an iphone
thing and i feel like it's a bit
pedantic and I kind of refuse just like
I refuse to do jump cuts and it's one of
those things that makes me feel a little
disconnected from this community but
it's one of those things where I just I
don't know maybe it's because I feel
like I'm an introvert at heart and so I
never actually expected any of this to
be successful and yet at the same time
since it is there's this expectation of
society for me to be some sort of public
figure who's constantly tweeting about
what I had for breakfast and I don't do
that so now I feel depressed because I'm
like oh no I'm sucking at the thing that
I'm supposed to be doing when really I'm
just trying to get out hun Apatosaurus
agrees a part of that makes me think
that maybe maybe the reason why I
disdained this is because it's the
complete opposite of what has gotten me
to where I am now and whatever realm of
success in
were you quantify it and I think that
like the key is and people are always
like oh it's you what's your trick and
I'm like well I don't try right and to
the point where I have tried to clarify
that in different ways by saying like oh
well I'm I'm just I keep my sales open
for when the wind blows I'm I'm open to
opportunity but really what it means is
I'm just trying to keep the boat pointed
in the right direction and I'm not
really paddling I'm just kind of waiting
I don't know how to really describe it
other than to say like I don't try and I
think what I mean when I say that is
like I don't like actively a
self-aggrandizing that's why I'm even
having trouble with these videos and
everything else but you know that is the
internal conflict of me but but
otherwise it's just like yes the success
is the authentic City authenticity and
the authenticity is not doing iphone
giveaways not like you know good more
power to you meg but I just I can't get
behind it and then so it made me think
though about that quote w and I really
liked from that video game that would
play on Super Nintendo and it was like
when you died and you needed to continue
and then Yoda would show up and it would
be like do or do not there is no try and
um there's a really bad Yoda but maybe
maybe that's what you de menthe you know
don't try just do it and I feel like a
doer or a dozer cuz it do things I don't
don't do things i do do do things and
that's what makes the things happen so
if I try and it's not real I don't know
by the way we're having a big hak5 Barry
a hacker bronze with the bro brunch
brunch thing and a warehouse warming
party which means everybody can come and
see Tampa queer house which is over here
and I really wish you could be here so
hacked I've got org slash brunch for
everyone else and until then I hope you
will and i miss you cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
