this Metasploit minute is brought to you
by hack five and viewers like you
support us directly at h a k shop calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me mix today
we're going to be going over modules for
MSF counselor Metasploit in general
we're gonna go over exploit modules
auxilary modules and post modules so
first off we're going to go into exploit
modules now exploit modules we've
already used them a little bit you do
use exploit hit tab a few times and
there's 1200 of these so I'm not gonna
list them all now let's do it let's
listen and then done there's a ton of
modules in there that you can use and
we've already gone over the Windows ones
there's eight hundred and sixty-four
Windows ones SMB and there's those first
and B so you know how to use this module
and you know how to look around in it
you know how to search for it but we
really haven't covered anything outside
of exploit modules so we're gonna we're
gonna spend some time in auxilary
modules post modules and and touch
really quickly on payload modules so
first off use auxilary now there's six
hundred and ninety three of these
currently but i want to make a little
bit certain on show you or i want to
make it clear on what some of these are
auxiliary modules are basically anything
that don't fit in the other categories
like admin and the directory there it
means that it's administrative so for an
example of that let's just show you the
auxilary admin ms sequel mmm a sequel
exec so we admin mssql ms SQL exec
show options there and we see that
basically all this does is takes a
username and password for MS a sequel
box and issues a command actually runs
xp command shell which is a functions
inside of ms SQL that's been disabled
for a while but this execute that if
it's available and you even tries to
re-enable it if possible if you can log
in as as a system administrator at RSA
so you'll see that this is our host
right here now that our host is the
remote host that we want to use but if
you're using a scanner module so
auxilary scanner and there's 369 of
these scanner HTTP HTTP version so
showing the version all this does this
shows the the server version if it
responds back as a server so let's just
for fun we're gonna go hack the Google
as I see Darren cringing in the corner
so our hosts is dub dub dub Google comm
we're gonna run it and basically what
this says is say it comes back and says
these IPS came back with GWS as the
server so if you ever if you ever look
at the HTTP headers that go back and
forth when you're surfing a website this
all this does is pulls that site back
and says in the server header
it says GWS and notice that we set our
hosts the cool thing about our hosts
when you see that is the scanner module
is that you can use a lot of different
formats if I set our host to 70 4.1 25.2
39.0 slash 24 that would work and that
would run against all those hosts I can
also do 1 - 15 or 45 and then I can
comma or I'm sorry space and then 192
168 0.1 and that's valid our hosts as
well so you can do a lot of different
formats including
file colon forward slash whatever so if
I have a file in temp slash hosts I
don't actually have that file I can use
that as well as a host and it's
basically a line separated file so you
have one on two and six eight 1.1 well
not two one two three and then maybe an
exclusion list that removes some of
those and says I only want these and it
will hit every single one of those files
so that's one of the cool things about
auxiliary modules is that it does have a
scanner type so outside of that and I
and I encourage you to look through all
the auxiliary modules because there's a
ton there's a bunch that do all these
amazing things outside of the exploit
modules I mean let's let me show you
just a scanner HTTP there are 146 146
different auxilary modules just for HTTP
traffic so let's say you know the other
type in auxilary is server so server has
a bunch of different things as well so
one of the cool things is the capture
module so I can say capture SMB now what
I can do is essentially running oops so
right now I think that's a little bit
broken for some reason but what I can
what I can do is I can run a a Samba
server or SMB server or sifts server and
then whenever someone tries to connect
to me with any share that they want it
will then capture the login credentials
and passwords that they're trying in the
ntlm v1 or v2 method which is not
straight it's not straight hashing but
you'll get the gist once we get further
down the line on other segments and
we'll explain some of those let's just
use aux server let's get some kind of
caPSURE HTTP basic so let's get one demo
done okay so if I go to this URL it
asked me for a username and password it
says secure site I'm gonna add obviously
I'm logging in as admin and then this
this is my secure password hit OK and it
says not found Apache server two point
two point nine so obviously I'm not
actually running an Apache server when
we go back and you can't see that very
well but you can see hey credential
collected admin this is my secure
password cool stuff so if you want to
prank your friends or whatever set up an
HTTP server have them log into it and
there you go you can set up anything you
want you can even set change so let's go
back real quick and actually show you I
can edit this module surfing down shows
what it sends back let's see do to do to
do there's response where does it get
response from before one authorized I
don't know why it's not where it pulls
the password from or the the server
stuff though but you should be able to
set the HTML that it shows up after it
logs in you can iframe it or whatever
you want to get back to it this so let's
quit out of that let's go to post
modules now post modules oops use posts
post modules are a little different from
auxilary or exploit because they run
post exploitation so post exploitation
is once you have a session of any type a
PHP interpreter or Windows meterpreter a
command shell if you just have a command
shell so it can run these things so post
let's see Windows post windows gather
check VM what this post module will do
is simply check to see if you know a
machine that you're on is a virtual
machine I mean there's a ton in there
one one of my favorites is the ARP
scanner so
once you're actually exploited in
machine and will definitely go into this
in other segments on on exploiting its
host and pivoting around and stuff like
that but if you're on an honest system
on a Windows system you can actually do
an ARP scan directly from that exploited
host so victim 1 you can do the ARP scan
from and see what hosts are around it
and it's a lot less loud I guess a lot
less chatty than doing a full TCP scan
or a ping sweep or scan like that and
there's tons in there you I you should
definitely look around on that one of
another one of my favorites I don't know
if you can see this well or not but is
the WLAN profile if you didn't know
already windows 7or whist this stand
above saves your password in clear text
on on your for your wireless
configuration so if you go to 17
different places or you have your
configuration for your windows for your
house and then work and then your mom's
house all of those passwords for your
wireless configs are stored in clear
text in your system so if someone gets
on the system they can then just run
this one module and get it will
definitely show that in an upcoming
episode because that's one of my
favorites and then finally is the
payloads so use payload windows
interpreter reverse TCP now this is this
is a module type that people really
aren't as familiar with using just
because you can use MSF payload MSF
encode in a MSM venom to create these
payloads on the command line but I like
to do it inside of inside of Metasploit
simply because now I can actually see
what options it needs and set those
options save those options and actually
do generate - Aitch and see what other
things that I can do on this thing it's
a easier way of getting into the payload
generation and getting you know
executables and and the cool thing is
you can actually see that this thing
supports a ton of different ways of
exploiting your show code into a CC
sharp
perl powershell tons of different things
so what do you think hit me up at MSF at
hack 5 org stay tuned the Metasploit
minute
for more shows like these thank you
again for supporting the show if you
want to support us even further you can
go to hae shop comm and enter the code
move x4 stickers like these and until
next time move Excel we hack it until
the cows come home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
