welcome to menace wait a minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob Fleur but you can call me movies
today we're gonna be talking about a
pretty simple command we already went
over sleep in last episode we're gonna
go over another one that I like get
proxy now it is we aren't going into
very simple singular command but I want
to talk about this one a little bit
better and then just saying it does what
it says it does on the tin so let's get
into our session sessions - I won I
think I have maybe - okay cool all right
get proxy all right it tells us a lot of
information now the proxy configuration
sign inside of an enterprise is it
really important
the auto-detect one it said with it
saying yes that means that my current
user it has the ability to do auto
detection of proxy settings what does
this tell me that means that W Pat
attacks will work and if you don't know
what W Pat attacks are I think we've
already gone over this but we haven't we
definitely need to do an episode on it
so email us MSF at hacked by hack 5 org
and let us know that we haven't done one
yet and we will get one in in the queue
so the auto detect proxy stuff is great
for attacking stuff if you haven't heard
about the potato attack yeah it's kind
of weird name but look over it
flock foxglove security calm they have a
cool attack on it that they talked about
at shmoocon this year all right Auto
configure RL this is another important
one if we download this pack file from
the internal web server internal server
and look at it it can sometimes give us
information about the really cool things
that are inside of an organization so do
they have certain servers that don't
want to proxy stuff - do they have
certain config
raishin that they want to go out this
way instead of that or iPS instead of
different look into how w pad files and
pack files are created and you'll start
to see how this it can be very useful
all right the next is the proxy URL this
is when things are specifically set up
for that specific URL or or HTTP so if
it's going over this proxy now that we
know that there's a proxy involved we
know one important feature system the
system user doesn't normally have proxy
settings so if we migrated into a system
process and we lose our shell guess what
that's our own fault for not doing this
we didn't know that system didn't have
proxy settings now we do so we're not
going to migrate into any processes that
is not going to have a proxy setting
then the bypass one just like that pack
file this can tell us more information
about that network we can see that the
Tenten network the 172 16 network and
this server 101 doesn't want doesn't set
up isn't set up for proxies or for your
community I am horrible like not typing
we are talking about typing I'm horrible
at speaking now awesome server 101 can't
actually go through a proxy so this is
how this is set up maybe they were
having issues or whatever just one
command can tell you a ton about what
this corporate network looks like with
with not nothing more than one single
command going through and I'm rambling
so we're gonna end this before I ramble
any further by saying tell us more about
how I'm horrible at rambling MSF at hack
