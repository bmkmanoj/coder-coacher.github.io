like Windows 10 does weaponized drones
are now legal in the US of A and agoura
the site for selling narcotics takes a
vacation all that coming up now on
threat wire hello world I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
September second 2015 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom it is time for the news
so let's get right into it so it seems
that Windows 10 isn't the only operating
system that has been scrutinized
recently for their privacy concerns well
it turns out windows 7 and 8 have both
had recent non security updates from
Microsoft that creates services for
phoning home any issues to Microsoft the
for updates labeled kb 30 6870 8 30 2 2
3 4 5 30 75 249 and 308 0149 all have to
do with a new service called diagnostics
and telemetry tracking these increase
the amount of diagnostic data that is
collected and even enabled third-party
app devs to receive performance
Diagnostics about the applications they
are building now it all sounds fair and
good but it is useful for companies to
know what kind of failure rate they may
experience on certain types of hardware
so you know that's cool but the problem
is that the data being sent is not
completely clear and it isn't easily
controlled by the user let alone even
turned off the diagnostic data for
Microsoft is sent via HTTPS and is
encrypted so it's not an issue of
transit but what is being transmitted
and how our user can control it to
remove the updates you have to have the
ability to go into your control panel
which you can view installed updates and
click remove and choose hide update any
time windows update alerts you of a new
one being available in an interesting
turn of events a bill in North Dakota
that was supposed to require police to
get a search warrant to use a drone to
look for criminal evidence has now
turned non-lethal representative Rick
Becker introduced the bill about drones
titled house bill 1328 and specifically
stated banning all weapons on police
drones when used for criminal activity
or searching for criminal activity but
before the bill could pass the State
House
committee allowed a lobbyist named Bruce
Berkut of the North Dakota Peace
Officers Association basically in other
words he was repping law enforcement to
change it to allow non-lethal weapons so
that includes rubber bullets tear gas
pepper spray sound cannons and get this
tasers yes tasers which have been
controversially a part of hundreds of
deaths in the u.s. in the past decade
North Dakota police departments have
been using drones for past several years
so it's no wonder that they were against
this legislation it also turns out that
there is a pretty decent economy in the
drone industry in North Dakota with
advertisements displayed during sports
games of all places in the state and the
local university offering a degree get
this in droves now with drones being as
controversial as they are now I'm
curious how the US public will see them
now that one's flying over North Dakota
can be weaponized with non-lethal
weapons oh and by the way everybody a
Global Hawk drone is not the same thing
as a DJI phantom quadricopter let's
let's just get that straight k and
lastly from the dark web site of the
Internet's a large network used as a
narcotics black market is going offline
for some time to implement software
updates the marketplace named agoura has
admins who have detected suspicious
activity on their servers which they
think is trying to break the anonymity
of tour that means that law enforcement
agencies could potentially find their
server IP address track down admins and
also find out about the buyers and
sellers agura's hiatus does not
currently have an end date at this time
the site became very popular one of the
most popular on the dark web and
researchers suggest that customers will
just move to another network during the
downtime to find their product the tour
vulnerability should come as a very
harsh reality for many of these site
admins and their customers now we love
featuring your comments so if you have a
thought on today's stories leave me a
note below so here's a question for you
what are your thoughts on drones over
the u.s. having non-lethal weapons to
catch criminals what makes it so
different from Middle Eastern countries
that have lethal weapons currently
flying overhead yes death machines
