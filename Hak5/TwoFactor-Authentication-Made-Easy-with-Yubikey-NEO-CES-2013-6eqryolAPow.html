go further hey I'm mixing pixel here for
hack five at showstoppers 2013 at CES
with the founder and CEO of yubico to
talk about this little itty bitty device
that looks like a USB Drive but it's not
exactly what what are we talking about
here when when we see this little
Yubikey this is a secure login token for
providing strong two-factor
authentication we all know that
passwords are no longer secure and this
one generates a one-time password so
every time you log in with this you
generate a code that no one can hack
because you can only be used once and
and how long is this this is not
something that I could memorize myself
which is why this guy is in place now is
a 44 charter encrypted code that has
really can't use it outside the system
so can we see how it works real quick
yeah so it has both a USB connection and
an NFC and this is the u bikini oh that
has NFC you tap it on the back on the
phone and the phone then opens an
application in this case is the LastPass
password manager which will allow you to
log in securely to your entire internet
in a single touch so it sends the
identity in a one-time passcode through
the end of center phase you can also use
it with the USB port for a computer to
log in to you know on a Mac or a PC or a
tablet and then the jibbety neo has been
developed with leading cloud services
unfortunately I cannot disclose the
names yet but they came with the
requirements they said they love the
Yubikey
but in order to have this to scale to
billions of users you don't want one
database to be hacked like happened to
RSA you know one time password
technologies are today dependent on one
server they can be hacked so we've
developed in the G bikini oh there's
drink encryption it means that they're
you not dependent on one single database
for the encryption keys and you can
develop a really secure solution that
can scale to a lot of users and without
the risk of being hacked now is it
different every single time just like
I'm a late I'm al a woman if you will is
it different every single time when you
when you swipe it or how does that
exactly work like just walk me through
it if you will so every time I tap it to
my phone it generates a one-time
passcode and every time I put on to you
I put it in my computer it generates a
one-time passcode so yes it's different
every time
but I don't have to remember anything I
don't do anything and that's the beauty
of it yes so now what exactly what
services can we expect to be available
for that I saw Gmail I think and
combined it with a password manager you
can use it with any service that has a
user name password today there are also
we provide an open source open source
components so you can use it to use it
with WordPress or Drupal or the range
your open source software you can also
use it for your VPN we have software for
that and so I think I saw it in use on
one of the ER you have a tablet you have
a notebook a MacBook Air so you can use
all that stuff the vision and the goal
for yubico is to have your Yubikey to
work to login to any services I envision
this to be to be offered on 7-eleven or
Safeway like a prepaid phone card if you
go and buy it and you tie it up to the
range of services and we're working on
that so it's going to happen for all
things CES tune into revision three.com
thanks a lot
four months offer you the extra peace of
mind every second you're on the road so
they integrated 9-1-1 assist with GPS
through sync if the airbags deploy or
the fuel pump shut off is activated
9-1-1 assist will help connect your
supported mobile phone to a 911 operator
it also gives emergency responders your
exact location thanks again to ford for
powering this hack five CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
