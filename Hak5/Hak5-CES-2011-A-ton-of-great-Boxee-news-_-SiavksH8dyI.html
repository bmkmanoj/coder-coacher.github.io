by dice com the career hub for tech for
hack 5 i'm dr in kitchen here at CES
2011 checking out our favorite media
distribution box you know what it is
it's boxy and it's andrew kipping what's
up Andrew hey how you doing Darren hey
everybody I'm having a great time you
guys know that we are a huge fan of boxy
what's new this year okay so i have to
like count it out because there are so
many new things ok so i omega TV with
boxxy a brand-new nass device that has
boxy embedded i will come back to that
wealth ok 46 inch viewsonic TV like full
screen TV with boxing about it yeah
watch out google mm-hmm we have a new
ipad app that's going to let you watch
where your friends are sharing watch
your featured items watch your watch
later items and play files from your
computer on your iPad as well as sling
it to a boxy device on your TV I will
drink to that what else last but not
least two big content announcements so
first is CBS whoa dude that's kind of
big I mean CBS isn't really team is
isn't even on hulu yeah we are super
stoked about this partnership so we're
going to be able to sell CBS content on
the platform later this year and then in
addition budu which is an amazing on
demand yeah wait I thought video is a
competitor no no no voodoo is an
ingredient in in boxee so we have a blue
to app that lets you get voodoo movies
and they just made a big 3d announcement
so now if you get a boxy device you've
got 3d movies at the palm at the you
know clickable just sprinkled voodoo
sauce all over it sweet so those are the
big announces right now tell me what
this harder because this is wicked it
looks a lot more spouse friendly than
the previous boxee box so tell me about
what the thinking was in this so this is
you know the boxee box was really our
baby we kind of had a hand in pretty
much every aspect of it this is the
first device that we kind of turned it
over and license the software and let i
omega kind of do whatever they wanted
with
the hardware so they've done a great job
of integrating you know kind of a more
traditional box like look they call it a
pizza box yeah so this one will stack
it'll fit in AV racks all the people who
hate it on the boxee box for its shape
can now buy this so for all the geeks at
home it's one are you one are you I
don't I don't know what that is you know
like servers are like one you to you
yeah yeah okay so the new device has
this this remote which is interesting so
you still get the same you know cordia
on the back and symbol on the front but
you've got volume up volume down and
mute you've got a dedicated search
button which is kind of RAD and then
this is actually also a trackpad so
instead of having to use the d-pad and
move up and down them out on the mouse
cursor you can just slide around like
that so is this out right now when's
this coming what's what to deal with
that this one's going to be out later
this year closer to the middle of the
year if you want it without a disk it's
229 you got a one terabyte disk for 299
and a two terabyte disk in it for 349
excellent also going to have some cool
stuff for my omega that's you know
lifeline software being able to store
data in the cloud have backup stuff so
it'll be it'll be the NASA vice with
boxxy on it epic and of course you guys
have like now the file sharing thing so
you could like get your videos from your
desktop or wherever they may be and then
now with the ipad app and got to check
it out that looks wicked it's a really
fun little ipad app but okay what but I
gotta ask when are we going to see the
Android app right you know what we only
have so many people know you need to
hire some more engineers get the android
app come on this is true this is true no
we definitely have plans for android we
want to do an official android phone app
want to do an official android tablet
app because you know all these guys are
coming out with android tablets and I
think you know they're going to do
really well yeah yeah but we actually we
had somebody that we went to immediately
for this who we knew would do a killer
job on it for the ipad
and he's nailed it yeah that's really
slick is that so what is the ipad app
Kostya it's free Oh epic and what's the
price point on the new iomega so the 229
