shouldn't have in your entire company's
network gets owned yeah that's right
threat wire is back hi i'm darren
kitchen and this is threat wire your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and this
begins the first episode after being on
hiatus through more than a year and we
are so excited to be kicking it off
right with the full cast of contributors
so we're gonna start it off right now
with our good friend snubz over 25
thousand iOS and OS 10 apps may be
vulnerable to SSL snooping attacks as
reported on friday by source DNA the AF
networking library a popular networking
framework was audited to reveal that any
attacker with a valid ssl certificate
could intercept would be secure internet
traffic from the affected apps the bug
essentially comes down to domain name
validation something that was turned off
by default in AF networking this means
that if an app wanted to make a secure
connection to say https example.com i as
an attacker could give it the valid ssl
certificate for https hack v org in af
networking wouldnt care that the domain
names don't match this is hot off the
heels of a report last week that the
framework would have set self-signed
certificates this means that an attacker
wouldn't even have needed to spend the
$50 on a valid certificate to intercept
secure traffic unlike web apps where you
can check the address bar in your
browser for the https and inspect the
certificate smartphone apps don't have
any standardized way for users to check
the security source DNA does maintain an
iOS security report where you can look
up a developer's itunes account and see
if their app is affected for example the
microsoft health app which until
recently was affected by this bug over
the weekend Tesla Motors got triple
hacked
now it's both the company's Twitter
account CEO Elon Musk personal Twitter
account and the Tesla Motors dot-com
homepage were hijacked the Tesla Twitter
account was renamed to hashtag our IPPR
gang and tweeted get a free Tesla call
and the phone number that phone number
was that of Route works a
self-proclaimed Linux guy and IT worker
root has since posted what amounts to
hacker group squabbles including claims
that the perpetrator was a young Finnish
hacker he had previously blogged about
hacking at ec-council
the certified ethical hacker program so
far the Fiasco has culminated in
threatening phone calls and visits quote
some Nimrod actually showed up to my
house today to claim a free car dude
that sucks in good luck straightening it
out with the FBI at the time of
recording there has been no official
response from Tesla Motors who is
probably busy with their upcoming home
battery announcement contributions from
the community this week include an Irish
Times story submitted by remi ram on
google+ on the user mistakes that aid in
cyber attacks ok so we get it companies
get hacked all the time that's just a
fact of life and this is not going to be
a roundup of who's got egg on their face
this week I mean that's just karma
gunnin for its Dogma what I mean though
is the old Tesla I know it hurts to get
owned but we're all anxiously awaiting
the debrief the internet love is look
good whodunit so try to keep it classy
with some charts and graphs either way
when this does in evitable II happen
many corporations are quick to point out
the sophistication of the attackers and
sort of a PR move to save face and
oftentimes you see the apt acronym for
advanced persistent threat thrown around
and these days you can pretty much just
say nation-state actor if you want to
blame it on North Korea but the fact of
the matter is that often times it's far
less advanced than you might think at
least getting in the front door because
that's all it takes with a well-crafted
email and this is most evident in a
recent data breach investigation report
from Verizon Communications
now Verizon has been maintaining this
report for 10 years now with data from
70 contributors with nearly 80,000
incidents so I'd say they've got a
pretty good idea of the trends of
cyberattacks and one of the interesting
findings over the last five years is
that phishing is on the rise and there's
probably a good reason for it well
security software vendors would love to
have you guys think that attackers
always get in through unpatched software
vulnerabilities the same software of
course that they can sell you a solution
for the fact of the matter is that it's
much easier to compromise the weakest
link as humans that's right phishing
attacks exploit this and unfortunately
there isn't a patch for human ignorance
of the 290 electronic espionage cases in
the report more than two-thirds involved
phishing emails even our very own
penetration tester buddy moobus on that
display
agrees that it is a very effective
tactic because it only takes one
employee to get owned before you can
start breaching out through the rest of
the network
so I don't know if it's an effectiveness
of fishing that's like a sign of
Internet literacy or generational thing
that'll eventually phase out but I
highly encourage everybody to take at
least a few fishing quizzes there are
some in the links in the descriptions
and if anybody's counting on the 13 and
14 on the OpenDNS quiz and a 90% on the
Cathy quiz feel free to share your
scores in the comments and that brings
me to speak of comments which is let us
know about your thoughts leave us a
comment the most thoughtful and
insightful ones will be featured here
also first no need to do that now now
before we go I do want to give a huge
thanks to everyone who has supported the
show throughout our hiatus your
contributions or shares your likes that
is what's bringing this back and of
course we can't do it without you so
please if you can spare a few cents an
episode consider becoming a patron at
patreon.com slash threat wire and we're
keeping threat wire completely
independent so no ads no networks so
this is your show it's truly in your
hands and you can find all of the
episodes and links to our social
networks and all the other ways to
contribute over at threat wired dotnet
with that I'm Darrin kitchen I'll see
you on the Internet
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
