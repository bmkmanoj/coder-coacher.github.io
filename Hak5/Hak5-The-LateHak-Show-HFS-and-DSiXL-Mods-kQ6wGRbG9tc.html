the i3 detroit hackerspace I've got the
easiest way to transfer files over HTTP
and Jen cutter joins us with a little
nintendo dsi XL hacking now really this
time I'm Shannon Morse you're watching
hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com go
to assist express try go to assist
express free for 30 days at go to assist
calm / hak5 and verizon droid apps
border control I have an excellent shop
you guys met of course this is the late
hack show with act 5 I know that you may
have been confused by your RSS download
but this is the show tonight and boy do
we have a good one for you probably some
other hacks and other stuff that I
really haven't figured out but its
production issue worry about that later
but let me tell you by about the week
because as you know this is week three
of hack across America I'm here another
none other than the 313 I'm in Detroit
ladies down with detroit could be here
thank you now a little difficult getting
here as you guys know a fan in Toronto
for quite a while difficult living that
city absolutely beautiful love that
place just got into town and a little
problem on the 401 West decided that it
would be a good idea to stop up services
and leave my wallet on my tank bag and
then drive off and then I'm writing down
the road and have a good time it's me
and monkey and then I realize that that
that there's a guy pulling up next to me
going like I'm like a monkey it's cool
let's go oh no oh I probably forgot
something so I pull over and and I'm
checking the monkey you know my monkeys
all good it's an important thing to
check on the side of the road and so
we're my luggage so I figure I'm fine
I'm about to leave until some awesome
French Canadians I get it say thank you
so much to Leo that was amazing for you
guys to stop and say to your walls like
150 meters that way and long story short
and go out there and oh my gosh is gone
no worries but I got half of my credit
cards and gonna have to check this out
on the b-roll sixty percent of my
driver's license and for some reason
they actually let me into the country
with this so thank you border guards of
course they didn't check my monkey and
we did they were on the way into Canada
just don't declare anything as you guys
know the monk is a very important
pivotal piece of equipment on this trip
is e does hide the
the fifth of Jack just in case I learned
that on a trip to Delaware and found out
very quickly what a dry county is so we
have a great show for you guys here in
the 313 I'm checking out some of the
latest from g on this is the new Hummer
with the nerf action wielding that
machine gun very very cool and we have
Nick brisky from I three Detroit I'm
sorry that's Brits key and I'm now
firing my my teleprompter guy and yes so
stick around for more from I three
Detroit but first let's go ahead and
hand it over to Shannon for this
this week's trivia is with a North
American release of March 28 2010 the
nintendo dsi XL features a ninety-three
percent larger screen and what percent
higher screen resolution enter for your
chance to win this premium deluxe
edition authentic animated gift
recreation or some killer brand new hack
five stickers condom your choice we'll
be right back after a brief word from
our sponsor today I'm registering the
Nomad monkey calm and setting up a blog
to highlight the adventures of this plus
primate as I motorcycle across North
America and as you know I am a big fan
of domain coms low prices and quality
service they really are the easy and
affordable way to get your site online
so with my site registered and deluxe
hosting plans set up I've head over to
the hosting control panel under the my
services tab here I find the application
vault where I can get one click installs
of popular open-source software there's
plenty of available from blogging to
collaboration galleries and e-commerce
wiki's and more I'm fond of WordPress so
I'll select it and click install then
choose the domain and select my options
like to install URL and password next
finish and there you go my blogs online
and any application vaults off work not
only be installed but also upgraded in a
similar fashion taking the headache out
of platform management and best of all
you can experience the fast dns and
solid hosting of domain com while
getting fifteen percent off at checkout
when you use coupon code hak5 got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com
hey hey you doing today alrighty i'm
having some of they tried this this is
the living room yeah crews gonna have
that so is it true that Detroit is the
only place where you're going to find a
parking lot that actually needs to be
mowed oh you know and what is it Warren
County is that the one that I pastor
Wayne Wayne Wayne beyond you know I
cannot move you know and I should've
been looking for this sign let me
blowing pull up guys can we both the pic
thank you yes this is actually the
county that I just drove through and if
you scroll down here it is an automation
a Lee County welcome to Detroit we hope
you survive alright well on that now
let's go ahead and introduce our first
guest it is Nick risky
okay this is phenomenal thank you very
much appreciate you coming out yeah well
no I appreciate you building a beautiful
set for me I was not expecting this when
it came down to I three Detroit no
thanks I mean we've been working on this
for probably about three weeks now and
it's it really shows really cuz it looks
like you maybe spend a half hour yeah
all right yeah we did yeah that's okay
not against you should is in the first
act five sec usually just threw a
king-sized a red bed sheet on a wall
through a poster and set it aside we'll
see we're supporting breast cancer
awareness week so that's what we got the
pink going and I'm a fan of breasts
there you go there you go right so I
three Detroit how long have you guys
been doing this here so I three Detroit
is why we've only had a physical space
since October first this is actually our
second space we outgrew that one we're
on 8,000 square feet right now whoa yeah
I think we're one of the biggest I mean
yeah we're not the biggest but we wanted
big yeah you could fit like five and a
half hack houses in that and we had four
people living there full time producing
a show well you know what the invitation
is open the imitator all right yeah as
long as you keep this up this is awesome
now I gotta ask though because I am a
little bit new to this whole new
phenomenon of hacker spaces and and I'll
have you explain that a sack boat house
I'm used to 2600 meetups DEFCON chapters
PLA if you really want to go old school
how does this differ from something like
that same consum just imagine that as
opposed to those guys meeting for a
weekend or a couple days or even a
couple hours you know we're open 24 7
365 days a week you know I three Detroit
you get your key card you come in
whenever you want midnight 2 a.m. you
know five o'clock but yeah I guess
you're welcome to so really you come in
whenever you want you build whatever you
want and it's just open to the general
public it's great that is epic now this
this seems like a new phenomenon is this
a me how long has this been going on
because it seems like lately I'm hearing
more and more about hacker spaces
springing up here and there you know in
the u.s. it's about like 2008 is when it
started but really in Europe it's been
going on for years like 10 plus years I
mean they figured this stuff out a long
time ago yeah well you know they've also
been a lot
things a lot longer than nothing yet you
know so what constitutes a hackerspace
what's the typical thing that you'll
find so really a cur space is any
gathering of people you know mostly in
some sort of physical space they're
getting together their hack and stuff
they're working on coding they're
working on physical things and you know
I threes a little bit different word we
just have you know so much more space
and we're able to focus on a lot more
disciplines we're at some places you
know they focus on coding they focus on
physical things they focus on cooking I
mean it just depends on the space you're
at right but the difference is it's a
place that's not your apartment your
house exactly really your house you got
it you can share your tools you can
share resources and you're not letting
the wife of the girlfriend you still can
viewing that it certainly is because
there are plenty of chicks here already
absolutely yeah so what makes I'd three
unique or actually before we what is I
three stand for come on that's got a
same for something now I three Detroit
its innovation inspire and imagine and
you know again we're started like last
April we've barely been around for a
year and we've already attracted you
know 36 members so so what makes I three
unique though you guys are downtown
Detroit I'm sure there's lots of things
at your disposal and sir and you know
what Detroit's obviously headed
struggles and you know we're not like
right right downtown Detroit but kind of
our hope is to slowly move down there
we're right outside of eight mile and
basically what we want to do is kind of
do our part you got to make Detroit a
little bit cooler a little bit hipper
because people are leaving there's not a
lot of stuff to do in Detroit we want to
be one of those things to do in Detroit
that's cool and fun so what kind of cool
stuff would you if you're into making
stuff what what kind of stuff could you
make here I mean I know that you guys
have like different like lab setup it's
it's very like walking into a an ad hoc
community college where there aren't
very many roles or i'm sure you guys do
have rules there's a couple rules yeah I
mean we think of ourselves as like the
community center of the future and the
goal is to be able to build whatever you
want so like I mean we have all sorts of
little pods we have a full kitchen we
have a chem lab electronics crafting
metal shop woodworking you're in our
film studio right now we have a robotic
setup we have meeting space which we
actually found out as opposed to doing a
treehouse which we were planning it
might actually become an 80 80 now so uh
yeah we're looking at this year's right
here like an 80 80 is an 88
ya like like semis full size like like
Lucas isn't gonna have a problem with
this thing you know we're will hopefully
get them sponsor okay that would be epic
yeah oh you guys do a great job in time
thank you you know the podcast you do
you have like you know better lighting
than then hack fives ever had in any of
our sets this is you know it's all about
Craig's craigslist you can find anything
on there if you just look a little bit
well that is so true so how does
somebody get involved in something like
this you just show up or what you check
out the website let's say you're not in
Detroit I would go check out
hackerspaces org there you can find a
hacker spaces all over the US at one
point I think there were 200 last we
checked mitch albom from noisebridge
said there's like 400 now yeah so I'm
you know go find your local one if
you're in Detroit check us out at i3
detroit com follow us on twitter you
know contacted i3 detroit com I mean
find your local hackerspace get involved
yeah and you guys are also involved with
local community absolutely so we have a
FIRST robotics program that we're
working on having a whole year program
Boy Scouts Girl Scouts penguicon which
is a local convention we're also
involved with Maker Faire and maker
faire is going to be huge it's normally
in San Francisco and they're gonna come
to Detroit this year I think it's partly
because of us really can't take all the
credit okay well what are you guys doing
a maker faire so we're going to have a
whole huge set up with hackerspaces we
actually contacted all the hacker spaces
to do a Power Wheels race so we're gonna
model it look like like the school has
really come ladies totally god dude it
totally what it was no toy and I don't
want to take all the credit cuz actually
ps1 but yet like a adult can you know
adult like we had last time sitting one
like that just didn't have enough juice
no and that's what's weird so we're
gonna put you know 24 volt power sources
in their motor controllers metal frames
like real tires and then so we get psone
put together this whole course we're get
like hay bales and like mapping out of
course and yeah it's good were you doing
that i Henry Ford Museum okay I July
thirty-first August first come try to
make so much sense detroit you've got
power wheels totally real hacking the
car wheels ok I love that thank you so
much well thank you for me together this
amazing set thank you can putting me up
for the night here at hak across America
ladies and gentlemen it's nick Gretzky
we will be back in just a moment first
we got to think one of the sponsors it
keeps us on the air
raise your hand if you've ever had to
transfer a file to somebody that was way
too big for email yeah me too it's a big
problem and there's tons of ways to
solve it so today I'm going to check out
some hassle free options there's no web
services no accounts and they're the
easiest way for the other person on the
other end of the line and before you
guys start emailing me I'm going to
check out some obvious choices first off
we have Dropbox which is simple and
elegant and it synchronizes folders
between Windows Mac Linux and your
mobile devices it even does web storage
with some nifty new AP is and by the way
if we use this for the hak5
pre-production videos to check all those
out and pass them along to each other
and then you have sugarsync which is
kind of like Dropbox but it has a little
bit more functionality and there's fire
zilla server which you know EFTPS have
been around since 1971 and if you must
use this inherently insecure protocol at
least grab a decent open source server
like fire Zilla server and last but not
least we have you send it rapidshare
megaupload etc etc etc all those ones
that you've ever heard of you upload it
they download it and you try to ignore
all of those upsells that are on every
single website when you try to download
whatever file it is why double your
efforts uploading and downloading when
you can just share a file straight from
your computer or better yet have them
upload directly to your hard drive yeah
that sounds nice to me HFS file server
is a lightweight windows file server
with HTTP so you can access it right in
your browser and it works right out of
the box it's highly customizable with
HTML templates so if you want to spend
time making it pretty it's very easy to
do so which is something I like to do
because I'm kind of like a record I like
shiny things pretty things sparkly
and it features a bandwidth control so
it won't slow down your capture the flag
insta game matches or your zombie
killing sprees like what I do like every
night mmm zombies of just killing
zombies oh yeah and it updates dynamic
dns service in case your public IP
changes which is great it's free and
open source which is something that i
personally adore so let's check out how
this works alright i've connected to the
hak5 cloud lab using go to assist
express and i've transferred over the
HFS exe it's a single executable there
is no install you just double-click and
there you go I love portable apps don't
you love portable apps i love portable
apps alright let's check this out i'm
going to right click and add a folder
let's pick one of these and now we'll
choose real folder you can see our
server is running on the default HTTP
port 80 but our isp is evil and blocks
port 80 so let's change that to 8000 by
clicking here and then here in the
address bar will see our local area
network IP address if we copy this into
a browser you'll see the files are ready
to download but that's not going to work
so well for our friends online so to
find our public IP address click menu IP
address and find external address now
that the address is updated we just need
to portforward from our router and share
the URL and if you want to make folders
writable so your friends can upload
directly to your disk this is what you
do you right click the folder choose
upload and upload for accounts and
choose anyone or create an account now
one of my personal favorite features of
each of us is as a client you can
download tools like W get or browser
extensions like download them all to
quickly grab files and HFS wilt are a
folder for you and that's just
scratching the surface unfortunately HFS
file server as windows only yeah i know
it can't work with linux under wine but
if you really want something
cross-platform and you don't mind
opening up a terminal try droopy droopy
is a python script that can run with
Windows Mac or Linux it has a similar
upload function to HFS file
server but it won't share a directory of
files though it is really good for
opening up just a quickie website for
you one of your friends to upload you a
file it's dead simple to use you just
create a directory and run droopy there
you go and you can specify a message
with either tack em or a picture with
tech p once it's running you go to HTTP
colon slash slash localhost colon 8080
si el servidor droopy I personally
definitely like droopy it's very cute
and if you have any information for me
any good tools make sure to email me at
feedback at hak5 org and the snubs
report wouldn't be made possible without

go to assist express so what could
possibly be better than nintendo DS
homebrew really nintendo DS homebrew 93%
bigger exactly so you need that's all
you need is them as something more to it
we're talking about the d/s act dsi XL
yeah yeah it's a mouthful okay and so so
is there something more to it than just
being large it is large it is heavy it
does not come with a wrist strap so I
have my ghetto fabulous we wrist rattle
ivory appropriated okay this thing it's
intended good just because I know it's
not gonna break alright we're approved
for those of you
there you know we're trying to throw
your DS across the room of course it
happens oh but yeah so we have the light
here for comparison in the wonderful
awesome fabulous nerve case I've
actually dropped my D s in this case and
it has survived that is yes you could
told this one up wahoo alright so yeah
it is it is significantly bigger but
what's what are the advantages of going
with this as opposed to because doesn't
that mean that the dsi is gonna get
cheaper now or no no they haven't really
changed anything okay well the one thing
that this loses is you have no GBA slot
so this is only for DS games and DSI
games okay and what does that mean for
homebrew though because I know that that
was important at one point in time one
when it came to homebrew right uh yes
for the dsi somebody I sighs you update
them and you have newer firmware and
that locks out some of the older cards
some of the r4s and the old super cards
so you have to pay attention now as to
what yes you have and what kind of card
system your breath because I was a big
fan of the art for I mean it's like you
can get it for only four dollars if you
look at lace yeah actually most cards
now uh there's one cause it's really
expensive the psycho des but depending
what you are maybe you want that level
of customization for most people these
days i'd recommend the acekard we should
probably recommend explain that when
we're talking about cards here we're
talking about parts that would go in
your DS that would allow you to plug in
typically a micro SD card with your own
home brew video games on it community
built non-sanctioned by Nintendo this is
I don't think it's gonna break you know
ruin your warranty no that's the best
part about these these are soft mods
when i did my original DS hack I was
opening up the back I'm kind of joining
two things together and that Warren team
Jen with a soldering iron whoa yeah it
is a miracle in doing good hahaha
there's a reason i go for soft mod not
hard mods right on so so what's the
difference now as far as the homebrew is
concerned with so we're saying that now
that we don't have this the slot here is
that going to impact our ability so
there's new carts exactly it's a
slightly different approach this is just
a cup like a one card solution but back
in the day on the light and if you have
a light you can still do this to card
solution
so we have something this case I am
using the the super key this does is
what i did my old is this just bypasses
the protection so that now you can go
straight to your car to solution your
slot to solution and now i can run
things off the GBA carpet and in this
case i'm using and regular SD card
because I've had this for many many
years so basically all this key pass
thing does is ladies boots off of this
and then it just passes it over to this
cart and then you can run your homebrew
exactly and on my old dsi you know I
kind of flashed I wouldn't need the
passkey I would just stick this in the
slot now the one advantage for the two
card system is that this plays the GBA
roms as well so you get the GBA homebrew
and the DA's homebrew these days you
just get the DA's home I sorry there's
plenty of it out there no you're some
really good stuff so you're saying that
the a scar is the way to go now is that
going to work for DSI dsi XL pens on
your DSi firmware but I can guarantee
that it does work on the dsi XL and
Japan in Europe and North America you
are totally covered it's been confirmed
in all regions alright how do we set it
up well first of all we have to make
sure see this little I there yes that I
is important make sure you get the
acekard 2i if you go to the acekard
website they're gonna have a list of
approved retailers and thankfully they
have them in just about all regions so
this meant that I could buy my card from
a Canadian company and avoid customs oh
yeah Devon mess tubes yeah so make sure
you get the approved one make sure it's
the I sometimes will have a sticker
it'll say dsi compatible and that is the
one that you want okay and I'm not
suming there's probably tons of
knockoffs just like they were with all
previous parts there are lots of fake
supercars I have fake supercard ones the
last of me about a week and a half
alright so what's the trick to getting a
setup for the dsi XL is there anything
that you have to change or you just pop
it in your ready to go when you have if
you're using an ace card on an older
game boy you can just run the original
loader and off you go you go to the
acekard website they'll have the loader
for download in there download section
put it on your computer put it on your
SD card run it when you got in your game
and you're good to go now to get it to
work on the dsi XL there is a patch for
it which you can also download from the
acekard site but here's where it gets a
little tricky you have to you can't run
that directly on the XL if you put the
card in to your XL when it comes up to
the menu screen you're gonna see the
regular acekard logo cuz it'll bring up
the logo when you put in the car okay if
you see that logo it's not going to work
it's good to say compatible it's just
gonna say put in a real cart mm-hmm you
can't use it so I had to run it on my my
DS Lite run the update and then put it
in here and it works perfectly and
you're going to need a riginal ds2 to
get this going if you have a friend with
the des borrow it for about 20 seconds
cuz that's all you're gonna need it for
alright and then you can run it out and
then it's actually going to show up as
danny phantom so it's gonna look like
you're playing a THQ danny phantom game
but so just ignore that because when you
load it up you will see that it is the
ace covered now you can say this is ace
cards operating system because you're
saying that this doesn't come with
anything just the chip itself yeah your
bodyguard yeah right the card doesn't
have any memory you've got to provide
your own micro SD and then what do you
put on the micro SD to make it actually
work well they have this like they have
their own for a Merv that you can use
but don't really there is a better open
source solution that is very awesome and
I'm always gonna say this wrong do you
think Akio Akio hockey oh let's call it
a key oh my colleges to the dev team if
they do not like the pronunciation but
this is open source you can skin it it's
really gorgeous folder system you can
organize your games however you want oh
you can have nested you could have
nested things it's all goods you can
separate your apps separate your ear
things there's a different IRC client we
just want to use if you have everything
set up for and so what are some of the
other features that you like about the
Aggie I mean other than it being
skinnable oh yeah I like making things
pretty I will confess but my favorite
feature is a soft reset back in the day
even with the super card the original
ones if I wanted to switch what game
always playing I'd have to turn it off
turn it on go into the menu again pick
the other game now when I'm done playing
a game Oh
have to do lr a B and down at the same
time okay so that's its version of
control of delete exactly sweet you're
perfect all right so uh so what can we
do now that we've got set up with the
Akio open source firmware on our card
here well now everything is very very
simple back in the supercar days what
you had to do was you had to get the
super card program for your pc you would
take the game that you want to then put
on your car when we say game we mean
legitimate homebrew not the stuff home
games are good right breakouts dumb vm
of course I am so you have to take that
you'd have to run it through the super
card program which would then put
another version of it onto your card
rather cross-compiling right cuz there
was the r3 and the r4 or something like
that there what they were there's a lot
of there was a lot of different cards
and if you got home brew you'd had to
like what recompile it almost for your
different card every card manufacturer
back in the day would have their own
program to make to bend the files to
their win ah now you don't have to do
that now you just copy the dot NDS file
over to whatever full do you like I on
your your ace card and you're good to go
all right so when you boot it up you see
you have this love a little menu here
and depending on a whose thing you're
running here sometimes they have very
pretty little pictures to show you what
game they're playing so under games so
what do we have let's let's test out
some homebrew what are you well I'm
playing lately haha one of the things
that I want to show off it's this thing
called shooting watched es way back in
the day there was this gamer for Hudson
called Visnic Davis 16 shot cuz he could
shoot 16 times a second so he was like
the ultimate whether the light gunner
with with him no no I like like so like
in Mega Man if you were allowed more
than three shots of the screen you could
he we could shoot seven times per second
gotcha so his nickname was sixteen shot
and they released his game trying to you
know it's like a training game mm-hmm so
if you are hardcore you can boot up this
sucker here which is gorgeous like
there's a lot of homebrew titles that
look really homebrew yeah this looks
really pro there's all kinds of
different versions different ways of
testing yourself you can
right very very pretty so yeah and this
kind of uses a lot of Hudson Hudson
softs assets here I'm sure that they
paid royalties somewhere along the line
so basically if you think you're
hardcore prove it this has a ranking
system oh and you can see how many times
you can shoot in a second you can race
against the clock okay start it up I got
to see I'm not quite getting it so go
ahead all right what are we gonna show
you what they're having it is a melon
here and what they're gonna show you is
uh cci you can test and it's measuring
how many seconds have it expired how
many times you press the button and SPS
shots per second this is actually no no
Jen Jen we have special controllers that
have macro buttons and a little dial
that you turn to put it into rapid fire
are you serious if there's a homebrew to
test how fast you can press a button
absolutely all right okay I have a
little something useful there is actual
useful nintendo DS the homebrew i know
because i played with it there's
wardriving stuff there's uh IRC is IRC
there's scummvm there's eight billion
emulators yeah Oh lemmings lemmings
level editor these days there you go
that's what's up times and tons of stuff
you can do with DES homebrew excellent
so you've got all the thrit enough so
that if you know cuz so that somebody
can follow along at home if these guys
like instructions for the acekard
specifically I have not tested too many
other cards that work on the XL yet but
I'm sure that more will be coming out in
the future excellent now before we get
going and do have to ask you what is
with the collection this is daddy are
they spawning new ones you leave in my
closet I like viruses yeah and
accessories I like starlight when you
come when you get the XL mmm nice catch
when you get the excel of course you
have the stylus that comes out of the
thing but because the the XL was
initially designed for older gamers in
Japan they also include this huge honkin
pen that looks just like a pen yeah so
that's nice and thick and then just for
comparison yeah grab that sucker out
again so this is the exhale this is the
light so you can see that it's a little
bit shorter but about the same thickness
so not a big difference there but back
with the light and the original I was
getting annoyed by how small
Penn was when I was enjoying long play
sessions that use the touchscreen yeah I
gotta know how good you are at that so
this is my my disgaea one as you can see
and then the Piplup one because I'm
obsessed with Piplup and even those
thing is ridiculously top-heavy it's
actually not bad to use cuz it's nice
and long for my hand okay yeah I love
accessories and this is actually a
fraction of a different stylist or style
I as you said there we go I have well
Jen I got 16 shots per second oh really
yeah I got 14 and carpal tunnel
