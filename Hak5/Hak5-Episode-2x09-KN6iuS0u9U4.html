I'm your host Aaron I'm Wes and this
month we have a very special episode yes
we went up to Washington DC to shmoocon
and it was really cool there was like
there was a lot of informative talks
there a couple of things they talked
about might land you behind bars not
like these that either playground bars
in the new house place yes doing good
but you might want to get a bag of
popcorn or something right now and
gather around the family because since
it is a special and special on shmoocon
and there is so much to cover it's kind
of long it's pretty long
yeah but we'll see you on the other side
right after we talked to Bruce Potter
who we asked all about shook on so
basically the shmoo group which runs
smooth on was something that I found it
back when I lived in Anchorage Alaska
like 99 or so and it was really formed
out of the idea that I had 10 or 12
friends who were all kind of doing
security work and we're all kind of into
the same thing and we wanted to do more
as a group than we could do as
individuals so you know as I was in the
community I'd meet more people that did
security and would grab them say hey you
want to come join this group you know it
wasn't for profit it wasn't a company it
was more like we got cool projects
running a website we're doing all this
stuff and we'd like to have people
involved and so it started out mostly as
this group of folks in Anchorage our
initial project with a couple of open
source tools we had look up information
for like you know RFC lookups no we're
just writing random CGI's and that kind
of thing right and massive archives of
like bug track and all these other
security lists and hosted on the end of
like 128k Circuit and Anchorage so but
it was really slow but like AltaVista
found it and like then suddenly like we
were like for a while the authoritative
archive of bug track it's so it's just
constantly that the pipe was always
filled but over time a lot of us kind of
scattered to the wind some similar
similar to Seattle in the Bay Area
Heidi and myself and her family moved
down to Virginia at the time and then we
just kind of continued to grow always we
met more people and so people found out
about the group
defconn's hawk and we were working on
books and we've got other conferences
isn't that kind of things a little
general like deep networking type yeah
exactly I mean just what happens
normally just we had an umbrella the
throne under all it is is a mailing list
you know it's a mailman mailing list a
server you know if you get added to the
list you're in the group you know that's
as complicated as it is and so there's
about 35 members total now 25 or so that
are actually active on a regular basis
and so after you know number of years
that were together you know we we go to
these conferences and be like man we can
put on one of these we can do this and
it'd be fine you know like you know we
saw things we want to do differently we
had ideas and things we wanted to do
period and and we said hey let's let's
try this and eventually after enough you
know you sit around the bar and have
this kind of conversation something
eventually comes with it so beetle at
the time is a member of the Schmidt
group and helping out you know with some
of the project said hey you know I'll
take this on and see what I can make
happen and so for a few months it kind
of was just doing things we weren't
really aware and then something it's
like here's the date I got the hotel
yeah they're gonna find uh Pharrell like
holy cow
and so then Heidi helped him out quite a
bit in the first year and they basically
between the two of them gathered up all
these volunteers and handle all the
logistics and made it happen and so the
goal I mean it's what's on the website
is you want to make it different
accessible affordable and entertaining
you know we want to be able to provide a
forum where people can come and try to
talk about security issues talk about
kind of related issues around computer
security in a way that's not really
polluted by vendors and hopefully is not
polluted by kind of the think that's
been in the community for a while you
know the security industries have
evolved over time and I think there are
some things that may have been true five
years ago that are true anymore and we
need to be able to deal with that so our
goal is to kind of you know build a
conference that allowed for that kind of
honest and open discussion and not cost
two thousand dollars but you know still
yeah are on the leg and still have a lot
of that the whole lot of fun that comes
with our kind of community right
it was the whole social event and
everything else yeah so we you know had
that the first conference and it was
apparently very successful we sold out
we do limited attendance because this is
all we're running on the cost recovery
basis again we're not trying to
money on this we was trying to give to
the community so we have to have this
line of how much can we charge and how
big can we be and what is our personal
liability in it because if we screw up
it comes out of our own pockets right
not everybody else's so um you know we
sold out at 350 folks or so and is very
successful there are certainly some
rough edges you know but we had a an
idea to try to be as transparent as we
could so they ran one of the talk
sessions was this called it on the con
and it was here's all our financial
information everything we did right
everything we did wrong so that other
people can go and try and learn from
that and I think people came to respect
like hey this seems like they are trying
to be honest with us and they're trying
to do it I think it helped that with 25
active members in the group you know
they told 10 of their friends basically
and that populates the entire conference
you get you get 350 people without even
thinking about it
so they tell two friends yeah they'll do
friends exactly and so for the next year
you know we grew pretty substantially in
size but and we sold out again very
quickly and we continued to try to be as
transparent as we could and this year
again the same thing we grew so about
you know just the cycle keeps seems to
be repeating myself and but I think
overall it's been a good experiment
we've done things I don't think that
other conferences would be willing to do
because they take a financial risk where
they take some kind of reputation risk
that we're willing to go out into London
say everyone to try to do this because
we think it's for the good of the
community and and it might make things
better so I think that's definitely one
of the big things that sets you apart
from a lot of those other conferences we
attended hope and it was kind of cool
kind of but then uh that was the first
con I've actually ever been to event you
I've gotten to the scene really late and
and I've know that adherence me you guys
have done a wonderful job with it it's
always it's all really well organised
the speakers are pretty eloquent and
what they're talking about and if they
if you want to call shenanigans on them
I love the shmoo ball right yeah so so
that was you know at least to go to
these conferences and people would just
say you know one on one is three I swear
they just say things like that people
would write it down you know like if
you're paying two thousand dollars to
attend a conference if somebody says one
on one is three part of your brain wants
to believe it that's to believe it real
bags you don't want to think you're
wasting your money
exact and so the shmoo ball was a way to
get people armed with
some kind of physical manifestation of
the bullshit flag you know that you can
just throw it at the guy on stage and
say I don't agree and maybe you said it
or maybe just threw it and everyone else
would throw them too because you know it
was just imminent that the guy wasn't
saying something because you'd mentioned
you were talking about it before in the
opening comments where it takes a big
set to stand up in front of somebody be
like no right I disagree but if with the
physical manifestation of the shmoo ball
you can just sit back anonymously whip
it yeah absolutely you'd be like in high
school again every can have it in study
hall high school nothing it wasn't me
man as soon as you got behind me over
there so now I think it's worked out and
I think every year we get more people
here who are used to that kind of
attitude so I think the discussion here
every year has gotten better as people
have realized that they can be free to
come here and talk to the speakers and
engage them and I think the speakers are
comfortable with not letting themselves
get too far afield of their normal lawn
gifts you get someone who's just saying
random crappy kind of you know get away
from them I got to go and so where do
you where does the shmoo group see shmoo
going so it as far as we're shmoocon is
going so we try to make a delineation
between the shmoo group is real kind of
it with figures neutrons one of the most
visible projects but we continue to try
to do other things and we're the shmoo
group is going that no idea it's just a
year adventure as far as we can tell
I'd like to you know and I think Heidi
and I talk about this a lot with the
rest of the group which is you know how
big do we think we want to get do we
want to get any bigger even from where
we are today are there any other ways to
impact the community in a positive way
that isn't just this conference because
the problem is we're going to become a
victim of our own success at some point
where if we continue to grow I think
that was your
this probably gets edited out at some
point I can make with moose antlers and
so anyway the we're going to become a
victim of her own successes we get to be
you know 1500 or whatever people there's
gonna be some breaking point where
people say this isn't a cozy environment
you it's just kind of this big whatever
anymore it's not not as cool as it used
to be and for us it will be not fun you
know you get 2,000 people 3,000 people
on a budget volunteer support them and
be like I don't want to do this I'd like
to see us get and this is my personal
opinion I think there's going to be
different opinions in the group I think
we can probably be a little bit bigger
than we are but I think the limit
intended thing is good for us it's good
for the people that attend because it
gives them abyss experience possible I
really like to see us focus on outreach
more in our ability to impact other
conferences and other parts of the
community in a positive way so that
people don't feel like they need to
necessarily come to smooth cotton and
you know do something else and get the
same kind of you know information flow
and participate like they can
participate here you know if someone
else is wildly successful because we
were able to arm them and make them
successful that'll be I think that's
important to us you know just as
important if not more so than getting
attendees here and and having this
conference that's that that's cool
that's really cool that's kind of like
how we feel about what we do is we don't
want it to not be fun and we want to
help be able to help everybody else
right here so grant at two different
things huge different scale but same
basic principles and you know I think
that that altruism is good to have in
the community because I think that
there's a lot of a lot of money in play
right now if we're right wrong I mean
there's business around security and so
a lot of people are going to you know
have different motivations and
thankfully the way I used to describe
this new group is we're a bunch of
security heaps with disposable income
they can go and do all these projects
and are expecting any return on the
investment we because we want to do the
right thing
it's an our geeks with a fair bit of
disposable income because with the
conference allows us to year-over-year
reinvest in the conference and and I
think that puts us in a unique
perspective to be able to you know do
things that are still altruistic in
nature and and potentially provide a
venue that if people believe that
they're no longer altruistic or way off
the rails they'll tell us and they'll
tell us honestly like we don't believe
in what you're doing anymore we'll
fantastic and tell us that and neither
will try to fix it or maybe we'll become
obsolete
that's cool so for anybody that happens
to not know about shmoo grouper shmoocon
where they where can they go to go find
out some information you can find out
more information by fukken @w Khan
Network that's sh m oo Co n so no
there's it's not like school so there's
no SCH which is what everybody wants to
say it's s hmm oh and to find out more
about the groovy English muqaam and
learn more there and on this Guk on.org
website will have all the talks from
this year both in slide form and video
form and free for download videos should
be up at some point
okay cool thanks a lot and we'll come
from so smoo came from there was a guy
who worked with me and a bunch of the
other spoon members at Internet Alaska
and where we all worked once not all of
us but number of his works must upon a
time and he was dating this woman and we
were 22 23 at the time and she came in
one day because he forgot his lunch and
we were in a staff meeting and and the
receptionist is like well you know he
can't go back there and after the staff
meeting so is there something you want
to leave us like I'll leave this lunch
for Malone he put his name on it and she
writes for my little schmoo weekends and
and when you're a 22 year old sysadmin
working with a bunch of other 22 year
old sis admins and you're all male like
you do not write schmoovy Ken's a bag
and live it down so so we started
calling them shmoo and actually around
the office like his business card
station and everything and so he
registered phu kham and then when you
know we were looking to start off the
shmoo group we didn't you know
originally like you know howdy was
involved and food was involved and a few
other folks and we were coming up with
these names and then we realized we were
poor and we couldn't really register new
domains because we didn't have 70 bucks
to throw down so we just used muqaam and
when we worked at Internet Alaska it was
tech support group
TSG at alaska net so we called it the
shmoo roof TSG at shoe calm and so it
was like this little inside joke as well
and how the name came to be so it was
really because we were broken we knew a
guy named Mary that we decided to use
college that's cool so he's now from
there forever immortalized he is
forevermore life yes absolutely thank
you so much thank you very much greatly
appreciate it
okay thanks a lot Bruce we really
appreciate you talking with us now up
next we have trivia so Ally what was
last month's trivia last month's trivia
question was what is the full name of
section ones resident hacker and it was
correctly answered by a Manuel Manuel as
I call him her name is Seymour Birkhoff
and Manuel admits they've googled it
nice Google Flu Google foo good ok so
I've got this month's trivia question
the voodoo five 6000 an unreleased
graphics card by 3dfx contains so many
circuits that a special external power
supply was intended to have been
included
how many VSA 100 graphics processing
units would the card have featured how
many GPUs was the card supposed to have
for the reason that it needed an
external power supply you should know
where to send your answers but just in
case they don't know already so up next
we are going to I need to check my list
a dear not one about cache don't make
you think about your NT logon privileges
check it out
all right so I'm here with Owen Miller
and if you're Collins and both of them
were just previously talking
bukhan about cash dump and a script that
you guys have developed that makes
things a little bit more secure when
you're talking about Windows domain
login you tell me a little bit first
about cache dump and what some of the
insecurities are with that basically
cache dump is just a utility that is
used to dump the cached credentials from
domain logins on local systems and it
installs itself as the service and
executes under the context of the system
user and then pulls the information out
of the registry and displays it to you
and it lets you know the cached logins
that have been on that box so how would
you say that this differs from something
like pwm pwm used more against the local
security database as opposed to
cashed-up which is used against the
specific registry entries for cash
domain credentials when you have a
machine that is a member of a domain
environment as opposed to waste dumping
the password database of a local system
so when you log in to a Windows domain
on Windows Network what really happens
that makes cash dump able to pull
something out of there what happens is
when you log in locally or via RDP or
even use the run as function it all
calls the win login process and the win
login process depending upon your
policies if cash credentials is enabled
which it typically is if you have a
Windows domain with a lot of laptop
users what it does is it actually will
it actually will cache the credentials
it goes through an algorithm they'll
catch the actual password in every
single workstation where a domain admin
is logged into or if you run like necess
with the local checks or if you run
popular patch management utilities it
does the same thing it logs into every
workstation using an account with domain
admin privileges and it leaves the
password hash behind so if that box gets
compromised if one of your twenty
thousand boxes gets compromised you can
actually dump those credentials and use
a popular password cracking tool like
John or Cain and Abel and you just have
the main admin so what's the major
vulnerability or the problem with the
way that Windows does this that your
script takes care of the way windows
works now it either allows you to enable
or disable cache credentials or limit
then about a number of cache potentials
that gets saved that's not really ideal
because with laptop users they need to
log in when they're not authenticating
against the domain they need to log in
via cached credentials to their local
laptop so what the script does it uses
utilizes catch them and it will go and
look up Active Directory and see what
member group membership that user has
and then if it's a member of a domain
admin privileged group it'll actually
zero out the cache credentials okay so
from a blackhat standpoint
without this script which nullifies the
hash in the cache on logout how would
you use this to take advantage of a
machine say like you had physical access
you're saying that the cache dump needs
to be installed as a service is that
something that you could do with some
sort of a live distro or something not
using the local operating system there
are things you can do without the local
OS running there are like backtrack and
other sorts of bootable Linux distros in
addition actually if you do a
installation of if you have a Windows CD
and you do a redo an installation over
top of it in a repair and you hit I
believe it's like shift f12 or shift f10
something like that during the
installation process it brings up a
command window so then you can start up
MMC and screw with the local accounts
database well when you do that then you
can just add a new user that's an
administrator to the local system and
then after it's finished doing the
repair process it's still a member of
the domain and then you can just go
ahead and log in locally with that run
cache dump and then grab all the local
authentication all the cached
credentials very easily so if they have
physical access they already have access
to these credentials pretty much no
matter what you do we've always been
aware that a physical access means the
machine is owned no matter what but it's
kind of scary to think about the fact
that if there are domain credentials
cached on that machine you can
potentially get access to the entire
network not just that local machine so I
guess that's a good tip for anybody
looking to repair a Windows machine and
that's shift f10 on installation so
anyway thank you guys so much for your
time
where can anybody find more information
about your research we're going to be
posting everything that we're going to
email everything to the shmoocon guys
and post it up I'll probably put the
copy the presentation up on my site
which is a Trojan to binaries comm and I
believe Derek and my sites Wi-Fi set
comm Wi-Fi SCC calm very cool thank you
guys so much
doggy doggy doggy doggy Douglas maybe
see no easy GoDaddy commas huh yeah I
just bought you for a buck ninety-nine
did not yeah I did dog nabbit whoops
just get your dog mr. Winky my wife
loves mr. Winky you know I'm gonna do
your mother now too late I already did
my mother pervert enter code hack that's
H a K when you check out for an
additional ten percent off any order
anyway so we're here is MOOC on with
Billy Hoffman from SPI dynamics it just
did a really interesting talk about
JavaScript and how it's going to bring
the goo explained to me this title real
quick because I think it's kind of
interesting so the the title was
JavaScript malware for a gray goo
tomorrow and gray goo is kind of this
hypothetical like end of the world
scenario where like nano machines just a
replicate and replicate so you have
nothing but machine so it's a big giant
massive gray goo is this like some
sci-fi book or you know you don't know
is actually no it's in facts this the
person who created nanotech you know
kind of prophesized that if we're not
careful what could happen and like Bill
joy the one of the founders of Sun is
written extensively about it so it's
kind of a fear but the reason I used it
in the talk is that javascript is one of
these small little things that you don't
think could ever cause you damage but I
mean it's it's grown so powerful
recently so quickly that you never know
what's going to have I see the nanobots
I think they took over the enterprise
once actually probably heat anyway
without going into too much of a dorky
mode I wanted to ask you about the ports
can you demonstrated a really nifty
thing talking about using javascript
actually do some more scheming how
exactly does that work so javascript
normally is pretty limited in how it can
talk to people but one of the things
that can do is is try to request images
and also load other web pages in now a
lot of times you can't see the content
that gets returned but you can tell
whether it's succeeded or whether it
failed or how long it took something to
happen and these are kind of a side
channel so if I try to load a document
and within a certain amount of time I
haven't gotten anything back yet I know
there's nothing there and if I go ahead
and I try to you know request certain
type of content and there's Ana web
server there there's maybe an FTP server
something it's going to react
differently and I'll get different types
of errors so you can kind of use this as
a side channel even though you're not
supposed to be able to get access to
this information you know it's kind of
like not seeing the object but kind of
seeing the shadow of it and you can make
assumptions about what it looks like and
so we can port scan with JavaScript and
spider Nemec section has a white paper
it's by Dynamix comm all about it grand
all the gory geeky detail well I'm sure
it'll be at the bottom of the screen
and we were you're also showing that Tom
that my space virus from 2005 to those
that aren't really familiar with
cross-site scripting you also did a
demonstration with CNN for your mom's
birthday how exactly does that you know
on a real basic level for the the
beginner viewers sure how does that work
so the problem there well what happens
is a lot of times websites will accept
information from the user and then spit
it back to the user so they'll say
things like your search query for you
know candy apples didn't return anything
well if if they are not encoding their
data that comes back properly I can
actually put HTML tags in there so when
it comes back to the browser the browser
is going to interpret it maybe don't
make the text really big or you know pop
open a you know a new window or
something like that
well another thing I can do is actually
injects a flash or JavaScript so that
when it gets returned back to the
browser the browser goes hey you know
CNN for example just gave me some
JavaScript I'm going to execute it
there's no reason for me not to and so
attackers can kind of use this
reflective nature to inject their own
code into a website and then that codes
going to get to a user's browser and run
and can do all sorts of things like port
scanning it can change the page and so
you could do massive defacements on the
CNN example I used a cross-site
scripting vulnerability to create a fake
news story about my mom's birthday this
sounds like it's perfect for fishing it
is perfect for fishing actually because
all fishing defense today relies on a my
actually at you know Bank of America
caverna
or a my at some site Russia well if you
have a cross-site scripting
vulnerability in Bank of America com you
may in fact be at Bank of America calm
you know check the certificate you know
some of those reputation toolbars I'll
say you know this many people think this
is a good site you know they'll all pass
because you're actually at Bank of
America calm but JavaScript has
rewritten the page to include a fake
login page or a fake login box and so
when you type it in there you just got
fished and really short of securing the
website there's nothing the end-user can
do to fix this because from the
browser's point of view there's
JavaScript there it should execute it it
doesn't know that that JavaScript wasn't
supposed to be there but got injected
or some other way okay so if the who's
the burden on who wears I don't want to
say blame but where is the insecurity
coming from and is there anything that
the end user can do certainly the the
insecurity is in the design of the
application in is in the design of the
web app right because it's JavaScript
isn't doing anything your browser isn't
supposed to do it's not like I'm
exploiting a buffer overflow or a
problem with the browser though those
are certainly common but with JavaScript
I'm giving you code your browsers going
to run it there's no reason for it not
to the the problem lies in how we got
there for the browser to run it and what
happens is when a developer creates a
site or something like that you know
think think about like a guestbook right
you know you're at a message site or
something like this or maybe a developer
forum you're asking some questions if I
post instead of a message that says hey
I'm having trouble with PHP can you help
me out I post a big block of HTML with a
big flashing you know like banner
advertisement well of course there's
there's checks in there I mean as
somebody that's dabbled in PHP you know
and you accept something you gotta make
sure at least you don't have you know
brackets on either end because I mean
that's dead giveaway but certainly so
you're saying that we need to do more
than just look for brackets certainly in
fact that's what we call blacklist input
validation if that's when you say I
don't want brackets or I don't want say
a single tick which is commonly used in
a sequel injection attacks another thing
against websites but as soon as somebody
finds out how to do a an attack that
doesn't involve brackets you're
protections are out of date so instead
of saying you know hey I don't want to
allow brackets what you should say is
well what what am I am gonna allow
somebody to post you know what's say if
it's you know a message board is kind of
an odd case because you want them to
post all sorts of characters but if
you're thinking about you know like a
magazine subscription page right sure
for for a zip code there shouldn't be
any numbers in or that should only be
numbers if that you shouldn't allow
anything but numbers for an address you
know only letters numbers maybe a space
or - same thing with a name you might
want to tick for like a Brian right most
people not like that and
so you and not only should you validate
for the datatype is this a number is
this a letter but also lengths a lot of
times someone will find out whether
something is a zip code or not bill
they'll take the string so is this a
number and you know they'll do some
conversion and PHP and see if it passes
do like a try/catch the problem with
this is is what happens if I give you
you know 9 billion it's a number it's
going to pass but if you put that into
your application a zip code it's
probably going to puke okay well what
about fur what would you say to a
programmer or a web application
developer like me that's just kind of a
novice I dabble I throw together a
little PHP script so that somebody can
enter in some fields and get on the live
show right and that'll just get emailed
to me you know and I just I check to
make sure that there's no brackets and
is there an @ sign in your email address
okay that sounds good what's the best
practice for for programmers moving
forward to write more secure code
because what if there's program that
that's not a security
you know guru very true well you know
it's it's not just about security
security is kind of a benefit of doing
input validation right I mean if we just
said you know if I gave you a very large
number your programs gonna puke you know
what happens if I gave you you know any
type of input you're not expecting your
program is going to be unstable these
are kind of edge cases you didn't think
about when you were writing your app
maybe you check to see if there was an @
sign there machine check to see if there
was an @ sign and a period and a-- write
that and so really it's it's it has a
side benefit of making your app secure
but really it's how you write really
strong robust enterprise level
applications and so I would say to any
kind of budding programmer who's just
getting started you know really trying
to think about how to write the best
strongest app you can and the way you do
that is take out all the uncertainty
there's some really good the PHP manual
actually the php.net has some really
good advice about how to avoid these
types of issues there's a Wikipedia
actually if you if you do a Wikipedia
search for web security their articles
are really quite good and they give
really good advice on how to fix things
properly ok now going back to maybe more
the gray hat side you did a demo of some
Ajax code or some JavaScript code I'm
not really sure where the distinction is
I think you need rounded corners for it
to be agents
so but and some venture capital to would
be nice
nevermind we don't want that but but you
demonstrated a way to brute-force
browser history to guess
have you been to you know whatever calm
this is kind of a neat way of abusing
the browser in a way that was never
intended you know I'm a big fan as a
hacker and just someone who's curious
how how to use something in a way it was
never intended you know I mean look at
the frisbee right the frisbee were you
know PI tens but now they're you know
they're a toy so what I did with with
this stealing history stuff is
JavaScript because you can change the
way the page looks and stuff it's able
to dynamically create like a hyperlink
you know to go somewhere and we all know
when you're using the browser the Linux
pre-caching
exactly like I think you might go here
next so let me just get that in the
cache and we all know that the browser
whether you've been to a link or not
it's visually different you know maybe
it's a different color it's underlined
or not and so what people can do is they
can dynamically create a link and then
see how the browser renders it they can
say alright I'm going to create a link
to slashed on and now I'm gonna see what
the color of that link is if it's purple
as opposed to like a solid blue that's
underlined I know you've been to
slashdot
and so without actually sending any
requests I'm just basically asking your
browser I'm creating links and then
seeing how your browser displays them to
get a gauge of wedding have been to
certain websites and that must take
forever you think so but I mean look how
fast modern machines are I can do
thousands of checks a second so and I
mean how many popular sites are there
especially think about an advertiser
using something like this I mean we all
see those like double-click and all be
here I'm giving us cookies it would be
trivial for them to put a little piece
of JavaScript maybe ask the top 250 most
popular sites or actually if they were
smart they would do things like niche
sites you know like hack a day you know
any type of site that's got a particular
type of you know yes and then I've got
you know soldering iron advertisements
yeah exactly
it makes sense but that's kind of an
invasion of privacy and EDI that I hope
double-click doesn't use technology like
that but I would hope not but I mean P
you know
and all I mean cookies people yes I
think I remember when we're first get
rid of cookie Amazon knows who I am when
I click checkout so they already do you
gave them your credit card so after
watching your demo I'm kind of getting
the tenth feel tinfoil hat feel or I'm
like I know cookies gonna need to a
little JavaScript and I don't want to no
no no that's always the like it's like
the reality distortion field right jobs
it dissipates and then you realize okay
I'm living in the real world and there's
certain risk that I take when I go to
myspace because I mean come on it's
MySpace
you showed off a really interesting
where you talked about something called
the purl and an XSS hybrid worm can you
touch me a little bit about what that is
yes so a lot of times we've seen kind of
with traditional ways people do kind of
like attacks and things like that
they're they're either exploiting a web
app when it's a cross-site scripting or
they are attacking the server you're
attacking your lower level stuff well I
started thinking well is it possible to
have something that those both because
both the the JavaScript in the vbscript
language are very similar to perl they
both have similar named functions and
the way that what is a comment in Perl
is different than what's a comment in
JavaScript so it's actually possible
have a single block of code and you've
got something where it's like you're
declaring a variable with a lot of code
instructions but it's commented out if
you're using Perl but if you throw that
to a JavaScript interpreter those
characters aren't a comment and so that
that code actually gets executed and run
so the same piece of code regards to
whether you're giving it to Perl or
you're giving JavaScript will do the
same thing and that would be rendered by
the browser if it's being JavaScript it
will be rendered by the browser and then
the browser or the javascript in the
browser can send the same worm to try to
attack the server where it would run his
Perl
that's scary thought very interesting is
there a proof of concept code any but
not yo and take a look at unfortunately
this is something I kind of been fooling
around with over the last year and so
they're going to just have to check your
blog or where can they go to find that
initially and it all sorts of other good
nuggets meme streams net is actually
where I vlog it's a social networking
site that lets you post content but kind
of differently than they dig or
something like that they use kind of
reputation systems so as you use the
site you know maybe I like you know this
guy's commentary on you know this type
of technology and I like this guy's you
know recipe tips and so the site
actually changes and you'll it kind of
adjusts to what you like it's really
kind of like a looking glass or a filter
and so you only see things that interest
you so would you lose reputation points
for doing the myspace photo okay
probably now before we get going you
just just debuted gypped oh yeah and I
would be very interested in finding out
more about what chick doe can do for
those in penetration testing or just won
a full round certain well Juuko is was a
proof of concept that was showed off we
had thought about giving the code away
but we're going to do a little bit more
work with it maybe do something with
that around blackhat you know we want to
make sure we're not you know arming
script kiddies but at the same time we
want to make sure that we're educating
people it's always a fine line this is a
hard balance line so Jake doe is a web
vulnerability scanner what written in
JavaScript so we already have this like
necess for you exactly exactly and what
we already have there's a pretty big
market it's pretty old too it's about
five or six seven years now we've had
things like whisker and Nick dough and
there are plugins even for Knesset's to
do more web space stuff and so kind of
web vulnerability scanners is a a
growing interesting field and it turns
out you can actually write one in
JavaScript too so now if I find say a
vulnerability in one site and I inject
code in it
that's code can then go and stand other
websites and find other vulnerable sites
and hop so it can actually move from
host to host like a worm and it also
it's cross-platform because it's
JavaScript so it's running in your
browser so this is going to work on your
little you know Apple iPhone running
Safari the way it's gonna work on your
you know sidekick running you know say I
don't even know what sidekicks run but I
know they've got a JavaScript
interpreter you know your your trio any
of these things as well as your standard
PCB at Mac or Linux or Windows acting
for my cell phone sounds like fun
now for those that are watching this and
just salivating at all this javascript
and malicious talk where can they go to
like
if they want to dig deeper into this
kind of stuff you get any resources you
want to give out maybe some some links
to certainly there's a there's a really
good well there are a lot of really good
white papers at spot on Amex calm
obviously like I said Wikipedia is
actually remarkably good and how
educated they are there's some really
good books the best one I have to
recommend
it's normally I'm not a big fan of
hacking exposed but attacking web
applications exposed actually this the
CTO spy wrote it but it's he very much
worked as a professional pen tester so
it's it's it's not a dry academic tome
it's very much alright here's what an
attacker does to break in and then
here's how you fix it sound that gets
around that here's how you fix that and
so it's kind of a tit-for-tat which is
really quite good and if you're
interested more come to the web 2.0
ajaxy stuff i'm actually writing a book
right now for addison-wesley on ajax
security
it'll be out about time of blackhat but
I think on Safari the the digital book
library it should be up there in about a
month nice very good I mean you know
it's it's the all the rage right now and
we shouldn't get too caught up in all
the nifty features without you know
being concerned about the security and
you know I really should stress that
it's it sounds all new and nifty
somebody actually have the talk asked me
this you know what about you know this
for security this doesn't sound new
security isn't really a new concept
there hasn't really been anything new or
groundbreaking in security in 30 years I
mean a buffer overflow or a cross-site
scripting vulnerability or sequel
injection I mean all of these things
come down to you accepted something from
the client and you acted on it without
you know checking to see what it was
first I mean a buffer overflow is just a
controlled crash of your application and
applications crash because there was
some edge case or something you forgot
to do but forever flows just happen to
crash your app in a way that the execute
code while dies but I mean this isn't I
mean there are several very basic
fundamental concepts that that really
all security is based off of in fact
Michael Howard he's a Microsoft guy he's
got a book called the the seven deadly
sins of software developers and it's
excellent it kind of runs through these
big seven kind of core concepts even not
really there's only about four we kind
of embellishes a couple out in some edge
cases but that's a really good resource
to and it's also written you don't have
to be a genius program
you can just be starting out it's a good
explanation okay and where can our
viewers find out more information about
you and SPI dynamics and specifically
gypto where you can go to spy to name it
come I'm gonna have all the slides up
from the presentation here we're
probably gonna write up a white paper in
the next couple of days about exactly
what Jake doe does and how it works and
you know of course I'm always open for
email it's the Hofmann at spy dynamics
comm very good well Billy thank you so
much for coming on and giving our
viewers taste of the insecure goo the
insecure dude thank you so much okay so
that was Billy Hoffman with dick dough
that definitely frightened me when it
came to Java scripting I was like whew
that's not good but right now we have
the poll and I have last month's poll
results and the question was what audio
format do you prefer mp3 ogg vorbis AAC
MIDI or WMA and the winner by landslide
with 61% mp3 second OGG with 25 AAC 5%
MIDI 4% and WMA 2% oh I can't believe
WMA actually got any votes
WMA so what's this month's poll question
this most poll question is FPS RTS that
other crap hey who worked this MMORPG
thank you very much gets your vote FPS
RTS or MMO yeah and for those of you who
are you know noobs that's gaming og
because they could view that one anyway
so check out the poll at hak5 org slash
poll and so what do we have next there
yeah you're supposed to remember that oh
hang on it's not oh that's right yeah
the insides Enoch you both MOOC on
okay I'm here with Ken over at shmoocon
taking a look at the network operations
center and I from what I understand you
were the guy that dark attacks or
maintains this beautiful little network
gasm um well not not exactly I mean I'm
one of many people that that kind of set
all this stuff up I guess I kind of like
brought everything together but I'm
definitely not like the sole person
responsible I can't like really clean
ones of the LAT people here you know all
day and all night I mean and why
wouldn't you want to leave when there's
so many blinking lights exactly so maybe
I was hoping you could show us around
and tell us what all these blinking
lights do so maybe you can tell us a
little bit of about these IDS's
yes so basically they're actually both
of the systems are their inline IPS
systems which basically the set up there
on the wall is where the internet
connectivity comes in from the hotel
network and then the traffic gets routed
through these boxes they're basically
totally transparent so they just bridge
all the traffic through they can do they
both have capabilities to do intrusion
prevention so basically they would
analyze all the traffic going through
look for signatures and known attacks
and then drop traffic according to the
signatures the way that we've been using
them is actually more from an analysis
standpoint where we're actually they're
looking at the data matching signatures
and recording it but we're not actually
dropping anything through these systems
so there's no special VLAN for the bad
guys they can go to jail and stay in
their own little subnet or anything like
that no no we're not doing that we're
not doing like any sort of network
access control where we would you know
like quarantines someone based off of
activity there are the network is highly
segregated in highly modular and there
are a lot of VLANs based on like the
different areas of the network
but we're not doing any sort of active
like quarantine what about these bad
boys over here so these guys are
actually servers for the Applied
Security contest I don't know if you
checked out the contest at all I haven't
gotten a chance to actually you know
play with it or compete in it but these
are these are all the servers that they
brought down for that and so they kind
of have like a hacking contest where
they have like a series of challenges
that people go through and and so we
actually have them like on their own
isolated Network so it's totally free
hacking zone here encouraged to do all
your fun short of ulnar ability testing
exploits and stuff like that and I guess
that keeps the rest of network clear
from no nasty traffic potentially it's
not actually like the networks are not
physically isolated we do have them for
instance we have one wireless network
that blankets the entire conference and
so on that wireless network there are
multiple SSIDs available one of them is
the shmoocon SSID which provides network
access internet access the other is the
ASI Hackett SSID which provides access
to these servers and so through the same
ap you can connect either one of the
networks and depending on which SSID are
associated to it'll write your traffic
to the different networks so they're not
physically separated they're basically
logically separated you know on the same
on the same cable plant or wire plan and
this mess over here in the rack well so
the top box is the controller for the
network chemistry it's a wireless IDs
system and so basically if you were to
go out through the conference area there
are a bunch of sensors close to all the
access points that are monitoring all
the wireless traffic and looking for
security events on the wireless network
different than these you know these guys
don't see any of the wireless traffic
because by the time it reaches them it's
no longer wireless so the network
chemistry box looks at like actual you
know like 802 11 based attacks and it
can do so for instance one of the things
that it can do is that if we have smoke
on access points with particular BSS IDs
and it can monitor for
shook on access points advertising
shmoocon that are not authorized BSS IDs
and then send via the fax to those
particular access points so have you
seen many attacks yeah we've seen yeah
we've seen quite a few attacks like our
DNS servers have gotten many attack
attempts we've seen on the water on the
wireless side you know there's been
because because we have the wireless
network in an open state where anyone
can connect you know that's susceptible
to a lot of attacks and really at the
end of the day because it's wireless you
know anyone anyone can custom crap
Wireless frames and attempt to inject
traffic and so we actually had a
wireless security vendor who unbeknownst
to us until it was brought to our
attention was actually you know
hijacking wireless connections and
redirecting all web requests to a page
and said hey come check out our boo from
the vendor er no it was VI was nice and
it kind of you know it wasn't goatse
though it wasn't go see well but then
there was also you know like we had like
some tub girl you know instances and
that type of thing I don't Google that
all pretty par for the course not you
know no surprises really like I didn't
you know like no you know no like Oh
days or anything like that though so for
next year any plan changes or just swap
out all the vendors for the fun of it or
anything in particular you really want
to add to the network well you know it's
funny we actually had a talk about that
one of the talks that we had today it
was basically a dissection of this whole
project and how well and how it went and
you know what we do what we do
differently next year and one thing that
we've talked about is providing more
local services or coming up with more
ways to get people at the conference
jabber involved in that work potentially
jabber having you know like a you know
like some sort of lloyd services or you
know local torrent trackers i mean
there's a whole you know there's a whole
range of things that we could do but
basically outside of just providing the
core you know Internet connectivity
coming up in more ways to
to make stuff local to the conference
very cool
well thank you so much time showing us
the network it's my pleasure looks like
a lot of fun and maybe next year I'll be
gutsy enough to bring my notebook and
even connect all right thank you thanks
okay so thanks a lot Ken for taking us
on the tour the NOC that was freakin
awesome thank you so coming up we're
gonna have we're gonna take a look at
the hack or halo it's kind of you can
play Halo or you can hack it's like the
ultimate LAN party you typed you yeah
way more organized and really cool but
up first we need to talk about the new
web contest we're going to try something
new and do sort of a like fansite kind
of make mm-hmm make a like a fan site
for hak5 using only web 1.0 send them
into contests to hack v dot org we'll
take a look at them figure out what's
the best show off the you know the
nominees and then the best one on the
next episode who get an uber awesome
special super prize yeah
now when we say web 1.0 excuse me we're
talking like geo cities yeah we're
talking you're getting judged on usage
of more key and animated gifts yes
animated gifts marquee guest books
tickers or counters all that fun CGI
happiness that oh boy and just make sure
when you make your submissions that you
include all the files and zip it up
together so it's easy for us to see
doesn't point us to it or you can point
us to it either way they'll be way
better because then we can judge them on
fun stuff like usage of Angelfire
Geocities whoo-hoo
so yeah send your submissions to contest
at hackpad org you can find all the
official rules at pack five dot org
slash contest and we figure this just
gonna be a fun new thing to try out and
if you're wondering about the set the
sets in the shop but it'll be back next
episode anyway
anyway let's go take a look at hack or
halo boom a shot
all right so I'm sitting here with
Jordan and west from the hack or halo
over its MOOC on can you tell me a
little bit about what hack or halo is
and where it came about hacker halo came
about at the very first MOOC on is kind
of a way to get the hacker community to
do their thing in the gaming community
to do their thing
I'll both at the same time and the
winner of the hack side gets something
to help their halo their gaming side in
the winner of the halo competition gets
something to help their hack side
because they clearly need to do the
other thing more it's a it's been going
on there's no the third year all the
years is from Yukon has been going on
and this year looking out to be pretty
good so the land gamers for the halo get
get some wireless equipment from what I
understand this year yeah we're giving
them a ridiculously tall yagi antenna
and some Wireless cards it's huge and
the the winners of the halo competition
or the the hack competition are getting
an Xbox 360 very cool so how does the
hack competition work can you kind of
step us through that sure well I don't
know how it worked last year's is my
first MOOC on this year we have a set of
puzzles that range from specific
security type you know exploit this box
as quick as possible to here's a
slightly hack related puzzle and you
need to you really use your brain to fit
to do it we've gone through the first
round of hack so far and no one's gotten
more than what five five or six and
there's 22 puzzles at all and about four
or five of them are really really simple
so I don't know I don't know what people
are spending the time on they think the
puzzles are harder than they actually
are that they're most of them are really
not super difficult just requires you to
a lot of them is just sniffing and
looking for abnormal traffic or crafting
packets with certain bytes set or bit
set and so they're not really not that
difficult people are just thinking it's
too hard last year and the year before
shmoocon or hacker halo was a pure
exploit based you know own as many
machines as you can as fast as you can
and you have like 10 minutes to do it we
wanted to get away from that and move
more towards a thinking type of game
that's are there any specific rules for
the way you play the hack no internet
access you get 55 minutes which is crazy
with 422 puzzles um what else there's
one person per hack keyboard but you can
have as many friends behind you helping
they can't be on the internet either
just that's pretty much an anything
anything goes don't attack your
teammates they're not worth the point
they're not a puzzle and don't attack
the VMware server okay so they're on the
other side of this wall on kink here so
maybe you could give us an example of
one of the puzzles one of the ones that
the creators myself in Jordan and some
of the other guys who helped set up is
there is a series of ASCII ports and we
give them the nmap output the ports in
ascending order there they're just
random not random they're actual there's
a reason why we picked those ports but
if you connect to them they're just TCP
ports if you connect to them you get a
quote from family guy random family guy
quote off of every port that you connect
to that's open and the trick to that the
clue is Compton says the ports are
trying to tell you something and what
you're supposed to do is take all of the
ports in ascending order line them up in
one large string chop them up into three
and convert them to their ASCII
equivalent and it spells straight out a
question mark question mark and it's the
hint is straight out of Compton the the
old NWA song so that's one of the the
more intricate puzzles is probably in my
opinion the most difficult puzzle but no
one's gotten that so far no one's even
come close so it sounds like one of
those fun things like the hidden
Futurama strings and the headers of
slash dot or something like that and
definitely something that we go for and
love to do we sometimes on the our show
do little Easter eggs were a URL will
pop off the next thing you know you're
playing a game and finding some little
videos and stuff so where'd the idea for
this kind of come from it actually I was
the one who presented it to Chris
Compton who's running all of hacker halo
we basically came up with Ike I had seen
at Def Con six or seven puzzle box done
by a guy who calls himself pelant a he's
San Diego or at least back then he was
in his box was hands-down the most
difficult thing I'd ever seen
it was required some like custom ssh
client even get into and then like
you're dropped in this like bizarro
shell like this supposed to teach you
how to play unix and then you had to
break out of that there was just this
puzzle after puzzle after puzzle and
they just got weirder and weirder as he
went on and to this very day my friends
and i that that helped work on it still
talked about it so when we made the
decision that we wanted to move away
from pure exploit based game i just said
one we just make a bunch of puzzles and
maybe interlace the puzzles you have to
solve puzzle one to get through the next
one and i just kind of went from there
and that's where that's where the
inspiration came from sounds like
there's a high probability of beaten by
a grue know by a grue i only know that
because i really dorky friends don't
bother dropping him into a shell just
drop them right into nack really fun
this is not enough time to play a good
game in that hack so yeah you got to be
real fast for a good game and so moving
forward with the next MOOC on any ideas
of changing the game format anything
like that you what do you see with the
hacker halo on the horizon we've been
tossing around their idea somewhat
jokingly that we need to have hack horn
or Halo or Guitar Hero because people
who play guitar hero that really like it
are sadistic fans of it like yourself
probably apparently you yeah so it seems
to be a really good game really popular
it could probably generate some serious
competition and not to mention you get
the tagline you can kill people in Halo
you can hack in the hack competition or
you can just rock out at Guitar Hero
well if you guys end up doing that then
we will definitely be here next year
because West's behind the camera right
now is just ready to start thrashing and
rocking and rolling and it's given us
devil horns anyway I understand that you
guys are busy hacking so good luck with
the hack and look forward to seeing how
it turns out thank you so much for
spending some time with us
alright so we just heard from Jason west
from hacker hallo thank you guys it was
awesome you know Paul you made it
semi-finals yes semifinals I kind of got
taken out there but it was a lot of fun
I really enjoyed playing Halo yeah i sat
there and watched your most of your
bouts and you did a really good job I
think you're just kind of good yeah it's
kind of a little confusing with the
giant screen yeah being all the way
across in the upper left corner and when
you're down below it right it didn't
make any sense but yeah whatever you
made a brief are those so hats off to
you yeah so we just got out of a hacker
halo and up next we have a Scott Moulton
with the hard drive
yes but before that we have to talk
about more video games better Oh LAN
party oh I didn't like for your sorry
you didn't like here uh it wasn't I'd
run up to like somebody and try and
punch him but I'd fail shoot him do you
get to use the penetrator well I was
like I run around like trying like go
snipe him in the head and then like get
one shot off and then hit him but it
never worked out well part of the
problem was none of us had the rigs to
play it yeah I had to borrow yours
yeah and that then I took Darren's and I
had like I want to like controller
felt a lot better blood yeah so anyway
this month's LAN party we're the third
and final time Goldeneye source it's
already out now so we don't have to
worry they like play this way too game
oh god are they good are they gonna
release in time I don't know they're at
right it is out so good look dude I just
got a half-life 2 I haven't downloaded
it yet but if it looks half as good as
the screenshots
I know those face shots we're beautiful
I was like yeah I know you're like one
girl so we're gonna play Goldeneye
source so if you don't have half-life 2
you go get a copy
I didn't say buy it I just said get a
copy yes dig up your oldest is somehow
owned it yes somehow acquire anyway so
like you said
up next is we have got mo
with hard drive recovery yep which would
that which that was pretty and it's a
lot of information yeah
it's it's definitely I need to know just
right there yeah
definitely and but then after that we
have the hacker arcade you thought the
you thought my arcade was cool you need
to check out what's what these guys did
so stay tuned after that so so here with
Scott Moulton from forensics strategy
services and you just did an interesting
talk here its MOOC on about reanimating
that are drives and I think it's really
a concern that all geeks have that fear
that one day you're going to boot up and
it's all gone and I guess it's not the
if it's more or less than 1 because that
owner Atlanta they're all gonna die it's
really scary thinking so you did an
interesting presentation where you
really broke down how the harddrive
works and how you can use some tools to
recover data and some common problems
one in particular and I'm sure we're all
familiar with the click of death right
just sound so cool but you know who has
an adage hard drive that's gone into
clicky clacking mode when that happens
what do you do well because the motors
spinning and the board still seems like
it's supplying power in a lot of cases
it's not going to be the PCB board and a
lot of people are trying to swap the
platters and things like that to try to
get that problem soft instead of doing
something like a PCB board where you're
not going to actually read anything back
but it's a fairly complicated problem
and it's not a really easy problem to
solve it's better to be knowledgeable
about what the problem is and if you
have at least tried or practiced doing
some of the either head replacement or
the platter replacements yourself you'll
at least have some sort of a success but
you at least need to know that that's a
very difficult problem to solve and it
putting in the freezers not gonna solve
your problem right those live tails that
put in the freezer where you drop it you
know flat from 2 feet and then it will
come back and I don't know if any of
those wait
I mean you've probably seen more hard
drives than I have so is there any merit
to any of that stuff well if you put it
in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes in a
lot of cases you will actually be able
to see
data it will it causes a metal to
contract and the head might pull away
from the platter but then you also have
the condensation problem or some other
problem that's going to be introduced in
about ten minutes from the time that it
starts running and so you may do further
damage to it especially if you're not
really quick at getting that content off
your drive and you just can't copy that
much that fast hard drives like to be
about 42 degrees or so and you can
probably actually get more accomplished
at 42 degrees if you can figure out how
to keep it at that temperature without
having condensation and I think my
computer runs at 42 degrees Celsius so
yeah yeah that's probably right it's
probably pretty hot so hopefully if it's
a Mac from what I understand Smart is
just a way to score or to get an idea of
where your drive health is and you're
assertive at the bad block list where is
really the difference between those like
well the bad block list is is what and
it existed prior to smart or anything
else smarts whole point in life is to be
a predictive failure type analysis tool
and so it's supposed to be able to tell
you that I've got too many bad BOTS
coming up or that I've got problems with
heat insensitivity and keep track of
those things there's a number of them
and they vary by manufacturer and what
thresholds are for smart to report that
something's good or bad that's happening
to your drive but it's entire life was
just meant to be a predictive failure so
that you could copy your data off of a
drive that was dying if you had some
sort of a warning and that's what it was
meant to do and are there any tools that
you recommend to actually check out you
know like like Hardware errors yes
they're just the smart stuff there is a
couple of free packages that are really
high-end diagnostic tools and there is a
piece of software that's called M HDD
and M HDD and Victoria are both written
by Russian people and there's English
versions of them and it seems that they
had some really high-end training in
data recovery and working on some
hardware and other software that they
had had previously done their software
looks like it's modeled after a lot of
that and it can tell you certain things
like how long a sector is taking to read
and be destructive on that or it can
the smart table and tell you what kind
of errors and things that you're having
and track it over time but it can also
do some data recovery routines and
things along the way and the other
really good big benefit that it has to
is that it skips the bias so if you have
a hard drive that doesn't mount that you
might actually be able to skip the bias
and talk directly to the drive using
these tools and not have to try to wait
for your system to show up in that table
a lot of people are under the
misconception that when your system
starts if it doesn't show your drive in
the table yeah you hang onto many of
hard drives have stuck on the shelf
labeled bad because it didn't show up in
the BIOS and I can't get any other BIOS
to read it so I'm like well so much for
that drive right it's not a problem with
the BIOS from that standpoint there's
things that you can do sometimes in talk
directly to the hard drive itself and
that's what M HDD will do right off the
bat I might be able to get some like
quick basic files back from the early
90s right one thing I can tell you
that's a really good benefit too is if
you find these old Adaptec 1200 a
controllers these old Adaptec 1200 a
controllers are basically m HDD was
written around some of the ability that
that thing has to actually talk to the
drive and do some recovery and use it as
a secondary controller and you can find
them for like ten and twelve bucks on
eBay now so they're really helpful for
you if you're going to use them HDD okay
now before we get into more of the
recovery stuff what to do let's let's
understand a bit more about hard drives
and how they work because you were
mentioning earlier that the that the
heads have actually changed recently and
then even after that there's been
changes to the platters so what are
those major changes in the you were
saying mr heads and whatnot the mr head
is primarily the head that we used in
the 90s and we have switched now to
something called the GM our head so the
GM our head is a lot more sensitive and
can read smaller areal densities so it
has allowed us to move from say a 10 or
a 20 gig hard drug into the 500 gig
range at the same time we also have
other issues with areal density causing
problems as it has increased and so a
lot of manufacturers now switching to
what's called the perpendicular heads
and the perpendicular heads basically
changed the direction that they write
instead of doing north and south along
the draw
they write up and down and so the
platter has been made a little bit
deeper with some softer layers in
between and some changes were made to
the actual material that you use for a
platter to possibly be glass or a
ceramic glass so that the perpendicular
drives can write more data to that and
get a higher density for the drive when
it comes to drive recovery and like
imaging to other drives and stuff like
that what kind of tips would you give
for that and what kind of software do
you use you know before you send it off
to someplace to be you know opened up
and and you know done in a cleanroom
professionally what would you use at
home well the very first thing that I
would do is it depends on the drive to
if it's not spending up or anything like
that you know you're already dealing
with some sort of a hardware error it is
easy enough to look at the board that is
on your hard drive because it's
primarily for screws and you can take
him off and look at your board and
sometimes you'll just see a burn spot on
it and if you do then you know you're
dealing with something that's fairly
easy from a standpoint of just replacing
that board but you've got to find the
right board to put on it but if your
hard drive is working and it's
physically spinning and you can do some
things if it can't mount them by us then
you can obviously look at it with em HDD
and see if you can actually talk
directly to the hard drive and do
anything but if it's still mounting in
the bias and even like windows can see
it but it's going really slow and having
some sector problems or something like
that you want to do what you can to
minimize scanning the whole hard drive
or trying to read every sector off that
hard drive because you may get a failure
in between so one of the tools I use is
from run time software there's a program
that's called NTFS Explorer or something
along those lines and it basically
allows you like if you have a Windows
drive and you want to know exactly where
your your My Documents folder is if it
can read the MFT and not have to scan
the rest of the hard drive it'll tell
you all the sectors and you'll be able
to just click on that folder and say
save this folder and because that way
you're not doing the windows folder or
the you know something along those lines
that's completely unnecessary but if
there's an other data recovery software
like there's some packages like run our
studio something along those lines and
our studio will scan the entire hard
drive to tell you what files and
categories you can get back and it may
be necessary to do that if you can't
read a table or something along those
lines but I would say anything you can
do to minimize
the amount of time and how hard you're
hitting that hard drive is going to be a
necessity okay so if windows completely
borked but you think you may be able to
get you know some data off the drive
what kind of views any like live CDs or
anything like that I will use lot CDs I
will use any method I can whatsoever to
get data back from a drive if I can so
if I have problems with NTFS and NTFS
isn't working right because Linux does a
great job with handling NTFS and
read-only mode things like that
sometimes I can actually read the files
out of the system just using a boot CD
from a bunt to or something like that
and copying my files off reformat the
hard drive what about imaging is there
anything that you need to be concerned
about like if you were to take you know
like I think this one's on the brink of
what's now and you wouldn't take an
identical one and and transfer you know
a bit for bit over what are the kind of
things that we want to look for all
right we do that well one of the cool
things is it doesn't have to be an
identical Drive this is one of those
unique situations where if you're trying
to do some imaging that because drives
have cash on them and they're trying to
read forward they're trying to read from
the zero sector all the way through the
max LBA sector there is a chance that by
turning off either the DMA and going
with pio mode that you might actually be
able to image that drive at a slower
speed or that you can do it in Reverse
which means that my cash is off I'm
basically not using cash because cash is
a pre cash and is looking forward right
so there is a free program out there
that some Linux people know about
it's called DD rescue and DD Rescue has
a specific switch in it to allow you to
start at max LBA and go to zero instead
of zero - max LBA
so you may be able to accomplish imaging
your drive and then use the second layer
actually going for the files or whatever
it is because it's it's independent of
operating system at that point in time
you're making a complete image of it and
then going for the data inside the image
so that you're not still dealing with
your bad hard drive one let's kind of
strange question that's always been on
my mind is that when it comes to and I
hope this isn't a religious debate like
Vai and Emacs but
or you know a TA and scuzzy drives is
really a difference in their longevity
well I think that because the scuzzy
platform is still made but a little bit
better they're more expensive there's
more poured into them they're firmwares
a little bit better things like that
that's why we're not seeing the
tremendous jumps in size either that
we're seeing in the IDE worlds that it's
all about the dollar and trying to
squeeze as much as you can down I would
still say that there probably is a lot
better of a lifespan with with speci
hard drives than there is with IDE hard
drives and I'm certainly seeing some
major things there from a standpoint of
timeframes because prior to 2000 they
may have been pretty close to the same
because the head technology was fairly
similar but now I think that they're in
such a hurry to use all the new heads to
make a higher capacity drive that we're
dealing with things like there's a brand
new head that's about to come out that
Fujitsu has kind of rebuilt which is a
seven-layer head called the colossal
head so it's going to be able to read
much more amounts of data at a smaller
amount well so I really think that we
are looking at the fact being that a
scuzzy is going to last longer and seems
to have a better life span than what
we're seeing in IDE but we also have
smaller quantities now yeah so now we're
dealing with tons and thousands of IDE
hard drives out there and constantly
we're going to have something so
inexpensive now that you could pick up
you know 2 500 gigs for $300 and read
them right you know not really have to
worry too much I agree and I recommend
it for everybody especially if you've
got critical data on a workstation doing
like an IDE raid 5 would be my highest
recommendation ok well thanks so much
for coming on and vast resources of
information where can they find more
information about you and the stuff that
you do with forensic strategy services
my hard drive died calm that is my
primary website for doing that stuff and
on a presentation page there's all kinds
of information about serial numbers and
replacements of hard drives and a
variety of things so my hard drive DICOM
is the best place all right thanks so
much Scott thank you
all right so now we're standing here in
the hacker arcade at shmoocon and with
me I have Ryan and David and if you look
behind me here you'll see duck hunt on a
projector what do we got going on over
here like what's the deal well
essentially we bail we both rune arcade
box just with the Linux box from 700
megahertz Pentium 3 we like cut open the
coin acceptor to the side of the machine
and basically made it so that you could
have side poins and launch the game in
addition to which it's controlled by the
Nintendo Wiimote system just add a touch
of irony to it since intended says so
hasn't come out with their own version
of hunt for the Wii so we beep into the
chase the coin acceptor he gets a little
technical essentially it's basically
just a serial cable attached to itself
it's a loopback cable but the data wires
I think five and six are not wrong but
they're basically crossed and
disconnected until the coin is dropped
where they're connected for short second
and there's some modifications that are
created to the put to the shmoo groups
code that essentially allow it to
basically send signals to itself and not
pay and listen to itself and not be able
to do anything until the coin is dropped
and that launches a campaign which is
emulated and key emulation is actually
very hard so so the the coin slot which
you've got going on is like is it just
like when the coin drops through it
bridges the connections or do you have a
micro switch down there yeah that's
essentially it I mean it's it's pretty
much a cheapest way to go I mean this
and how much did that coin acceptor cost
like 30 bucks um I was a little more
expensive than I thought it was but it's
still T it's still cheaper you know then
you know buying an arcade machine so
what else can you tell us about what's
going on up here like I see the IR thing
up there David did that I just kind of
helped him put it together and then so
another interesting part is actually how
they're distributing the point systems
like for for instance we tried to have
it so if you score a certain point
amount you would get sort of tokens
shmoo ball return fire here we go there
you go so okay there we go so they have
some crypto code that generates keys and
like gives you guys tokens for how many
points you get so on top of the coolness
of the arcade we're giving out points on
USB thumb drives which are redeemable
for merchandise at the end of the shrew
con so it's pretty cool so now I noticed
one thing when I was playing it is that
the accelerometers work but they since
the the IR isn't working for the
triangulation of location yeah there it
is if anybody that's unfamiliar with the
Wiimote everything's done over Bluetooth
all the buttons and all the motions sent
sent over bluetooth but it uses the
infrared for triangulation so when you
can do this it senses you're moving left
or right but it'll also give you the
location on the screen and I know
there's a Windows version but you said
you had problems with the Linux driver
for the Wiimote yeah there's actually a
couple of different Linux drivers
available they all use lib Lee mode at
its core but the original one that we
went with wmd which I think stands for
we want a moat damn it which that's not
actually real acronym but that's what
they called it basically sucked up
around 75% of the CPU cycles available
and when you're emulating stuff on top
of that it basically became completely
useless and was totally bricked so we
just dumped that driver altogether
because we just didn't have a choice and
it did use the infrared sensor and
everything like that we found another
one at the last minute called seaweed
that that's written in C and it was a
lot better in principle performance
although we kind of uncertain Zout how
to sacrifice the calibration for the
infrared as a result but you know a
little tit for tat whatever
last minute when he says last minute he
means last minute this was like well
this morning like like 1 o'clock this
morning getting the remote to work so
everything that could went wrong with
this arcade box has gotten wrong so yes
yes indeed yes indeed my friend Murphy
strikes again whoa and again and again
all right thank you so much fellas
greatly appreciate it yes yes it's been
uh oh you like this lightning-fast
reflexes you know what before you even
cuts it oh I miss because I threw
left-handed yeah and you throw like a
girl all right catch y'all later okay so
I'm standing here with a Babak from tool
here at shmoocon and so let's cut
straight to it
what is tool what's tool all about well
tool stands for the open organization of
lock Pickers it's been around in one
form or another for quite some time
actually the original organization
started in the Netherlands I think
almost over 20 years ago is no longer
around in this original form but most of
the members that were part of that are
now part of tool there's also four bins
for quite some time other organizations
and other European countries about lock
picking you have ss dev in Germany and
you have you know some guys in France
and the UK and there was actually quite
a few organizations like this that have
been around in Europe and a while ago we
stood that you know it was about time
that we have a u.s. division of
something like this and so I ended up me
and some other people got a hold of the
tool people Barry wells in Hana Fay and
the rest of the group and after some
talks we decided it would be about time
to formally start a u.s. division here
and it turned out really well so far
we're all about the the sport and the
hobby of picking where we don't actually
really concentrate on bypass methods for
actual doors or anything like that but
it's a really fun hobby it's a it's a
particular form of hacking that almost
anyone can wrap their minds around you
don't have to have you know years and
years of experience
you know in some dark basement you know
hacking away at code to be able to do
this with the really bad monitors an
absolutely absolutely and it's it's it's
one of the forms of hacking that I think
most people can don't have any trouble
relating to everyone understands they do
even if they don't end up going through
with actually using it as a hobby
everyone understands that never will and
can has some sort of interest in it so
it's been really rewarding and that is
in that respect right now I obviously
like the whole idea of lock-picking come
has become part of you know a bad stigma
and so do you guys ever catch any flack
about that from any kind of law
enforcement you know not really at all
actually as part of tool tool is
recognized as one of the more
prestigious and well-established
lock-picking organizations as part of
our member list we have actually already
quite a few police officers that are
part of tool firemen and we have some
few detectives people with military
backgrounds we have informal
relationships with certain lock
manufacturers for testing product
samples tools actually pretty serious
organisation and we actually really
aren't hassle as much as you know you
might think otherwise but overall the
that cut the feedback that we've gotten
has always been very very supportive
from all aspects from you know normal
average people to hackers to you know
you know different different cops and
whatnot it's always it's always pretty
good we're very very serious about our
ethical procedures and processes as far
as the organisation goes and we try our
very best to instill that into all of
our members so at this point you're
pretty much like any kind of white-hot
security professional to put it in that
kind of context absolutely a hundred
percent ok so uh for people that are
interested in getting into the hobby of
lock-picking uh where could you know
what's a good place to start well
there's a quite a few different forums
and different guides and whatnot you can
find online we do have links to quite a
few different resources on our us web
site tool
us that's two or three OS us and in our
resources area we have links to the
guide formerly known as the MRT at the
MIT guide to lock-picking it's an oldie
but it's a goodie it has a lot of
pertinent information in there we also
have links to forums and dvn Olaf's
website about lock-picking and some
different starting points there for you
well that's really really interesting
and thank you so much for being here
greatly appreciate it and thanks for my
block picking kid too so thanks a lot
okay so that's pretty much gonna wrap up
finally this episode of the shmoocon
special hak5
thank ya 3 we've got a bunch of people
that we need to thank real quick pretty
much happening oh yeah
first of all Rodney and mu bik's for
hooking us up with the press passes
getting the podcast meetup thing going
on
it's getting the ball rolling with that
and also a Mark Martin McKee was part of
that yeah as well as Paul comecomecome
and the cyber speed come and split cast
in fact you were just recently on I was
on to episode of speaketh on their
should move on special yeah a trend here
it's meta and yeah and then we were on
pot I come to come to come and that was
a lot of fun yeah that was pretty funny
the sweetest yes ice naked half naked
stickers check them out it's a really
good security podcast it's really worth
listening to really entertaining I
pulled a common through browser and hit
ctrl enter yes
that's my box right here yeah okay
haven't used that one in a while we're
going to be moving to a dedicated server
the web the forum's in the site and the
wacky that's all growing so you may
notice some 404s was the transition just
emails to the aunts and bad links if and
right there yeah if anything's horribly
broken let us know all the hamsters to
start spinning a little bit faster we'll
give them some steroids also we're on
the latest episode of leat by math club
you can check out the clip here in just
a second yeah let's just go ahead and
roll the clip
we've established a connection to jog or
vicious blackberry and its accompanying
systems so did we know where Chris is no
that's on a separate system listen
whoever programmed this thing is
probably leave themselves fraught
thirteen well we can't exactly find out
where he is as it stands but we can use
the e-911 GPS to figure out where drug
war bitch is hopefully that'll give us
that what's amazing yeah could we ask
any work yeah we suck after doing a few
podcast thingy we might get kind of used
to being in front of you know not so
much much alright and I think about the
last thing oh right before that we need
to thank our awesome host dream host who
has been supporting us from the
beginning with 1-click installs and the
two terabytes of transfers and you know
hundred gigs of storage and if you're
looking for web space and it looks like
something that you might be interested
in we've got a coupon code that'll save
you $25 on your purchase that's coupon
code hak5 when you checkout that
supports the show and we think that's
awesome that you're supporting us and we
greatly appreciate okay
now pack five radio act five radio uh
some of you are familiar with it some of
you are well hack five radio was not is
not owned or operated by us but it was
the official radio of yeah pack five
radio is no more no no it's merged well
think of boomers getting to that okay
pack five radio no longer exists all the
resources of hack five radio including
its owner have merged with kgm our radio
comma had to think about it for a second
said no more questions with the
trademarking stuff no no it's going to
be completely legitimate according to
the new like loyalty laws not the
royalties yeah it's ridiculous but it's
going to be completely legal that's why
it's been done so we can kind of share
resources and everything so check it out
kgm our radio calm and I'm sure the heck
I've radioed on will point there as well
yeah why not sure get on that mess
poor guys in there like taking notes
while he watches the show what do I have
to do next yeah yeah anyway thank you so
much movies for the awesome meetup
movies and bigger
Tigger's yeah kg mr he's been doing some
great work for us he'll be on the next
episode hopefully we've got some clips
need to get out of the way which brings
us to the next episode and all the fun
stuff with that as you know if you've
been watching through the first season
we do 10 months on and 2 months off for
the sanity which we're slowly losing and
that means that the next episode 2x10
will be the last one for a little bit
and then it will come back again what
season finale yeah all those fifth is
the return date yes three xo1 so may 5th
that's a Saturday in Cinco de Mayo oh is
it really
DeMaio means yeah okay yeah the big
Mexican holiday yeah and the hamster
going anyway long story short Cinco de
Mayo falls on a Saturday yes
season finale very huge party up here at
the new techno lust house or whatever
and technical back house or whatever you
want to call it Studio B and we are
going to be throwing a huge bash on
opening night which won't be late like
this episode is sorry and we kind of
lost the guest list
so if you're on it just email me if
you're not and you're not like to be and
you'd like if you're in the Williamsburg
Richmond Newports crater area Hampton
Roads area if you're if you're down with
the two three one eight eight two seven
five seven numskull two three one eighty
eight so zip code yeah but you got to be
down with the seven five seven yeah I'm
really white sorry they white balance on
my arm actually anyway we're throwing a
huge party come on down it's gonna be a
lot of fun we'll probably webcast it as
well or something
yeah well there'll be some kind of
livestream so a bunch of drunk SOPs can
be fun yes and I guess if that's it Oh
standard fare
forms forms IRC firstly the heck puppet
or show notes on the wiki hak5 devilish
wiki call the printed information it's
at the bottom screen and in the little
place where you downloaded this if you
weren't on it thank you for supporting
thank you for watching and from the red
couch here at the hack house we remind
you trust you Tecna lust
ramble anymore that's mad I had a lot of
fun with it
what was I talking about again you
started over so that just about wraps up
this episode of hack farm my crib
hello can you hear me sweetums yeah
Kirby you put your butt in this shot I
was trying to roll with it but I knew
that it was gonna be bad
all right now we're good we'll save it
for the I'll take money these guys got
to get back to the hack this episode
this month's episode is a special hence
it's a long short bus Ali Mike her up
for last month's trivia forget what
we're doing right there I'm just saying
after that Billy offer mm-hmm
it's music guitar okay so this just
about wraps everything up
it looks cool that guys wearing a
t-shirt yeah please don't use that
okay so that's just about wraps is he
whoa it's like season one again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
