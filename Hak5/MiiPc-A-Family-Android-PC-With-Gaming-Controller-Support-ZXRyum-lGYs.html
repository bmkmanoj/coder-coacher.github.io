by Toyota with hack 5 I'm Shannon Morris
coming to you from CES 2014 at
showstoppers and I found Richard at me
PC Richard how are you doing tonight
thank you thank you for having us
absolutely now I saw this and I thought
it was pretty cool it's probably one of
the coolest things here to be honest the
vp c is for in it's an android-powered
family pc is that correct that's correct
it's more than an Android of what we
have done is we have the redefined
family computing what we have here is an
Android powered family device it's a
mini PC it can run all kinds of Android
apps available in the App Store it can
it comes with HDMI connector so you hook
up to your big-screen TV become the
media center streaming content video but
what's really exciting today is we're
announcing the gaming capability so
leverage leveraging the ups of the shelf
game controller you can play many
Android games
what kind of games can I play a lot of
games are kids friendly games like or d2
Kanaka new what's really fun is a lot of
games are really designed for Android
tablets and how do you provide that
experience onto a bigger screen TV but
while providing a safeguard environment
through our parental control that is
really cool
now I also notice that this is for a
family so do you have ways of you know
protecting your children if they want to
browse on the internet and things like
that yes Sammy PC the heart of my PC
comes with parental control is a
cloud-based technology that we have
developed over the years what it does is
we provide a set a guideline to how a
family to create some kind of Gatineau
guidance right how do you want your kids
to access internet playing games one of
the core issue we're attacking is the
addictiveness of surfing the web playing
games so through the mobile app the
parents can start to have a conversation
with their kids what kind of games that
you would like to run what website you
would like to serve and provide this a
very healthy dialogue that's such a
great idea I love this idea it's really
cool it's nice and safe for the children
and
parents can still have fun with it too
now I also noticed that there's a bunch
of different inputs going on here so can
I use my tablet but can I move to like a
keyboard and a mouse if I wanted to yeah
so let me show you here this is an
Android device it has 3 USB connectivity
so you can hook up to your keyboard if
you have a USB keyboard HDMI connector
so perfect for a big-screen TV or you
have a HDMI monitor building Wi-Fi
Ethernet building Bluetooth speaker out
we have external SD slot so it provides
a lot of connectivity to do a lot of
different things for you that's so fun I
love this idea it's so cool now I know
you started I was a Kickstarter funded
on Kickstarter the very first day so we
exceeded 3x initially the project was we
all have kids and we talk about the
internet addiction how do we overcome
that so it turned into something we
think it's cool but we're not sure if
that's the problem many people are
facing today
so Kickstarter is a launch pad to
validate the concept and we got
overwhelming a response from them what
congratulations on the Kickstarter so if
I want to go online where can I find
this how much does it cost you can go to
me PC comm there's a lot of information
there we have a lot of different support
inflammation from we right now we are
selling on amazon.com
we just finished fulfilling all the
Kickstarter backers so use that big
milestone for us but you can find this
on amazon.com and if you want to find
out all the available information EPC
has some great resources and what's the
price 1:29 for basic model that has one
gig internal ddr memory plus 4 gig and
149 for a total amount of memory oh I
didn't notice there's an SD card slot on
the front so does that mean I can do
expandable memory yes you can either use
a USB thumb nail drive plug into the
back of me PC can more memory or SD card
that's awesome I love this idea this is
really cool and I can't wait to check it
out myself so
