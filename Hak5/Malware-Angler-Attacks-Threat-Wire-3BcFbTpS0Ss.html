hits thousands an open source router
firmware is officially going bye-bye all
that coming up now on threat wire hello
world I'm Shannon Morse and this a
threat wire for March 16 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom first off
patrons be on the lookout for a new
security episode by Darren kitchen this
month it will be on the patreon feed by
the end of the month and of course if
you want early access to extras check
out our patreon page at patreon.com /
threat wire onto the news this one being
about malware now while I am totally
down to not block ads on sites that I
like to support also thank you for your
support sometimes there's a really good
reason to just block all the things
enter angler and rig a couple of
toolkits that started pushing malicious
banner ads through an ad network that
was compromised this exploit is called
malvert izing which happens when
malicious code is injected into a legit
online ad network or web page in this
case reported by malwarebytes two
domains bought in late February and for
ad networks from google app nexus AOL
and rubicon were the culprits serving up
malicious ads to legit sites such as msn
com BBC xfinity calm and even more Trend
Micro has reported that the campaign may
have affected tens of thousands of users
in the past 24 hours alone as of March
14th when a user visits and infected
site the ads redirect them to a Trojan
file and a piece of ransomware which
both get downloaded to their computer to
keep yourself safe from malvert izing a
user can block ads and uninstall adobe
flash java and Microsoft Silverlight
since angler targets those third-party
add-ons also make sure your browser is
up-to-date and 64-bit not 32 if you've
ever bought a tp-link router for your
network you are probably aware of the
fact that you could install open source
router firmware on the device be it open
wrt dd-wrt etc etc etc and that these
firmware options could remove clunky
router gooeys that came pre-installed on
the devices not to mention probably help
you with security now the FCC has passed
their new
regulation stating that hardware
manufacturers need to block the ability
for users to install third-party
firmware that could allow them to change
RF parameters such as country codes
frequency limits and output power
however open source firmware is still
allowed in general if the hardware
manufacturers put some sort of controls
in place for these parameters now
because of the new regulations tp-link
has officially complied with the FCC and
public statements made on their website
regarding any routers made after June
second 2016 tp-link is the first router
manufacturer to issue a statement about
the FCC rulings so this ruling was past
due to the FAA finding some interfering
equipment being used at and around
airports which affected their
terrestrial Doppler weather radar
systems so the FAA pushed the FCC to
update governing rules which all router
manufacturers in the US have to comply
with now with so many router
manufacturers not pushing updates as
quickly as they should or completely
ignoring older devices until we are
forced to upgrade to keep our home
network secure this is definitely a law
that we need to discuss if only phone
carriers and router makers were more
keen on keeping their products up to
date with in this fast-paced time of
security flaws and privacy issues but
that seems to be only a dream maybe they
should take a note from open source
firmware creators mmm I would tips when
running a security company yeah that was
the headline of a hacker easing from the
attacker of a security company whose
websites and servers went down this
weekend stamina smarted as a hosting and
DDoS protection company posted on their
social networks that they had
experienced an outage due to a quote
rare event unquote but not necessarily
stating that it was due to an attack on
their servers so later a data dump of
information pertaining to their
customers was made public with names
email addresses database routing tables
and a lot more now according to the dump
the company was storing credit cards in
plain text but that hasn't been
confirmed now if plaintext credit cards
were stored by a security company it's
not only a huge failure of trust but
also a violation of PCI compliance which
can come with some crazy
hefty fees from credit card companies
like Visa and MasterCard stamina says
not provided much of a clear public
response about the breach on their
platforms as of time of recording which
has really disappointed many of their
users but servers do appear to be back
online now early access to show
