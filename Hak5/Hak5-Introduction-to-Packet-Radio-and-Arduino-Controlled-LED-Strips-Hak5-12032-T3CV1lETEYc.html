by teen you can actually take the online
exact private exams for free so there's
a couple of those as well that's
interesting and realize that it's
actually the amateurs that are testing
the potential amateurs within the radio
clubs it's not formalized through the
government or or has that worked i guess
they submit paperwork back to the FCC
because from what i understand in order
to do any of this you have to become
licensed you get a call sign and and
then you have to transmit that I you
know that's about the extent of my
knowledge on that absolutely so so what
the FCC does is they regulate the
airwaves right to control all the
airwaves in the in the US as you know
and they work with recipients as well
and they regulate the licensing for the
ham radio operator the training though
is actually on the part of the clubs and
the amateurs and the volunteers that
support amateur radio and so they do the
regulation part the licensing part but
as far as in the end the testing they
actually do the testing where you have
trained instructors that are volunteers
normally they easily have one or two
Proctor's or folks that can x eight
minutes or the test and then they will
score the exam then they will forward
those results to the FCC within
processes the paperwork which in a
database and then it will mail you your
certificate with your call sign so they
do the Miss rate of stuff but not so
much the training stuff but they control
the the testing and the questions the
test banks all kind of thing so they got
people actually volunteer to help put
together the testing and the questions
but then the actual individual clubs for
the city is actually have a proctor taxi
administrator and so the FCC will
license you to be able to broadcast on
VHF or uhf here in the United States and
now I can only assume is it like like
Wi-Fi and how that on the is M band like
2.4 gigahertz we have 11 channels
available to us and then the the
International Telecommunications Union
works with other countries around the
world to make sure that all of those
frequencies are the same no matter where
you go so you know if you go to Japan
the same
aim you know channel 13 there's channel
13 I guess we can't use that in USC I
understand Wi-Fi and I understand that
that that that's the aspect of it that
the itu makes sure that everybody's on
the same frequency do you have to you
know is there like a is that an issue
when it comes to ham or you know as VHF
VHF everywhere that's that's a great
question so yes the the FCC works with
all the other governmental bodies around
the world and they came up with
standards and so basically 144 dot you
know 550 frequency is the same as it is
in South America and there's what they
call reciprocal licensing so basically I
could even go to Canada for example in
broadcast from Canada because if the US
has a reciprocal license with that
country we can travel back and forth
same for the frequencies right the
frequencies are the same whether they're
here or in China some frequencies are
more restrictive obviously like fire and
police and military they have their own
bounds but there's a there's a very wide
range of common band with common bands
that we all communicate on that's that's
the whole thing for for amateur radio is
we want to be able to pick up the
frequency and call somebody in China or
call somebody over in Europe so they've
worked very hard for and its business
been around for a hundred years so
they've worked out the frequencies the
reciprocal agreements you know it's it's
it's all pretty much done now and it's
not like anybody at any country can like
opt out it's you know because the
inherent nature of radio if you want a
broadcast on this frequency to China
China doesn't get to say at their
borders you know no no frequencies
coming here exactly what some of the
restrictive countries for example North
Korea you know they do not allow ham
radio operators because they don't want
information to leak out so what they do
is they restrict the ownership of a
radio they can't really control the air
wave but they can control the hardware
meaning not letting it get in there and
let people use it so there are some
countries that are very restrictive and
they don't allow people to legally be a
amateur radio operator but for the most
part a lot of countries do including
China and Japan Japan's one of the
largest you know of folks that have a
ham radio operators licensing so to me
about some of the restrictions here in
the United States I mean obviously the
restriction is I can't just go out by
radiance are transmitting without a
license so one I have to get licensed
and then you get a call sign I'm
assuming part of the paperwork is
actually registering in the database
kind of like a whois database of like
yes yeah so here's my name here's my
address and all of that stuff so there's
your identification in Andhra and so
what about monitoring for instance so
when you use ham radio or packet radio
can you use encryption to thwart
monitoring or at least make monitoring
less important because it is thus
encrypted great question alright so the
promis-- of amateur radio which was
started about a hundred years ago and I
heard this December it'll be a hundred
years since it was the birth of amateur
radio it was on the promis-- that it
would be a very low cost license issued
by the government on the premises for
general public use meaning that security
wasn't wasn't around at the time so
everything was open right and packet
radio wasn't available at the time so it
was all just voice communications as
time is marched on the pc has met the
radio hence we have air mail and these
kind of things to do do packet radio but
technically the rules has still governed
by the FCC that that's not to be you
know profanity you know you're supposed
to have a good code of conduct and
you're supposed to broadcast your your
station identification every every
basically 10 minutes in some form and
that could be you know either voice or
through a system that basically it's
like Morse code but you're not supposed
to technically encrypt data over the SEC
airwaves now whether people do it or not
that's up to how they do it but as per
the FCC definition you're not supposed
to broadcast encrypted data
can you get fines or go to jail if
you're actually like say for instance i
want to send email but i want to use
like PGP to encrypt it with like public
and private keys i send that over VHF
the FCC hears that they can't decode it
they get upset I'm not going to
Guantanamo Bay what's going on here yeah
well they do okay so there are people
that monitor the airways basically
they're volunteers for the FCC and in
the old days you know the kind of the
old-timers didn't get involved in email
and broadcasting and a Christian data
type thing so the world's changed now
and now we have younger people coming
out they know about PGP they know about
encryption you know I went to see mail
this encrypted somehow the rules that
stated that there was to be no no
security that were an inspector meaning
monies people that volunteer that to
make sure that rules are being followed
didn't have access to so the rules state
that the inspector is still supposed to
be able to have access to those data so
as if you were supposed to you could use
PGP for instance if say you published
your private key openly and thus or give
it to the inspector and thus you know
nullifying the whole point a good point
there yeah again that goes back to you
know the whole amateur radio system was
designed as a hobby as type thing and
and it's supposed to be open its open
system open shared whether people do
their security you know is really how
they do how they manage their their data
flow but their sec rules are pretty
clear as to what you can do what you
can't do and that's part of your job as
an amateur radio operator is to find out
what these rules are will they change
that to say okay we can allow a person
to encrypt a tether at their computer
and then transmit it and that's that's
still under discussion right now but
right now it's a public domain it's kind
of like you know they can't cuss
listening to your favorite radio station
on the air you know there's rules and
come
to follow it's the same thing with with
being an amateur radio operator so I
think things are going to change but
right now they're they're pretty strict
as to open communication for everybody
you know we're not going to keep any
secrets and whatnot know those kind of
things um I think as a younger people
come in that can help change some of
those rules but right now that's there
they're pretty strict on that it's kind
of interesting to think like that I've
been going off lately about how much I
loved hang and it is for good reason
this is actually my personal setup I've
got two accounts with ting I love these
devices it has been rock solid and let
me tell you I'm so happy to see that you
guys have been checking out the service
too they are doing some fantastic jobs
shaking up the cell industry with their
customer first approach and it is a
godsend if you haven't heard what I'm
talking about ting is an awesome service
that brings clarity usability and big
savings to mobile phone users so ting
get this just has one simple plan honest
offerings it's megabytes minutes and
text messages all billed separately I
know it's so great you don't have to get
some package you don't have to worry
about you know going over some plan and
having some ridiculous fees you just pay
one fee for each thing it's no BS real
simple check it out at ting calm / hak5
they've got an online savings calculator
and if you're ready to get started get
this they're gonna hook hak5 fans up
with $75 off your first month of service
just for being act 5 you or it's so cool
all you have to do is go over to ting
calm / hak5 and the coupon will be
activated it's just that simple with
tang
they're they're pretty strict on that
it's kind of interesting to think of
like how that you know compares to the
Internet where you know as far as
monitoring is concerned you can use
whatever encryption you want as far as
identification is concerned there's you
know ways to get online without having
to well obviously don't need a license
to be on the Internet as we know from
youtube comments and you don't you know
you could potentially be anonymous if
you go through enough hoops of course
the difference there is that there's the
control I mean as we saw in like Egypt a
whole country can just turn off the
internet you can't turn off VHF you
can't turn off hf I mean I'm sure you
could jam it but for the most part you
know nobody can just press a button and
turn off all the ham radio operators at
that very good very good point yeah
absolutely yeah that's where the
government I think I'm just speaking you
know in my thoughts that the government
saying hey if you have if if you're
broadcasting you got to follow our rules
because we're there FCC rules but we
have to be allowed to at least you know
inspect you know we have to listen to
your voice you know I make sure that
you're not cussing and st. profanity
it's fascinating because online you can
say whatever you want you know there's
no limitations you can drop f-bombs all
day long absolutely you can but but uh
it was kind of like like I said it was a
hobbyist gentleman's a club that was
formed a hundred years ago with a
predicate with the content police saying
like oh I don't approve of of the kind
of stuff you were saying but I mean
we've seen that time and a half again
with like you know shock jocks on FM
radio so this yeah same kind of thing
but i think i said i think the security
things are going to change at the at the
computer level it's as a matter of
changing the FCC rules I'll give another
example remember you know if you look at
a clock radio and it says you know this
device has to accept interference from
sec part 15 15 yeah that's me okay so
that means that i technically now is it
kind of funny but my my amateur radio
can interfere with your clock radio
because i actually trump the rules over
your clock radio so if you get static
and fun
see stuff the rules protect me saying
that I can broadcast and you know sorry
about having interference to your clock
radio now the also rules state that you
need to try to mitigate use filters and
these kind of things to prevent any
harmful interference to a device but the
rules and the laws state that I have
authority over you including your TV so
if I if I you know interfere with your
TV transmission when I broadcast likey
the mike sorry and then you know but I'm
supposed to help mitigate to put filters
on and turn the power down or whatnot so
it's a double-edged sword so what I find
fascinating about ham radio and packet
radio in particular is that unlike Wi-Fi
you can cross Kansas and so while there
has been so many fascinating mesh
networking groups that seattle is known
for their fantastic wireless user groups
that you know put together these mesh
networks these community networks that
are outside the band of the internet
that cannot be controlled the same way
that the internet is cannot be you know
the you know there you can mitigate
monitoring you don't have the same kind
of identification aspects and you can do
whatever content you want over those
networks they're still localized and the
only way to really connect them to other
you know mesh networks is some fantastic
ones that have just learned about in
like Cape Town the only way that Cape
Town is going to speak to Seattle's mesh
network is over like an existing line or
over or how else would you do it and so
that's why I'm fascinated with them ham
radio in that it's you know out of band
and actually has the kind of power to to
actually broadcast globally to actually
cross Kansas because you're not going to
do that with a bunch of Wi-Fi repeaters
absolutely that's right like I said you
know we have the options where we can
bounce signals off satellites we can
bounce signals off the moon we can do a
slow scan TV you can actually broadcast
over amateur radio TV which I'm sure
you're familiar that so the cool thing
about amateur radio is there are lots of
options we have lots of frequencies and
we have lots of tools and it's been
around for a long but it was like you
also have a lot of limitations you know
as far as like you have to get licensed
you can't broadcast this and so when I
look at those community networks
like how would you link those up it
seems like technically feasibility wise
totally there but legally wise not so
much very true everything you're saying
is very true we have lots of
technologies and things we can do lots
of hacking and lots of melding together
of technology between Wi-Fi cellular
microwave all those things that
technology exists where we can inter
interact in interface with a lot of
different things but it does go back to
the rules and goes back to the FCC laws
so
sorry about that what about what about
some of the other frequencies I mean
there's gmrs here's mu RS there's FRS
that the family radio systems the
general radio systems the multi-use
radio systems yeah yeah so so consumers
can use those I know with gmrs you have
to like you do actually have to get a
license in that case but I think you
just send a ten-dollar bill to the FCC
and they say have fun you know can you
do packet radio over anything or are you
limited to only doing it over VHF and
UHF VHF UHF hf e that's pretty much what
it was designed for was old but if you
if you plugged your TNC your your
equivalent of a modem a modulator
demodulator it just turns your bits into
radio instead of the telephone you
plugged it into an FRS radio and you've
got you know 5 10 15 miles range on that
is that legit um yeah actually I haven't
worked with mfrs family radio system as
collect with Mars Mars is the military
something where you can actually talk
from Radio to a family member in Germany
or something yeah I haven't worked with
family radio services using packet radio
or I'm work with Mars or any of those
other ones both been mostly with echo
link when link and some of the you know
the commercial stuff I'm sure you
probably could do packet radio over the
family radio services but I have an
interface what that particular network
before yeah I'm just fascinated by the
idea of like you know like oh once I
realized like wow there's this whole
packet radio thing and really it's just
basically the same thing we're doing
short range high bandwidth with Wi-Fi
how cool would it be to use something
and my hang-up is always you know the
license the identification to content
restriction things of that nature so but
okay so let's dial it back a little and
start talking about the gear so we go
out we get our license yeah we get our
call sign we took those classes so now
we're educated and empowered but now
we've got a laptop when we want to start
broadcasting emails and receiving stuff
how do we
about that you know very questions so
yeah so we know that there's there's a
there's a bay there's a ham radio outlet
and other stores that are mail order or
click brick-and-mortar stores we join a
club and once you get into it some kind
of a radio club those folks start to
train you and teach you how to use
packet radio and what frequencies to use
and normally a club will have its own
frequency so you can communicate with
those members and whatnot the-the-the
there's there's the there's a couple of
different national organizations for ham
radio as well too and so they they can
provide books um they also have videos
online there's some dirt some stuff on
YouTube now on videos so basically to
transmit i mean i have i've literally
built a opinion three laptop out of
Parts I mean it was I was I was out of
two or three broken laptops and i sat on
my kitchen table I put a new screen in
one keyboard on the seller and I kind of
Frankenstein this machine together so I
had a serial port on it my T&amp;amp;C has a
serial port ran you know the other
serial port into the into the end of my
radio and poof I mean I'm broadcasting
that's it that's it so so just a radio
and a TNC and there you go in a laptop
yeah yep and so what are you to those
components do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
