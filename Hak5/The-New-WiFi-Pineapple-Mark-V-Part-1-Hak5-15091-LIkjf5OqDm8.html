domain.com have you guys deal today
thank you so much for coming out to the
mark 5 release oh my god I cannot begin
to tell you how jazzed I am so thank you
to each and every one of you that are
here that are tuning in to the live
stream for letting us live this dream
I'm on cloud nine right now so real
quick before we get into it I do want to
put out a huge thanks to the awesome hat
5 team that has made this happen as well
as all of our spouses and significant
others that have put up with us for the
last six months so so this guy 80 just
saw him he he kind of taught us this
thing at I guess it was Derby con and
that is um well first you drink all the
booze and then you hack all the things
yeah so in order to help you guys
facilitating the drink all the booze
thing what we need are three words we
say these words two words okay let's go
with two we say these two words we have
to drink can I can I get a word anybody
yell out a word okay are we gonna
go with dongs and why fine okay so we're
going with Wi-Fi and and and pineapple
we're not gonna make it through this
deck
all right well without further ado this
right here is sub guys and as everyone
knows Darren I'm Darren and and together
we have joined powers to make epic
pineapple awesomeness everybody of
course on the stream in here should know
but if you don't the Wi-Fi pineapple
basically it's a Wi-Fi hotspot honeypot
it's kind of a man-in-the-middle tool
it's a pen test pivot box can do so many
things but basically small inexpensive
box you can deploy anywhere manage
anywhere totally useful on your hacking
pen test engagement fun stuff and and
art basically what we believe in our
core values is that we want to make easy
to use
affordable and expandable hacker gear
pentest gear hardware the physical
manifestation of hacking you drop it
anywhere and and get your ownage on and
those are have been our core principles
since the very beginning of this project
of course today we're introducing the
mark 5 and this is of course based on
five years of feedback in fact just over
a month ago September 7 2008 was the
pineapples five-year birthday I know the
mark 1 was born in fact hang on oh oh oh
man
we have we have boots now ah that's boot
yes ok yeah this guy so this is the new
pineapple yeah so we thought of a new
design you know that's we think you guys
are going to love it it Scrolls like
butter but in reality I mean as we've
seen the landscape change over the last
5 years with this epic tool it really
comes down to the current generation the
mark for that totally changed everything
because of the new intuitive user
interface we've got the modular
infusions I mean job you freaking came
in out of nowhere I guess out of Germany
and saved me from myself and my really
bad PHP code and kind of like blew it
into orbit like c64 that's cool yeah you
know always so we introduced the new web
interface and kind of you know one of
the biggest I think revolutions of the
pineapple was having a modular cut I'm
sorry I'll talk to Mike more so to have
this modular interface really drink all
right frost so yeah now it's a book yeah
so no really the the whole one of the
biggest things was the the modules are
introduced for the mark 4 yes here here
for yes the thorn not not the bump not
naughty yeah no sir
so uh so introduce these infusions or
modules and that really helped get
community involved in the development
and I guess we we got a lot of feedback
from there a lot of people just aren't
you know code
things that we wouldn't you know what
weren't able to offer out-of-the-box
right before right we had no idea what
was going to happen when we opened it up
and threw in an API and you know people
started hacking at it just got crazy
well so Community Development actually
got expanded there also the fact that we
have us be the first time and a device
kind of allowed to possibly have a
second Wi-Fi interface more storage so
therefore installing things extra
programs logging and so on so that's all
great so we got far without yeah I know
it introduced an amazing this is what it
did and like suddenly you know people
are writing things like SSL strip and D
auth attacks and beacon attacks we got
URL stuff on there man and middle
injection tools we've got site surveys
TCP dump I mean you can even control
your pineapple or text messages exactly
so is that 2 or 1 all right well I'm
three and now so here we go but yeah
that's that's basically what happened
and so through all of that basically
what happened was we kind of got a
little too big for our britches I don't
know if you realized I'm just just a bit
so we started looking I mean as I mean
if naming it the mark two and three and
just kind of like you know says hey
we're gonna make new stuff all the time
coming all the time yeah totally totally
so this one we're launching today is
going to be obsolete in six weeks but
it's cool get anyway but so we start
actually locates coming out coming up
yes so we started looking at some
possible hardware opportunities and
honestly there's nothing else out
there's nothing on the landscape right
now that serves this really unique need
of the hacker and the pen tester and to
be honest this is all subs fault because
had he not come in here and saved me
from my horrible PHP code and enabled us
to be able to do awesome things with
that USB and to be able to do awesome
things with that framework and those
modular you know the modular design of
those over-the-air updates and all that
stuff we wouldn't be having this
conversation
no so the conversation we did have was
well hey what if we could make our own
I'm ready so we did we did so we asked
ourselves what is it that we want in a
Wi-Fi pineapple or use bees no no no no
we don't want more use be we're gonna
have a rat's nest of cables it's gonna
look nasty listen but we need storage we
need
you know I know we knew it all those
things but listen it's I understand that
it's a hacker device but that's no
reason why it can't be elegant and
beautiful let's go so the things we
actually want are your right storage
yeah we want to log stuff we want to
install stuff there's tons of packages
and infusions that can take advantage of
this you know it's embedded Linux let's
go we want radios we're gonna do
advanced attacks you know and we want to
stick to our core values of making it
dead simple to deploy those attacks of
course I'm not discounting USB we
definitely want USB we want solid USB
because we got those you know 3G 4G
modems we get Android tethering and all
of that of course out-of-the-box sure
that's one versatile power you know I
would say we've had so many issues with
mark 4 in regards to power and power is
a tricky issue and we learned so much
and I am so proud that we were able to
do versatile power because I would say
being able to power the mark for off of
USB was huge now it wasn't always as
stable as I would hope but it was huge
in that it was convenient we also want
it to be unbreakable
yeah we've again this is a prom we've
had in the past even though we put many
safeguards in there
your power failures what Wi-Fi I got
thirsty yeah no so we we did have huge
issues in regarding to breaking well not
huge but but people did break their
devices and it was hard to recover
without serial cable or you are cable
not case something I'm so speaking of
Siri we also want to make it totally
expandable because as we've seen you
know with the opportunities that us be
provided with mark 4 and with of course
the software with the new api's and
whatnot it has totally grown and so we
want to stick to that core value so
here's the thing feature wise the mark 5
we are building it on our proven
platform we said this with the mark for
the AR 9330 one is beginning of life it
has got some legs it's got some gams
Ofelia it's a great platform and so we
are building on the AR 93 31 but we're
not stopping there because we are going
to add the infamous
in fact an unlocked Realtek RTL 81 87 a
lot of people call it an alpha it's an
amazing radio as high gain we've got
it's professional I mean we've got SMA
connectors on this thing that are PSMA
stuff this is like so you can put those
professional antennas on this and it
really just you know this is it's just a
fantastic chip absolutely
yeah so we decided to go with those and
let me tell you in fact even beginning
this whole adventure of custom hardware
there were some fun lessons to learn we
can talk about RF diversity
according to putting two of these
devices on one board is appe the FCC had
a lot of fun trying to figure out what
to do with us but we've got it the world
by the way yeah
okay so storage wise we absolutely want
storage right so what's these way to
expand storage on a device my christy
maybe even you know on board my christy
yeah and so we've actually included a
two gig microSD card with every
pineapple and what this allows us to do
eighty I did not realize I would forget
the word so quickly I'm expecting cause
to run up we're here with the Red Bull
and vodka any moment all right
but yeah adding having that SD card
shipped from us allows us to actually
make sure that the hottest the latest
and greatest firmware the freshest pick
pineapples new ships out the door I
think it can I can I just know because I
remember the words it's gonna be a quiz
later and so in that we've included the
2gig but we are expandable up to 32 and
we're supporting fat and ext this will
allow you to install tons of
applications and even do tons of swamp
cuz sadly a lot of you guys do use
Windows which scares me but you know if
you want to then go ahead its its Adobe
I'm not even gonna go down that rathole
yeah alright so dead simple okay that is
a core pillar of ours we've always
wanted to make this super easy for
anybody to pick up and use you know
there's only these awesome command-line
tools but we don't want you to
necessarily even have to drop into the
command line and so sab has done an
amazing job and our
unity has done an amazing job of making
these infusions that like take these
complex tools and really simplify them
in a web interface anybody can you know
just like you know click the button and
it goes but what's easier than clicking
the button flipping the switch right so
let's put some dip switches on it and
what we've done is introduced attack
boot modes basically we've got five dip
switches on there three of them are user
configurable and allow you to specify
what it is that you want the pineapple
to do so you flip those switches we're
gonna rename the product so let me tell
you about the Wi-Fi coconut ah there's a
Wi-Fi wireless coconut so the the I
Triple E 802 dot 11 coconut mm-hmm now
has dip switches where you can clip
these to choose your attack mode you
turn it on it we're calling it it does
the thing yeah so so our device does not
do the thing also pops Colleen yes okay
the other things like we mentioned we're
not getting rid of USB we loved USB and
moreover we love solid USB and we will
will elute we'll talk about the live
stream that we're doing next week later
but basically we'll get into the QA
about this and get into the all the
esoteric gory details about the AR 9330
one and all of the fun stuff in there
but know what we've done is we have
solved a lot of these issues and made a
very reliable USB stack we've
implemented it in such a way where I
have 3G dongle is running for days yeah
as well as the power issue we wanted a
very versatile and very robust power
supply so we still continue to accept 5
volt as well as 12 volt and we're
shipping already with international
ac/dc
yes we can actually use the charge
absolutely no but the whole power supply
she was was one before do we no no no
we're not them I'm preparing a tea right
something else we love you cross so I
hear it still gives me wings whoo
no so uh so a lot of you guys watching
live so I'm probably here too you guys
have had issues powering multiple
devices you know on the mall for well
plugging into your laptop or any other
five volt power source over USB we don't
have that issue anymore with the onboard
real second Atheros they are not going
to have the same issues the don't go
down they don't you know have have but
they just they just do thank you on the
board already yes we also wanted it to
be unbreakable and I think we did a
budding entrepreneurs startups and
innovators are all turning their ideas
into realities backed by the strength of
a dotnet domain and you guys know dot
nets are globally known they're one of
the most popular domain extensions
online they inject your business with
