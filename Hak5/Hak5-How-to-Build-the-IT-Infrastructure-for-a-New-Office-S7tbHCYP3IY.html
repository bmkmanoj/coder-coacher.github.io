an office network from the ground up the
right way
breaking SIM card security with a palm
centro how not to fork your bits with
grub to in a bar beer over all that and
more on this episode of hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by go daddy Squarespace and the national
fight against drunk driving over the
limit under arrest
everybody welcome this week's episode of
hack 5 I met last doc I'm Shannon Morse
I'm Darrin kitchen this is season 6
episode 1 in the brand new hack 5 studio
yes it is it's so lovely I love it we
spent quite a bit of time working
slaughtering goats gonna drain the blood
exactly there's a sacrificial thing yeah
we ran out of goat blood we had to slice
you know a little bit and be like squirt
squirt well you know cuz brie no exact
I'm just happy that we all put our own
ideas and thoughts into it and we
combined all of our brains into one are
you kidding me we just said what worked
over the last five seasons and then just
said well you know I really like the
bricks and I really like this whatever
that stuff is and how about we throw on
some of that I mean you know red by any
but there's not a whole thing about how
it's every aspect I posed the question
to Twitter and and asked him I said you
know what can you can you actually name
all the different you know aspects of
the set yeah I'm seasons past and there
were only a couple people I got it right
out of the you know 20 or 30 though I
should responded you put that crappy
iPhone picture up on there right I
posted your photo well new BlackBerry
photo 3GS would have rocked it yeah but
anyway so we've got a great episode I am
going to be well still working out the
kinks it's understandable I'm going to
be showing you guys more of what we've
actually got going on in a day to day
aspect of information technology systems
admin network admin kind of thing I
showed you ESXi last time on the last
series and today we're going to start a
series kicking off network
infrastructure how to actually construct
and build plan and deploy a network
infrastructure based on your needs so
that's what I'm doing to just get a 10
base T hub and plug everything into it
right yeah I think so but anyway uh
Shannon you've got a ridiculous hack
that I'm yeah apparently you can bypass
the sim sim lock security on
true exciting yeah we'll have to play
this out I was like whoa okay I need a
new phone I mean a lot of people lock
their tzimmes because a lot of people
keep especially people who have iPhones
stuff on their sims so that when they
need to transfer to another device or
you know so like that everything goes on
the sim I'm in cDNA land so I have no
way you have no idea what them is that
is that with two M's is that like a
denim do they make that in II do and I
video yeah alright so we went there yeah
yeah I'll have more on that later
I promise all right well let's kick it
off right but first let's find out the
details about this month's land party
huh
this one's LAN party is call of duty 4
modern warfare
we'll be playing a game dock 5 org on
Saturday September 5th and you can sign
up and vote for all of your favorite
games over at hacked bog land

and i would like to thank our sponsors
Squarespace with Squarespace you can
build beautiful looking blogs websites
in a fraction of the time it would take
with a traditional content management
system their intuitive drag-and-drop
interfaces as snappy and powerful as a
desktop publishing app but best of all
there's no software to install no
databases to configure no patches to
apply and no code to Vettel wit find out
for yourself how simple and powerful it

hey what's up guys alright so here we
are back in the set again we're going to
show you exactly what it takes to
actually deploy and support and build
the infrastructure that will go behind
your ESXi or ESX or vSphere deployments
that we actually highlighted weeks prior
I'm currently in a sticky situation
where right now I've got a bottleneck on
my network and I have no idea where it's
at from one end to another I get about
14 megabytes a second throughput on a
pure gigabit network between the front
and the back end we've got about five
different 24 port Gigabit Ethernet
switches don't know exactly what the
problem is because I don't have
sufficient management capabilities to
actually trace back where that problem
is actually coming from so the master
plan here is to not only fix that
problem but future-proof ourself
later on down the line now when I say
future-proof most of you walk into a
place whether it be a network closet or
a data center with stuff already
pre-configured and already in production
the problem there is you have your own
way of doing things probably the way
that things have been done are not to
best practices so what we want to do is
we want to live migrate our existing
hodgepodge solution to a best practices
or as best as we can possibly get
practices solution so what I've actually
chosen to do is we're going to actually
reap a CH all of our connections we're
going to replace all the switches we're
going to stack the switches and we're
also going to VLAN and make sure we have
QoS enabled on all of our solutions that
we possibly can that includes VoIP that
includes if you have some other you know
port that you guys are using proprietary
to actually transmit data we want to
make sure that that gets priority so the
whole series is based on start to finish
where we're actually going with our
network so let me give you a basic
rundown we've got a couple components
here I may may mention in the ESXi
series and I've got a
and solution which is 10 gig Ethernet
which utilizes a cx4 adapter for copper
10 gig II the Dell power connect 6248
that I actually purchased allows you to
connect up to CX for 10 gig Ethernet
uplink modules into each switch now in
each switch we can daisy-chain
12 of them for 576 front end ports to
make one big switch beyond that we can
actually connect 10 gig Ethernet up
links into the system so that we can
actually connect servers sans whatever
we want to utilize the CX 4 adapter in
addition we've got forty eight gigabit
stacking modules on the back of the unit
so that we can have high-speed
communication between each switch we've
also got Leviton xtreme 6 plus which are
cat 6 certified connectors which make it
pretty easy to you know mix and match or
you know swap in and out the biggest
problem with standard patch panels are
your tone generator and your tone wand
with the Leviton series because of the
Keystone jacks that we've actually got
to utilize we can say ok port 1 on this
patch panel corroborates to port 1 on
the other patch panel in our server rack
and that's the other thing that I want
to let you guys know about the way that
I'm going to implement my architecture
is I'm going to have a bunch of patch
panels in a networking closet and for
each server rack we've got we're going
to put another patch panel it makes up
things a whole lot more modular in the
event that you ever need to move that
you ever need to reconstruct or actually
trace back and make changes to your
existing patch interface so that's kind
of a high-level overview of exactly what
we're going to do to try and bring my
network up-to-date and a lot of the same
principles will apply to your network as
well if you have any questions feel free
to hit me up in mad at hack 5 org or you
can hit me up at forums hack 5 org
coming up Shannon's gone sim pin
bypassing
the palm central garrison keep us up to
date with everything that is community
related this week we want to highlight
some of the grand geekery found across
the vast hak5 community now this bit of
brilliance comes from the hak5 forms
none other than a luscious 89 now him
and two of his buddies built this sweet
little enabled Rover based on none other
than a Barbie Power Wheels remember this
from the 90s dude I totally wanted one a
GI Joe not the Barbie one anyway point
being he has this beautiful website put
together that documents the whole
project so the hardware the electronics
the code is all there for you guys to
enjoy so I definitely encourage you to
check it out there's videos and
everything linked up in our show notes
and of course if you guys want to
nominate a community project we feature
on the show just go ahead and email us
or just contact about five five org and
of course we want to thank one of our
excellent sponsors the national fight
against drunk driving listen people
alcohol drugs and driving do not mix and
the message is pretty clear drinking and
driving
over the limit under arrest don't put
yourself or others in danger police will
be out in force from August 21st through
Labor Day weekend cracking down on drunk
drivers beyond just putting your life or
mine at risk
you could cost yourself a bundle of time
and money lots of drivers license higher
insurance rates and dozens of other
expenses from attorneys fees fines costs
of towing repairs loss of work the list
goes on and on drinking and driving is
so easy to avoid go out have fun just
plan ahead get a designated driver call
a taxi take the bus or rent a limo
they're actually pretty cheap when you
split it up between half a dozen people
sorry so I had this friend online who
came out to me and he was like what kind
of security do you use for your palm
sentro and I was like
good question so I actually searched for
pom security pom central security and I
found out that there is a bypass by
using the system the SIM PIN lock that
you can bypass and find all of the
hardware information on a pom central I
didn't realize that censures I mean I'm
not I mean I haven't used a palm in
years but I didn't realize the security
was a big deal but like yeah X I had is
like a sweet so I mean there's like you
know exploits and stuff for this phone
there is it's really weird um well first
of all you know what a pin code is or do
you well pop yeah yeah I understand the
pins you know your typical for did you I
mean I you know what honestly the only
time I've ever used it is on a candy bar
phone when I used to pop it in my pocket
and accidentally dial people so who
hasn't but I've never used it to secure
my phone because I've always imagined if
somebody really wanted to they just take
my blackberry and then pull the SD card
out of the back of it and that'd be game
over well these little sim card guys
whoa there anybody but they store all
sorts of information that is basically a
unique identifier for yourself so that
your network knows who you are no matter
what phone you're using you can transfer
it to every single phone if you're on a
GSM network it stores your contacts your
SMS messages your country code and your
mobile network code it all sorts of
different codes tons and tons of data
and one thing that it protects as well
is this SIM PIN password and your PUC
password in case you forget your sim and
your lock yourselves out so you need
your PUC passwords which is your kind of
like a serial okay so so that pin on the
sim is what locks my phone yes great and
you said this way around it on the sub
there is would you like to see yeah we'd
love to see so how do we go about this
okay well they're like three palm users
in the audience I had to set up my phone
lock so I went over into the phone lock
menu and typed in my password and then I
shut off my phone right and then when it
power cycles comes back on and I see
this okay that is entering a couple of
numbers and yeah unlock sim
I have to enter in my four digit
password and then I can get back into
the phone I can unlock it I can make
calls do email I can get on the internet
whatever I want right well well we don't
have the password because we it is you
know stole Paul's yes palm center
because he's no not a Mac user he and I
know that if I try it four times or
three times then it'll completely lock
me out or great you'll need your pop
code and the only way you can get that
is by like going to the store or going
online and that would require a little
bit of social engineering or and and
there's basically no sense in brute
forcing it but I don't want to hit OK
and cancel does nothing so emergency
calls the one that you want to pay
attention to so I hit emergency call hit
star to the phone key and I want to hang
up that emergency call before it goes
through yeah we don't wanna be dialing
911 hack five and now I'm into the
hardware oh great you're yeah yeah
you've got your calendar right there you
see that we can push cars for I have my
calendar I can see the email that I've
already downloaded onto my phone all my
SMS messages off your mail from Gmail I
have all of my contacts on here
everything there's even pictures on here
that you can access just by doing the
emergency call thing you can access a
person's life I could access all of my
notes in here like if somebody stored
their passwords inside of their notes or
their now that's a very bad idea or any
kind of information in there it would
completely ruin your life if somebody
was able to do that do that suck um I'm
trying to like grab my head around it's
a little scary isn't it
right now but this is just for the
centro though right and it's a far sign
now and this doesn't give us access to
like it but no kind of template i
understand you know you're saying that
there's a lot of information stored in
the sim but the way i hear is that the
the sim actually like as far as contacts
are concerned only actually carries like
the name and the phone number so you
know for most smartphones you've got you
know you know mobile homework yeah
exactly so they're all stored on your
photos and everything so this just gets
you access to the hardware that's still
really cool now the thing is there are
ways to
keep yourself from having this problem
okay you can download certain types of
extra security for a year pon Centro
there's one that I checked out on a
whole bunch of different forums it does
cost 12 bucks and not too cool for an
application it's called warden security
for the Palm Centro and apparently
everybody says that it's a really good
one I'm not going to read 12 bucks
though because I keep my phone on me at
all times so I'm not too worried except
for when you lose electronics and cab
rights and Charlie it happen that's just
my camera okay no worries
sweet well I'm so I think we should do a
lot more sim hacking if I did great so
let's go ahead and import some fun
hardware from China and see what kind of
fun stuff we can do so if you guys have
some ideas on maybe some simin locking
some phone bypasses definitely hit me up
my email is snaps at hak5 org or you can
catch me on the forums I'm always there
alright and coming up in just a bit I'm
gonna be talking to you guys about grub
2 and we're gonna wrap this bad boy up
but first let's head over to Matt and
see what's going on with trivia so our
last contest was using the clues in
episode 525 what is the address of the
hack beach house our winner last time
was beat men who not only provides the
address but also photos of the beach
house with interior in a full floor plan
Beakman goes on to quote River Phoenix
from sneakers it's fascinating what 50
bucks will get you at the county
recorders office to shave Beekman Touche
this week's contest is one for the
Photoshop and After Effects crowds get
creative with the assets at hack $5
slash LCD wall and come up with your own
graphic loop for our new LCD wall the
winner will receive proto bozos CD 0
equals 1 equals everything with along
with an awesome hack 5 swag bag not only
that but the winner will will also use
the winning graphics in an upcoming
episode of hack 5 head on over to hack 5

alright guys so that just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack fine but
before we let you go I wanted to ask
Darren you recently had some fun and I
thought we were calling it out yeah as
always it's it's totally gonna be worth
it as soon as iron out all the kinks I'm
working on assignment next week for grub
2 which is like the coolest read it's a
rewrite of grub I mean we all know grub
because it's the tasty goodness that
brought us the u.s. people up they pass
yeah and I thought there's I've been
doing a lot of reading about that stuff
in fact we have totally got to take the
that entire episode thread and move it
to its own form because yeah there have
been like what 17,000 yen is or
something ok it seems blow it up pretty
good so it deserves more than just a
thread so let's go ahead and make a
board specifically for that anyway uh so
it's as far as you know aside from in
ministry over there I've been looking
into grub 2 because it's really cool
because it was written from scratch it's
cleaned up it's modular its portable and
best of all it has this really sweet new
option called loopback which basically
lets us take a file and mount it as a
filesystem so what that means is instead
of extracting an ISO and copying a boot
folder and some squash FS and some other
frog and happy goodness and hoping
everything works and you know praying to
the ether Lords we can actually boot off
of an ISO file cool dude I got like ISOs
coming out my floppy drive whatever you
know I'm saying like you know so just
like throw this all on your USB Drive
format it up nothing about a boom so
it's not hard coded you can actually
select which one you actually want to
boot off right ok gotcha
yeah and that's cool or who doesn't have
an ISO collection you know way better
than Juliette yeah
and Julia does that house pronounced I
think it was Julia so I've been you guys
know that on a new bond to a guy you
know and and I did the procedure it's
it's as simple as a pet install grub to
really is except I do want to mention
that ok so when you go through and
actually do it you'll see it's beautiful
little message here and that's like
don't freak out it's going to be ok
we're changing your grub up before we do
this we're going to actually test the
stuff before we do it and what what it
actually does is put scrub to behind the
grub one and we would do what's known
chain loading so we actually chain load
grub to from grub one and if it works we
say let's go ahead and finalize it run
this command upgrade tak from tak grub
tak legacy time out tak is the military
definition or phrase for - or - know
whatever they come up recently yeah yeah
there's a bunch of people that wanted to
know where the hell did you attack your
military came from explanation came from
move it for pronunciation of you sitting
right there
I've crosscut to that guy are we right
yeah rubiks is me shaking its header and
they're giving us the the international
icon it does that sometimes idiot so
point being you just play the other
lords and I got to the point where it's
like moment of truth you know let's go
ahead and try that chain loading and I
got that beautiful like final not found
error fifteen nothing work no and I'm
like submitter like oh no all of my
pineapple code was on that this is bad
and it turns out that it was good that I
actually made this mistake because I
learned I got very intimate with grub we
had moments there and we really
connected I feel like there's there's
something to be had but there's there's
command mind so you can actually yeah
well there's this command lines that you
can do that what happened instead of
starting with 0 to start with 1 on a
partition and then and then they forgot
to put slash boot in the thing and then
I'm an idiot that actually used will be
I'm lame and boring and just stop that
way so I'm going to redo my entire
laptop now but I got everything working
that's pretty easy to just edit the
entries so that's what I'm working on so
if you're you know grub fiend hit me up
because we are having some fun next week
so you're going to show us a bunch of
the the ropes why you wouldn't why why
you would you actually use grub to over
grab one benefits of so on and so forth
and so many caveats as well yeah
prettier no Paul likes lie low but he
can he can good as happy efi apple in
and just crawl into a boss i think he
just doesn't know how to pronounce Lilu
no in the conditions damn good anyway
yeah whatever Chanin more than yes so we
have a group and I know all y'all out
there haven't joined it yet so you need
to join it because I came up with the
sweetest name for this group it's called
facebook.com slash techno lust so if you
don't join I'm gonna track you down
she's kidding she went what was it was
arms up she moved to Virginia twelve no
fourteen months ago and congrats on the
y'all oh honey I was saying y'all way
before I moved over here that's right
Missouri right and real and y'all North
Carolina crap yeah no so I do want to
mention something real quick before you
get to that mad props to Blake
Stephenson if you've been going you
annoying over the sweet new graphics on
hack five website on the motion graphics
that I'm going to slave over here
shortly to go ahead I do them I'm finish
of course if this is airing that means
that that that I was actually able to
take those beautiful vectors that he put
together there was awesome cartoon
figures of us and turn it into something
something half decent so you know rock
out so thank you to him USB switchblade
shirt is it coming did we get a question
about that yes okay um yeah got my comp
oh yeah
there you go all right as well as
restocking the other saw famous Claire
yeah store mmm the other thing we want
to let you guys know about you
we're going to be doing hack 5 or
actually what we call hack 5 labs so
we're going to take ideas segment
improvements things like that we're
actually going to take your suggestions
your ideas and your comments and form
that into our show and give you mad
props we're do so if you have any
questions or comments hit us up feedback
in hak5 org or labs at hack 5 org check
the website for information on when the
live labs are going to go on we'll all
be here this is this is the thing that
we're using that special cool technology
where we can all sign into a special
thing get our hands dirty with some
remote sessions yes it really is like a
hands-on environment yes ok cool because
no I think it's great to bring new
people into the show using this
technology as well of off show off
camera you know dirt like heck 5 live
style with hack house yeah getting your
hands dirty just playing with technology
with kids so you guys are all invited
we're gonna create a forum and create
the email address so head on over forms
on hi-5 org and sometimes I have five
top or yes good life poor people are
like oh poor people yes an animal I'm
looking at my buddy the fam fam faster
fit yeah yeah we love you guys
alright just my wraps up this season 1
season 6 episode 1 episode of egg but my
name is Dan kitchen I'm Shannon and I'm
Matt last stock and we're reminding you
to trust your techno lust oh yes we have
only meal time it's like Sunday morning
you know you turn on like sighs like
mine Jesus yo all right welcome to it's
not like bottom mmm Lucas is saying
dirty thanks to me oh all right
let's do the show okay stop him
