budget server benchmarks virtualizing
physical server and an ooey-gooey web
2.0 mashup all that and a whole lot more
on this episode of a 25
so Apple recently released the Apple TV
and the first thing that we thought was
ooh
something new to hack and I guess when
it comes to anything Apple hacking or
Linux or anything you can put doom on
it's time for Paul Tobias to come back
and rip some stuff open and make it make
the warranty voided yeah we did but uh
what we have here is the you know the
Apple TV if you haven't heard about it
was kind of well it looks like a little
gray box it's pretty out generic but uh
so essentially what is this device for
anybody that has been living under
rocking and hasn't played with it or
heard um what I consider it would be
kind of a video iPod for your television
it essentially syncs all your media
files from your computer and especially
with things like video podcasts like we
do it looks great and phenomenal so this
is something you connect to your HDTV
and it's the only right oh the
widescreen only in widescreen only is
essentially what it does what people
have hooked it up to like square boxes
and then it squishes everybody die and
you can like if you're really fanatic
you can like plug a composite table and
get grayscale no thank you but it's made
for widescreen TVs and it just syncs up
with your iTunes yeah I guess can stream
from up to five the five other iTunes on
your network so we saw it we were
thinking about going with a myth
solution with front ends and stuff and
for $300 for a solution that works right
out of the box probably the best way to
go especially when it comes to the Zack
gang yes well this gets was a hacking
what does everyone want a hack on this
thing um well when I first came out like
everybody a cue they like chop this
thing open and MIT the first thing they
specifically wanted more bigger hard
drives right that's a 40 gig right yeah
it came with a 40 gig like laptop hard
drive which is easily replaceable but
once again we we're not really gonna
keep too much media on this cuz we have
other ideas some in the past but uh so
we were more interested in like playing
our older media like our DivX and our
you've got a huge collection of all
sorts of stuff you know thank you to the
stage 6 people for all that legitimate
content I'm sure all the rest of it is
as well yeah so so yeah brother than
transcoding cuz whenever you're
transcoding it takes hours and like just
for like you know 50 minutes or
something and you're like that no thank
you
okay so what is the as this being the
Apple hacking 101 segment what is the
fundamental one thing that we need to do
to further every other hack that we will
be doing down the road the main thing
that you need to do is put SSH on it and
like that will enable every hack that
you can possibly do down along the line
I'm like that's the first thing you
essentially have to do and it is
required for pretty much everything else
unless you have the hard drive drive
attached to a computer which it's kind
of annoying okay you can't like use it
all the time when it's attached to your
computer so SSH is secure shell and I
think we've talked about this before but
it's kind of like telnet but secure and
you can do file copies and all sorts of
fun stuff it allows us to log into the
Darwin machine that's really running on
this because it's basically OSN right
yeah it's kind of a chopped up O's ten
type version it has a lot of same file
structures as Mac OSX and there's a USB
service port on the back but we can't
get yeah they kind of disabled it within
the OS has open hacked yet release you
know kind of get it to work but it kind
of cuts it off those people yeah it
reboots and then kills the USB port and
then okay so to get SSH on here and
further all of the additional hacks we
need to get the hard drive out here
right yep okay this thing you gotta do
is rip this sucker true
so let's go ahead and do that and while
you're ripping it open and explain how
that works I guess I'll go over the
ingredients that we're going to need for
this Apple hack first off we're going to
need a torx set this is a we're going to
need a Torx eight bit and a Torx ten bit
driver and that's just to take this off
and it's covered by this this rubber
bottom which comes off really easily not
that easily but now it's very difficult
to take that thing
with Lego putty knife but we've taken
off a couple times so it's kind of less
sticky yeah it's got a little bit of
adhesive on it and I find that it's you
know you don't really need to replace it
some people might get it it kind of fits
in there and it's snug so here's your
ten bit driver trailer or screws around
the sides yes there's four t8 on the
sides
and then there's four four t tens in the
laptop holding spot so but we just kind
of taken some of them out already for
convenience factor for us so we've got
the Torx drivers to open it up we're
also going to need a USB to IDE adaptor
and this is just to make things easier
you may have one of these that already
connects like laptop hard drives to
regular IDE inside your computer we like
the USB one because it makes it really
easy to work with with any other
computer in your house so you can pick
one of these up for really inexpensive
we're also going to need a few pieces of
software namely DD to do disk imaging
and that will be for the backup we're
going to need sshd from open Darwin org
the middle I should be the SSH server on
here we're going to need an NSS H dot P
list file that's the configuration file
to actually log into the SSH daemon
we're going to need an SSH client and it
makes it a little easier to have a
graphical SCP client all right let me
interject with this Windows PC guy over
here because essentially Linux and Mac
kind of have a lot of these utilities
built into it so if you're running any
of those especially if you're like into
the new Ubuntu feisty phone thing it's
awesome it it's pretty much already
there for you so you got your denim you
guys consider it a whole lot easier than
what he's you know about to show you
okay but for the rest for the 80% of the
audience that is running Windows and I
know that the Linux audience you guys
are hardcore and we love you guys but
you probably already know how to use DD
this is really the same thing it's just
with a GUI so we're going to be using
when DD we're going to be using putty
which is my favorite SSH client on when
I'm gonna be using winscp and that's an
SCP to transfer files over SSH it's a
graphical it looks just like Windows
Explorer Norton commander what do you
use for SSH on the Mac SSH or SCP SCP oh
I use a an open program called fugu it
has a little pufferfish logo it's pretty
easy it looks very native to the Mac go
ahead bus what do I does SCP work on OS
10 yeah - you'd be working OS - I've
never tried it
yeah sure I was curious because it works
in the BSD and Linux environment and
consider it's just a command you know
it'd be there and then the SP graphical
interface I may not make a drag-and-drop
early I can just seem to get it well I
know I understand the ease of using a
graphical SCP client but I was just
wondering for those who are kind of
hardcore if they could just go into the
terminal interesting oh you could do it
by hand yeah but we find it easier to do
this way yeah I wanna be hardcore so you
can do it the command-line way and we
applaud him for that way to go all right
so the other one yeah we've got the
screws out and now we're ready to
actually more than water you've eaten
well it's already boarded look at
Charlotte time to get to the good stuff
all right so you want to be a little
delicate right here yeah cuz it's still
attached by the IDE thing over here so
you can see so let's take a look right
here it's like there's the hard drive
and they've got this nice little ribbon
we can pull out the IDE here I'm gonna
get all the good stuff in there you got
your wireless card whatever is our
supply processor all the fun stuff the
whole thing's like you know it's looking
and admiring the hardware like any good
geek yeah well we're mainly interested
is this in is this hard drive so it's
good and remove this IDE
that's not gonna work okay well yeah
yeah you gotta remember how we do it
yeah I take the screws out all the way
on the and then rip it out of the it's
got this little sticky pad here it's not
really gonna write damage your hard
drive if you take it off of there so
okay we use the knife on it I wouldn't
recommend it right just probably hard
drive off yeah ginger like fine however
you feel comfortable with and then you
can pull out the rest of the yachty a
chain okay so this is where we use our
IDE two USB adapter if you want to go
ahead and plug in this adapter and I'll
get this size up here in the disc so be
careful of the dummy bit and yeah I got
a plugged in it should show up over here
on our PC now to back this up we're
using a Windows box a little easier on a
Linux machine or a Windows machine
because they can natively view the files
just say a Windows machine I don't know
what I said yeah you said a Windows me
okay but a Mac machine is only do this
thinking yes thank you
so umm but on Windows what we need to do
is install another piece of software
called Mac drive seven now there's free
trial available it basically just adds
support so Windows can actually view
this drive and we've gone ahead and done
that and as you can see here we're
looking at the what is mounted is the e
Drive which is the OS boot partition of
the Apple TV yep and there's actually
four partitions on the Apple TV there's
like an e FF efi partition OS boot media
and a to recovery is a hybrid partition
which Icona has some nice features in it
okay whenever you want to repair your
system well the first thing we want to
do once we pop this out and plug it into
our PC is actually do a disk image and
back this up just in case we feel for it
we use DD for that on Windows we use
windy Dean and I'm just gonna real quick
gloss over this we've got more
information in the show notes but it's
really simple procedure you're not going
to do it here takes a little while but
with win DD you select your source your
destination you click exec and it just
makes a backup partition for you so if
you do really mess it up you're not
completely screwed
Mac it's just Dee Dee if location off of
location right so I guess next we need
to get s
eh on here so we've downloaded OpenSSH
from open Darwin org and if we just open
up this folder and go into the USR and
then under s bin we will find the sshd
file and all we really need to do is
copy this over to our OS boot slash USR
slash bin folder and we've already done
that so I can show you here yes there's
a whole bunch of other programs that are
and here it is and I can copy but I
don't know how useful it would be on
there right so we just need to just copy
this over and already done that so we
also need to edit the sshd plist file
that's the configuration file that's
going to actually allow us to log in
once we've got the daemon running and
that is located in OS boot which we've
got mounted here under system and then
under library and then under launch
daemon so and we can see ssh dot p list
right here i'm going to go ahead and
open this an e/m editor and you can see
when you first tak this and open up this
file there's only like three lines in
this text file what we need to do is
replace it with the sshd I'm sorry the
SSH dot P list file that we found from
one of our resources and that is wicked
awkward t v-- org and here it is on on
the wiki site and just copy this right
over and once we have that in place we
can pop it all back together and put it
in our machine yet bog into it and
that's essentially where most of our
hats will continue on from there and
because once you have SSH you pretty
much own the rest of the hard drive and
potentially risk the system right so
we're gonna put everything back together
and we're gonna take a break and take a
look at trivia this month we're also
going to have a great segment with Wes
about virtualizing physical servers and
near the end of the episode we'll come
back to this put it all back together
and get our additional codecs and our
other plugins installed on this and then
talk about the future of Apple TV
hacking so let's go ahead and check in
with Ali and see what's up with this
month's trivia
okay so last month's trivia question was
the Vudu five 6000 an unreleased
graphics card by 3dfx contains so many
circuits that a special external power
supply was intended to have been used
how many vs a 100 graphics processing
units would the card have featured the
correct answer for who give us that
correct answer was Ken or in hacker land
some of you might know him as box game X
congratulations Ken we'll send you out
some mad cool this month's trivia
question
well the sequence you see on the screen
it can be defined recursively by using
the operation of bitwise negation name
the sequence and continue it for 1024
bits bonus points for ready and basic
better you than me
if 10 go to 20 okay you know you can
send your answers to trivia at hak5
don't work alrighty so up next you'll
see me again with Paul talking about
virtualizing a physical server let's go
I've got this ugly old giant loud power
consuming like pretty much almost kind
of useless except I still need it to run
whatever my the server Windows 2003 that
I have on here with its website specific
stuff but uh I wish I could virtualize
it and thankfully I have less who can
show us how to do it zing yes I can show
you how to virtualize a physical server
2003 nice now what what what no we need
to do this what we're gonna need is we
need PE builder to make a custom bar PE
loadable seat bootable CD like you know
hot bootable just like Ubuntu where you
can boot up off of it and then have all
the OS functionality we're gonna need
some kind of disk imaging software I
chose a Cronus true image 9.1 when you
say this imaging software you mean like
all the discs on like say like a so
everywhere has lots of this and except
their partition well the partitions like
the your CDE
whatever okay because you want full
functionality of that server so we're
going to make a disk image of the entire
server alright and ghost does this and a
Cronus true image does this I went with
a Cronus okay because one I like the
interface a little bit better it's a
little easier to use it's not it's very
intuitive and plus you can download a
free 15 day trial from Acronis and it's
a full version full version it's just as
long does it work yeah yeah and it just
self-destruct so what else do we need
and then we're going to need a list of
plugins for our bartpe and that list is
right over here now this is an awesome
awesome guide for this entire project
right here and it's from RTFM education
it gives you a list of all these plugins
that you might need okay the ones that
we're definitely concerned about or this
one the LSI logic driver because that is
the scuzzy interface that ESX uses
because we're this was old this whole
thing I did was at work yeah so this is
very kind of corporate kind of like
higher-end kind of thing but you might
potentially do the same kind of stuff
with like free versions of like say
VMware server exactly money they say
something Microsoft virtual server but
wow that's that's that's still yeah
that's still to be tested but this this
is definitely all focused around ESX
server but it also depends on how your
virtualization environment handles the
disks for the server out of it for the
machine does it use an IDE doesn't use a
virtualized IDE chain or scuzzy yeah but
this is definitely geared towards OD
scuzzy drivers and plugins we're gonna
need the LSI logic driver and then we're
gonna need this right here the classic
ultimate p2v original fix vm scuzzy free
p2v plugin this is a direct plug in for
bartpe
that's going allow us to take the the
scuzzy driver that's already in our
physical server
rip it out and shove this LSI logic
driver in okay so that's kind of how you
get around the whole windows is like hey
this is my original hard drive this is
my original hardware and it cuts its own
head off yeah it's like screw this I'm
done yes exactly that's what it does
that's exactly what it does sit in mhm
working because it's gonna load it into
its default system load drivers so when
the system comes up for the first time
in the virtual environment oh my got
these scuzzy drivers and it just keeps
trucking nice that's pretty much what we
need now if we pop over here now this a
remote desktop into one of my servers
that were in it and and that's a kranish
true image sitting right there and I've
gone ahead and I've already made an
image of this server all the disks right
here if I open up my computer you'll see
it has two disks to it two partitions
right and so all I did was make an image
of both partitions and shoved that out
to one of mine ass first thing we need
to do at this point is actually send the
image that we made and put it on this
partition alright so a first thing we
need to do I've already installed the
plugin for a crona's true image so now
it has it it has the Acronis software
built into it for me to recover my disk
image so we're gonna start that up we're
just gonna use a default options because
I haven't changed anything it's gonna
prepare it it's gonna just move it bite
for bite over there and when it's done
as far as the hard drive itself is
concerned the virtual hard drive itself
is concerned it is identical exact
replica if I can be any more redundant
of the original of the physical so as a
partitioning it is a very much a
doppelganger all right now but once this
is done we're have to actually going to
modify it and make it not so much a
doppelganger so it'll actually work on
our current hardware hardware yet we're
gonna get out of the Acronis because
Acronis has done its job now we're gonna
come down here to our tools draw our
programs here's where the magic happens
okay so now we need to set disc 0 and
partition 1 to be Z
to BC now sometimes this decides to work
and sometimes it doesn't it's still kind
of flaky in this environment the whole
idea behind diskpart it's a it's a tool
that's you can be that can be used in
Server 2003 but not XP and what it's
gonna do is make the system find the new
partitions and we're going to boot off
of our CD again so we're back in the
bartpe environment and we're going to
tell it that this is your operating
system disk this is where all the magic
has to happen this is where you need to
change drivers so things work the way
they're supposed to work we're back in a
virtual machine now and now we need to
fix the VM scuzzy ok so now we need to
set the target OS saying this is where
we're gonna work this is how things are
going to be see and now there's our OSU
OS hard drive and we're gonna have to
drill down yes windows you can the magic
of guessing where you are yeah see now
we've got all these extra tools at it
here remember how those were all grayed
out yeah now these are all of our scuzzy
drivers that we need to know that all
the possible scuzzy drivers that we need
to inject ok so since we don't we've
already set the target root now we're
just gonna come down here now we're
running a server 2003 Windows 2003 you
see it over there on the right and we
need those LSI logic scuzzy drivers okay
so we're gonna inject those little
command prompt pops up done Wow
that's all there was to it and what that
did was it went in it found the original
scuzzy drivers that were in there ripped
those out stuck in the VMware LSI logic
scuzzy drivers to say oh yeah this is
how the drive works now you're on a new
hard drive this is how you talk done so
now we can restart
this is the point you have to restart
because now we have to get out here
we're gonna restart and we're gonna let
it boot normally it's gonna boot off of
the hard drive and it's a Master Boot
Record Elma bartpe we're completely done
with bartpe now but you can always hold
on to that CD for any kind of later use
that you might yeah you know whatever
you need to bring another one of these
big giant machines into your sir
yeah back into virtual land here you go
see Windows Server 2003 splash screen
yeah now what's gonna happen it's gonna
freak out a little bit because the hard
the hardware has changed some yeah I
like anyone whose machine does yeah it's
gonna be like whoa oh hey massive
hardware changes but it's not gonna kill
itself it's just gonna ask me if I want
to re-register with Microsoft and that's
what I wanted if you have like and if
all you've your licensing is correct and
everything you know this is all geared
towards the corporate environment now
it's doing it's it's throwing this error
just because driver you know the
hardware's change so the drivers it's
trying to access or really are doing
anything yeah they're not they're not
worth anything so and then so we're
going to where's the insert key there it
is now we're gonna log in it just thinks
you know it shut down for no apparently
reason so I'm just gonna give it a bunch
of garbage so it'll let me in now here
here it is when - since when does this
first activate on this computer the
hardware on the juice the hardware is
changed significantly bah blah blah yes
I want to re-register and I'll bring up
that kind of hole the big grave yeah
yeah so give me your keys well I don't
know it's just do you want to talk back
to Microsoft and tell it this is the
server yes this is the server it's ok I
authorize this that essentially pretty
much does it like mm-hmm
we're done yes that was pretty amazing
like I've worked with a lot of virtual
machine stuff and I've done ESX before
I've never actually done a full like
migration like that that is impressive
and I've done it a couple of times and
it works every time once you get through
all this stuff no I don't want to turn
on hardware acceleration right now do it
later
but yeah I've done it a couple of times
I've done it with a domain controller I
done it with a sharepoint server I've
done it with a another 2003 server
running at an s AP server and I mean and
what's really funny and it's really
amazing is the fact that s ap runs on
top of a database like Oracle there's a
sequel and it didn't have a problem all
I had to go all I had to do was go into
the firewall and adjust these static IP
settings yeah for the new the new Mac
address that was it and that was just to
make sure it had proper connectivity and
had the right IP address so he could
talk to everything else on the network
but I mean with this vinicky and is just
temperamental as s ap systems are and
windows I've had him cranking I've had
him cranking and all of the data just
just flies exact xual physical machine
okay so for further information always
check out the show notes wwf/e org slash
wiki you can email me directly west
Hekla org now coming up we're gonna have
a pre-recorded segment with our old
buddy mu bik's and his USB thumb drive
thumb drive Oh tricks and that's coming
up shortly after this message
when your dishes need a truly high
quality resolution reach for pixel clean
HD only pixel clean HD now with 1080p
can remove unwanted jaggies macro
blocking and compression artifacts in
fact every leading dishwasher
manufacturer recommends pixel clean HD
with 1080p remember it's not clean until
it's pixel clean have you seen how easy
go daddy.com is huh yeah I just bought
you for a buck 99 did not yeah I did
dog nabbit whoops just did your dog mr.
Winky my wife loves mr. Winky no now I'm
gonna do your wife mother you know I'm
gonna do your mother now too late I
already did my mother pervert enter code
hack that's a CH a K when you check out
for an additional 10% off any order
welcome back to act 5 I'm Darrin and
joining us again is Rob fuller moody
says he's known throughout the community
from 360 to comm here again with a bag
of USB goodies and this time encrypted
part do so we're following up with the
segment you did last time about true
correct and now you've taken your tools
and made them secure
I have not only that but automatic ok so
you've taken switchblade and hacksaw
technology and you've put your tools in
it so let's take a look because I have a
feeling just based on the brand of USB
memory stick he's got that it's going to
start running automatically where Darren
and I saw him with my laptop there we go
I should be running the hacksaw on this
in the background so there's DLO of
stuff still of a script so we plugged it
in something's happening automatic
although ok so it's actually asking for
your TrueCrypt password it is as soon as
you plug it in and it's actually hidden
volume ok so I go ahead in two different
paths but then tell me attack five sucks
or is it password its password ok that
doesn't look like hack 5 SEC's no that's
quite long double time ok here we hit ok
ok look automatically starting is my
pious start menu
ok I've never used PS start that that's
a really spiffy little tool so that just
it's better than the Start menu spiffy
ok this just stays down in there so
you've got work stuff non work stuff all
sorts of you get putty tcp eview right
so all the standard stuff but there was
this nifty tool you were showing me that
settle down and non-work-related
it's like his bare grip err grep very
graphic gret I'm used to grep ok grep
files I can grok that well this is grep
for Windows basically so it's like a
spotlight on crack there you go
so right now we're looking at our old
Drive the encrypted volume on on my USB
stick and we'll just start typing in
password sure any ties correctly it's
doing that to really search them on the
fly and we're looking for all the files
with password so it's actually just
doing a string search like in all of
your ASCII files or your binary files
everything and and in finding that
string and showing you the matches and
actually showing you what line in what
program so you can see here in putty
there were two matches or there eight
matches and putty mm-hm and here's each
each one of the lines so this would be
great for a writer know maybe auditing
co-workers or friends or write unknown
people if you want to find out if your
dad or mom are storing their passwords
somewhere which this shouldn't be all
you have to do is run this and type in
your mom your not store your password in
the right place okay well they could be
storing in a true crypt aaam there you
go still got to remember one password
but it's okay maybe would be okay to
write them down inside of the text file
in the trip island and this is
incredibly fast compared to far I'm
surprised how fast it's going yeah well
that indeed these if you've ever used
the search within files feature in the
end though with the windows find feature
it's no good especially when you're
doing like I don't know it this way I
could even use this for like you know
when I'm trying to do a huge find and
replace through a PHP files or something
like that does have a replace feature no
however it does have an open feature or
an edit feature so you can what edit it
and like a text editor or a okay Foxit
reader so what are you gonna open the
executable and so we can also do yeah we
can change this to text it can also do
ignoring case regex and tax invert match
all the cool little grep features sounds
like it's like google for your hard
drive there you go to the desktop eat
your heart out sweets what else you got
on the USB key let's see
non-work-related revoir dÃ­ganos voice
space monger did reduce system
information
no let's siw it's a great tool system
the information for Windows mm-hmm
now have you ever had to find out as
much information about a computer before
you rebuild it so that you can have the
drivers and everything yeah
unfortunately holding down windows and
hitting pause for the the regular menu
isn't going to give you anything more
than processor and RAM finds out
everything look is orange DirectX tag Oh
tons more look under Oh what's this
licenses oh I wouldn't look in there I
mean I'm sure it's fine it's a work
laptop so it is and there's all your
licenses oh fiffie
I don't know how long I should keep that
up one so here's your driver's mm-hmm
and scroll Oh even more down so I can
actually see the drivers files and their
version information so you could use
this actually like extract those before
you do a rebuild of your computer my my
my neck support everything you only want
or save there's another little feature
down here called secrets
we're not going to click on ok so is
this LS a secrets just like any one of
three secrets and if I were practicing
safe computing clicking on that wouldn't
reveal anything go out and do it I'll
just lower the opacity a lot and here's
all your secrets is your wireless okay
so that's like a program that I showed
recently exactly with the wireless keys
ok very spiffy you can you stop
scrolling and passwords okay
thanks Rob Oh keep going down Oh more
good stuff it can scan the network
search Network neighborhood for FTP HTTP
NetBIOS Oracle air DPD comm great
stylish smells it sounds like you could
spend hours of fun on any network just
playing with this tool definitely ok
sounds like there's way too much than
weak imperative to Cain and Abel or a
map or all those other tools that you
use it is not detected or hack tool oh
okay so it's not recognized by like or
95s or any of those others as is not
picked as act work right very spiffy
well it seems like a very great you know
even for the white hat side because I
you know reformat machine so many times
there I'm always like where are those
blasted drivers you know and I love the
the Google problem where oh I just did a
reformat but I forgot to back up my
network drivers I'll just go redownload
my network driver was that yeah that was
like a no wait that was a touchpad what
anyway yeah good stuff well Rob thanks
again so much for showing us your
encrypted USB goodies look forward to
having you back on the show soon and
where can everybody find out more
information about you and all your USB
goodies room 3
sixty-two calm thank you so much sugar
problem last month poll question was FPS
RTS or MMO what's your favorite game
style so three choices somebody's gotta
win FPS for the win at 66% RTS and not
even a close second at 21% and then MMO
six shut up haha PS / Whitley was four
choices you know I don't play these
games you insensitive clod 6% don't even
know what is on here those people don't
even count no they don't exist solitaire
players so this month's poll this month
poll question is thus far what is the
near favorite episode of hack 5 this
does not include sketches or 0.5
you know just of the 20 link lien that's
one money
what's the near favorite episode top
hands down near the top and you sound
off at hack 5 org slash poll thank you
very much and now up next is going to be
benchmarking home servers ok we're just
letting out just stay tuned check it out
and here let's roll with it alright so
here we are and I finally get to do a
segment with my co-host day alright I'm
Darren hi nice to meet you I'm a PC yeah
I'm a Mac but not really okay so anyway
what we're gonna be talking about here
is your household kind of knock and you
know we moved into a house when you move
into a house of for geeks you're bound
to have some network issues I mean the
first thing we had to do was get rid of
the Linksys as our main router and
switch over a smooth wall and we talked
about that on to xo8
so we'd actually like to talk about
maybe the server side of the stuff that
goes into our NOC and there's so many
network services those geeks wanna run
yeah we want to run FTP servers fast
responses media centers yes an as main
controller and this goes on and on and
on yeah just it's whatever you your
heart's desire if you want to run a
small web host through you yeah webpage
you know I don't think of her I think
there was maybe two viewers that
actually have one PC directly connected
to
DSL line and the rest of us you know
yeah this is knocking that in fact we
remember when we did the survey one of
the questions was how many PCs you have
oh yeah yeah is here so one of the
answers was I live in a knock like
majority of people are actually those
people so yeah exactly yeah we're there
with you he's like 10 plus I live in an
OP but the the question is always been
okay so we need to throw up a freenas
and when we not finna or FreeNAS or uh
or smooth ball when we did we're like
alright let's grab that Pentium 3 under
your desk or sitting in your closet
big ugly right here the gray box of doom
that's been sitting collecting dust but
it'll make a great firewall but how much
is it really gonna cost you how loud is
it gonna be how big is it I think I'm
gonna produce just sheer Idol which is
all that a firewall does anyway just
right idols it never really winds up for
any kind of CPU usage like how much
power is this actually using it an idol
not much seriously like you're on top on
our smooth wall and it's just kind of
watching some packets go like a 1 0
never a 2 nope nada - but I'm just
saying like it's got all this extra crap
in it it's just a big it's an older box
that we're never built as proficient as
the new one so let's get rid of that and
build some new stuff exactly like
because this one's good like after our
little research yeah it turns out that
this closet box on average uses about 50
watts and what we're going to be doing
here is talking about not only the form
factors and stuff but also the power
requirements that was our biggest deal
is what's the cost to actually run these
like the cost to run the studio lights
way too expensive time to start dropping
some prices so closet box here uses 50
watts of power on we're going to use a
baseline of 10 cents per kilowatt hour
which may change depending on your area
but it's a good baseline but we're
looking at 450 watts we're looking at
almost 50 bucks a year to run this
that's crazy and you know and you said
it well 50 bucks a year's pay number 12
months it's really not that much I'm
saying this thing's evil exactly trying
to be ready to circle it's not almost
it's not as evil as some yes so now this
is the links that one of these yeah
everybody's got one of these it's a it's
a reasonably good it's small doesn't
make any noise doesn't make too much
heat and when it does its job seven
watts of power so we benchmarked all of
these use
I guess we should say the Watts up Pro
this is a great little device if you
haven't seen these I found this I
believe on ThinkGeek and you know it's
just so much fun to plug everything in
and realize oh my gosh you know the
product ours is actually using the
broadcast console Paul sitting at
staking up 4000 Watts so you know yeah
it's just sucking down yeah
but comparatively so it's a really good
tool to figure out exactly how much
power you are using and you know in real
time so the Linksys you know seven watts
so over a year that's gonna cost you
about six dollars and 13 cents using our
benchmark which and that's that's good
except not a whole lot you can do that
we've hacked it a little bit but aside
from you know some mediocre server stuff
this isn't going to ronnied Yoker
comparatively speaking it's not gonna
run asterisk with any sort of
performance it's not going to be a
FreeNAS it's not gonna it serves a
purpose that's all it was built for was
one particular purpose
we want to do more exactly so it's G
open yo VRT is great xw RT dd-wrt is
okay yeah so time to go with the smooth
wall talked about that so here's our
actual smooth wall box I love this
machine
mm-hm this is a mini ITX and I've just
been dying to find any reason to play
with a mini ITX machine because there's
just so much fun they're very very cool
they're very compact and quite frankly
that is the biggest downfall to these in
my opinion is that they're just so small
and it's like great once you get it all
put together and putting this together
in the closet but like when you sit
there trying to plug everything in on
this thing Alli come here can I use your
your small fingers to plug in this
little molex here yeah yeah exactly it's
just like it's it's difficult to work on
but once it's up and running it works
great it's got a really cool laptop
power brick type deal going right so
let's talk about the hardware first of
all this thing is running a it's a via
EPA ia 5,000 a motherboard slash
processor they all have the processors
built onto the motherboard mini a is can
you feel I know seriously it's a 532 a
it's a it's a 5 33 megahertz fanless and
that's one of the big deals was I mean
they've got bigger megahertz for these
little mini ITX from via but I wanted
the fanless so 5 33 megahertz should be
fine
for a router and the whole total cost of
the motherboard which has you know your
video and and you know the the CPU and
everything built-in who even has one
Nick um was of $90 someone need a case
for in cases for Mini ITX stuff oryx and
sidon and then you got an out of power
supply and and virtualized power supply
and then there's all these additional
little cords like you'll need if you
want a laptop hard drive you have to
either get an adapter or a special cable
and this had it all this is the I star
USA s3 storm it's a mini ITX case with a
built-in 80 watt power supply so it's
got an outboard little brick like on
your laptop yeah and that does all the
AC to DC conversion and everything to
have a plug to go straight into very
much like a laptop and so total cost for
the Mini ITX that was $90 for the case
and then throw in 256 Meg's of PC 133
it's not a DDR box PC 133 grams got a
little bit high well that's just because
of the whole you know London BAM exactly
but total copper box total cost of
ownership for this or total cost of
purchase is 280 bucks it's less
expensive than an Apple TV and if you
have spare parts like you know we put a
3.com NIC in here that goes for about
$20 but we had laying around we put a
Hitachi travel star 20 gig laptop hard
drive in that way around $30 if you've
got some PC 133 line around to save
excuse me save some money off that as
well so we actually ended up building
this for about 200 and some spare parts
yeah the only thing I can think of that
might have been a better investment for
us on this one so we could have set up a
DMZ on our network was getting a bigger
case with a riser
well network it's got it's got this
riser right here that you might might be
able to only pull this back off sure
pull that back off and you see it's got
the PCI riser right here and then that's
only one PCI slot and what we might have
been better off doing was by getting one
of those more expensive network cards
with two right you can see we've got an
integrated NIC right here and then this
is a nice little 3com 3905 and it's a
great NIC but you write had we had had
we've got a case with another slot you
can actually get
with two yeah either get a razor two pcs
or get one of those like more expensive
single PC I network card with two yeah
and then we wouldn't have to use the
links just as an access point exam at
all with our purple or green or yellow
or yeah fuchsia interface the smooth
wall yes so that that was that that's
the one small thing I wish there's a
little more expandability so after we
built the smooth wall we realized you
know what we need a domain controller or
just a general-purpose VM box that we
can run all of our little test stuff
like you know in the VM and all the
other stuff that we do research and
development on we needed a decent
platformer but we didn't want to spend a
whole lot of money this right here is an
awesome solution it's based on a PC
chips motherboard with embedded vs c7
processor it's I believe 1.5 gigahertz
and this puppy just purrs yeah in just
in case it's a Sayyaf likes ATX
motherboard so it's slightly bigger
right this is the Flex ATX there's a bit
bigger than the than the Mini ITX but we
do have two PCI ports we've got the
embedded processor it does have a fan
we've got ddr2 port right here right and
it also supports IDE and as there are
about firewire serial ata yeah SATA
yeah yeah and three and a half inch
regular desktop hard drive a regular
out-of-order cd-rom so and it's got a
built in the the case is a is the apex
this is the apex DM 317 a micro ATX case
it's got a 275 watt power supply built
in total cost of this thing alone was
only $40 $40 for this case $70 for the
PC chips motherboard with the processor
and then you know thrown another $20 in
kingston valueram and 40 bucks for our
Western Digital 80 gig at 7200 our
hundred and seventy dollars this is the
least expensive computer we have ever
built and honestly it's it's doing the
job it's supposed to be doing fairly
well for the price I think we made
Thrones more RAM later but yeah and and
what I like about this one is since it's
a
phlex ATX it's had a little bit more
expandability to it so definitely it's
nice having this big you know regular
size we could throw in a DVD burner in
here whereas you know with our mini ITX
here the only thing that we have right
here is a tray for a laptop Zeron and
then there's that laptop CD ROMs into
the big super drives in combo drives but
there's a bit more offensive so I mean
with this we definitely have a lot more
explained ability it's got enough
horsepower to run like a Server 2003
domain controller as such though it does
have two fans it's got a 80 millimeter
on the side here we also have you know
the power supply fan and the fan on the
processor so it is a lot noisier than
this fanless unit and it's also using a
little bit more power whereas the Mini
ITX was running 13 watts and over a
course of a year that would be about 15
dollars a year yeah the Flex ATX is
running at about 44 watts which is about
39 dollars a year so but we're also
talking 533 megahertz here versus a gig
and a half here yeah a big difference
but it's also and we thought about
benchmarking performance per watt and
then realized well when it comes to
running like you know whatever your file
server whatever your home service that
you want to add to your network be it's
all about choosing the right tool for
the job and if the Linksys router at 7
watts is the right tool for the job by
all means use it exactly but if you need
a lot of expandability now this is great
as just our firewall smooth walls
running great this would be a little bit
overkill well yeah this would definitely
overkill for something like that but
this like in my earlier segment virtual
you know using servers in a virtual
environment right you're gonna want that
extra horsepower and expandability
exactly so that you can you know put an
extra network card in there for you know
redundancy or different stuff like that
and then you want the bigger hard drives
and more RAM to for system resources so
then you can run the Astrix server
definitely an FTP server and you know
all that other stuff like most like most
of these boxes nowadays it does have
your integrated NIC the USB - oh and all
that other fun stuff that you would
expect um and you know we popped in
about 256 of RAM but we realized soon
after that the processor is X
pretty beefy enough so that we're
running Server 2003 on here with
Microsoft Virtual PC Server 2005
released - yeah
which is just like VMware or ESX that
you talked about it earlier in fact we
may just switch this over to something
like that or VMware server is free so we
might switch over that yeah but in that
case we're probably gonna just like load
this up with tons of RAM yeah and and
and and that's that's definitely the
right way to go but the whole the whole
key behind this is yes knowing the right
tool for the job but then also being
able to budge it out this is going to do
the job versus this is really gonna do
the job and then some and you have to
kind of keep in mind expandability and
write that so while this may be 44 watts
it's gonna be running it's running a VM
right now for asterisk and it will
probably end up running a few more VMs
as we give it more RAM so in essence
this right here may be a little bit
larger and use more power but it is the
equivalent of a couple of these so and
it just depends on what you need to run
and I guess you know a beautiful little
lickable apples yeah and then for
everything else this is just a pure idea
system we featured the Apple yeah we
just cracked it open and we're gonna put
it all back together at the end of the
show
yeah and it's a three hundred dollar
machine mm-hmm one gigahertz it's one
gigahertz 256 Meg's RAM and it only uses
about 15 watts so about $13 a year and I
gotta say it's it's more expensive than
anything you can build I mean obviously
you can build you know $4,000 easy and
if you want to but we were able to build
you know this for 170 in this for 280 I
still wouldn't have spent you know this
being 280 I wouldn't spent the extra to
use an Apple TV as a server it is Darwin
we've shown you how to get an SSH into
there so you could use it as a server
and we just thought it'd be fun to show
off because you know it's it's the
smallest of these obviously it's the
most powerful is the most expensive and
it's got a pretty decent you know power
wattage thing going on yeah but it's
just like once again I me personally had
almost classify the Apple TV in the same
category as the Linksys well you're
talking about like a 2 mega tour process
well no but I'm saying I'm saying but
you heard right earlier it's an embedded
but it's hackable and they both are you
know what might be interesting though
it's a a Beowulf cluster of Apple TV's I
mean just Jacquemont you've seen the Mac
minis so that would be interesting
folding at home next on your Apple TV
okay so that mean up that's your server
prompt for the day that that's your
server prime there's a healthy dose of
hardware but coming up next is the the
web window contest we have to talk about
that yeah and well when we when your
server we move to a new dedicated server
if there's an AMD 64 yeah it is and
we're using PHP which is the P version
of PHP kind of has a bug with the AMD 64
is integer it's just like flip the bit
somewhere and the wiki is not online as
of recording so a lot of submissions we
can't actually see because some people
put them on the wiki and some people
emailed contest at - org right we've
gone through them all they all look
really great
as far as web 1.0 is but we're here to
say the 20 the the April 26th deadline
is now open if you haven't gotten your
submission in it now's the time right
because with this is a perfect octave
perfect opportunity words try to use
them for us to talk about the new show
that we're going to be piloting here
soon and it's going to be very much in
the hak5 live fashion except for it
won't be as structured as the hack 5
betas before and it's gonna be really
freeform kind of conversational yeah
very conversational less educational not
to say it won't be educational right I
think it's the idea is it'll finally
give us the ability to focus on so many
of those community projects that have
spurred up and we just love those but so
many times we're looking at the board
and and are like episode listing and
there's only so many segments that we
can fit in so many minutes of airtime
that we have on this one show everything
just keeps falling off and it's finally
time to get another bucket because this
thing's over flow this buckets full and
it's not like we're you know I crammed
into a time space but we just don't want
to have you know we'll have you download
a two hour long episode if we really
covered everything we wanted to cover
each month yeah and we're already
starting to get pretty big on these
exactly so this is a prime opportunity
for us to break a break this section off
and be very community driven we you know
we try to keep up on all this projects
as much as possible live which means
live Skype callers with video and all
sorts of you know fun stuff we can have
all sorts of fun people on and it's
going to be a blast it really yeah
definitely definitely it's gonna be late
night you're live kind of geek show yeah
yeah it's gonna be like David Letterman
but but cool so uh that's that's web one
Oh contest so that's what your
submissions in and check hak5 org we are
regularly this may be the season finale
but you've got some technical coming yes
there will be another last year round
always always always so I'm gonna take a
quick break and we'll be back with more
tectal us say whoo
other dental Paisley's me feeling chalky
and unfulfilled that's why I use new
happy bright HD happy bright HD has a
pixel density that no other brain can
achieve and with his color calibrated
comb filter I'm left with a smile so
bright you know it's 1080p so enjoy
happy teeth with new happy bright HD all
right so last month's LAN party was a
Goldeneye source and what a yes they do
there dude it owns seriously if you
remember Goldeneye from the old n64 this
is like what they like it but with
beautiful source graphics and I can't
believe that it's taking this long to
finally play and the game and
multiplayer but I was worth the wait
the gameplay is proxy mines alone just
boom yeah definitely and just the
graphics and just it you know the fact
that there's no crosshair yeah unless
use is interesting you know it brings
back that arcade-style gameplay that I
just loved from the n64 little crash II
and that's because we're also getting
browser Berlin yeah and like there's
people lining up a you know mile down
the street the Internet Street and it
was just so much fun
so everybody joined us next month's line
party or coughs out of this the
offseason land party if you will is
going to be counter-strike source which
means we've got a couple months to play
and trust me the scrimmages are starting
now we are going to be playing the
official and then probably sure this is
one of many official counter-strike land
party games on May 18th at 8 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time
of course game dot hack 5 org so you can
find all of the details at hack 5 org
slash land party and sign up because we
would love to you know maybe start some
ladders or something to be great and if
you don't have source and may have other
open source or we an open arena or so
yeah some stuff that you can play
without spending a 45 or 46 up next
comes our discussion on your web two
point is the
it's surrounded check it out so Darren
what if you even flying around with on
our website and there's some interesting
things popping out okay well the thing
was I decided here it is the end of the
season let's have some fun we never
really talked about web - oh stuff yeah
so why not and there's all these fun
little web - of stuff that we've been
using over the last you know a couple
months that I thought would be fun to do
a little mashup and bring them all
together throw them on the site and have
some fun all right well let's see what
you get okay so this is probably
familiar the hak5 website and what we've
done is we've gone to slash set cam and
we scroll down here live from
Williamsburg Virginia knows there's us
way over here yeah there and this is
streaming through Ustream
okay embed it into this page also on the
right here we have a gab lead chat
that's kind of an AJAX chat built into
the site embedded in the page and if we
scroll down and you're gonna have to
mind this resolution at 800 by 600 for
video reasons and desktop tired you
can't go wrong with desktop tower
defense in fact if you haven't played it
word of warning it's slightly addictive
in fact we had to pry Wes off of it just
so we could shoot this segment we're
like we're gonna shoot like hang on I
got a squirt tower yeah it took them a
long time remember that there's a pause
yeah but uh so what you got it okay how
did you get it to do that well sure it's
pretty easy I mean all of these services
allow you to embed their code really
easily so just open up the source code
here oh and it's bad HTML it's it's half
XHTML and it's with the CSS and the
other half is my handiwork which is yeah
HTML 4.0 spec I don't close my BR
statements but if we just scroll down
here we can see first off here is long
you stream yeah I'll see you at there's
the stream code let's see you got it a
custom width and height there exactly
yeah when you uh when you embed most of
these things you find them these online
services they allow you to normal format
exactly just like you're used to with
YouTube that you can embed on your
you can actually take a look at the
source code and just tweak it a little
bit and we changed the resolution to 450
by 367 it was originally like 300
something but what you have to do is you
know take whatever the original
resolution is the width and divided by
the height so it is at 450 times or I'm
sorry / 367 and then 1.2 to 6 that's our
aspect ratio so if we wanted to do like
640 by 480
we take 640 times one point 2 to 6 and
that's what our width would need to be
okay - or our alright one of those yeah
to maintain the aspect resolution and
whatnot all right what about the gap
legit sure to get that in there what is
that gladly chats really easy all we do
is we head over to got Wacom and we grab
this and it's just an iframe we pop this
code in there and of course we've got
options like scrolling and here's where
we add the the width and the height
whoops and it's it's pretty easy to
adjust this code and what is gambling do
I've never actually seen that before
let's head over the gab Lee's site this
is at G a B Bly calm it's basically a
way to embed your own custom little
ajaxy chatroom on any page whatsoever
they make it super easy to do so we've
head over to the website we can choose
let's say we want a chat window with 600
width and a 400 height and then we give
it the URL where we want to embed it and
we click generate and down here there's
our code so we just paste that right
into there and you know it gives us that
that's really all there is to it yeah
this isn't your typical IRC or anything
like that doesn't connect to an IRC
server just connects to the gobbly stuff
on the back end and so it's just a chat
for like that page for just for that
page and if you get like a link within
that page if somebody posts a link you
click it it'll take you to you know your
new tab in Firefox with another gabbling
shot just for that page so everybody
following the links can be like oh
you're here too so it's kind of fun we
had the option on like hak5 org slash
chat you can go and you can use the the
java chat that we have but i didn't want
to like
more java in here you know it's like a
sauna you've got a 486 this page might
make your system crawl
so that's Gabe Lee Ustream is pretty
easy to use you just you know you sign
up for your service you'd click
broadcast you'd get an option to I'll
just go ahead and log in here Oh No and
you can see your broadcast here we have
the hack five set cam we also have
another generic one I knew it would just
be an embed code exactly we just hit
play live and then you get this window
you would allow and if we had a webcam
in here then they would just start
broadcasting the audio and video and
that's what we're doing right across
from the set we have our gobbly chat and
hello people all right well now I know
desktop tower defense is I thought it
was part of like another page how did
you get it to be embedded into it right
desktop tower defense is part of
hand-drawn Gamescom and all it is really
is a flash game yeah so it's really easy
to just view the source and copy and
make your own alterations to embed it on
your page I definitely suggest everybody
checking out desktop tower defense on
the set cam page to actually go over to
their site because they had they're
supported by advertising and we're not
trying to rip off their stuff we're just
trying to got all these fun little cool
things so you're sitting there watching
the the webcam while we're filming and
you're playing Billy chat you can you
know get a little game on all right cool
so uh actually if you go back to it I
gotta say all this looks familiar like
weren't you able to do this back in like
web 1.0 no yeah but it wasn't as easy
wasn't as easy where is fun because we
didn't have gradient surrounded corners
then what it's definitely very cool well
I like the fact that the there's a
community that has spawned right here
just like we have a community in the
forums and in the IRC and the wiki
there's just yeah an ad hoc community
forms people that like to hang out here
in the galley chat watch the set say hey
look it's Kirby you know yeah with an e
not an AI and it's kind of funny so it's
just another place for people the same
kind of exactly here's to meet in fact
if if you want you can sign up at that
Ustream Brad
your own webcam we even have a little
mashup that we did a little bit earlier
hi-5 org I was actually part of that one
slash dream had this other page and this
one is just a whole bunch of gap or
there's AG a bleach at up there and then
we've got a whole bunch of youth streams
and nobody's on but we had myself Ally
Hugh Kate Webb moonlit Rubik the Tron
can't i duke kodi neeya chives advil box
gamax brad actually Witten's emo so i
just gonna make sure they get their
shout out in there for being part of the
crew that got in early on that and it's
fun because you put them all together
and what you end up with is like a whole
screen full of everybody's webcams and
you're all chatting with audio so it's
kind of like a video skype conferencing
and but but i'll all flash and it just
kills your browser but is so much fun
and there's the fun thing where if
you're in this box right here you can
like look over on your webcam make it
looks like what was that Brady Bunch
yeah yeah we gotta stick Wes in the
middle so he'll be Alice he's giving me
the eye so I think he's actually a
center square okay I think he's also
asking us to wrap up and then really
this is low-tech but it's fun and
thought it'd be a fun little thing or
trying out some embedded code some web -
it's better than the first one all right
new package so we're gonna take a quick
commercial break and when we get back
we'll be finishing our Apple TV Apple TV
hacking can't wait to get that all back
together so stay tuned we'll be back

tired of sucking at complicated music
games coming soon to the Nintendo Wii
cowbell revolution using the Wiis
revolutionary new control scheme you
could virtually live your lifelong
dreams of being a cowbell hero rock out
to the catalog with 30 different
authentic cowbell rhythms or make your
own game doesn't keep score cowbell
revolution you got me all right so it's
time to get back to our Apple TV hacking
at the beginning of the show we open up
the box and enabled SSH so we're about
to log in and get our plugins and our
codecs and all that fun stuff on but
before we do that it's time to ask Paul
all of your favorite Apple TV hacking
resources I was really saying what
people would first deal with this thing
when it first came out so there was a
number of sites like kana mentioned in
it and like dig and size job but one
that I mainly went to was Apple TV hacks
dotnet and it kind of has kind of a you
know web 2.0 nice looking stuff and it
covers a whole kind of variety anything
that kind of mentions it so is it was
pretty easy and then like later on this
started develop summer I think it was on
like the arc I can't remember how it
started but there's a place that
developed called wiki awkward tv.org or
yes it's an organization he'll write
yeah this is a great resource I love
when when anything hacking starts to
come out like the Wii hacking or the
Nintendo DS to the PSP anything like
these starts up it's like God have the
wiki at free of wiki
so you're right this is a great resource
and they've got all sorts of stuff
basically you got your news they've got
information about plugins they've even
got an IRC channel so you can go in
there and ruffle may all you want
and that's pound awkward TV on
irc.speedrunslive.com seems
for thinking cuz it they have like what
they call like working like projects
where they're trying to enable other
hacks for the Apple TV that just haven't
been completed yet simply due to like
research time right so if you're into
this and you're like hey you know you
could probably do this really awesomely
if you had some parole and there's some
code to get into that because we love
that we think it's great so definitely
support this site so I guess now it's
time to talk about what hacks we're
gonna do we got SSH on here let's go
ahead and login the enabler of all the
hex the enabler okay so we'll do on
Windows by fire putty
oh yeah no one no I I can't yeah II what
well I could go through the command
prompt but I don't have an SSH client so
well I guess I don't know I have to
download one I just kind of do yeah yeah
you and yours your Linux in your Mac we
have to tack on a one to tell it to use
SSH one right we do have to use SSH one
there's instructions on the Aqua TV wiki
on enabling SSH to but for our purposes
it's on the home network I'm not really
worried about it I'm gonna go in through
this gonna use putty give it the IP
address and what we need to keep in mind
here is with that plist that we set up
the username and password to log in here
is gonna be front row very ironic and
the password is front row and there
we're we're at the Darwin prompt we've
got our bash prompt and we can do an LS
and you know CD to the root and all
sorts of fun stuff and for the most part
what we need to do now to get our
plugins and our codecs on is to copy
files and we could like West SAS before
use SCP through the command prompt but I
like to use this this program here this
is winscp it's a GUI for just you know
drag-and-drop you can see it looks just
like Windows Explorer and I've already
navigated to the slash library slash
QuickTime directory and this is where
we're going to put our codecs
yep well again on Linux and Mac it it's
already kind of built in well except for
Mac you have to use fugu is
mentioned before to get the
drag-and-drop to go ahead like gooey but
on Linux is just kind of in your so
we've copied over the harrion component
and the a52 codec component can you tell
me a little bit about these codecs
essentially all their these are kind of
like prepackaged for a lot of the things
you'll find on the Internet as far as X
bits and mpeg-2 and stuff like that the
office of the audio part and it just
kind of so the Parian is a kind of a
codec pack yeah so that'll give us our X
bit in our DivX and stuff like that and
the 852 codec that's an audio codec yep
I mean ac3 right so we've got our sound
our video and one of the names that yeah
but we've got links in the show notes
where to get these codec packs and it's
really easy you just copy them over to
slash libraries slash QuickTime on the
Apple TV so now that we can play that
content that we've got we need to find a
way to actually get access it so for
that we're gonna need a plug-in
yeah and aqua TV it has a nice plug-in
directory that kind of helps you along
with a lot of it and the first one we
write that need to get is that's a TV
files right and the plugins are at
plugins to awkward tv.org
and this is great list we've got the atv
files which we're about to show off
they've also got the RSS the sports core
is the weather I mean you can even you
know there's one here run pearl yeah so
good stuff definitely a fun resource for
the plugins we're just going to focus on
the ATV and the RSS so once you've
downloaded the ATV plug-in which is our
files menu allows us to see the the DivX
and the x beds that we've put on it all
we have to do is copy it over to OS boot
and it's in the system so let me just
navigate there let's go up one level
system library it's under core core
services and then finder app if there's
a Mac stuff right there and then under
contents and then plugins and we see all
these fr appliance this is very
interesting because like since they
already have this directory
you can see where it kind of goes along
with like the interface of the Apple TV
that it's already kind of like hmm free
thought that Apple might put other
plugins into there and enable some new
features for the Apple TV yeah I could
see that coming down the road just kind
of I guess they took advantage of that
yeah I mean it's like when everybody
started hacking the weed to get a web
browser and then you know they're like
oh here's opera you know it's like oh
great you know all that but no I mean
this is really cool because we could do
stuff that Apple won't release if they
ever do yeah you can see you've got the
TV appliance we've got our settings our
podcast photos music movies those are
the ones that are initially in the menu
here and if you see in the menu we've
got the movies on this channel right
here TVs the music and whatnot on this
display right here and these all you
have to do is just copy it over so we've
got our a TV files to F our appliance we
got over that over and was there
anything else like that that pretty much
enables the a TV files just allows you
to browse the the files and actually
player and we've pretty loaded on some
movies then I ripped from my personal
collection then you know some free
content like pure rubbish
so we can go ahead and like play an
awesome episode of pure ownage and not
have to transcode it over to over to the
QuickTime or the h.264 mpeg-4 all that
fun stuff one of the other fun plugins
III think it's pretty cool is the RSS
plugin so same deal download the plug-in
and copy it over to system library core
services finder app components are
content / plugins and that's the RSS but
this one actually has a file that you
need to kind of write in where you want
your RSS feeds to come from so you can
kind of hand select whatever you want
right there is a configuration file and
that goes in users / front row and we'll
see our RSS feeds file here and it's
real simple
we've got slash dot in here so eaters
they're our RSS dot slash dot org slash
what a slash dot and then got to make
sure that you have a pipe right here and
then
anything after the pipe is actually what
it's going to be named end it with a
semicolon so if we go and look over here
we actually have the RSS plug-in and we
can go down into slash dot and actually
check out some of these stories what's
the other one well I don't know
something about the riaa something about
Apple something about Microsoft you know
there's no winning hey look there's
something about Google on slashed are
you serious I don't see it yeah there it
is oh well you know it's fun because
then you can read your RSS feeds on your
couch with your Apple remote and I think
that's really nifty so that's the the
primer the fundamentals of getting
plug-ins in there getting your codecs in
there let me see now we can play our
other file formats and whatnot so you
wanted to look forward and well hacking
like I've been kind of reading into a
lot of sites again and there's also an
ability because it's a Mac it has a lot
of kind of the UNIX file sharing
structures along with the Apple FP but
at the one I've been focusing on was a
NFS and essentially what we was thinking
of this may be kind of like a myth TV
back in for because we have to have
cable with our internet right take
advantage of that maybe
so you're saying rather than by our
shows for two dollars a piece on the
Apple iTunes Store
we can just record them and more
illegally and it's already coming to our
house and then have all the Apple TVs in
the house to sync up with those yeah and
it'll just just go straight to that
offline folder because right now we only
have a 40 gigabyte hard drive down here
might as well use that streaming
functionality and the you know Dex bed
and DivX finally have it more available
to everybody else to access sounds like
fun little project looking forward I'm
sure we're going to be getting into that
in the off season so something to look
forward to in just a few months as we
come back and get everything off to
start it up again so Paul thank you so
much for hacking open the Apple TV it
was a lot of fun all right so I'm gonna
go and chat with West we're gonna give
our closing remarks and wrap this bad
boy up
rock on
nice all right so uh
we're here at the end of the last
episode of season 2 of hak5
Finn done you know it's been a good
season we're coming up on that time now
where the hack fives gonna see a lot of
changes a special time beat the
adolescence period of this yes but this
is the point you know we start changing
things hopefully always about the better
you know take a look at what we've done
we always you know reflect on things
that we've done try to pick out the
things we did right the things that we
horribly sucked at and the things that
they're working yeah so they're you know
and you might see some changes on the
website if an eye on that doing some
tweaking mmm and speaking of the website
yes my ad DS gonna kick in right now
sure don't forget that you can always
contact us and always always be a part
of the hak5 community community we are
very accepting in fact you know we both
hang out on the forms and IRC like all
the time there's new communities growing
in the wiki's and you know every corner
of the you know you probe us on port 80
and you'll find a community just about
everywhere so you just did probe us some
please yeah
so yeah make sure you're active on the
forums active on the wiki active in the
IRC it's a great great community and we
love everybody that's in it mmm from the
bottom of our hearts except remember
once you so what we're gonna do is take
two months off this is the regular pair
we're gonna come back on August 5th
mm-hm and with the premiere of three xo1
but don't get so sad because we're not
completely gone yeah it's not it's not
like you're techno Lester's gone for the
next two months because one you always
carry your own technolo
and two during the offseason we are
going to air the pilot of hak5 live now
you've seen the alphas you've seen the
betas of hak5 live are you saying that
we're going gold no no no no are you say
that's a pilot pilot okay it's a release
candidate Oh released oh you know what
that makes me feel so much better a
release kinda no pressure it's a rc1
yeah we're not RTM yet I'm down I'm down
with that when our team yet but it's
definitely an RC one so we're out of
like web 2.0 on this one
must be like 3.0 for actually coming out
of beta all right but no it and the
whole premise of this show is going to
be very community driven we're gonna
look over you know all the projects that
are going on the wiki suggestions in the
forums topics that have come up over
like they know that we always say you
can send questions or questions at act
five that Oregon we never answer on the
show you know this is why there's not
enough room on the board this is the
episode yeah so we're going to make more
room by expanding the show and I'm sure
you guys will enjoy it it's gonna be
really cool it's gonna be really
laid-back really chill you actually
