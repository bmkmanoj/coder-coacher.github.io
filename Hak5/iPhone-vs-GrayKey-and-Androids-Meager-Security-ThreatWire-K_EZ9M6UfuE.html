as much as they should
Gregg he lets cops unlock encrypted
iPhones and everything you need to know
about the Facebook Zuckerberg hearing
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for April 17 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom our patreon
is at patreon.com slash threat wire and
that is always the best way to support
the show and will help us reach our next
goal so if you want access to exclusives
check out the patreon link in the show
notes below and now on to the news first
off we have Android so our top story
this week was chosen by our patreon
patrons and is all about Android with
over two billion Android devices
currently in use worldwide it's pretty
important that these phones be updated
each time a new update is available to
patch security holes Google's own phones
the pixel line they continue to be the
most up to date since the patches come
from their own home base but many other
vendors have stated that they have upped
their game when it comes to releasing
these patches on a timely basis every
single month now security researchers at
the security research lab tested
multiple samples of 23 different
manufacturers to determine how often
they patch and if they were missing any
of the critical or high severity patches
in their updates they released their
findings on April 13th at the hack in
the box conference in Amsterdam samples
were in lots either they had a few which
means they had 5 to 9 many which means
they had 10 to 49 or lots which means
they had 50-plus samples with around
3,000 phones tested total vendors that
did include the critical patches include
Google Samsung and Sony and a few others
ones that we're missing four or more
critical patches for vulnerabilities
include ZTE TCL and others vendors like
oneplus motorola HTC LG and huawei we're
somewhere in between the researchers
were able to determine which patches
were missing by looking at the binary
itself on each and every phone that they
tested Sol explained that just
because a patch is missing does not
necessarily mean the device is
vulnerable to a hack in the event that
they still have received all the other
updates needed to protect against a
known issue and with androids built-in
sandboxing in a SLR that's probably the
case now with that said they also link
to an app called snoop snitch which they
created that can help you determine if
you've received all updates needed on
your phone but active monitoring with
this app requires a rooted device with a
Qualcomm chip set which not all Android
devices use the problem as many of these
manufacturers have been lying to their
users when you go into your settings and
you check your updates and your phone
says you are up-to-date you expect that
you had already have received all of the
updates available but the SRL
researchers expose the problem several
manufacturers would simply and quietly
skip certain patches while sending you
the rest of them so some phones were
missing multiple patches even if the
phone said that it was update eight now
as always patching is a must but you may
want to move to iPhone but I guess those
are also kind of screwed as well ah yes
the iPhone yeah those are screwed to at
least in their current state of
encryption they are it reports by
motherboard and malwarebytes Labs a
device called grey key can brute force
encryption on iOS devices even with the
newest operating systems including iOS
11 for as little as $15,000 a company
called grey shift which was founded in
2016 in Atlanta Georgia has been selling
small boxy devices called grey keys to
federal agencies and local law
enforcement offices in the United States
prices for a year-long license are
either 15,000 for a connected version
with 300 uses so that's 300 iphones or
30,000 for an offline version with
unlimited uses so they'd be able to use
this as many times as they want now when
a law enforcement agent needs to use the
device they plug an eye device into the
grey key and it starts brute-forcing the
encryption it is controlled by a web UI
and it requires no special training to
use once running on a device it'll take
a couple of hours to a few days to
unlock and break the encryption
on the device it works on any numeric
passcode lock in malwarebytes suspects
that it uses a jailbreak technique
though no hard technical data or
evidence is available publicly many
security researchers think that it
replaces iboot firmware with a custom
boot firmware that defeats each layer of
security the devices are only sold to
verified law enforcement by the creator
which is again great shift the $15,000
version uses a geofencing technique so
that once it's hooked up to a network
and set up it can only be used on that
one network unfortunately though
networks can be spoofed or compromised
wireless or wired with Lam taps or other
devices like a pineapple so whether or
not they protect against attacks is yet
to be determined
the $30,000 option is an offline model
that requires a two-factor
authentication code to work but how and
where the two-factor authentication code
is stored could be a very important
factor in its security
according to letters and emails leaked
to motherboard agencies have already
purchased or they are currently
receiving quotes for the devices
including the DEA the FBI Secret Service
along with many small local law
enforcement offices now the implications
are tremendous for a device like this
even if a device like this never ended
up on the black market which I suspect
that it would if it was resold by a law
enforcement agency a license could be
copied and networks can be spoofed but
even if it never gets out into a public
space many innocent citizens could see
their iPhones being decrypted by this
device during a court case then turned
over afterwards but what does the device
do to the phone with that broken
encryption be fixed upon wiping the
operating system or is this really a
boot issue with their phones forever be
vulnerable to any hacks
could someone reverse engineer this
device and break its security measures
it works with a web GUI so is that web
GUI secure who knows and I have so many
questions in the meantime this seems to
only work against phones that use
passcode protection so if you switch to
authentication with an alphanumeric
passcode instead that might help up
has not released a statement about the
device at time of recording so we are
unsure if they will be releasing any
better encryption as well Mark
Zuckerberg of Facebook spent two days in
Congress hearings answering questions
about the business that he runs and how
they handle security and privacy of
their users much of it was not very
exciting or breaking news to be honest
but I did want to point out a few
pertinent details that came to light
from the hearings one detail that was
brought up by representative Ben Lujan
a Democrat from New Mexico was the idea
of a shadow profile so this is where
Facebook collects valuable data about
you from various data analytics firms as
well as the profile of data that you
have put on the page yourself this is
data from sites that you make purchases
on because yay cookies and data brokers
as well as things that you have liked
disliked or followed this data is used
to show you tailored ads which is why
even if you don't have a brand's page on
Facebook or mention it on Facebook you
will still see an ad for it based on
browsing habits or other social
platforms unfortunately we did not get
any kind of meaty questions due to the
fact that many senators just did not
know how Facebook worked or they got
confused about the terminology
Zuckerberg did receive several questions
that he was unable to answer and many of
these had to do with specifics of
handling data or amounts of data kept
which the CEO said that his team would
follow up on surprisingly they had heard
about the conspiracy theory that
Facebook listens to your conversations
and serves up ads based on those combos
and he did deny the claim Zuckerberg had
to repeatedly explain that Facebook does
not sell data to advertisers but it does
give access to that data to third
parties Senator John Cornyn a Republican
of Texas was concerned that users did
not know or understand Facebook's Terms
of Service and the data they agreed to
give away was not informed consent
Zuckerberg agreed that users probably do
not actually read the Terms of Service
oops senators did miss a good
opportunity to ask Zuckerberg about
Russian pages that were operating to
influence narratives he did receive a
few questions regarding this topic but
neither went into very much detail as
far as how Facebook acted
nor did we find out a facebook deleted
any kind of data beforehand or if any of
their employees offered assistance to
the Russian agency the internet research
agency or the IRA we did learn that
Facebook has talked to special
prosecutor Robert Muller
but Zuckerberg did not comment on what
those conversations were about Muller
has been investigating the Russian ties
to the US as 2016 election and given the
amount of accounts on Facebook created
to post paid ads and organic regular
posts about hot issues this does not
necessarily come as a surprise Facebook
also had some positive news the company
is launching a new bug bounty with
payouts as much as forty thousand
dollars for reports about data abuse on
its platform by at developers Facebook
also stopped fighting against a major
privacy bill that was proposed in
California it's called the California
consumer Privacy Act to go on November's
ballot and it would give users an option
to opt out of data collection and forces
companies to explicitly state what data
they are collecting the companies would
also be held liable of any kind of
breach of data Facebook had donated
$200,000 to the committee to protect
California jobs which is a group that
was fighting against the Act of course I
am a little bit skeptical with the
countless times that Zuckerberg said I
don't know or I'll have to have my team
follow up with you on that it sounds
like he doesn't know how to run his own
company but I do suspect that he didn't
want to give any hard facts in such a
public forum when so many users are
watching perhaps until the news dies
down maybe
unfortunately for Facebook though they
have been in the news for a few straight
months now and I do not see that
changing anytime soon I want to give a
shout out to our patrons on patreon for
sharing their favorite news on the
community tab if you are a patreon
patron you can send in your favorite
stories on that community tab to get
featured in the show and every Friday
I'm going to pick three or more top
stories for a voting poll that patrons
can vote on to be included in next
week's show everyone who sports
throughout wire patreon.com slash threat
where are the reason that keep we can
keep on bringing you news every single
week we are on the way to our next goal
which allows me to cover the cost of
upgrading some of this equipment here
and we will also open
a live video Q&amp;amp;A just for patrons each
and every month and if you are already a
patron you get access to an audio RSS
feed first looks at show topics pulls
discussions just for patrons and a whole
lot more and any little bit helps us
grow the show this month my goal is to
get to 850 patrons we are just short of
reaching that goal so sharing the show
with your friends signing up to donate
just $1 a month it all helps a ton and
thank you so much to everybody who sends
in cute little fur babies I love
checking them out and they are adorable
from some of our patreon supporters to
check out the perk levels on patreon
