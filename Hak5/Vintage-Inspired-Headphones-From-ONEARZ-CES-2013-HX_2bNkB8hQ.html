go further with Peck 5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2013 with
revision3.com and I found some really
style and headphones with mr. David Peru
from on ears now
tell me a little bit about these why are
they dressed in denim because this one
as the is built for the image as James
Dean so this is the the denim jeans and
the the red corners that he was wearing
in the in the movies rebel as a course
no we set the curves so very familiar
with that now what about these other two
you have a couple of vintage ones over
here yes so the ACDC model is a very
specific design with the stats on the on
the hip dance so it makes it really
really nice I think and really different
from other headphones that you can find
out the markets all those things that we
have is a brushed aluminum ranges which
makes it a very strong and a
nice-looking it's of course a foldable
with detachable cables and we provide
different cables one with microphone to
pick up the phone and one without
microphone for people who don't have
compatible mobile phone for this kind of
feature that's excellent it's nice to
hear that I can actually answer the
phone with these I don't have to take
them off to actually use them when your
phone rings our music will oppose and
you can pick up the phone then very cool
now on what is this one that's dressed
in leather so this one in a brown
leather he's the Elvis one Elvis Presley
so this is another icon for the product
for the vintage sorry so this is
basically a models with different
looking so this one is born later and
Elvis a signature inside that forms
that's beautiful and can I try some of
these on real quick okay awesome
yeah let's try those on
so you just plug it in on the bottom and
it looks like the volume depends on the
phone that you're using so that's all
everything's compatible on your phone
and it feels pretty comfortable they're
really lightweight and they're loud
got some Bruno Mars playing yeah they're
really soft right here and you can hear
the low bass and it's very clear and
Chris
so I can he understand all of the music
it's not muffled at all these are really
nice headphones actually I'm quite
impressed I was a little bit like I
don't know they're vintage they got a
nice style I'm not sure they're not only
beautiful you ever saw the good sound
exactly now you also have these more
upscale ones over here what is different
about these compared to these for this
one you have the construction is
different this is more complex and you
have also better driver insight so the
music is even better the sound is not
balanced is not for her professional
audio enthusiastics this one you have
also perceive a noise reduction with the
big situation in a material skull
protein material so it's very soft
and it it removed the noise from from
outsides very cool it's a beautiful
piece of headphone work and does this
come with anything else does it come
with like the big stereo equipment yes
you have this cable with the microphone
again to pick up the phone and then
cable for the DG's you also get the case
yes you receive a nicer carrying case to
protect it and you have called cable for
the DG's three meter one so very long
like this and you receive also the 6.3
millimeter adapter it's mainly for the
DG's and a plane adapter if you travel
with a product that's cool I think you
know my dad would love this he's a big
audiophile geek and I'm personally I
gotta go with this ones I mean rock on
right so how much do these cost and the
more professional ones so these 1d
series cost - 99 euro retail price $99
and/or your eyes the same and 189 for
this one yeah america has to be
different right and where can people
find more information and one day will
be available in America people can find
for the moment information on on Eskom
what's right and it will be available in
the US or on March or April of this year
