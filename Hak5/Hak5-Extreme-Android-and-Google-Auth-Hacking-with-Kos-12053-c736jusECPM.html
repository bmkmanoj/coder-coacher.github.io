assist it's time once again to check
port 110 yes it is so this week David
writes and he said he's a big fan of the
show thank you David keep up the great
work thank you we will I am curious if
you have run into a script that can
monitor the availability of a specific
SSID and in the event that SSID becomes
unavailable run another script the
scenario bomb
we have laptops with full drive
encryption a pre bootloader and sure
your entire drive stays encrypted the
thing is if your laptop is currently
booted and running what is what good is
your full Drive Encryption someone
swipes your laptop and combine whatever
they want as long as the computer stays
running yeah that's not good
I want a script that will forcibly shut
the computer down without warning if the
laptop leaves the building
ie the specific SSID is no longer
available any thoughts or resources you
can think of we are a window shop of
course ok so all of that I was like dude
I totally have the solution for you
until you said we're a window shopping I
sympathize I've been there that's fun
working 19 windows and so here's what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna throw out the
solution that I already have in my head
for Linux and hopefully with the
crowdsource brain of the hi-5 community
we can come up with something cool so
what I'm gonna do is begin by doing an
IWW and 0 scan and then grep for SSID
and I can see right here that there's a
couple of different access points in the
area and this one risa here is one that
I'm familiar with as it's nearby the
hak5 studio so I'm going to copy this
and what I'll do next is wlan0 scan
again but this time wrapped just for the
word Risa and as you can see I only find
Risa and now I have results and I can
test continually whether or not this
access point is in the area so now all
we have to do is put together an awesome
bash script so I'll use nano give nanos
and love and we'll call it Risa Sh and
start it with a slash she bang slash bin
slash bash not SH because there's the
difference between Jo and again and
thanks for emailing about that one yeah
and so what we'll want to do here is a
while loop just while true so it'll
continue doing kids it while true it's
always true it's true true yeah
true that alright so while true
semicolon do and so it's going to
continue doing whatever we tell it in
this case we're gonna create a variable
called test and it's going to be
beginning with the dollar sign in
parentheses our command
so that's IWW and zero scan and then
grep for Arisa
all right so end that with our
parentheses and so next all we have to
do is test this variable we do so with
the if command and then in brackets
space quote dollar sign test that
variable we just created close our
quotes and then if it equals two equal
signs means not means if it is equal to
if it returns exactly what i put in
quotes here and so i'm gonna do quotes
i'm going to paste what i had copied
from our output before notice how
there's a tab here so that's why i
copied it and then basically just close
this out with my brackets so it's gonna
do an if so if the test for the access
point in the area responds with you know
what we expect to see well then
obviously everything is all good so then
on a new line and we let's just echo
stuff to just kind of do some debugging
and I'll say echo network in range and
then else and we'll just echo network
out of range ah okay and this is where
you would want to put in like a reboot
command or a power off command or a
shutdown now or something like that
because you know obviously the laptop
has left the building it's out of range
of your Wi-Fi access point and so here's
where you would put your fun stuff in
right now I'm just gonna have everything
echo to the terminal just so that I can
kind of like know and debugging and I
don't want to like have my machine
rebooting when I'm trying to debug so
finally all we have to do is hit Phi
fi it's if backwards and it ends our if
statement and I'm going to put a sleep
one here you might want to make this
actually more like however long you want
in between each interval of this test
I'm gonna do one second cause I'm just
debugging but 30 seconds whatever you're
comfortable and then finally so
beautiful just done and so that done
statement actually ends our while loop
so I'm going to close that out and save
it and make it executable with chmod and
I'm going to run it so
I run Risa now said network can range
over and over and over until of course
the network is no longer in range which
I guess I could do function f3 on my
laptop to disable Wi-Fi and then
suddenly Network out of range cuz my I
turn off my Wi-Fi radio okay so just a
review you you find the SSID somewhere
in your local area and then you write
the script to tell you that it's in
range or if it's out of range and then
you'd put a little delay in there is
that correct yeah just put it away and
so what I would do with this whole thing
is I would make it so that it runs on on
a cron job so that is like a scheduled
task over and over so it just makes sure
that it's always running and so that way
if the laptop leaves the building you
could have it send you an alert way all
sorts of other fun stuff yeah hey that's
secure so what I want to know though is
for those like see scripters out there
and all those you know windows api know
it all is like email us because i would
love to have something that we can put
together kind of similar to this for the
windows side nice well stay tuned
because coming up we've got some awesome
trivia and your Technol us photos of the

believe it still booted had the correct
date and the time was off by a whole two
hours y2k whatevs he says that the
little guy has its RAM maxed out at a
whole get this 640 kilobytes
awesome 640 K is all anyone ever needs
right 640 that's hold my shears to 640 k
a conventional right there I was
actually remember on my PC XT my first
computer 4.77 megahertz had only 512 K
around it's that kind of sucked because
ok all the good games need ok yeah
that's a little strong
good water yeah anyway if you guys don't
