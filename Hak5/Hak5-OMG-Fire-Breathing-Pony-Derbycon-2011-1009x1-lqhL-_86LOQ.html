AKA Dave Kennedy founder of Der Beek on
and the social engineering tool kit
muaks is back in the house with all
things metasploit and john from level
one hackerspace shares with us a very
special animatronic pony that breathes
fire yeah yeah whoo ponies the free fire
all that and more this time on hak5 this
segment of hak5 is brought to you by
t-mobile hello and welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen me llamo is
Shannon what my name is Shannon Oh pound
include beard age cuz it's another
fantastic episode of hak5 we got some
good stuff from der beek on yes we do
but you know what I went to a wedding
this weekend that's fantastic so did I
wedding was it sarafina's that's the
wedding I was at work now oh my god this
is awesome because there's no longer
Sarafina issues producer of the
wonderful show on revision3 that is
tekzilla so if you haven't watched that
go and check it out it was a beautiful
ceremony lots of wine did you catch the
bouquet I didn't the singer Emily and
read okay she has a beautiful like 20 s
jazz era voice awesome music it was so
much fun yeah I was glad to go up there
for that this weekend yo evil server has
a reason Regis yeah it's all his friends
getting mushy I know yeah we wanted to
talk about the amuses us we have to keep
on like kicking him out of the room
every time we record an episode because
he keeps on getting off well that in the
cigar smoking I mean yeah one lick in
California's like really yeah you you
have to go outside it's like 50 feet
away from or not we should really put a
camera on evil server with some stogies
and some whiskey and like just let him
rattle it off cuz he's got a lot yeah he
really needs to vent it out like right
now yeah it's pretty bad but hey um good
news we also got a gift from a fan oh I
love it want to get gifts from fans who
is it this week this is from
Max and I can't I don't know is this
German it says computer for Allah and
volcom in Minnesota but no this is
actually from DK which is Denmark
Denmark yes but I don't speak Denmark
ian i think i think that's danish thank
you this is awesome i love i love seeing
things in different languages like one
of your friends brought some newspapers
from Thailand to know way too dirty
Connor knows yeah we should show those
off on the next room yeah we should was
it a techie newspaper yep whoa uh no
it's just around whose paper but this is
pretty cool yeah like seeing what you
know magazines look like in other
countries you know if I ever get the
chance to go to Japan i will pick up
like 50 million pop culture magazines
from japan and and then it all will be
about what's going on in the United
States family but in Japanese so it'll
look cooler yeah which is a great export
all right well let's get on with it we
have some fantastic stuff I want you
guys to stay tuned because coming up we
got relic from der beek on talking about
set we got muvek talking about
metasploit and a my little pony that
breeze fire well it's a polity it
breathes fire stay tuned
I'm here with Joe another creative
hacker at Derby con 2011 from level 1
hackerspace here in Louisville how are
you Joe I'm doing great and who's your
little pal here this is butterscotch my
fire-breathing pony who fire breathing
pony please explain well it's a pony
that um breathes fire it started out
life as a childs toy and we made it
better better well you know what I gotta
say it probably I can only imagine when
it was skinned it was already probably
creepy enough but you've obviously taken
it to like level 11 or something just
skinning it alone yeah it was already in
the uncanny valley when when we found it
but we figure we can make it better
bigger faster stronger more fiery what's
the inspiration behind that um other
animatronic things that have been
skinned just if you see one of them than
you know that if you see an animatronic
thing it's your duty to take its skin
off it's like Terminator I'm just
imagining some very creepy moment in
Disneyland with like it's a small world
or something like that how do you hear
you have the obligatory nunchuck
controller amazing thing to just attach
to any kind of electronics I how do you
go about controlling this guy ok so the
num truck controller is being fed into a
the Arduino market controller here and
then that microcontroller is just
tapping into the preexisting motor
control system that was already there
and how was that it was great it was
surprisingly when I open it up it was
the circuit board was labeled it had
color-coded wires it was a beautiful
beautiful sight whoa it's like code that
was commented it's so this is all
running by an Arduino so is this all
like right now and see open source good
stuff like that yeah it's in the Arduino
see ish language but I have all the code
and will hopefully be pushing it out
once I clean it up a little and put
those comments in ya know that's
important stuff and I'm sure a lot of
people are going to want to you know
kind of following these footsteps and
try similar stuff because you're right i
mean who doesn't love the creepy
animatronic animal how did you get it to
breathe fire
the fire is actually fueled by starter
fluid which is mostly ether and it's
it's held in the belly and then we have
a cable for safety of course to be able
to remotely trigger the cans and then it
goes up this tube and then X is it
through the mouth and then at the mouth
we have a real igniter that ignites it
she just pop that right off a grill and
there you go shoot some flames now you
guys had this over at maker faire here
in Detroit didn't you yes we did and it
must have been a fan favorite the kids
must love it Oh kids love it parents not
so much but we think it's important to
give kids goals that cause distress to
their parents absolutely I gotta say
this is really awe-inspiring do you have
like a well what's an actually have like
a farm of these guys happen in a zoo
yeah so I have another pony that we need
to probably help put out fires with and
then I have a dinosaur we have an
orangutang at the space someone's
working on but the next thing is to get
this this little girl walking so you can
imagine the the pony to complement it
with maybe a fire extinguisher or
something and then you want them to trot
around yeah I would preferably be able
to the rat around maker faire next year
instead of having to stand next to a
pony so hopefully we'll have her up and
walking on six legs very shortly well on
six legs six legs are better than four
okay that's another level of creepiness
they're so awesome i love the the gist
of creativity of this is their place
where some people can go and find the
ins now to like you know because
obviously this is like a toy that is
commercially available if somebody else
wants to hack this and kind of do
something similar maybe have it shoot
ice or something is that something you
have documented well the documentation
is not up i'm working on it I'm much
better at doing things than documenting
them but hopefully within the next week
I'll have all the up on level one org oh
nice you guys have like a wiki there for
level one yeah we have a wiki on the
level one site and we also just have a
main blog that i'll i'll be posting all
them from
shahnaz we go and I also be getting it
up on instructables once I have that
done that is so sweet Joe thank you so
much it's been a pleasure this is like I
said awe inspiring hey muma run oh yeah
