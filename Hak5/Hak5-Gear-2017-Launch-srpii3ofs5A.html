I'm gonna hand the microphone over to
our longtime hak5 developer and now the
lead of software development and the
whole team set can assemble this is the
part where you drive forward and then
I'm gonna give you a hand see it's
actually really weird to look down upon
set because he's normally like eight
feet tall metric so I'm just gonna give
him a little I'm just gonna hold you up
and then you unmute yourself and then
you Inoue yourself just mentioned the
team ah we have Morgan Henry helping
else off the belt but now or the team's
you better knows them is I'm 20 they
like me can't be there in person today
last couple of years they've been help
me out wherever possible so you know
are you guys the community and different
we've been releasing throughout the past
seven months consisting features that
were arrested by the communities such as
we'd only storage or variable speeds or
in general techniques to download
channels and releasing version 1.1 of
the batch funny updater which is
affordable out allow you to update the
base easily just super simple addition
to the two-wire this is this bash
planning updater is in the whole vein of
the entire product which is make it so
easy even an FBI agent can use it so
funny getting all the payloads all you
have to do now is double click that's
that's twice
to the weekend this is really exciting
because mark and Henry come to us going
to hack five community as the Sun and I
just love the way that this is
organically grown and said thank you so
much that's right so my so it's okay so
that right there is some of the lineup
talking about the bass funny
my rubber ducky and the Wi-Fi pineapples
but what about the lantern let's start
with a lantern real real quick so as we
know the Lin turtle is a does actually
need to match what I'm looking at so as
you guys know the Lin turtle is an
incredibly stealthy remote access tool
kit it's fantastic at giving you remote
access into an organization and it's
quite simply disguised as a USB Ethernet
adapter which are so commonplace in this
day and age where most people's machines
don't have those standard rj45 ports
that we all know and love and because
it's a USB Ethernet adapter it is
literally the man in the middle when you
think about it you know you plug it into
the computer and it is the line the
wires in between that computer and the
rest of the network and the Internet
ultimately so it's because of that that
we've been able to you know see from a
really awesome perspective the things
that are transiting the wire from that
computer and which means that you can
see the documents that are flowing
through you can see all of the Internet
requests that are going through and it's
great that we can use it for remote
access but there's so much more that you
can do in terms of logging and
unfortunately up until now we haven't
had the ability to utilize it to its
full potential when you consider how
many documents tasks from within the
network unencrypted before they get that
firewall all of that internal
communication if only we have a way to
store all of those interesting packets
and all of those documents as sshfs just
is not enough which is why today I'm
really excited that we're going to be
introducing
the lantern unless d Mallette journalist
e is an upgrade from the lane turtle
you'll notice yes it does have a
beautiful pigtails that you plug in USB
but it's also the same lantern oh we
know and love it's got that same stealth
aspect to it except you plug in a big
fat micro SD card and you can accelerate
all the documents to that you can store
all the logs on that for later retrieval
and it just opens up a lot more
possibilities with how many tools and
data that we can store on that so I'm
really excited about the lame turtle SD
yeah but you guys know my penetration
testers here know Matt on any engagement
the the most important thing the most
pivotal thing that you can have on any
engagement is other than hacker typer
done net remote access ready you know if
you have access to the clients network
that's like that's day one right that's
that's where it all begins
and up until now sometimes the networks
that you're dropping these on may prove
through limitations be a restrictive
firewall and that doesn't want your
reverse shell to get out or an
individual detection system that then
notices your reverse shell and then
drops in that's never any fun so with
that we're really excited in addition to
the lien for SD today to also be
introducing the land turtle 3g yeah
we're the remote access tool that brings
its own network this is an absolute game
changer here I can tell you from
experience I was a system
traitor for 10 years and I would have
loved one of these yeah it's not even
just the restrictive firewall sometimes
like just the internet goes down and you
know as a pen tester one is not enough
that two is one like having the ability
to get that reverse shell out through a
network that you've brought in yourself
that they never see is so essential on
again it also means that you could
literally just like ship this to the
clients site and tell them like hey I'm
sending a USB Ethernet adapter just plug
it in it's all good yeah the 3G modem
you we're talking at like 90 GSM bands
so you're going to be able to get access
into this network no matter what and
it's it's not even just that what I
think about it in terms of you know on
these on some of these longer pentest
gives you really want to make an impact
of like what access you actually had
into their network and they never saw
you to boot because you brought your own
network well this means that when you're
exfiltrating all of that intellectual
property whether it's you know stealing
all that data from the clients site to
show them in the report like this is
what we were able to do that in addition
to exit rating all of those all of those
files you didn't waste the bandwidth I
mean that's just a common courtesy
so that's it right there
I'm very excited the land turtle 3G the
land turtle SD and these are available
now yeah now we have a lot of fun is
minute and the middle we have a lot of
favors Wi-Fi we also know that on any
engagement you know you go to those
client sites and you see it everywhere
as much fun as Wi-Fi is there is
Ethernet everywhere it's it's kind of
the name of the game and I can tell you
that I've tried it all networked apps
are not smart
networked apps are not small and they
are definitely not persistent you know I
even just something as simple as getting
a peak app I'm sure you have this
problem because I have been there on a
ladder with a laptop and to Nick's
hanging off some dumbbells with wires
going everywhere sitting in Wireshark
trying to remember some set of IP tables
commands just to get a peek app off of
some IP camera or something like that
but that is never gonna happen to you
anymore because today we are introducing
the packet squirrel right here this is a
stealthy pocket-sized
man in the middle it's an Ethernet
multi-tool and I'm going to show you a
little video about it right now
so the packets coral super tiny stealthy
man in the middle and we're making it
not just for pen testers but also sis
admins and the privacy conscious burp so
we actually built payloads into this
thing for the first time so right out of
the box you've got the ability to
capture packets to do man-in-the-middle
attacks and to get remote access so you
can even use it with a VPN system to
secure network traffic in addition to
remote access and you just plug it in
line and power it I'm doing a simple
scripting language as we have done and
as it has been successful and we're
doing a payload library like the bash
buggy where there's one central place to
get all of it and if you like arming
mode us estates writing and get root
access all the fixings this thing just
blends into the environment you'd never
notice it's there so that's really
exciting because we've never released a
device that out of the box has payloads
and I feel like it's kind of a game
changer because when you think about it
as as assistant min I love this tool
where I just need to get some packets
for analysis later from some box be it
you know a network printer or an IP
camera or some esoteric IOT thing and
now you've just got a tiny little device
that you can plug in line flip the
switch power it on it you plug in a USB
Drive and it just does it with a pcap
file that's it you never have to
interface with it at all but if you want
to go further and do man-in-the-middle
attacks for instance the dns spoofing
helo
that's right on here you just flip the
switch there's one single config file
and it's a really easy one on one side
it has the domain name that you want to
alter well the other side it's got the
IP address that you want to send it to
I'd like mine found out in a
demonstration with Shannon on hack five
year recently she came up with a domain
name snow sports rainbows calm it's
amazing fishing site ever so that's one
config file flipping a switch and
similarly the VPN feature couldn't be
easier because you know as we have all
started using things like Open VPN I
know you guys are using Open VPN but we
definitely do it's got easier and easier
over the years those scripts to set it
up in like five minutes
which means that you can secure your
traffic or you can get remote access
back into the packet squirrel which is a
beautiful vantage point to then pivot
through the network through that open
VPN connection and with one line of the
config change you can do the same thing
except instead of remote access you can
secure all of the traffic through it
which means you just copy your own VPN
profile over to the packet squirrel and
instantly everything that you plug into
it is going to go through that VPN
connection which is great because I line
up with a bunch of the VPN profiles and
give them out to family members during
the holidays literally you flip the
switch and it just does the thing and
speaking in as I begin to the hardware
the switch is now four-way which means
that you can carry three payloads in
addition to the dedicated army mode that
gets you shell access and it will run
any additional payload off of USB so you
can literally just put a text file on a
thumb drive plug it into the thing and
have it run that payload and it's not
just bash payload either we're now
supporting
Python and PHP you can even put binaries
on this so that's that's I'm really
excited about that and the scripting
language we're building on a lot of the
language of the bash funding so the
scripting language you know in addition
to working across bash and Python and
PHP means that you can easily interface
with the led the lessons that we've
learned from the bash Fundy having that
ability to know look you know what state
your payload is in we've also added a
button so that you can interface with
your payload you can add some
intelligence to it that says hey you
know you can have decisions and such and
then it's also just ridiculously small
in like 24 grams it's about the
footprint of a book of matches and the
power draw on this thing is about 0.12
amps Wow another thing for over a week
off of a higher capacity a USB battery
max yeah so on an engagement this is
something that you can easily just slip
it into the environment
right in and with all of the different
networking modes between NAT and
transparent bridge being able to capture
packets do man in the middle attacks and
maintain persistent remote access so I'm
really excited for that and I'm really
excited that now the packets world
rounds out the hack five gear lineup
that is the packets world in a nutshell
well we won't be available throughout
the night to answer questions everybody
that got a ticket for a voucher please
come up after this I grab yourself your
packet squirrel but at this time I want
to eat you to his chin because you know
hack life is more than just awesome gear
it's also a couple of podcasters you
should probably know more about Shannon
if you want to flip it around and just
hit that little button right there look
at that alright so if you aren't
familiar we have a couple of different
podcasts
no it's not gonna show me clintus that's
okay all right so if you're not familiar
you can go over to hak5 org and check
out all the different video shows that
we do first off I want to tell you a
little bit about threat wire which is
your source for everything security
privacy and Internet freedom it's all
the nukes that you can get that show
just hit our third goal on patreon so if
you aren't subscribed yet that's
patreon.com/lenguin
through crowdfunding up a trio so we
really appreciate it everybody that one
says over there
and our next goal is going to let us
upgrade the studio so we're super
excited about that we just added a video
RSS feed as well the next show is tech
thing and that shows the one that I do
with mr. Patrick Norton wherever he
might lead with here is no part of
America mommy where's mom brain back
there Martin's sorry there is trying to
get it at the door
so if you're curious about tech thing
that is the show for consumer technology
where we make all of your different
gadgets behave and we just hit 50,000
subscribers on YouTube that is a huge
goal for us or if you aren't
my next hole my personal goal is a
hundred thousand so we are on our way

take us long to get to 50k I don't think
it'll take long to get to 100k either
the next show you might be familiar with
is Menace wait a minute we're also very
excited that Moe bik's is going to be
back on with the next season of
Metasploit minutes that you can get your
word on we're so excited about that when
is he joining us pair number 11 November
11th right when I leave for Japan the
fix is coming up Darren's gonna work
with him on getting that new season out
we are so excited it's an awesome
educational informal very great show
about Metasploit so everything you want
to know about this boy you can get it
there at Metasploit mitten and last off
is hak5 our true oldie and that's the
one that started it all seriously we've
been doing that show since 2005 old
Aaron asked how old are you just kidding
so hacks Wyatt also just hit a goal on
YouTube we hit 350 thousand subscribers

s'mores for me by the way I'm going to
eat all of those anybody familiar with a
chubby bunny or whatever that some
delicious all right you ready to do that
thing with that we do it every every
episode of hack 5 I'm Shannon Morse
I'm Darren kitchen and we're reminding
you to I think we're done we're done
