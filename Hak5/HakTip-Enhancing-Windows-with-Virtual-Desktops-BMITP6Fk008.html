Netflix welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers Network gurus and
IT ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse
and today we're enhancing Windows with
virtual desktops but first off what are
virtual desktops they're a super easy
way to save some money and keep yourself
organized but what exactly are they
think of it this way each monitor that
you buy is basically another desktop
that you can place applications on for
example my dual screen PC at home I keep
Chrome on one monitor in my media
programs on another so if you only had
one monitor instead of the two you can
download a virtual desktop these
programs will increase your desktop
space so you can keep more than one
program maximized even though you don't
have multiple monitors Linux users have
had this ability for pretty much ever
but for Windows here are a few top picks
to help you organize and manage your
programs my first choice is Virtua win
from virtual window org this program is
available for Windows in a regular
download and my favorite a portable
version you can customize how many
desktops you want to have up to 20
different ones and enable hotkeys and
mouse controls left clicking on the
taskbar icon lets you switch to any of
your running applications or move them
to another desktop to switch to another
virtual desktop simply use your set
hotkeys my second option is decks po
from Dec spot de decks po is available
for Windows as well and has recently
been updated to use the windows 7
taskbar really efficiently decks po
works about the same but comes with core
plugins to make your use more productive
it even comes with a fancy 3d transition
if you really want it and it features
plenty of customizations in the settings
as well and my last option is windows
pager from windows pager sourceforge.net
this program runs on all versions of
Windows since 2000 and it integrates
into the taskbar you can right-click on
your programs and move them to a
specific desktop or you can drag them to
the icon on your taskbar switch to each
desktop by clicking
with your mouse and you can also copy
directly from one desktop to another by
dragging the text or the file and keep a
program viewable at all times by
right-clicking on it keyboard shortcuts
are also customizable so which one was
my favorite
I'll let you know right after the break

after much testing deliberation and
thought I decided my favorite would be
deck SPO with all the features and
plugins I Expo gives the user the most
customisation of all of them although
it's not portable which I'm very very
sad about the program doesn't take up
much room
and it's very super easy to use thank
