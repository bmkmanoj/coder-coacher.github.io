gets hit with a denial-of-service attack
the JPMorgan hackers have been arrested
and someone stopped the NSA from
collecting phone call data all that
coming up now on threat wire hello world
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for November 11 2015 thank you to
our veterans for your service threat
wire is your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom quite a bit has happened this
week starting with some ransomware for
linux ransomware is a type of malware
that is used for a hacker to hold data
hostage until a target pays up
oftentimes in bitcoins so that it's an
anonymous transaction a new strain of
ransomware found by dr. Webb and called
Linux dot encoder dot one will target
Linux websites and servers by holding
the data and files for said website or
server hostage until a ransom of
somewhere around one Bitcoin or at time
of recording 353 dollars is paid to the
hackers so that they will give the
target back their access unfortunately
like many other attacks on sites this is
done through vulnerable website plugins
and third-party software Linux encoder
one requires root access and encrypts
the home backup and system folders for a
server as well as important files an RSA
2048 key will store a es 128-bit keys
that he used to encrypt all the local
files in a private key pair is needed to
decrypt the files directions are sent to
the target as a readme text file now
once paid up the server's files are
decrypted and at time of writing
webmasters are reminded to backup all
pertinent data for their sites and
servers as there is not a fixed
protonmail is a switzerland-based
provider of end-to-end encrypted email
which just days ago fell prey to a
denial of service attack or a DDoS for
short the attack started November 3rd
and has since been restored the DDoS was
similar to many other attacks going on
in Switzerland however by the second
phase this was no longer the case they
discovered that this was done by two
different groups protonmail then
believed this to be done by
state-sponsored
attackers given the extremely
sophisticated capabilities and one group
called the Armada
Collective has been named as involved as
well now during their first discovery of
the ddos protonmail decided to pay out
15 bitcoins or nearly 6000 bucks
to the criminals to stop the attack
unfortunately paying the ransom
obviously didn't stop the DDoS and it
continued for six whole days by the
second group who also ended up taking
down many other companies as collateral
damage until it was finally mitigated
now protonmail is working with the swiss
government computer emergency response
team or gov sur cert for short and the
cybercrime coordination unit Switzerland
or Cyco for short on a criminal
investigation into the attack now since
implementing a long-term fix is really
expensive protonmail has started a
crowdsourcing campaign to raise funds
and the link is below in the show notes
JP Morgan Chase financial institution
was one of nine targets in a hack during
2014 all the way from 2012 to 2015 to be
exact and as of earlier this week the
hackers that may have been the culprits
have been charged with 23 counts in the
largest hacking case of financial
history currently reports are estimating
over 100 million customers have had
their data stolen for this hack and the
hackers made about a hundred million
bucks as well the three hackers arrested
include Gary Xiaolin zip Ornstein and
Joshua Samuel Aaron indicted on hacking
identity theft securities fraud money
laundering and so much more
according to hacker news a man named
Anthony Murr geo was also arrested in
relation to this hack as well
now brute force social engineering and
the heartbleed vulnerability were all
used in this attack no surprise there
lastly the NSA has been ordered to halt
their phone data collection by US
District Judge Richard Leon which
applies to Larry Clayman and activists
who brought a civil liberty case up
against the NSA for their collections
now while the NSA is set to hang
collections on November 29th anyway so
the halt isn't that surprising it is
important and it's significant this may
set a precedent for future cases about
privacy and government spying and hey a
little something called citizens rights
now last off I just want to say hey
thank you Thank You patrons for making
the show possible
share it with your friends or on your
favorite social network I want to see it
as show get two three times per week and
with your help we can make that actually
happen patreon.com slash the rat wire is
the place to support us and AUSA where
you can hit us up with pictures of your

necessarily have to have fur but they're
really really cute
I like the kitties those are some of my
faves I like the dogs too and yes I love
aminals and yes I said animals let's
work together to get threat wire up to
our next goal where we will release an
RSS feed and another episode every week
