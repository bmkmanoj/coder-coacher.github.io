needed upgrade but with that I also have
some concerns d haces get more costly
and more widespread and yahoo faces more
problems all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for October
4 2016 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom if you haven't checked out our
patreon please do so we have tons that
we want to do for the show but we can't
do it without your support patreon.com /
threat wire is the place to support
threat wire now on to the news first off
being emergency text yeah those text
alerts are those things that pop up on
everybody's phone at the office at the
same time freaking everyone out and
alerting you of severe weather Amber
Alerts for missing children and more and
they have needed an update for quite
some time since their implementation way
back in 2012 they've been limited to
English only no photos or media
attachments only 90 characters and they
target a whole county now as of sep
tember 29th the FCC has mandated some
updates to the wireless emergency alert
system so it can now support english in
spanish 360 characters for text embedded
phone numbers and URLs for photos and
much stricter Geographic targeting for
alerts so this means more targeted
emergency alerts could keep people from
getting annoyed at receiving too many
that don't correspond to their location
the FCC is also looking into updating
the WEA with thumbnail images and even
better geo-targeting to get the word out
to the people that need it immediately
and enable people to see an image of for
example an abducted child as opposed to
having to go search for it on the
internet but although I am one of the
many people who find these incredibly
important and I keep them on on my own
phone I'm also a bit concerned embedding
media in text messages as an mms for
example has already been used to hack an
android phone in the stage fright attack
would WEA be implementing the same kind
of media message could this new data
also created new means for an attacker
to spoof a WEA text and infect a phone
it's something that we should look into
as alerts are push two phones
then approved first last week Krebs on
security posted an article detailing the
D das that hit their site and the
possibility that it stemmed from
infected IOT devices Internet of Things
devices such as connected fridges and
doorbells security cameras and a lot
more are easily hackable because they
allow for more convenience for consumers
over security which we hear time and
time again many come with hard coded
passwords or default passwords that just
never get changed or they use
unencrypted means to transfer data to
the user but it also means IOT devices
are a huge target for botnet owners to
infect and use to take down sites
servers and more on Friday of last week
a user by the name Ana senpai posted on
the hack forums the source code to one
of the biggest botnet run malware called
me I which gets installed on these
vulnerable devices and then turns them
into BOTS to do pretty much whatever the
botnet owner wants usually adidas me and
I is the malware that is used to create
a botnet hitting both Krebs on security
with over 620 gigabits per second of
data as well as French webhost OVH with
over one terabit of data per second
which is absolutely insane that's a
whole lot of data the source code being
posted means we very well might CD das
has become more common and more popular
amongst attackers so how do you protect
your own IOT devices first swear off any
devices that don't use encryption or
don't allow you to change your username
or your password and to be honest if
they don't tell you what security they
use they probably don't use any at all
which is horrible change the password on
your connected devices and reboot them
according to Krebs on security quote
infected systems can be cleaned up by
simply rebooting them the swiping the
malicious code from memory only changing
the default password protects them from
rapidly being reinfected on reboot 6.4
billion things are in use worldwide this
year with 5.5 million new things being
connected every single day so we as
consumers need to make sure that we are
making sound buying decisions not
blindly becoming a part of a botnet oh
yeah and manufacturers don't get me
started with you a bit of mystery
surrounds the yahoo breached this week
as info armor cio
and rude Kamarov stated the breach may
have been by a cybercrime outfit not so
much a state-sponsored attack info armor
cells they're investigated services and
protection to other businesses and
comoros information came from another
contact not necessarily proving it was a
cybercrime outfit not a state-sponsored
hack the FBI is still investigating the
breach but no confirmed theories have
been announced now what this also comes
news that even though yahoo suggested
that users change their passwords ASAP
if user was using an iOS device that
device would still have access to the
account which means that if a hacker had
approved yahoo mail on their own iOS
device they would still have access as
well so this is due to a permanent
credential association that yahoo mail
would give to the iOS device allowing it
to continually update and give access
even after a password has changed
elsewhere so how do you fix it in your
yahoo account on an actual web page not
the iOS app go to your recent activity
tab and you will see exactly what
devices are being used to access your
account and then you can remove
whichever one should not be there thanks
