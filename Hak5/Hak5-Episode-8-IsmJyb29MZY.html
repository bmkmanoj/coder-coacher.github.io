you're watching hack point five
some cool stuff ahead so sit back now
you've got two monsters following you
Alex you start reading his email Irena
salutes key for geek entertainment
there's some that have 700 the most
ideal but he does yupp TV anything good
on dude everything's good our men and if
I thought I'd see the day 300 channels
it's all good 300 channels of white
Odile TV command an open alpha
diggnation holy crap yeah this is
amazing dude you're dreaming no dude
it's amazing no you're dreaming huh
you're dreaming d you're dreaming d mmm
d dreamin what your dream what you're
dreaming I'm awake you were dreaming
your you were like some random babbling
about a light diggnation and command and
being on TV oh I was thinking about that
segment with those applications oh
that's right yeah are we still shooting
yeah yeah yeah alright let's get on set
now yeah yeah go clean yourself up
Spanky ok so the opening to this whole
sequence you know this whole segment
completely fictitious complete
dramatization it's a nice thought it is
300 channels but no there's nothing good
release on TV young terrestrial TV yeah
but it's actually not far off no I mean
you think if you've got a media center
pc or if you've got some way to get your
content from your pc over to TV and
you've got a couple of applications that
will help you subscribe to video online
or channels online you know who needs
cable at that point now really if you
can pipe all your video you know back
out to a TV or something right so
there's three applications that i want
to take a look at that will allow you to
easily subscribe to video content online
first of course being iTunes we're all
familiar with itunes probably it's got a
podcast directory which also does video
it's not really the best in terms of
video podcast because it just kind of
has like a featured video podcast list
there's only about five pages i don't
know maybe about a hundred right um
definitely not everything there are a
lot more video content in
itunes podcast directory but you really
have to go hunting for it so it's not
really got a bit of shovel around for
podcasts it's great love it yeah but it
doesn't handle the video as well as a
really shut because you had to kind of
make the video work i think is right you
know well what's nice about it though is
it's rock solid it will accept external
links so if there's an online TV show
that you like to watch that's not in the
iTunes directory you can always just add
it in yourself and it will automatically
download those that's all it'll also
sync with your video with ipod by your
with ipod video with ipod ipod with
video that's the one I always try to
call a video iPod but it's alright
that's the ipod 43 yes so waiting for
the 16 by nine but anyway um downsides
of course it only handles direct
downloads HTTP right that we don't we
don't like that that much it's nice that
we can track the numbers but at the same
time it kills those in bandwidth yeah
well now libsyn is kind of that's
helping out a lot um the other downside
is it doesn't have a nice way to manage
all of those downloads they largely
loaded Ian hard drives going to fill up
yeah it's a couple other players i'm
going to say now there's some
alternatives there are some alternatives
first being fire ant it's in release
candidate one stage right now so you can
kind of call it a beta if you want it's
really nice it's got an integrated
channel guide which is really cool
that's one of the main features that i
like just to clarify things channels or
RSS feeds channels or RSS feeds and then
just basically video podcasts yeah IPTV
vid guess what and intuitively they have
been subdivided into categories tags
it's really nice the way they do it you
can take a look at channels by top rated
you know the most watched you can check
out what's you know what's new channels
it's got an automated system for popular
tags as you can see it's like your basic
tag cloud where you know the more
popular the bigger the fall yeah
boldface font hot you know and i really
like the way that it's got this ability
to stream video so if you find some
example it yeah if you find a video
kapag cast you like take a look what
looks interesting to you you're like hmm
sample it oh this is really cool and
then
drive to the RSS feed and it'll do the
automatic downloading it's got a
built-in player it automatically deletes
stuff after a certain amount of days
awesome it's not rock solid yet but it's
it's doing okay and I think it's going
to you know progress from here this one
is for both PC and actually all of these
that we're going to talk about or for
both windows and let's not call PC
because Windows and Windows and Mac
right yet this one also has a really
cool feature where a little sink with
portable devices such as your what did I
call it you called video with ipod video
with ipod video with ipod x4 microsoft
it'll also it allows to sync with the
PSP which is really cool guy and if the
if the video format is not in PSP
friendly format it will encode for you
yeah using ffmpeg it's not a hundred
percent yet but it does a good job and
worse yeah I mean there's also other
good encoders if you want to do it
manually there's video or has a nice set
of tools that allow you to we actually
use that yeah we use the video i put is
the video or a video or use video or
ipod converter yeah yeah and they've
also got a PSP converter really nice
nice now one of the things i noticed
about this is the very very nice web
interface in fact you can get to it from
the website you don't actually need the
client ok well that's really nice enough
you're on a lot of remote computers but
i'm saying you know when you're actually
running your own relational client but
the idea is to set these up let him own
background to subscribe to channels and
pull them down so you don't have to
think about it right so let's move on to
the other player which is from the
participatory culture foundation i said
that right yeah that's the same people
that brought us blog torrent broadcast
machine and more recently video bomb
which is kind of like a dig for vegas
I've seen it before this was originally
called DTV but they renamed it when it
came out for the for windows just
recently and democracy it's in point
eight right now which kind of shows
little blood or more buggy than fire in
it's a little bit more buggy at this
point but it's also open source no that
means that means it's going to be the
first to also go to unix linux bsd
toasters toast or whatever microwaves if
it runs linux yeah i think our
refrigerator runs linux sure why not
buddy that's a good mod but it's not
you'd say that yet and I
it's not even so it this has got a
really nifty channel guide that looks
very similar to the one in itunes to say
this is very I i tuned reminiscent right
it doesn't have an automated tags kind
of a well it doesn't have the tag cloud
but it does have the popular tags here
we can head over to technology see that
there's 16 technology podcasts in here
or video podcast I'm not sure what a
goal you know and you can check out a
site or you know if you see something
you like you can click this it'll
subscribe to it it's also got a really
nifty player where it will go fullscreen
no matter what you know about it the
codec or volume is exactly well that's
nice that's a really really nice gotcha
um and it doesn't doesn't sync with any
player or portable players yet yeah but
if it's also open source stuff yeah so
maybe later they've paid somebody else
you know my program the program that in
but there's a you know if you have a
portable player anyway you you can do
that ma'am well if you really really
want yeah and I mean that's what I do is
I just well the cool thing about both of
these is that they have a channel guide
which will expose you to a lot of
content like I didn't even know there
were 300 different vid casts out there
so I mean a lot of them are V logs or
vlogs video blogs yeah whatever yeah and
those are cool and I suggest you check
out either of these because it's got an
extensive directory or you could just do
what I do and that is go to a bunch of
favorited tabs bookmarks and downloading
yourself and the hard drive fills up and
you got to manually delete them Manuel
Manuel menuhin and the advantage to
these client type programs like I like
to use a mail client and this is to me
is like having a mail client does the
work for you yeah it does all the work
for you and plus you can subscribe to
the RSS feeds so that you know you're
always checking out the same side over
and over wait for an update yeah just
like okay where's it coming saying I
like some some shows that you know only
release once a month that tend to you
know maybe release some bonus material
through service Lee you might want to
consider subscribing to our RSS feed
because hey we release on the 5th but
every now and then
is extra content point 5 episode special
specials for your holiday just like that
yeah so you know that to me this is the
way to go so check them out you know mol
them over if you like them use them if
you don't add let us know about your
experiences with both fire ant and
democracy player give us some feedback
you know just tell us what you think
yeah so other than that thanks a lot and
enjoy the rest of the show action d
you're dreaming what today we just got
back from Toronto dude that was the
coolest trip i went up to Toronto to do
a couple episodes of call for help it
was a ten-hour Drive 700 miles 1126
kilometers for the rest of the world I
would have been going on the mud well I
thought it was going to be but I brought
my favorite site on the internet with me
my ipod saved my life and so did matt
from Winona University hooked me up with
a program that allowed me to time shift
Pandora whoa okay let everybody know
what pandora is because it's like the
coolest thing pandora is a site where
you can go listen to music as a radio
station here's the coolest part about it
you can customize this radio station
institute specifically for you pandora
has a group of people who strictly
listen to songs to you tag them for
certain you know vocal harmonics mellow
mellow guitarist well if you try it if
you like a band or you like a song by a
band you can type in the name of the
song or the band itself you like their
whole stuff and it will search out
through all the music library and grab
all the little tags that match and show
you stuff that you might like you may
not like if you feel like what they play
then you can give it a thumbs down and
they won't play anything like that
anymore but if you give it a thumbs up
to play more stuff like it's great at
learning I gave it let's see the shins
and the killer is any suggested a
milking heap which led me to
fischerspooner and then you hooked me up
with Jem and I think it's a great
service I actually pay for the three
dollars a month for the account so i
don't get the ads on the screen and it's
really an amazing service I love it I
can't live without at first heard about
it on inside the net and I've been using
it ever since when you told me about it
I i went to it and with
in an hour I was in love I listen to
when i'm photoshopping now i'm addicted
yeah well I listen to it at work but now
I can listen to it in the car because in
time shifting it okay so isn't that kind
of not against their terms of service
yeah well here's what I figure yes it is
against their terms of service I guess
right but what I'm doing is I'm paying
pinned or the three dollars a month okay
I'm time shifting the song so that I can
listen to them in the car okay and then
if I like what I hear I'll go and buy
the artist you know i'll hit up the
itunes music store and you know so I'm
supporting the artist from supporting
Pandora if I don't like the tracks i'm
just gonna bleed it so I don't feel like
I'm so sorry you're selling it it's for
just kind of personal use I'm a personal
use strictly for you but yeah it is
against their terms of service so don't
sue us it was Matt from winona
University he started the program so his
fault not his haha let's take a look at
it so basically when you run pandora i'm
going to go ahead and play a song here
and turn this down just a bit what it's
doing is it will save this file in a
temp folder so here we can see it's
access to and if you rename that to die
mp3 that'll work that's an mp3 file but
it doesn't have a 93 tag and it doesn't
have a file name photoshop is like track
1 yeah it's nothing a rate of name yeah
it's not going to be very odd pod
friendly at all so what we've got here
is this this java applet and i'm going
to go ahead and run pandora now it's bat
file start and then period for this
directory and what that's going to do is
use this program to scrape the artist
name and the title of the track from the
title bar in Firefox and create the id3
tags and the file name for it so it's
copying access one and if i head over
here to my pandora folder you can see
there's my mp3 file if I open that up
there it is and a wimp and it's got the
correct id3 tag and it's playing and
it's exactly what I want and I can leave
this Java program running all night and
then in the morning sync it up to my
ipod bro in a playlist listen to it on
the way home from so you're good for a
10 hour drive I'm good for a 10 hour
drive
and I'm writing down stuff that I like
so I want to get home i can download
online i keep a notebook by my computer
for the same reason so i suggest
everybody head over to our website check
it out and thank you matthew from Winona
University for the awesome hookup thanks
not okay we're gonna take a little break
from our you know regular segments and
it's time to take questions of course
first question being I wish to leave my
desktop machine running at home 24 7 is
this safe and can you make any
recommendations or precautions and
modifications that it should make that's
from Andrew in Winchester UK I wouldn't
necessarily say it's harmful to your
computer your Abba your button hours on
your hard drive spinning yeah but you
can also tell windows or whatever
operating system you have to
automatically spin down the drives the
other thing the power sit yeah you know
my biggest concern is you know is your
PC on the floor and if so it's going to
start collecting a lot more dust mmm
that's a thing to watch out for just
make sure that you're keeping your fans
clean yeah a quick modification for that
is the the air filter rod which is where
you can take some like pantyhose and
stretch them over the end of your fans
and screw them in that way yeah so it
makes cleaning your fans a lot easier
and just less dust gets in your case
ahead of time and good tip but make sure
you clean them because will happen is
they will clog and you will start to
overheat yeah I say though once you've
got a PC running 24 7 in the house it
opens up the possibilities you know to
doing things like running around web
server or all sorts of other fun stuff
that we talk about all the time on the
show we always assume that you've got a
PC in your house that's running 24 7 so
yeah we I mean I do it all the time
having any problems with it in last I
don't know eight years yeah my box stays
on almost all the time the only problem
is it when you have programs with memory
leaks and crap like that yeah I'm not
going to name names but restart every
couple of days yeah okay so would it be
possible to start a playlist playing a
very low volume and then gradually
increase the volume over the course of
say twenty minutes I think this might
prove as a much much gentler way to wake
up and haven't figured out how to do it
near the linux or windows it's by Josh
uh yeah you can there's a cool utility
called nir CMD newark man you can google
that
we're finding in our show notes and
basically that will allow you to do a
lot of cool command-line things to
Windows such as up the volume so you can
write a batch script that will gradually
up the volume by one percent over the
course of however many minutes or you
can cheat do it like I used to do and
take the song you want to wake up to
into audacity or whatever your audio
editor yeah Sam audio editing program is
drop it in and then just ramp the volume
works for me it's it's a cheap bits of
cheap fix right Jeff rights what is the
name of the opening song at the
beginning of your show that isn't one by
ghost writer I already have that one
that is the Act point five theme song
and that's by Ashley wit and sure we'll
throw it up on the website once we get
all the other stuff fixed kind of having
some problems with one of our it's been
dating kidnap yeah one of our servers is
having some issues but we'll take care
of that and we'll go ahead and put the
we should put the theme song and some
wallpapers and get NASA for those along
we need we need to put up the goodies
page yeah we've got a whole bunch of
there's a goodies page in the works with
wallpapers and banner buttons and audio
clips and all sorts of fun stuff so
we'll go ahead and throw that out there
for you just keep an eye on hak5 org
okay the next one is I can't afford an
ipod but i have a lexar one gigabyte USB
key and elects our mp3 player that it
goes into do you know of any programs to
download podcasts and videos like my
favorite show hack point five org point
five dot org I do sure 10 whatever you
know what I mean overnight so that every
morning I can just grab my USB key get
my fill of podcast and watch vid guess
it's cool on the computers Fred computer
engineering student at st. Lawrence
College Canada yay Canada awesome um
fire and fire ants awesome yrz what to
do is you just set it so that your
whatever the drive letter is of that USB
thumb drive of the destination folder of
your downloads so it'll download those
and then when you wake up grab the drive
and you should be all set to go just
don't forget to plug in your job before
you you know go to bed yeah so check out
fire ant good stuff is there a Windows
hotkey that will minimize the currently
selected window or
possibly a registry hack to make Windows
key em do it it seems like Windows key
em and Windows key d do the same exact
function kind of its they're very very
similar windows key d toggles between
your desktop and what you've currently
got active your windows and stuff
whereas when does p.m. we'll just
minimize all this so if you get Windows
key d twice you're going to go to your
desktop and then back to your location
yeah which is a really good way to hide
things you don't want people to see no I
won't do now if you say so I won't boo
in done yeah but removing old boss key
and like all those games back in the day
you'll be playing like you know all
those dos games you press the f1 and it
would like go to like an Excel like
Excel like a busy calc spreadsheet or a
das prompt to make it look like you're
working i think it was in Wolfenstein
might have been commander keen I'm not
really sure and then you hit it again
and yeah you're back to the game yeah
all that for you oh definitely um sure
real easy I'll hold down alt in space
and then let go and then press n that
will minimize multum will move it will
boot altos s resize a public space c
close o space X maximize alt space or
restore but by the fun stuff old space
it's good oh dude once you start using
Alta paste shortcuts and an alt tab and
windows key r you you know it don't even
touch the mouse anymore really and that
makes you look like a real ly D make me
when you're around non-users yeah
totally I'll users edited users so
that's it for this batch of questions
this episode if you have any questions
you know you can always send them to us
we'll take them on air questions at hak5
org and on with the show
okay so Wes has got some mod or hack or
something I'm not really sure because he
comes up with crazy stuff when he comes
home from work and half the time I don't
know if it's going to blow us up or make
our lives easier or somebody bringing a
piece of hardware home that makes
certain computers evil you know let's
not get into that it's not my fault yes
it is another time anyway what is it
what's all this okay I got a few
questions to ask you mmm do you watch
IPTV dude I make IPTV yeah i watch IPTV
command and open alpha WASD dl TV etc
etc so by that logic you have a computer
yeah uh-huh so you wat where do you
watch your IV TV on my computer that way
you'd already figured out that you have
yes okay where are you going with this
man all right do you watch it on TV well
I'm budtv no no I just did a segment on
this remember one um we're talking about
democracy and fire ant and yeah yeah so
you don't watch it on TV no well I mean
if there's a good episode or something
maybe I'll put it on the TV so we can
lounge we've got a media center oh so
yeah we have a media center just copy it
over the network fired up in VLC good to
go how many people have a media center I
know not everybody i'm sure not
everybody watching as a media center
kick us an email if you do pitchers are
cool I always love to geek out and see
that kind of stuff well that's that's
beside but no not everybody can have a
media center I'm why not well one
expensive mm-hmm to you know not
everybody has the second pc laying
around you know they're not the easiest
things to set up and then there's always
the wife factor or girlfriend factor
yeah big ugly doesn't fit the decor
anyway anyway but it would be nice maybe
nice of everybody had immunity is
sending then we could just kick the
cable to the curb and but I'm not
worried about media said it'd just be
nice to watch ipg be on TV yeah
definitely you can do it well i know
i've got a media center without it okay
what I'm oh yeah you're right you're
right got a TV in the living room mm-hmm
got a PC in my room mm-hmm I've got a
lot of color a lot of um composite cable
mm-hmm but signals going to degrade
haha there's a wire that doesn't degrade
over distance my composite ok what guys
ok I've got all in wonder card that
accepts coax in out so so genius it's
not gonna work do you play Nintendo you
have played Nintendo played the hell out
its min Tendo dude are you go the
emulators how'd you hook it up the old
agenda yeah little boxy thing the little
boy screws into the coax on your TV and
then I your cable Ryan runs into that
and that wire goes into little boxy
thing where you play the games and
you're all like contra exactly pop down
down you know what that little gray boxy
thing was the little gray boxy yeah it's
uh or if modulator yeah what you do
modulate sarup core Thank You captain
obvious never one being obvious no
you're missing the point here so you
take a coax and run it into this RF
modulator right but it's also got
another wire that attaches to it and
then it's got one coax it comes out of
the back of the RF modulator and into
the TV ok so i run a coax cable from my
room to the TV and then put an RF
modulator on the end of it i mean i set
up a home theater once where lady didn't
have a you know the new TV it didn't
have composite in or s-video and so had
to use an f video or I'm sorry compiler
modulator or at modulator from the DVD
player to the RF modulator to the TV to
play the dvds too many acronyms ok so
yeah we know that that works mmm but I'm
not running the cable one you did no I
didn't you did when I set this guy I
didn't build this house dude so I didn't
run cable everywhere that I wanted to ok
nice you didn't huh you already have
cable everywhere numbnuts alright yeah
ok Oh is there a cable jack in your yeah
yeah yeah there's a cable jack in every
room you can plug it you could plug the
RF modulator too you're going to love
this we should do a segment on it RF
modulator in the in the room where the
cable distribution box is run it to the
in line oh oh let's get b-roll of this
there you'd get a good chance see do you
see that right there yes thank you Eric
dude look yeah ok so that's why there
are cables going everywhere
uh-huh so you made my life easier mm-hmm
because it this does exactly what we
just said great what we did was so
channel 3 on every TV in the house is
now my computer is this a TV in the
house stay sitting in front of us yeah
it's a TV in the house it's a TV and
it's in the house well what do you know
and look well that's a computer all
sorry for the scanlines Hey look they're
actually not bad okay so i'm assuming RF
remote control control the pc from any
room in the house that's kind of clergy
you know what has of a budget i would
come up with a better solution are you
gonna try and one up okay i'm gonna warn
up okay captain obvious with some Apache
eat now not some web servers and some
PHP well you know what that's gonna be a
wireless it's gonna be awesome awesome
sex cell phone dude it'll be this killer
segment they should tune in next month
next month yeah so you've seen pretty
much how this works and like we said you
know just a quick recap you go into your
cable box that you know where the
provider first pipes into your domicile
mm-hmm their cable line plugs into the
RF modulator antenna in mm-hmm and you
also run your RCA or your composite from
your computer to the RF modulator hmm
now from the to TV now plugs into your
cable distribution box and it goes every
channel exactly awesome now TV is almost
worth watching now you just need a
program like democracy or iTunes or or
we went over this yeah good stuff good
stuff awesome so we hope we will tune in
next month to check out the software end
of that and then hopefully we don't
start watching hak5 on heat no no any
questions email us yes email him and
right show notes next time cuz I need to
know what's going on before you pop me
in a segment want me to pop you
watch also joining us here today is
Chris monton from math club productions
and he's here to talk to us a little bit
about his online hacker drama lee chris
thanks so much for being here first of
all what is math club productions math
club productions is a home-brewed vid
casting production company that is kind
of provide entertainment through the
internets the internets the web's and
what we try we're trying to really
provide is a way of showing people that
they don't have to go for content just
from the regular broadcasting you know
your TV your TiVo you can get the stuff
out on the internet download it and
watch it at your leisure most of the
time math club productions came from
actually a social group that we have a
long time ago we were brought together
it's a group of friends the producer and
I and we used to go to a bar and for
some reason we got labeled as the math
club or the geek squad or the spectacle
squad not me i don't have blasted but
the other four did i was the bouncer of
the group i guess and they started
calling us the math club and we started
calling ourselves math club and next
thing though we have 40 or 50 people in
our social group that started showing up
you know we go see movies together we
hang out and we started networking not
only socially a business wise you know
someone who's in real estate would sell
a house to somebody in our group or find
someone we were really arguing over what
our name of our film was going to be an
or a production company and after
struggling with about seven names that
were already copyrighted or like you
know we already use half the people in
math club the social group why not call
it math club productions so exactly what
is lete lete is a hacker term or online
term for being elite or a hacker acts
for whatever you want to say and we came
about that name because one of the
things we were trying to do is while it
doesn't have found totally our shows a
dramatic show we wanted to be able to
tell people basically what the show was
going to kind of be about which is about
for hackers coming together they think
for hacking for good you know throughout
the season things kind of change and
take a downward spiral from there
so weird the idea for an online hacker
drama come from you know the producer
now John we're sitting around we're
talking about podcast at that point and
this was back in August June and August
of last year and then one day the
bombings over an England happened and I
was just you know I woke up one that day
we had a meeting about doing a podcast
and I was just kind of like you know
wouldn't have been great if hackers
could have hacked his cell phones and
stop that whole thing and John was like
man we need to do something like that
and then I said you know I got an idea
we just started rolling with it next
thing he did is I'm very a DD so he's I
start writing this down Chris because
that's why I have him around he makes me
write things down makes me write things
down I say right now makes me things
right down so i started doing we've got
the whole thing is written down within
like two hours so that's where it came
from so why take all this money in time
to do this production i just think this
is really the direction that that you
know this type of entertainment is going
and it's important to show people that
in the end you can do whatever you want
to set your mind to we hope to you know
kind of foster a sense that if you have
an idea with some production value and a
little bit of money you can do something
on your own and you know I just that's
one of the reasons why i think we draw
people into our production as because
everybody sees us doing things instead
of just talking about doing something so
it's been the biggest challenge to elite
coordinating everybody I mean you know
you just don't know how big of a task is
to edit and try to control everybody and
get people there on time and also get
the scenes you know you think a scene
that would just kind of come out being
30 seconds takes four hours to shoot and
people just don't see that and I think
that's one of the biggest thing is
managing time and being able to do this
when most of us have second and third
jobs what would you say to any aspiring
filmmakers that really want to get into
like online broadcasting i would say
instead of saying that you need to like
find a company to work with or anything
like that i'd say look for people that
you can network with find someone who
has a camera find someone who does sound
to tell them about your production and
you'll find people I mean
it's really how we've worked you know I
think we found our camera we did find
our camera and editor because we're just
talking about one day and he was I'd
love to do a project like that and then
the sum of our actors came on that way
and our latest director came out and you
know wow you guys are doing so I want to
be part of something that's being done
instead of talked about so where would
you like to see Lee in about a year from
now we already have three seasons
roughly outlined we'd like to have
beyond second our second season and we'd
like to start becoming a kind of a
mobile production company such as it
just instead of being stuck in Richmond
become more mobile with our production
and moving around and getting more you
know exotic locations like Washington DC
or something i knows where do you see
guy PTV going in the next one to three
years um it's incredible two or three
years ago I started seeing this trend of
you know alternative broadcast
alternatives to broadcasting and as far
as this trend goes I you know I hope it
does take over broadcasting because this
is so much more directed towards
somebody who's looking for specific
content and it for me it allows me to
find what I want watch it what I want
and really if i don't like it i just
don't watch it again you know or i'm not
its leave to my tivo or my TV of when
it's coming on the IPTV i think is going
to split and hopefully will grow into
what more than what they're talking
about now I know many companies are
talking about it as a backbone for a new
way of developing and distributing but I
think if you also incorporate these
types of homebrew you know shows in tues
IPTV you could open up a whole new
floodgate of technologies and ways of
distributing to entertainment and how
can our viewers find out more about math
club productions and about lead we are
on the WWF club I NC com is our main
webpage you can also go into itunes
where you can learn search through 1337
and you'll find our production company
off of there and then we're also on pod
lounge out of australia
fire ant is another one that we're
listed on so Chris thanks so much for
joining us and I suggest everybody head
over to math club productions and check
out Lee it's a really awesome online
hacker drama vidcast that I think you
will all enjoy

bullshit that you've dealt with can be
forgotten
