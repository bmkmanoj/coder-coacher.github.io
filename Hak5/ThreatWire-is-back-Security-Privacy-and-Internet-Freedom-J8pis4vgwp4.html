Shannon Morse from hack five and tech
thing and I'm Patrick Norton from tech
thing and in 2012 we had an awesome
opportunity to launch the right wire a
weekly dose of news all about security
privacy and what is threatening the
freedom of our internet and a couple of
months after that a guy named Edward
Snowden showed the whole world that the
NSA was acting on secret core orders
collecting call records from nearly
every telephone company in America and
building tools that can sniff out nearly
everything a user does on the internet
suddenly people stop looking at us like
we're crazy tinfoil hat where's I'm
started with asking the important
questions about how do we protect
ourselves online and it's not just giant
three that are government agencies if
you're getting phishing emails trying to
steal your Bank info or had to get a new
credit card because of security breaches
at the likes of Target or Home Depot yo
are you president rallying about the
evils of foreign hackers chances are
you've got questions we were excited to
bring this information to the public in
a way that was really easy to consume
but in 2013 after 50 shows threat wire
had to end and since then we've been on
hiatus and we've been offered
advertising and sponsorship
opportunities but we've passed them all
because we want to keep this going and
keep it completely independent no ads no
networks suddenly services like patreon
made it easy for viewers like you
support shows like this directly we
think it's time to bring that wire back
the threats to our freedom the
violations of our privacy and our
security
those didn't stop in 2013 and neither
will we you can make this happen by
being a part of the show by becoming a
patron over at patreon.com slash threat
wire because this isn't just a show and
it's not just an amazing community this
is a movement and we want to know are
you ready
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
