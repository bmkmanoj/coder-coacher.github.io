by jack threads Oh
hey stop stop get away from the gh2 and
what I know h1 good it's close enough I
know looking bothers you but you can
just use the audio from another camera
yeah it'll be okay all right it's time
to check port 25
which means emails moose asks which
segment on which episode in which season
did Darrin explain how to build this
lovely picture frame computer case by
case mod yeah I had a little bit of
trouble actually finding those episodes
because I don't think somebody actually
broke their segment show notes on the
episode Darrin so the episode is 903 and
904 19-4 is where he went back and did
all the cable management for the photo
frame came on I love zip ties yeah me
too oh my god use him everywhere at home
next all right then Alfred wants to know
actually he's saying that he just got
through season 10 episode 13 and heard
some gamers share his definition of the
Asch SlideShare Paulsen it's the October
4th
yeah he says that um in Swedish it's
actually called broad garb and in
English it means lumberyard brodgar and
he wishes you a happy new year is it is
it like Swedish New Year no well I think
it's I think it's New Year for everybody
except for China yes it does so I also
like the idea of Swedish New Year though
why you killed that sounds awesome
I had everywhere with me sauces beer
yeah saunas and Brad guards ragnarök
yes all right I'll go with the next one
this is from anonymous he was wondering
if it is possible to set up tour at the
router level this would provide many
benefits for me I'm gonna take a guess
and assume that the reason he wants to
do this is that he has lots of devices
on a wireless network like an Android
town yeah that's what I was thinking too
or something and just wants to die is
this everything right you don't yeah
get necessary installed porn a Roku
right um maybe you could monkey go wrong
what the man
solution I think this is for him to
actually set up a poor proxy server and
just send everything through that and
then ow ah I'll be easier yeah I think
you're right we should do it segment on
that awesome unless unless untangle or
pfSense has like a module that you can
install but I don't all right now here's
a handy tip from Phoenix and Thor they
said love the show and episode 1018
towards the end of the show Corp app had
a problem with the caps lock key
Darren's tip for disabling caps lock is
good but what about using X Mon map to
swap the caps lock key with the escape
key and here is how you do it make a
file called dot X Mon map in your home
directory that contains the following
remove lock equals caps lock key sim
caps lock equals Escape key sim Escape
equals caps lock and then add lock
equals caps lock there you go configure
your desktop environment or your window
manager to run the following command
when you login X Mon Matt space dot X
Mon map this actually isn't a new trick
but I'm setting it anyway because it's
so useful especially for vim users in my
opinion this should be the default for
all setups oh and by the way Shannon for
Jolicloud try hitting on f1 to open up a
terminal as mentioned here and he did
send me a link to the Jolicloud website
forums but Jolicloud is for people who
mainly use like Web Apps it is I
reviewed it a couple of weeks ago and I
was trying to get into the terminal
because I was having issues getting onto
the Internet's wirelessly on I can
understand that
brought to you by two interfaces that
really matter anymore yeah it's a web
browser in a terminal but it's very
doable he's somebody who dislikes caps
lock and he's doing everything in the
cloud maybe he should get like one of
those heads and builds for like Chrome
OS and it's no that on his laptop that
way he can really stick it to the caps
lock man so that's a good idea I did
want to mention though I did try the alt
f1 before we did the segment it didn't
work for me so I must have done
something wrong but I also got an email
saying that all f2 and also pull up the
terminal in the Julia operating system
so if you guys have Jolie OS downloaded
both try alt f1 and f2 and see which one
works for you guys get out of the
morning
I actually uninstalled jelly so maybe I
should install it again and try them
both out
alright guys stay tuned because we'll be
