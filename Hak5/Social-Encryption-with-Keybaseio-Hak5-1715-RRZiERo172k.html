by domain.com whole walk the hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen i'm shannon
worried it's your weekly dose of Technol
us and hey to everybody in the united
states and people that are overseas that
are celebrating Happy Thanksgiving
that's nothing to do with turkeys no no
wait wait turkeys turkeys mmm turkeys
gobble gobble
so speaking of Thanksgiving there's also
this thing called Black Friday in Cyber
Monday don't pay the cyber monday which
I'm super excited about but if you guys
are looking for really cool hacker here
we have some stuff in the hack shop oh
and fresh cool sales on our hack 5 swag
so keep that in mind when you want to go
shopping and support us that's what
keeps active going so thank you
everybody who hits put your dollars
behind keeping this guy on the air we
truly appreciate it we are so blessed to
be on the air and to be all fun and cool
in here I agree we are speaking of shows
that are on air or maybe aren't tekzilla
was cancelled and I was doing tekzilla
for the past year it was very sad but we
we pop some champagne and we had a good
time on the last episode like some for
my homies I know right yeah Patrick
Norton man he's he's a great co-host not
as good as you I promise not anyway yeah
that seems it seems like the end of an
era or something it was like but you
know don't
to quote my my co-host over there he
said shows come and go sometimes they
survive and sometimes they don't and
networks might change
so if networks want to change it up a
little bit and do you know whatever they
feel like doing shows get cancelled so
I'm doing other stuff
well they didn't euthanize Patrick and
that's what's most important and you're
still here I'm still here yes and you
can always find hak5 at H aka the number
500 are G always will be there always
no matter what let's see what else is
important going on I think oh no oh no I
think it was somebody's birthday oh my
god are there really pineapples in here
yeah there's some this looks delicious
it's a it's a pineapple cake yeah SMA
instead of RP SMA solo okay really good
reception yeah and some of the 60 bi but
we're using my mouse so we've got you
know four by four days it's gonna be
good it's gonna be really good I'm just
I'm just gonna take a little test so
happy birthday thank you that's awesome
I will eat this later oh I've been into
something really cool hmm
I just discovered this book I kind of
stole it from somebody getting started
with Arduino
so this teaches you about the hardware
of the Arduino oh and it teaches you a
little bit about breadboards and
resistors and things like that an LED so
dangerous might have found my next
obsession oh um I don't know how would
you guys feel about doing some Arduino
segments hide your soldering irons no um
actually this would be fantastic in fact
I was just talking to glitch on IRC not
too long ago just about he's got an
awesome Arduino project that he's
putting together that's a rover and it
like drives around and it uses pineapple
to control the Arduino and he's got a
it's gonna do a hangout we're gonna have
really cool robots
this is robots at the ak5 warehouse I
can't wait until we get telepresence
with IRC streaming live goodness and the
other things Oh which we'll be able to
do now I didn't tell you about this
sorry we're totally inside baseball we
should save all of this to the end
there's actually a there's a segment
coming up a promise is a really good one
about the encryption and the fun
happiness but Shannon I'm very excited
to let you know that we will soon have
bandwidth Oh warehouse mm-hmm thank
commie thank all those well we're gonna
have 600 megabits down
oh and 80 megabits up because it was the
only way we were able to convince
Comcast to run a line here was to buy
four of their top business accounts with
all the static IP addresses
they wanted $44,000 run a line so I
guess I'm to eat the cost of we signed
up for four business lines it ain't
cheap but we're gonna have all the
bandwidth which means minecraft servers
for everyone
seriously we're gonna have to bring back
the Thunder kitten assault force for
this one because I can't wait to show
you these racks for reinstalling yes I
can't wait this is super super exciting
are you are happening things awesome
things are happening yeah yes yes so so
let us let us communicate securely yes
let us so this has obviously been
something that we're very very proud of
is secure emails mail Volokh we tried
out me envelope for a little while I've
been using it I love it I love the fact
that every since we did that segment
I've gotten a ton of PGP email me too
but ya know what's so beautiful in this
new you know post-snowden era that we
live in there's so many great you know
there's a lot of snake oil out there
right hey well in addition to that
there's some really cool open-source
stuff and I'm really keen on the one
that you've brought to the table today
yes
so this one that I've checked out is
called key-based dot IO and you can go
over a key based I oh and check it out
for yourself they give a really good
description on their page about what
they're all about
so you get a public key and then you get
it safely and it starts with a social
media username so not the actual key so
even if you don't have a PGP key you're
all set because you might be wondering
like oh is it just a website but you can
also use this in the command line it's
completely open source so you can find
all the code over at github this allows
you to get that actual public key
without having to you know share them
offline or having to write them down for
somebody else or however you decided to
share it well kids change is like a big
deal you know keys signing parties like
getting people together to actually use
their keys and so this kind of solves
that and I love the way that it
integrates social into it so hey you
know maybe this will be the thing that
makes encryption a more socially
acceptable thing you know amazing so if
you're interested in signing up right
now they are in their alpha phase so
they only do invites I have four invites
or tweet at that's not so
everybody follow me on Twitter all of
you all of you alright so basically when
you sign up you get this key base
passphrase never sent to the key base
server so this is how ever you actually
you know log in to your site it's salted
it's stretched with s crypt in the
browser so that means it actually takes
your password then beefs it up
essentially yeah exactly
and it uses a script is what okay well
okay so you remember like R is like oh
yeah our stuff is totally secure because
we md5 your password it's like Oh fail
it might as well be plain text at that
point but s crypt and bcrypt are some
awesome alternatives that that are
actually made for encryption not made
for like hashing files to say this is
the file you think your downloaded so
and the fantastic thing about this is it
all happens in the browser so your
password never touches their server so
basically what you can do is if you
don't already have some kind of public
keys set up if you haven't created one
through mail below or through what is it
have you
Cubase can do that for you so you can
set one up through key base it will
create a 4096 key bit pair your public
key pair will be created for you and
your a cryptid private key will be made
available to you as well so I should
mention on their main page
they say key based io is a key based
client
however certain crypto actions there we
go signing and decrypting are limited to
users who store client encrypted copies
of their private keys on the server an
optional feature we didn't mention above
on the website all crypto is performed
in JavaScript in your browser
some people have strong feelings about
this for good reason and by the way
you're logged in oh thank you it's good
stuff yeah and you know like we said
there's also the you know you can
actually just go ahead and download it's
written in node so you can just run this
on your Linux machine or whatever have
you and this is fantastic cuz I have my
key right here but I host it on hack 5
org slash key slash Darin and you also
have it on the MIT I have done a MIT
Kizer search so this is kind of like a
key server but with a social aspect it
is it's very social so this is why it's
cool
I think is because it can match up the
key base user so say I want to look for
a Darrin here I can look through for
Darrin not through his public key I
don't have to search through the MIT
software but I can look you up via your
username so say I know your Twitter
username I do its hak5 Darrin okay I can
look at your Twitter account I can see
if you've posted your public key on
their vehicle and if you have validated
yourself through key basis website on
Twitter so if you show me that so I'm
logged in now it's just got the invite
from you and I'm gonna go ahead and say
I already have a key I'm just gonna
paste this website and load that okay
it can also store a client encrypted
copy of this for the private key maybe
another time there we go I'll do that
later or maybe not you know what I'm
gonna do in the browser and it is
unavailable to me okay how would you
like to sign it well okay that means
that I'm actually gonna have to get into
PGP on this machine which I actually
haven't set up that's okay I can show
you on my computer
show me on yours because I haven't said
I haven't set up my GPG on that list so
basically once you get your profile set
up you have your you know your profile
your user name your face some kind of
picture on it if you go over to my
computer over here it gives you a bunch
of links so it has a Twitter link github
reddit coinbase hacker news your proven
website or domain and also a Bitcoin
address so it can help you validate
Bitcoin so you're not you know getting
spooked by somebody up in nowhere so
you'll notice right here it says snubz
which is my username on twitter and then
it shows you a little tweet link if you
go over to Twitter and you can do this
through the link so if I click on this
it'll just take you over to my profile
if you go over to Twitter it's going to
allow you to verify yourself through
your Twitter account so I can verify
myself it says I am Shannon Morse on key
base do and then it gives you a
signature based on my public key so if I
click on this link right here which goes
back to keep a sigh oh it says it is now
proven so it will link up my Twitter
account to my key base account and it
says snubs and key base splash and more
so the same person
they both control this public key and
then I can go back to here and show the
proof so from here people can tell that
I am who I actually say I am because
they know that I own my Twitter account
and they'll be able to start doing this
thing called tracking me via key base so
from here I'll be able to do things like
I can encrypt messages to you because
you know that my public key is actually
Shannon Morse
I can decrypt messages from somebody
else I can also sign them for to verify
that I am Who I am
so I can sign a message on here right
here I can type in a message and then my
passphrase down at the bottom for key
base and then very end I can also verify
so if you sent me a message I could
verify it via key basis servers so when
I go back to my main page everything
should be set up with all of my external
social networking accounts I should
mention that GPG takes care of all of
the encryption going on within key base
using the verified public key that you
have posted so for example if I wanted
to find Aaron I don't necessarily need
to use Darren's need-to-know Darren's
username on key base to encrypt a
message for him as long as I know is
Twitter username or what I'm familiar
with then I'm good so you've set up your
account yes finally and now I can now I
can go ahead and actually what improve
my Twitter by what yeah click improve
Twitter yeah and then you put in your
username whatever that might be yes and
then there we go enter my key based
passphrase that generates a signature
okay so I just post this to Twitter yeah
right
so yeah Utah so let me go ahead and
tweet so you can't actually post it from
key base like that because now is it
doing like the OAuth yeah there's no Oh
auth going on so it's it's completely
separate from key base suite well I just
tweeted that cool so now I tweeted it
verified don't delete your proof
hahaha so if this ever gets compromised
I can delete the Twitter account and
then I then I would be able to
disconnect those and be like woah dude
although you know use a good passphrase
and don't get hacked but yeah so now
she's all set up and if you go back to
your page on your actual account you'll
be able to see that now you've been
identified you've been verified via your
Twitter and you can now send me you know
encrypted messages you can decrypt them
via the key base website or through the
command line as well and you can also do
something called tracking people so if
you search for me up there you can put
it in anymore there we go when I
see you
so click there you can track me so this
is gonna send me an email that says
Darrin kitchen is now tracking you and
then if i refresh my page I can do the
same thing with you I can refresh so
sign in again there we go it's
generating a signature and now I am
tracking you ah and I see that you are
also tracking move X and J yes 3hd more
and sub and you're being tracked by
Peter Aston so here's an idea I know
that you actually just set up your
account I know that that's you so I'm
gonna track you - aha so I like yeah I
like that it's kind of like Twitter like
following people because it gives some
sort of like it's not a web of trust say
per se but it's it's get lending
validity to that this is actually the
Shannon Morse I'm looking for which I
really like that yeah so basically you
know it makes you more verifiable the
more accounts that you have following
you or the more accounts that you've set
up so that your your verified via your
github or whatever that makes you more
verifiable so it's it's kind of like
being legit so think of it like it's
kind of like Twitter following in a way
but it checks your proofs and then if
I'm absolutely happy I get a snapshot up
those proofs with my private key so I
can move on to a different computer I
don't necessarily have to have your
public key on all of my different
computers which could be an issue so I
just have to know that you know you are
who you say you are go over to key base
and do encryption or decryption through
their servers you know it is super cool
about this is I don't have to know your
key base yeah but if I'm if your key
base has your 12 I know your Twitter and
your Twitter is proven on key base and
you've also proven
you're coinbase calm account now I can
actually send you money with Bitcoin yes
you can without having to have
previously known your Bitcoin or your
coin based comm identity so I love kind
of ties it all together and in a secure
mean some of those other like about me
or other types of web sites at least
makes it this makes it very very open to
a wider public I feel like it makes PGP
more understandable
it makes encryption like a social
network where it's the next new thing
you gotta get cool okay cool I think
it's awesome because it's it's gonna be
welcoming it doesn't feel scary whatever
you like I can still be you know as
pretty as this nice you know html5 with
all the cool you know it's very you know
maybe the guys created this also created
OkCupid so of course it's gonna be you
know like looks gorgeous and I look how
cute it is but it's also all up on
github it is yeah is a fantastic
open-source legit I like it I'm totally
cool then track us
I am key base io / Darrin kitchen and
I'm key based io / Shannon Morse
whatever it might be there we go
yeah okay awesome well feedback at hack
