crashplan this is a lot of toys here
yeah you just get to play with these
every day pretty much yeah it's it's a
lot of fun pretty sweet gig I was hoping
that maybe you could give me a kind of
an idea of what the the basics are when
it comes to satellite broadband the idea
of never being you know without a
connection okay you want to talk
satellite broadband or you want to talk
just dead in general oh yeah let's just
talk about data like as long as I can
get an ssh session back to my box I
don't care okay you might be able to do
an ssh session even over a handheld
although I wouldn't recommend it because
I have that phone kind of Sydney what is
this guy this is a iridium latest NL
phone so it's a satellite phone with
your capability of doing a data as well
you can do 2.4 killed it's per second
2.4 kilobits that's something that will
give you a little telnet or SSH action
yeah so how does that differ from some
of the others i mean this 2.4 kilobits
per second what you would come to expect
from satellite or it gets better it gets
better from there actually it gets worse
from there to know where it gets worse
than that so inmarsat version of the
handheld phone I just got here this guy
does 2.4 this does 1.2 1.2 kilobits per
second Wow okay so now that we've seen
the extreme bad end of the scale where
does it go from there so it would go up
to actually global starters phone they
almost then you're doing about 4.8
kilobits per second on that on that guy
when you're in service so what's what's
the issue with getting service with
global stars just because their
satellites fall out of the sky or stop
working they had a real bad well they
lost most of their satellites initially
this poor guys what happened were they
the ones that had the head-on collision
with the Russian satellite or no and
actually i think it was solar flares it
broke them they just didn't have
protection on the on their birds and
that's it I don't know the specifics on
it but that's that's what i was told
Lucy I just just lost a birds now you
say airtime wouldn't even buy airtime
you're paying for a minute when you do a
handheld phones ose so when you do data
on these even though they're only like
you know kilobytes per second you're
paying private in a minute not the
megabyte yes that's that's actually the
hang-up that a lot of people have on
this is you know when you start talking
about costs over for doing data over
satellite communications you know they
see that no we can buy a global start
phone for seven hundred dollars and I'm
paying a dollar a minute or what have
you oh no it's they don't make the
people aren't able to equate you know
i'm doing i'm able to transfer this much
data at a minute vs i'm paying twelve
dollars a meg on something like a sleep
robin terminal I mean are any of the
broadband solutions for satellite like
at the point where I could like real I
these say like oh this is a good
solution for me to go around the world
and upload HD video if you the hard part
we're doing that is yes there is a
viable way to do it vsat is actually a
very good means of doing a your transfer
costs so you're paying less than a
dollar or Meg on vsat put your pain
about 15 grand up for equipment yeah
they're the domes are about size of that
iridium dome they're on up you've seen
these vans whatnot with a big dish on
them yeah chances are that's a visa
edition not it so oh I'm so where's kind
of the sweet spot in between the not
fifteen thousand dollars up front but
still for when I need data and I'm out
of 3g coverage area I kind of want to
just go to the boonies but still get my
email vegans a very good solution for
that because of the size of the terminal
so it's packable
you have really good transfer rates
right so my hacker mind is like okay yes
I'm using the linux box with only SSH
going out and have restrictive iptables
rules you know and be making the most
out of every megabyte mainly just using
SSH or mosh or some other you know to
get to to server in the cloud to do fun
stuff or necessarily pop it on my
windows box and Windows Update kill
everything but way I mean so with these
rather than with these terminals it's
rather than like the phones worse by the
minute what if I don't egg by the Meg
gave amber Meg so for example your
you've got the began Slyke the mobile
broadband satellite terminals you've got
a kind of a more of a fixed installation
unit like this is our mr SATs maritime
terminal it uses the same satellites as
the the vegans but it's a a tracking
dome yeah this is attracting dome right
here this is the the below deck unit the
antenna I can show you the antenna
outside is it is it like this is it like
a dome it's a dome but it's a little bit
smaller ok yeah well so you put the dome
on the on the mast and then you put this
guy down in the ship and then you've got
your awesome handset so you were saying
that began though being the sweet spot
what what is began that's you know it's
a technology from inmarsat but who are
they and what is began and how does it
differ from say iridium because you know
before I looked into all of this stuff
iridium was the only constellation of
satellites for voice and data that I was
even aware of okay um it goes into
things like their satellite
constellation themselves so whereas
iridium is polar orbiting you've got 686
birds up there mr sat only has three
they're geostationary their way up there
it's like 2,200 miles above the equator
and so it's
instead of a your phone you either be in
an omnidirectional or likely or antenna
where it's kind of omni directional in
its face in different directions whatnot
you're having to aim these two towards
the satellite but once you've got it
aimed you're able to pull on the class 3
190 to kill that's all the way up to a
class 1 which is 262 so some significant
bandwidth yeah so it's kind of like the
difference between like you know with
Wi-Fi an omnidirectional antenna versus
a directional antenna obviously the
directional one's going to get you
better right yeah but you have to point
it but you have to point yeah and so the
reason being is because the Inmarsat
constellation of satellites are at a
higher orbit well it's it's hot that's
how they function is there at a higher
orbit because in order to get better
coverage on our geostationary you have
to get the satellite farther out so that
it's able to spirit spot be so are you
to be now so each of these satellites
sees a third of the world right right so
you've got the the u.s. is sitting I
want to say right at the equator just
off the coast of South America ish ok
and it's it's broadcasting North End
self at that point wow that's one
satellite that covers the whole region
mm-hmm and you've got you know if you
want to go into the technology of it
they've got weather what they call wide
beams so they take that the whole the
whole beam that the satellite hits on
the globe and i divide it out to a wide
beams which covers pacifica regions yeah
and then so like like regions the size
of states or collections of state
collections of states I would say yeah
and then when you boot up your terminal
and it's if you're going to the ending
sequence on it that's what you're
actually registering to is the wide beam
ok and then when you're wide beam is
just there as a register beam just like
here's where I am right right oh I see
and then when you actually get into
where you're transferring data it
switches from the wide beam to a spot
beam which is a
much more narrow pipe so you're saying
that the actual satellite what is it
like filled with hundreds of these spot
beams do they actually like move and you
know kind of like change their
orientation based on where you are
connecting no it's just more of a
resource allocation so if you were to
ever look at the actual antenna on the
mo satellite it's kind of a honeycomb
shaped kind of antenna to it but it's
it's really kind of more back-end and
resource allocation so each each spot
aim has its own channel and its own
bandwidth it's kind of similar to you
could say something like a cable network
where your your bandwidth is shared
among other other nodes in that being so
you've got a three reticle throughput
but it's it's not sure and so I guess
then they have like a maximum throughput
or maximum like concurrent connections
where I notice you yeah and you're
saying that there's different classes
though what differentiates the different
classes basically the strength of the
antenna so you've got a class 3 which is
0 size of this guy here this is an
actual inmarsat terminal but it's about
the size all the way up to class ones
like these two guys here and it's really
just they're just strength of the
antenna and how large the terminals
because of that is that heavy not really
well 30 and so is it just that this has
more antenna fixtures or how does that
work just it's it's already kind of like
is it kind of like my mo or is it just
that it's got higher transmit power and
just got higher transmit power ok that's
pretty cool so how do you most
efficiently use your signal because of
your PIN by the megabyte obviously
anything that you can do at the head end
to kind of reduce that is going to be
you know worth whatever cost true and
see that's where our side of the
business comes into place I mean yeah
we're equipment and airtime provider so
you know we were able to supply iridium
airtime
that I'm Globalstar what have you but we
also do back end solutions so you can do
something like the optimizers is the the
base model units just a little mini
router open wrt based you can plug in a
1 of the handsets to it and it's got the
drivers built into to run any of the
handsets and you can do things like male
we have a specialized mail service that
that does batch compression so it's a
storm forward type of setup to it you
have an application that runs on your
computer that acts as your mail clients
mail server clunk whoa I see so it so we
can speak the same protocol and
everything that it's used to okay but
really it's just talking to your device
that it's going to go and fetch
everything in the most optimum way right
right so when you're ready to transfer
you just hit start and it goes through
the dialing sequence for the handheld's
or telling the terminals via AT commands
to start a session then it goes through
and transfers in oh that makes a lot of
sense because this device right here you
just Wi-Fi over to it do your thing and
since it's connected to like the serial
on some of these devices then you've got
even though you've got really low
bandwidth you should be able to like you
know unit everything's like you know
gzip or something like a super
compressed and then goes to a server on
the other end that's expecting that kind
of stuff pretty cool so we've got both a
mail service and a we started with
maritime so mail and weather was big for
maritime you know what's what's the
weather going to be like for this trip
or what have you in fact is there
because it's too expensive to pull up
you know whether calm or Noah calm or
whatever if you can oh I see I mean a
lot of a lot of times the maritime guys
aren't really running terminals you'll
see bigger ships or people with a little
bit more money running the higher
equipment but most the time you see
people running just handsets really so
yeah that's the majority of I mean the
more jury of personal users will do
handsets just because they don't want to
pay the upfront costs
are these less expensive that's it yeah
what are those run globalstar you're
going to be paying roughly about I want
to say about seven or dollars same with
the Inmarsat handheld yridians you're
going to pay about eleven hundred
dollars for the 9555 they'll be the
older rendition and then the 9575 you're
paying about 1500 that's that's
considerably less expensive and some of
the bigger you know broadband terminals
right uh immerse that won't actually let
you run these over water you can what
it's because oh can they tell ya oh yeah
they can tell oh I guess everything you
know every device that registers yeah
obviously their satellite knows where it
is and then they use gps or well the
satellite pics is that the terminal
itself picks up a GPS fix so that it
knows what satellite it's going to be
registering to and what what spot beam
and why beam it's gonna be gone so they
don't let you use these overseas no you
have to actually go to American I'm
terminal 4 why is it just because it's
like a business model thing or is there
a technical reason why you know I think
it's more meaning country laws and what
have you because there's actually some
countries where you have to notify them
that you've got a satellite
communication so they can monitor what
you're doing David things right yeah
like how some of in Laden was using
iridium phones you know and all the fun
wiretapping that goes on with that so
there's I think there's some of that in
play I don't really know the specifics
because the rest that really doesn't
tell us but course yeah I think it's
probably business model related to and
any generally when you're sitting on a
boat last thing you want to do is be
trying to run your boat and aim it yeah
terminal anyway so you go to a maritime
unit you've got an active tracking
antenna that's tracking a satellite
right because with with a boat you know
pitching and everything trying to keep
that thing level isn't as much fun so it
makes sense that you know such domes
exists okay so what's inside what's like
under the dome
this being an example of just a typical
film with an array of antennas or
whatever have you again it's it differs
depending on the satellite constellation
setup so on the mr set one you've
actually got an active antenna where
it's got a a 4 axis up down left right
and it's it's taking and looking at
signal basically like what you would be
doing manually you know and trying to
find the best signal and it's if what it
does when you first boot it up it does a
360 pan and then an up and down so it
kind of registers where it's at and then
it starts looking for the bird soon as
it finds it or locks on and just kind of
tracks it at that point so then you can
start tilting it and it compensates it
compensates for everything on it yeah so
you can do a 360 turn you can roll pitch
whatever its it'll track it that's
pretty cool and then you know iridium
they just get by with a a kind of
omnidirectional ish type of antenna just
by pointing internal multiple antennas
yeah yes you have like several different
antennas in here hopefully all over the
place seven panels in there okay so
there are actual panels about a size
they're just aimed in different you were
telling you about that the optimizer
what is this guy so these are from the
optimizer you go on up to other type of
solutions depend on what you're wanting
to do with your satellite communications
we've got a router called the 202 which
is the next level up from the optimizer
and it's got to a PSN spaced and it's
got squid built into it so you can do
its kind of manual failover and let you
just unplug and plug in but it's also
got USB ports or tues run the handheld's
and you know so you can set up firewalls
to block traffic that you don't want to
occur like Windows Update like windows
update or skype and we've had some
people that ran skype on their sound
light thing because they could then they
look at their build running is a super
node or something and you're you know
transferring other people data
yeah they don't do that anymore they
change the model but yeah I kind of
stuff this is all fascinating i just
love the idea that like how far we've
come in the last I mean 10 years they're
still launching satellites I mean global
star just got done launching their
replacement constellation yridians in
the works to launching a what they call
the next yeah service and the pilot here
will be able to use it as well so
they'll see a transfer broadband
increase yeah a bandwidth increase on it
I think out of all of you through the
one that that I'd just like most as far
as like a hacker aspect is just these
these brits the emergent I marsac guys
who are just like you know what let's
just do this with three satellites and
call it a day it's definitely efficient
I mean you know it's they've got they've
got a really good service to so I wonder
how much of that is is tied to the cost
of you know the mega bytes in that it's
not a technical limitation why I really
and couldn't be faster or whenever it's
just kind of like
this thing you know we've got 66 you
know well you guys to maintain versus
three you also got to keep in mind when
the birds were launched two so r idioms
birds have been up there I only quiet
now yeah yeah are you write it was like
the mid 90s and it was like such a big
deal and also it's like it seems that
really complicated because they're
they're not in a geostationary orbit so
at any given point in time you can
actually see no we stood outside for
long enough we'd see an iridium flare
and hey who just happen all in yeah and
even the interlinking between them too
because you have to have a ground
station for it to talk to you right so
it's your transfers going up to a bird
but then it's going to come back down to
earth in order to be able to get to
learn some network yeah it's crazy to
because since they're all moving in
different directions they they speak to
each other and hang over free space
optics yep which is like hmm it's like
ka-band i think that i use for like for
another link i think it might be
microwave but but either web I've
actually done it got got a diagram at
sea cave and across over someone to
selling them back down drew it's just
overly complex yes wow it's let's make
access points the move and then mesh
well they move well thanks Ryan yeah
another Trump yeah what can people find
out more by oceans website we've got wwo
shinzo cns calm phone 2068 so maybe 270
there you go load of course sure yes
playing little this way here yeah your
backups should be private like really
private none of this bogus we store your
private key in the cloud for you
nonsense or more recently with the whole
Intelligence Agency back doors no I mean
true privacy backed by sound crypto and
with a key that never leaves your system
we've been talking about it for years
here on hak5 secure ways to do backups
and furthermore i've personally been a
customer of our newest sponsored
crashplan because they get it you know
with their free client for Windows Mac
Linux even solaris you get
to use your very own Blowfish key you
know the open source cypher from Bruce
Schneier and this way nothing ever
touches the network without first being
encrypted and not only can you use their
free clients and back up to your own
external hard drive for free but they're
secure off-site storage is truly
unlimited I know I've got terabytes up
there so as hackers as geeks as IT
professionals we all know the importance
of off-site backups and as hak5 viewers
we're getting a very special hookup from
now until July thirty-first 2013 we're
getting a huge discount on their one
year unlimited plans that normally start
5999 a year but if you go to this very
special page set up just for us at
crashplan calm / hack it up look at
twenty percent off that's a year of
unlimited backups for less than four
bucks a month it is never too soon to
back it up so I highly encourage you to
take advantage of this July only offer
at crashplan calm / hack it up it's time
for my favorite part of the show this is
the technol us photo of the week this
one comes from lewis he sends us this
photo of his new Wi-Fi setup and says i
bought this when I received my Wi-Fi
pineapple and thought you may want to
see how everything is being used I'm a
network admin and I have been using it
to do testing on the wireless networks I
have implemented and it's brilliant I'm
trying to work on a way to get this
device reporting to a new few gen 2
servers to paint maps of the wireless
coverage around the buildings this could
be great for W land surveys that's very
cool it's awesome to see you using
everything for work very convenient now
you can send your photos over to
feedback at hak5 org and make sure to
put in the subject line techni lest so
that we can find them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
