multiplexing tyonne's Rob bit signaling
and why you never actually got 56k back
in the day this episode of fact 5 is
brought to you by goto assist express
support smarter with go to assist
express domain calm got a great idea it
all starts with a great domain domain
calm and Sony hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of Technol us i've got
a great show for you guys this week
because we're talking about a topic that
is so near and dear to my heart
something that i've been having a lot of
fun with since i was just a little kid
and i thought i'd share with you guys
because you know it's the middle of the
holidays I'm doing a lot of traveling as
this airs I'm probably still driving
across the country so I guess you know
follow the Twitter and Facebook for all
that action maybe I'll even be doing
some video blogging but regardless
putting together a little series here on
phone phreaking no not getting free
long-distance we're talking the more
interesting intricacies of the telephone
network and you're probably asking
yourself why are we getting into the
telephone network this is a hacker show
math is hard you know what this stuff is
fun it really is and a lot of it applies
to more than just the telephone network
I mean sure the free phone calls is kind
of an allure just like old packet
sniffing thing is but at the end of the
day it's really learning the network I
mean going to be wrong red boxing was
really cool but when I started learning
about the ESS 5 and and DMS 100 those
are like different switching systems and
then how it all like works with you know
T ones and pulse code modulation time
division multiplexing and you start
learning some really really neat stuff
that you know a lot of these these
topics here apply to more fields than
just telephony so today I figured why
don't we just go ahead and recap what we
talked about last week and then we're
going to get into a little time division
multiplexing and a little bit of these
signaling and framing and other
fun cool intricacies of tyonne's or
what's known as a ds1 circuit and how
that equates to the superior II one or
the European version thereof but yeah
that's what we're doing dude and I value
your feedback so throughout all of this
go ahead and hit up feedback a hack five
dot org let me know this is something
you guys like you know just like I did
with the what is it
DNS segments having a lot of fun with
the whiteboard I figured hey let's try
something completely off the wall with
hack five and and see how that goes but
you know it's you guys show so you let
me know what you think and we'll make it
happen of course I haven't seen any the
feedback of the last week because this
is all getting shot back back and I'm in
transit across country at the moment but
you know that is what's going on you're
wondering about the whine it's so that I
can pause and take a drink because if I
don't I'm going to ramble the entire
show so let's paint a little picture
here that's why I've got the markers
right we got we got some grassy fields
going on right okay and over here we got
some grass going on oh what's that
behind the grass oh no it's a big
building and it's got a big logo on it
and it is poorly drawn but that right
there is supposed to be a bell anyway
it's Ma Bell well actually I guess these
days it would look more like that you
know I'm talking about anyway when I
grew up it was all Bell Atlantic before
they merge with GTE and everybody else
to create Verizon but whatever anyway we
got the central offers chillin over here
and you know and it's a beautiful day we
got some birds flying over here and then
oh what's this oh no it's my house
that's that's totally where I live right
there right and inside my house I have a
telephone and I want to call Shannon
because that's what I do on my landline
it's gonna be awesome right so we got
some telephone poles here and you
probably didn't tune in to watch me draw
so I promise that we're getting to
something that makes sense here in a
moment so we got some telephone cables
here and I'm just going to I'm going to
be the blue house so I
I got my two wires going over to the
telephone company right we put another
one on the other side oh wow look how
look at sexy that looks right well then
you know I've got a next-door neighbor
here we're gonna gonna call him mark
right mark mark lives next door he's a
cool guy
you know plays his music a little too
loud sometimes but you can't fault the
guy you know I'd probably own him in
rock band anyway right so mark Scott you
know mark let's talk on the phone too so
he's got a circuit which consists of two
with two wires right I'll be your tip
and your ring or in the interior of your
house telephone wiring you PI notice
them as the red and the green there may
also be a black and a yellow for a
second line regardless so we got you
know we got four wires going over the
phone company but you know I forget to
mention this I actually live in a big
neighborhood right back here purple
house that's Bob
Bob's pretty cool Bob's got the purple
wires all going to the central office
there's something wrong with this
picture
okay that's never going to work because
you can see if we just keep going you
know for the size of your city or
neighborhood whatever this the central
office is just going to get completely
exhausted with all of those cables going
across you know your telephone poles are
going to be like drooping down with
gigantic cables it's not going to work
so what we're going to talk about today
is how we take all of those and using a
technology called time division
multiplexing rather than sending out you
know for our example we're going to be
talking about 24 subscribers or 24
household's 24 lines ds0 is whatever you
want to call them right and putting
those on to to twisted pairs or 4 wires
on a t1 or what's known as a ds1 and
that's what we're going to be getting in
today but how did we get here right
we're going to be talking about how we
can multiplex them digitally and as you
know from last week we were talking
about pulse amplitude modulation and
pulse code modulation and that is
essentially taking an analog waveform we
got that analog waveform of me talking
on the phone right there and we're going
to quanta size it we're going to say hey
that right there
is 255 that right there is zero I guess
the center line would be 128 and then
we're going to sample it we're going to
sample it 8,000 times every second when
we're going to just put these little
orange markers here to signify the
samples at our sample rate of 8,000
Hertz is actually due to the fact that
the telephone wire analog is eight Hertz
or 8 kilohertz so you have to sample it
twice as much anyway regardless we're
sampling it a whole bunch and we've
talked about how there's different
sample rates equate to you know things
we see pulse code modulation and other
technologies such as the compact disc
where it's forty four point one
kilohertz or DVDs where it's 48
kilohertz or even you know blue ray
where it's 192 max I think anyway so the
fidelity is alright you know if it's
8,000 Hertz 8,000 times a second we're
going to sample that and come up with a
number representing this you know analog
blue waveform here between 0 and 255
which comes out to a 8-bit number that's
the pulse amplitude modulation bit there
is coming up with that number so for
example in last week we talked about how
this one right here might be a 173 and
then with pulse code modulation or at
least the you law version that
encompasses North America and Japan
we're going to come up with a binary bit
stream we're going to say hey 173 that
is equal to 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 and we come
up with that because binary going from
right to left can be drawn as 1 plus 2
plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 plus 32 plus 64
plus 128 if you add all of those up
together you get 255
of course you start with 0 when you're
counting a binary math so really you've
got 256 you know bits there to work with
and that right there is your bit depth
right and we get this by saying ok 173
we can come up with that if we do you
know going from the right it's 1 the
though the one indicates that you add
the zero indicates that you ignore go to
the next number essentially alright so
we've got this one zero so we don't add
the two one we add the four we add the
eight zero we don't add the sixteen one
we add the 32 zero we don't add the
sixty-four and one at the very beginning
we add the 128 which is how we get 173
so essentially what we get is this one
zero one zero one one zero one out of
you know that one eight thousands eight
thousandths I can't say that anyway one
of those 8,000 Hertz samples we're going
to come up with a binary representation
of this analog waveform and it's going
to look like this one zero one zero one
one zero one right and then on the wire
we talked about how that is going to
look quite gorgeous like this it's going
to look like one zero one zero one one
zero one and that's because this right
here is plus three volts that right
there is zero volts and that right there
is minus 3 volts and we alternate those
just so that that signal can travel
further and these are really what are
known as pulses each of these plus three
minus three that's a pulse when when
it's zero volts it's nothing and then
what happens is over time that signal
every six thousand feet is going to need
to be what's known as regenerated rather
just in the analog world to amplify it
which would result in noise we just say
hey whatever you gave me it might not be
plus three it might only be like plus
two and a half but I know that that was
meant to be a three and it just
recreates that digital signal all over
again and that's how we can maintain a
pristine digital connection and what we
know as the last mile before it gets
over the telephone company and then you
know they shoot it up over a satellite
or over t1 or over many different types
of mediums like microwave or underground
or undersea cables and they're probably
cut by the CIA anyway and and we can you
know use those so that we can have a
conversation without losing
quality and and that right there in a
nutshell is pulse amplitude modulation
pulse code modulation Wow
okay a little heavier than I thought on
the a block but you know I think that
was a good recap and I think we have the
fundamentals now to go ahead and start
talking about how we can multiplex these
and then get into some of the more fun
intricacies of t1 circuits but I guess
you guys probably need a break
so do I so let's just go ahead and kick
it over Shanon find out about trivia and
when we get back its TDM last week's
trivia question was created by Larry
Ewing in 1996 this aquatic flightless
bird is mascot - what family of
unix-like operating systems all right
I'll give you a hint like a penguin get
it tux tux the penguin he's so cute
I wish humans RL so I could like walk
around with him and he could be my
little friend oh yeah
anyway if you want to win some high-five
swag this week go over to hackpad org
slash trivia it answer the following
question with an initial release of may
2003 this fork of cafe log has been
downloaded over 12 million times and is
used by over 12% of the top million
websites we'll be right back after a

it all starts with a great domain domain
comm time-division multiplexing it's one
of the easiest ones to explain and maybe
in a later segment we'll talk about some
other ones like frequency division
multiplexing and wave division
multiplexing and a whole bunch other fun
ones when you get into different types
of signals like I don't know a fiber
optic for example that's a really fun
one but let's just talk about time
division multiplexing because it's
really important as we talked about we
had all of those different homes you
know my place and and Frank's plays mark
plays and the whole neighborhood see
like we got 24 people up in this
neighborhood and we all want to get our
circuit over to the central office
without causing those uh those lines to
droop so phone company said hey why
don't we save some copper using some
cool technology called time division
multiplexing we'll take all of those
digital sources that we've just created
using pulse code modulation and we're
going to stick them all on one line yes
that is a t1 actually it's not exactly
one line it's really two twisted pairs
or four wires but whatever right so t1
it's kind of synonymous to a ds1 or a
digital signal one and really the
difference there is that a ds1 is
basically the logical logical bit
pattern of a t1 but really whenever you
see them the one in the same well a t1
is just a really cool line that has
to four channels you can think of them
as and each of those channels is a ds0
you'll also see things like a ds3 or
eighty-three you may be familiar with as
well which has you know I don't remember
how many channels I think is like 54 but
I'm not positive anyway we're talking
about a t1 which is 24 channels now
let's go ahead and break this down I'm
going to go ahead and paint these this
neighborhood here and we're just going
to use three subscribers just to make it
all fit but here we go I'll be blue
there is my analog waveform and here's
Bob and here's his analog waveform and
here's our mark here's its analog
waveform and each of those traveling
over there you know individual pairs of
wires they're going to go into a cool
little box down the street and that's
going to do what's known as pulse code
modulation pulse amplitude modulation
being a part of that we've talked about
it before and that's how we end up with
just as we talked about is cool digital
representation of those so paint the
rest of that okay so imagine those being
24 subscribers we've created digital
versions of those by sampling them 8,000
times per second or 8,000 Hertz and
we've got a bit depth of 8-bits right so
what does that give us well eight times
8,000 we're going to get times we're
going to get 64,000 64k bits per second
that's how much bandwidth each of those
subscriber lines or ds0 circuits have so
that right there equals 64 kilobits per
second right now we know that that t1 or
the ds1 is 24 channels yet it actually
has the bandwidth
of 1.544 mega bits per second now how do
we get that okay before we even get to
the whole multiplexing part how do we
get that because we know that
essentially all we're going to do is
we're going to take these we're going to
run them through another box here in
this case that box is going to be called
time division multiplexing right so
we'll come back to this in just a second
but how do we get to 1.544 megabits per
second well if you do the math the 24
and remember this this right here is 24
channels if we take the we take 8 bits
times 24 channels right we get 192 192
times remember 8,000 times per second or
8,000 Hertz equals 1 million 536,000
okay or one point five three six
megabits a second what's that it's not
1.544 it's actually because there's
another bit in here let's just go ahead
and add this guy right there and that's
plus one as a framing bit we're a timing
bit it's an important bit that maintains
our signaling and that right there
brings this whoops I'm sorry that plus
one is in the wrong place the plus one
is actually right here plus one right so
that's actually a 193 times 8,000 and
that's how we get 154 whoops wrong color
bear with me 1 5 4 4
secretin okay awesome to me zeros anyway
think so now I had a read for some
anyway that's how we get 1.544 and we're
going to come back to that plus one
later on in the show because it's really
important and then there's some fun
discrepancies that are just going to
have you going whoa at the end of the
show but that aside let's now get all of
these guys onto one line how are we
going to do that okay well we're going
through the time division multiplexer
and essentially what it's going to do is
it's going to say hey you know this this
is sampled you know for each of these
are sampled 8,000 times per second that
means that each of these sequences a
sequence of eight bits in a byte is
going to take about and found the right
color here is going to take about 125
microseconds okay 125 microseconds
because it's 8,000 times per second
right now what we're going to need to do
is to put all of those on one except
we're going to have to compress it down
now we're not actually speeding up the
bits you can't speed up bits it's copper
wire it's not going to happen you're not
going to be able to send electricity
faster on a t1 then you would on a DS
zero or a subscriber line it's it's no
different sorry we just can't bend the
rules there but what we can do is
increase the rate because this 125
microseconds is the rate of 8,000 Hertz
or 8,000 times a second for our eight
bits on our single d0 or our single
subscriber but what happens here is when
we go to time division multiplexing
we're going to say hey we're going to
actually come up with discrete time
slots okay and each of these time slots
are going to be we divide that by 24
we're going to get 5.2 micro seconds
right so right here where we had this
really big you know pretend that's eight
bits right
we're gonna on our stream here we're
going to say okay yeah mm-hmm right ten
that's eight bits right squish down
right and we're going to say okay cool
so we've got our eight bits for the blue
one Darren the first subscriber then
we're going to go to Joe and and Joe
needs to get his bits in as well so
we're going to send Joe's bits right and
then we're going to go down to tomorrow
and we're going to send marks bits just
imagine that those are eight times each
right and and then rather than three
we're actually talking about 24 but I
just don't have enough whiteboard for
that but so after we've done 24 of these
I've got one more bit just a single bit
not eight right and that is going to be
that's going to be our timing the bit
that we talked about our our one bit
that adds you know that that makes that
192 193 that we can maintain timing and
that's important because what we need to
do is every time we see that we're going
to need to know okay great the next 8
bits is for channel 1 the next 8 bits
after that is for channel 2 channel 3
all the way to 24 and then we see the
tying bit again ok and that's how rather
than one point five three six it's one
point five four bore so each of these
being 52 microseconds versus when they
were up here being 125 microseconds you
can see how we've just increased the
sample rate increase the rate here for
our t1 and we can take 24 subscribers
and put them on one wire right
we just sequence them with time division
multiplexing we've got those time slots
we put them all into it and everything
sitting happy as long as we've got that
timing bit so that we know when to be
counting each channel or time slot now
just anecdotally and not with a whole
lot of specification here how does that
compare to our European counterparts
well they were a bit smarter than us
if you ask me they have what's known as
an e one and I don't know all of the
nitty-gritties of those because you know
being an American and all that but what
I do know is theirs is 32 love how
that's a nice round number if you will
32 times lots right I forget the exact
band width of it too but they have
separate bandwidth dedicated to
signaling and timing and when we get
back we're going to be talking about how
t1 signaling works and all of a sudden
you're going to get really jealous above
the Europeans you can understand why
sometimes we couldn't get much more than
33 six on your 56k modem back in the day
when you were a little HP be playing
quake 2 I know we all remember now
before we get going though I do want to
say hey thank you so much to our latest
sponsor Sony our friend over at Bike
jacker jacker Anthony Carboni actually
put together a little mini segment for
us and we going to air it now and we
would really like to know what you think
of it so check this out hey guys Anthony
here for signal by Sony a show about
everything sony makes from gear to games
to movies and I've been wondering just
how realistic Gran Turismo 5 is so I
grabbed a professional race driver and
brought him here to Venice California
and the GT studios we're gonna have them
play the game and compare its track to
the real track are you feeling slight
changes as you're as you're hitting up
against walls well you know I didn't I
didn't hit hard enough so it might just
be cosmetic at this point but I think
that's important because before we all
know there was definitely no damage in
the game and now I mean cosmetic is one
thing but more importantly is how does
the car drive after you've hit the wall
or have you hit somebody else because
that has consequences and if you don't
realize those consequences then
people just don't really take it
seriously and that's just some of the
stuff we did here at GT Studios to find
out more about Gran Turismo 5 head to
revision three.com slash sony so by now
we have a general understanding of how
we can take something from analog to
digital with pulse amplitude modulation
and pulse code modulation and then how
we can multiplex it with 23 other
subscribers on a 24 channel t1 or a ds1
link using time division multiplexing
and I figured that t1 link it's kind of
interesting it's got some interesting
bits that hey you know there's still
they're still around they're still
kicking you'll see them a lot why don't
we learn some of the finer details of it
just a few that I find really
interesting as far as the signaling is
concerned because like we said and let's
just go ahead and paint out a idea here
of a multiplexed t1 so again blue being
Darren we've got got a binary bit stream
here I'm just going to do the 8 bit ok
so there's there's me and then we've got
you know the next subscriber just a few
bits here in no particular order the
next subscriber and then let's imagine
21 other subscribers and then we have a
1 and that right there is that colors
not working out so well we have a 1 and
that right there is our signal bit our
timing bit it helps us understand where
the channels begin and it happens every
193 bits because there's eight of these
times 24 192 Plus that 193 times 8,000
was it 8,000 yeah no times 24 no I just
did my math wrong times that number yes
times 8,000 and that's how we get 1.544
megabits per second sorry had a little
moment there anyway what I think is
really interesting listen the american
t1 is a little thing called robbed bit
signaling now signaling equipment needs
more bandwidth than what is available
here sure we've got that one in a
framing bit there but
we need a little bit more and what they
end up doing is every sixth subscriber
see how we had a 8 bit here pretend like
this green one here was actually the
sixth subscriber what they do is they're
actually going to take that last bit
that 8th bit there and they're going to
use it they're so greedy they're going
to use it for themselves
so what does that mean well if every
sixth subscriber on a t1 is only getting
seven of their eight bits that means
that you have a you know only of five
and six chance of getting all eight bits
right now what are those come out to
well your eight bits times 8,000 times
per second or 8,000 Hertz we know to be
64 kilobits per second which in pulse
code modulation actually equates to 37
decibels or I guess that's supposed to
be a big B or is supposed to be a big D
hmm
just going to go lowercase decibels
signal-to-noise ratio okay so that's
kind of your audio fidelity you can kind
of think of that as right well if we're
that sixth subscriber we're only going
to get seven bits now that's not a
that's not a big deal we can still send
you know our data there that just means
that our our bit depth is only going to
be seven so rather than going to 256 or
212 to to you know counting the 0 255
what does that go up to 128 then mmm
yeah something like that anyway we're
not going to get quite as much fidelity
there so 7 bits times 8,000 Hertz equals
56 kilobits per second or 31 decibels
signal-to-noise ratio hey remember those
days 56 K there you go and that's why or
one of the reasons and I think that
there's what's really interesting about
this is okay so we've got this timing
bit
over here on our t1 that says hey you
know you see me I'm one I'm the timing
bit that means that the next eight bits
are going to be you know channel 1 and
then channel 2 3 4 etc and then you're
depending on our signalling equipment we
may you know Rob these 8-bit every six
channels right it's one of the ways to
do it then there's various methods of
signaling but that's one of them right
the rob bit signaling it we're going to
make every six subscriber only seven
bits right 56k huh bummer to be you well
that timing bit there isn't a constant
in the universe it's not like hooked up
to some crazy atomic clock or anything
it's just arbitrarily set for that t1 or
that ds1 link right well when you make a
phone call say like you know you're in
Poughkeepsie and you want to call
Waynesville Missouri you might go
through several T ones and not all of
those T ones are synchronized which
means if they all use robbed bit
signaling not only do you have a greater
chance of having your eighth bit robbed
but you could be robbed more than once
which means that your call quality could
really degrade which means your dial-up
quality if you're calling to another
city could really degrade how many of
you guys didn't always connect at 56
kilobits a second yeah I know I remember
it always get like 33 6 or sometimes 26
something if it was like you know
calling a different city far away or
whatever that was a real shame right and
I just find that to be one of those
fascinating little intricacies here of
the t1 a few other things that I can't
go into a whole lot of detail due to
time about t1 s though is you know we
talked about the European version the e1
well they have 32 channels right and
they actually have separate bandwidth
for their signaling so they don't Rob
any bits right there's a few other
interesting things about the American
thing the t1 and that is one's density
and what one's density says is that at
least one of the bits for every byte for
every eight bits right has to be a 1 so
you can't have you can
have 868 zeros in a row it's got to be
you know you get to here and then it has
to be a one actually has to be a one
right and that means that you've got a
twelve and a half percent ones density
and I just I find that quite interesting
as well as one other little key thing
here about t1 and that's what's known as
b8zs that's supposed to be a Z so what
is b8zs it actually stands for bipolar
with 8 0 substitution and essentially
what that does is if there is a string
of eight or more zeros it actually
replaces it with a special string and of
course it's going to reverse it on the
other end because it knows that special
string but it's I just find it
fascinating that there are these like
you know intricate rules when we're
talking about t1 signalling that we
don't have to think about you know when
we're talking about our fun you know our
TCP stuff and the other thing that I
found that was interesting when I was
picking up some of this research that I
really hadn't touched since I was like
13 is that there's actually like silence
on a line is represented as all ones I
know that's that's math that's something
you can take home to Grandma or
something you guys are really going to
need to send some feedback on this
particular segment or this series if you
will because I'm fascinated to hear what
you guys think about these discussions I
know that it's not very practical in the
sense that we're talking about how to
you know you know do such-and-such with
backtrack for whatever but you know if
this is something you joy definitely hit
us up feedback a hak5 Dorgan I'd love to
hear what you guys think and dude if you
were like hanging out in pound freaks or
pound 2600 on you know I received a net
back in the 90s
you remember aardwolf dude you know give
me a ring pull my Docs whatever
in come on we yeah our path is probably
crossed and you know it's fun to revisit
some of this old-school freak stuff
that's not necessarily just exploiting
the telephone system it's it's really
just getting intimate with the
technology and having a deeper
understanding of it and in this case the
PSTN but you know time division
multiplexing you will see in so many
other areas and maybe this is something
you guys are interested in seeing more
of we can talk about other types of
multiplexing other types of signaling
and get into more fun electronic stuff
it's really up to you guys this up and
with all of that said whoo I think we
need to take a break
when we get back Shannon's going to help
us wrap it all up as many of you know I
do a lot of IT consulting and I've been
using go to assist expressed exclusively
for the last six months now I've fallen
in love with the software and last time
we talked about how you can easily
reboot a computer instantly get
connected to a computer and transfer
files I figured I would tell you about
some of my other favorite features for
example diagnostics in just one click I
can get a glance at a computer and
understand all the applications that are
installed processes the system set up
the devices what services are going on
with Microsoft Office stuff is installed
it's a real simple way to just glance at
a machine and have an understanding of
what's going on also another neat
feature is the screen sharing
now you might imagine okay it's remote
support of course you can share the
screen you can control their keyboard
and mouse right but it also can work in
Reverse which is great for example if
you have an application on your desktop
that you would like to show them it's
awesome for training in that sense
another thing that I really love and it
might seem really simple is chat I've
been in situations where I've been
tethered to my cell phone for a 3G
connection to get remote support done
well on the road and obviously I
couldn't be on the phone and using the
3G at the same time so the chat feature
is really nice rather than you know
making do with like what opening a
notepad document and going back and
forth or something the also the really
cool key about the chat there is an
abuse this before on like under the
aftermath of a bad patch Tuesday or
something is the ability to do multiple
clients at the same time yes I can have
as many of these support sessions
running as I want and I can just have
between them which is really nice when
it comes to the chat to just have an
idea of what I'm doing with which client
and using the notes feature
to make comments about each of those
clients and what issues they're having
so that I can get those solved quickly
you know that's what go to assist
Express is all about they put the tools
at your fingertips to get the job done
quickly and easily so you can spend the
rest of your time doing more important
things and it's definitely going to cut
down on travel costs and and all those
terrible expenses and the time involved
in all that so I definitely love it and
I highly encourage you guys to check it
out you can get a free 30 day trial if
you go to go to assist com slash hak5
and for that special offer though you do
have to use at the URL again that's go
to assist com /h ak5 if you've got the
time no less like aaron who made his
server tower and very nicely named at
the Learning Lab make sure to email your
photos over to feedback at hack 5 org
and if you have a favorite hacker in
your family make sure to go over to have
