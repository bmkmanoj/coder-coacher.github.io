Jackthreads
as you guys know we are fans of your
feedback so please keep sending those
into feedback a hack five dot org if you
have questions about segments that we've
done here on the show if there's a
segment you'd like us to see doing here
on the show words with chinon Brandon
writes the open source screen recorder
you couldn't think of for windows is
probably camstudio open source it is one
of the most popular and free recording
softwares out there otherwise you have
to pay like three hundred dollars for
techsmith camtasia studio you can find
camstudio over at camstudio org actually
used camstudio they open source version
like in the first and second season of
hack five and back then in like 05 and
06 kind of it was like the only open
source thing around and we're the only
free thing really feasibly for windows
not a huge fan of it maybe it's been
updated since I see there's a two point
O release now a 2.6 betta not really
seeing dates on here but it would be I
don't know I could try it again I'm in
Linux now though so I just use ffmpeg
but but yeah thank you that's the
open-source alternative if you don't
want to go with the free proprietary
stuff which is that blueberry software
we recommended last week it's just a
veterinary thank you John writes hey I'm
a longtime fan of the show in on episode
10 03 Darren ran the motherboard off of
a non-standard connector was it put
together by Darren or is there somewhere
that I can get one as I really need this
for a mobile game server I'm working on
was were there any drawbacks to using
the battery instead of a standard psu so
it's really just a DC power supply for a
computer and this is what it ends up
looking like let me just pull this guy
on the board and this is just your
standard ATX connector here hang up come
here you can get it it does want to come
out now little lever yeah I did
come on that's how you know that it was
me there we go it doesn't want to come
out so this right here is just a DC to
DC power supply and what that's going to
allow you to do is with either a big
power brick like you would have on the
back of the laptop cord or in our case a
battery allow you to power a computer
off of 12 volts so if we were to plug it
into our car we'd be able to do the same
thing the limitations are you're going
to run into with these guys and you can
pretty much pick them up at whatever you
know computer shop you fancy is that I
think this one was 160 wat i haven't
seen really big ones if you're putting
together Twight one of the reasons it is
not a gaming rig and then he sent to the
imagination pop a big honkin video card
in here and this thing's not going to
boot just not enough juice so yeah
that's that's pretty much all you have
to do is go and grab one of these guys
and in you're all set cool next up is
SWE hunter 2000 on youtube he said hey I
need to run a PC from a 12 volt battery
just like you did can you please make a
more in-depth tutorial about how you did
that all right kind of good one with
what we were just talking about all you
need to do is grab one of those and then
one of these this is a 12 volt battery
and this is the actually the other side
of the connector that you would have
found on the back of this guy so what
we've done here actually is the negative
and the positive you can tell because
they are both red no I'm joking um this
one's got a loop but all we have to do
is we tapped into here it's kind of
electric taped up it's not the most
beautiful job this is what the connector
typically looks like like these little
DC to DC power supplies actually end up
coming with kind of like a mini piece mm
sorry a PCI backplane that would allow
you to plug the little DC you know
bullet kind of connector into the back
of that and then when these two guys
meet computer comes on this 12 volt
battery is a 7.2 amp hour battery if you
were drawing 14 amps it would only last
for a half hour so
you know you just got to do the math you
can this is typically used in like
security what are they like video
security stuff like garage doors use
these you can pick up these kind of
batteries at you know a any electronics
store really you could use a big honking
car battery with like you know 20 amps
and 20 amp hours and all that fun stuff
or 200 get some ridiculously big ones I
mean imagine a Wi-Fi pineapple lasting
for 16 days on a single charge what but
you know they really just have to do the
math this guy be honest does not power
this machine for a whole long time not
really all right next up is Mike he
writes I came across this service on my
travels outside the UK for access to I
player it's called free UK VPN com it's
great great for 2 megabits per second
bandwidth which is just enough for
streaming but they don't change but they
changed the password every 12 hours
which is a minor inconvenience for such
a great service I am still using we
topia and you know there's nothing wrong
with those free services when it just
comes to oh I want a VPN to the UK so I
can use the BBC iplayer or whatever it
may be that your attempt to do just keep
in mind and this is really one of these
points where everybody's like oh secure
yourself on a public Wi-Fi but just
using a VPN and really all you're doing
is I mean eventually that connection is
going to be unencrypted at some point in
time when it hits the web server unless
is like SSL and 2n and all you're doing
when you say at like a public Wi-Fi
you're on it unencrypted wireless
network and in you VPN to London and
then from London and comes out
unencrypted and it's like now you've
just moved where that endpoint is where
its unencrypted so that's great that
there are services out there like that
where you can you know use to stream the
BBC iplayer I'm just going to say I
don't know who those people are not like
I you know really know with the wii
topia guys either you just kind of have
to you know ask yourself how much do you
trust that does that source for your
tunnel and i don't know if i'd be
logging into my gmail or anything like
that while using that tunnel so that's
why i like to set up my own VPN servers
on my own like
virtual private servers and you know
dedicated and run it at home next up
which is Jack Clark 1981 on YouTube he
