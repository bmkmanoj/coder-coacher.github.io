the diffie-hellman protocol for crypto
is probably NSA's favorite thing ever
secure all the things with Facebook and
China is hacking the US are we surprised
all that coming from nail on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for October 21st 2015 and by
the way happy back to the future day
this is your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom just a quick reminder that we
are funded by the contributions of our
viewers via patreon over at patreon.com
/ threat wire for that on to the news so
first off drones helicopters
quadricopter 'he's what's going on so
earlier this week the US Department of
Transportation held a press conference
to discuss the coming registration
requirements for the use of small drones
and unmanned aircraft systems or UAS
this would be used in case of any kind
of incidents involving drones so that an
odor can be contacted and accounted for
drone owners would be informed of
regulations for flying as well while no
regulations and rules are completely
developed the d-o-t once then done by
November 20th and is working with the
FAA along with drone and airline
industries to come up with a standard
for regulations and registration some
smaller drones that have a low safety
risk probably like the little hubsan
quad won't require registration some
larger quadcopters will now while we are
currently unsure which models will
correspond with registration we expect
to hear about those by the end of the
year in similar news a website called
the intercept published several
documents pertaining to drone related
killings by the American government many
of which did not kill the intended
target of a strike the documents which
were leaked by a whistleblower explain
how these drone strikes are implemented
and it's a little bit unsettling save a
good afternoon to read the entire
document list but it's definitely worth
it we'll have a link to the entire thing
down in the show notes below
diffie-hellman or d h for short is a
cryptographic protocol used for
exchanging keys online as security for a
communication and it was later followed
by RSA for public key crypto using
asymmetric algorithms now if all of that
sounds a little
using watch the hak5 link below a group
of researchers have released a
presentation explaining how D H fails in
practice due to the fact that about
two-thirds of vpns a quarter of ssh
servers globally use one single common
1024-bit prime number for the encryption
and with NSA's 11 billion dollar per
year budget they could easily crack many
communications if they were just able to
break one prime and since D H only
commonly uses a few primes this would be
well within their reach the researchers
right quote this state of affairs puts
everyone security at risk vulnerability
on this scale is indiscriminate it
impacts everybody security including
American citizens and companies but we
hope that a clear technical
understanding of the cryptanalytic
machinery behind government surveillance
will be an important step towards better
security for everyone they recommend
websites use 2048-bit diffie-hellman
keys and for ssh users to upgrade to the
latest openssh facebook post in an
update on their block this week
announcing that they will alert you if
they believe your profiles being
targeted or is compromised by a
state-sponsored actor and we'll ask if
you'd like to turn on login approvals a
state-sponsored attack could very well
be positioned against a political
opponent protesters journalists or a
person speaking out of line about a
government just to name a few Facebook
does not explain how they know if an
attack is coming from a state sponsor
but they plan to only use this
notification for those specifically they
do explain that a notification like this
could also be due to a compromise
machine such as one with malware whether
you think you could be a target of any
attack on your social network accounts I
highly suggest that you use two-factor
authentication and do turn on login
approvals back on the twenty-fifth of
September an announcement was made that
both the US and China would not conduct
any kind of espionage or commercial
hacks on targets in the alternate
country afterwards in a report by
security firm CrowdStrike it appears
that china-based hackers had continued
to attack technology in pharmaceutical
companies in the US which could be to
steal intellectual property or trade
secrets while it is completely possible
that there could be a time delay between
the acknowledgement of the agreement and
actual implementation they do believe
that these attacks
were due to the same group that was
involved with the OPM breach also
believed to be by a Chinese attacker
this information was posted publicly by
CrowdStrike with a high degree of
confidence that these intrusions were
undertaken by a variety of different
Chinese actors however this information
has not been confirmed so take it with a
grain of salt thanks again to all of our
patrons at patreon calm / threat wire
you are the ones that make this show
possible independent and completely
ad-free the fur baby pictures that you
send in are incredibly cute and awesome
and if you have any new ones please send
them over our way if you want to be a
backer and have your name on the website
over at threat wire net check out
patreon.com / threat wire and with that
I'm Shannon Morse and i will see you on
the internet and yes i said quadricopter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
