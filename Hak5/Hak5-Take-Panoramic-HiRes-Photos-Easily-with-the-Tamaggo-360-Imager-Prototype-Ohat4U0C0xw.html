for hak5 I'm Darrin kitchen here at CES
2012 checking out tamago tamago has this
interesting product here that they're
calling the 360 imager what this guy
does is takes photographs panoramas in
360 degrees very simply with just the
push of a button the operation looks
pretty dead simple what we have here is
an LCD on the back for viewing a photos
and other such information right there a
big huge button and that's it there's a
USB port and many back here to charge
the device to get photos off of the
device you can also get photos off of
the device via bluetooth and Wi-Fi not
sure if it's Wi-Fi Direct Connect or how
they've been able to explain the
mechanics of that this right here is
just a prototype
this is slated to be releasing in a
second quarter of 2012 with a price
point of about $200 now the 360-degree
image is captured in a 14 megapixel JPEG
and what we have here is all done with
this curved optics that basically takes
about a 200 degree field of view so if
you hold it up like over your head and
just click the button you should be able
to get a picture and just flash of a
second there's no mechanics in there to
spin anything around or anything like
that there's no mirrors to stand above
this we've seen some other things from
Kickstarter that clipped your iPhone
that do something very similar but I
think that this is probably targeted to
do it more towards a consumer that's
just looking for an all-in-one device
with a big stupid button that they can
press some other features that it has is
the ability to take in addition to a 360
panorama horizontally but to hold it
vertically you can on either end and
take really long photos so if you're in
front of a building or something like
that you could get a pretty stretched
out image all the way to the top I'm
looking forward to seeing actually how
it is implemented because that's really
what it all comes down to but right now
in the hand it feels great and I'm sure
that it'll find a niche in real estate
and other such events for continued
coverage of CES 2012 go ahead and head
over to revision 3.com /
CES and of course I'd like to thank Ford
for powering our CES coverage break
coach found in the Ford Focus TVs
instrument cluster allows you to
optimize your usage of the car's
regenerative brakes it displays a
graphic that shows how much energy is
captured each time you stop so that you
can make adjustments to maximize your
range thanks to Ford for powering our
CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
