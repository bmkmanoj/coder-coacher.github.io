by domain.com it should come as no
surprise the timeliness of talking about
human interface devices manufacturing
all that fun stuff we just went through
that ourselves and you guys just kind of
started a little small company now huge
customers one of the concerns and it was
actually one of mine as well putting
this together was where do you have it
made and we actually it's way more
expensive too but we had ours made in
the United States we decided to
manufacture 18 Sweden because that's
where our company started going now we
have our team in u.s. most of our team
I'm actually here I just moved to Palo
Alto nice so we decided also to put the
manufacturing in in Sweden because of
the idea so much goes to China so much
from the I mean is so cheap to
manufacture in China why is it not just
so if you may if you have robots that
does it it's cheaper to have it in
Sweden but then you have to invest in
those Roberts because people rub it in
manufacture 10,000 of these per day one
Robert test mold but what did it cost to
build the robot yeah man so yes but so I
i we see that as a long-term investor of
course and the way we have put up the
production there is no handling of the
encryption keys then there's not there's
no secrets in our manufacturer right
thing like some people are concerned
about I mean remember just it was years
ago when the the big story broke about
those uh those knockoff cisco routers
yeah from china that had a little extra
code in them and that's not what you
want when you're talking about an
authentication product is a little extra
code put in there no so a major defense
contractor just recently came to yuba
call and said that they had got
confirmed that they're buying another
token from another large vendor they got
confirmed that they had copies of their
secrets for these 50,000 people in their
staff in in China and in France and you
know it's um it was a concern to them if
you're a good defense country if your
big company you don't want copies of
Secrets anywhere that is out of your
control and we've already realized
now with RS a bridge that r is a could
not keep these secrets in a you know
secure so if you're an enterprise and
really want to control your secrets you
should run your own servers you
shouldn't yeah no I totally Bolivia here
at servers is the way to go the and you
guys make it easy actually because you
support radius which is kind of an open
standard for setting up a fennec ation
how do how do people get the radius
server going from you guys though yeah
we have a range of open source
components and to make it easy for our
customers we put them together in a
virtual appliance so we have a
enterprise-class open source software
actually both built on open source
components like so it's like a red hat
with a this not built on top no yes
built on Whitman and my squirrel and
your you know some there you don't have
to sit there setting up all of those
demands you guys go and get a vmdk and
we have customers that we're up and
running in two hours with it Wow and and
they've replaced our legacy
authentication tokens with its solution
and they just buy the key from us and
the software is open source and the good
thing with open sores is they can
scrutinize it we were not gonna
presenting a black box you know what you
call its make oil thing oh yeah it's
very secure you have to trust that no it
open source is where it's at you always
find more creativity comes through and
you end up seeing like weird stuff that
you never would have even expected way
at a left field they're like dude great
stuff so I commend you guys for going
that route that's awesome that you make
just go to website download your the
radius virtual appliance you could be up
in a couple of hours I I do see some
caveats here net its then I think part
of this is the just as as computing
matures and as like we realize like wow
that old model of just having a username
and a password is really pathetic it's
it's been a long time coming but with
all of the different avenues of you know
two-factor authentication I know that
Gmail or Google is doing it for all of
their Google applications i use a
smartphone app to get a six digit key
that i have to type in when I get on my
gmail there's a lot of complexity to
like do I trust that smartphone app what
if my phone gets routed you know I think
having a smartphone app is better than
username password but it could also be
worse because it's not super secure and
it could give a false sense of security
because if it's hack you don't know if
it's act it's not like a topi that's one
thing we're kind of at a very
interesting point in like a fundamental
thing that's been a mainstay of
computing and that is authentication and
we're a part here where you know RSA and
so many other vendors you guys come in
and and people are like in Gmail or
Google like you know being a proponent
of this and so many people are realizing
like oh yeah well maybe we shouldn't
just you know take security for granted
as like so many Hollywood you know
celebrities are finding out in the final
and big media I don't know whether they
latch on to that stuff and not the
actual real interesting stuff but anyway
point being this is kind of like a time
we're like the birth of all of these
different forms of the ten occation is
really important that they're done right
so that we're not left with like you
said a false sense of security and then
ten years down the road we take for
granted some you know USB key that we
plug in to login or some you know
rfid-based system or whatever it may be
yeah I think it's really important to
look at the total chained the whole life
cycles if you're really concerned you
should see you know where you know the
process of how the secrets are created
and where they're created where they're
stored and and how they're secured and
having a hardware is always more secure
than the software is so much more
complex though it just a username and a
password so my vision is that these open
identity initiatives really take off
maximal and open ID because that will
enable one key all internet and then the
complexity is lower because then you
have you know leave key to your bike to
your house into your internet yes i love
that although the difference here is if
i steal the key to your bike i now have
access to your bike but if i steal your
Yubikey i don't have access you have we
combine it oh I always come by I always
recommend all customers to combine it
with a pin or a password but that
doesn't have to be very complex it could
be afford to do pin just like an ATM but
is this that much more it's not just
like oh I got your hash and then a
reverse
and I've got your password it's you know
I love that you guys bring something
that that makes it really easy for
people to add some layers of security
and I think that any layer of security
that you can add reasonably should be
implemented uh what about what about
though I see some caveats here where I
want to log in to XYZ web application
through my smartphone my smart friend
doesn't have a USB port except the
keyboard type something in so we are
working on solutions on that that I'd be
happy for you know to tell you in a next
podcast okay and everything yeah so even
people who were interested to follow
what we do they can sign up to our
newsletter or Twitter and we'll be happy
to tell your brother you know we're
working on really cool things well it is
a really cool thing in people you know
must wonder obviously it provides a
robust level of security but how secure
is the device itself I'm saying like if
that thing gets run over goes through
the wash am i screwed yeah so we have
this beautiful story from our geek
community that have told us that they
they pro got it in their pocket and went
through the washing machine and through
the laundry and survived but the best
story is actually from a scuba diver who
had to challenge me when I said he was
waterproof okay he had to take it down
48 meters down in the back of the Red
Sea sure and and and he sent me a photo
where he said here is my yubikey I would
like what the next is neither of his
depth gauge or whatever but he came up
and said yes it worked and we also had
another it was a developer at the
University who said um I realized my
yubikey was gone when I my wife told me
that our dog I did along with my
homework wait the dog ate it like they
retrieved it yeah and and luckily both
the dog and the Yubikey survived a big
you Vicky worked I'm not gonna go into
detail ow it love your dog it works all
right yes I me have the other vendors
but we have the dog test we have the
scuba diver tears I should be a test
from Allen has your server has your
hardware appliance been through the dog
seen it it's a pleasure talking with you
I thank you so much for coming out to
the studio it's great that your bear
yeah I just wanted two into one thing we
have a an offer for your community today
well that's the thing is they can go out
right now and check out the virtual
appliance and get started go with the
last pattern you can go on to the store
that you be khou.com and we will provide
all your listeners a coupon code nice
and if you'd a hack on it they put in
hack 540 at 5 40 you will get forty

thank you well you guys isn't just a bit
no it seems to be something more like
straight forward by USB rubber ducky
calm no it should be more hardcore like
wait tactical saltdogs car I'm leaning
towards programmable human interface
device calm absolutely got is that you
typing Kirby Kirby well no matter what
your project is domain com has what you
need to register host and promote your
next big idea even if it's for good comm

don't forget when you think domain names
think domain.com now of course it's time
for the nipple and Henrik he writes in
to say when I'm doing some server
tweaking configuration I always have to
restart the service hundreds of times
just to see the results of the action
and instead of typing in the whole thing
for example he writes / @ t / our CD /
httpd
restart to restart like your apache
server he just does control are types
restart and hit enter he says that
control our lets you search through your
already typed commands and i'll go ahead
and do that here control are like type
restart and you can see that I've done /
at CRC 0d my networking restart and boom
I don't have to type that whole command
because I've already typed it once that
is an awesome tip send yours over to
hack five dot org slash nibble get some
schwag
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
