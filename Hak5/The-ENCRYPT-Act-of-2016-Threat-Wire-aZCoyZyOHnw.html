the IRS website is not a malware bot is
taking over androids and bitcoins are
being stolen all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for February 17
2016 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
patrons be on the lookout for a new
security episode by Darren kitchen it
will be on the patron feed by the end of
the month if you want early access to
extras check out our patreon page at
patreon.com / threat wire onto the
stories the encrypt act of 2016 is being
introduced to Congress by a couple of
Representatives Ted Leo a Democrat from
California and Blake Farenthold a
Republican from Texas on Wednesday of
this week this act short for ensuring
national constitutional rights for your
private Telecommunications Act could
keep states like California and New York
from blocking the sales of encrypted
phones which both of the states are
currently trying to do now obviously
some law enforcement officials like FBI
director James Comey are against the use
of heavy encryption on phones others
such as representative Ted Leo once you
ensure privacy rights of the American
people the encrypt act of 2016 would
quote remove a state's ability to one
design or alter the security functions
in its product or service to allow the
surveillance of any user of such product
or service or to allow the physical
search of such product by any agency or
instrumentality of a state a political
subdivision of a state or the United
States or to have the ability to decrypt
or otherwise render intelligible
information that is encrypted or
otherwise rendered unintelligible using
its products or service since the Act
would cover computer hardware software
and electronic devices and online
services this would be a really big leap
forward for privacy advocates like us is
nothing sacred well if they didn't learn
last year that they are a target the
second time has a seriously shaking our
heads the IRS electronic filing pin
application site on IRS gov was hit with
a series of automated attacks last month
according to a report
februari ninth no personal data was
stolen and the data used to gain access
to pens was stolen in an external breach
I'm going to make an educated guess here
that the SS ends were probably from the
health insurance hacks last year or the
OPM hack or maybe even both 464 thousand
Social Security numbers were attempted
and 101,000 succeeded on the IRS website
the IRS is notifying affected users via
mail and they are flagging their
accounts for extra protection
researchers at Heimdall security have
discovered a malware that is targeting
Android phones by way of SMS and MMS
messages the text simply tell the target
that they received a multimedia message
and to follow the link to view the
message the link takes them to an APK
file which when run will gain admin
rights and access to do many things such
as send SMS is read and receive SMS ah's
make calls erase the entire phone and
many more little issues so the malware
dubbed mazhar bot or maze our bot can
also give a hacker backdoor access to
the phone and allow them to implement a
man-in-the-middle attack to protect
yourself from the malware don't click on
suspicious links on your phone via SMS
or mms turn off unknown sources allow
installation of apps for from sources
other than the Play Store which is in
the settings you can also download
antivirus but this one is fairly new so
it hasn't been fully vetted by antivirus
apps as being malicious as of yet you
can also keep your Wi-Fi off which we
always recommend install a VPN and be
very strictly cautious almost 900
Bitcoin wallets have been targeted in an
ongoing attack thats stolen 103 thousand
dollars worth of bitcoin so far how was
this money stolen the targets used
memorized passwords that were sent in
plain text through one single hash
iteration of sha-256 basically meaning
it wasn't encrypted very well so
basically it was easy to crack so bring
wallets use passwords instead of 64-bit
generated private keys and because of
that lack of salting the hashed
encryptions were very quick to break
into in a paper that will be presented
later this month at the financial
cryptography and data security
conference 2016 researchers used 300
billion potential passwords against
brain wallets in
attempt to crack them most wallets were
drained in just minutes some within
seconds so if you're a current Bitcoin
wallet owner it is advised to use a
properly salted cryptographic key
instead of a brain wallet password for
your Bitcoin early access to show
summaries behind-the-scenes pictures and
daring kitchen security videos it's all
available for patrons at patreon calm /
threat wire plus when we hit our next
goal we will make an RSS feed I know you
guys want one so we're trying to get
there as fast as we can now if you are
already a patron thank you so much for
supporting us our show is independent
and ad free because of your help and if
you are a hushpuppy contributor like
these send us a pic of your furry
friends because we love to see your pet
pals they are adorable we enjoy them and
I hope that they are as in touch with
security as we are and you can find all
of our episodes links to our social
networks and other ways to contribute
all over at threat wire net with that I
am Shannon Morse and i will see you on
the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
