webcam all weighing in at three and a
half pounds with a 3-cell battery asus
was also showing off their Express gate
technology which allows you to browse
the web and play digital media with this
mere five second boot time featured was
this p5q lem core two main board in this
m4m 72 AMD phenom athlon sempron
mainboard as three out of four hack
house residents use aussies main boards
we're excited to see this technology
come to the mainstream however we know
that many hobbyists can get similar
functionality now with their existing
main boards with coreboot formerly linux
BIOS nvidia announced their 3d vision
for chief wars these wireless glasses
offer stereo 3d in combination with an
ir transmitter and nvidia software
they'll work with both 120 Hertz LCDs
and dlp HDTV while stereoscopic glasses
aren't anything new once that don't
cause migraines are or if the 200 bucks
maybe toshiba had water-resistant
technology on display
like this water resistant Internet
viewer couple it with a set of HD
goggles and we're ready to start hacking
under the sea Sony must have been
pondering what would happen if one of
those short fatty ipod nanos in a
macbook air got freaky with this one the
sony vaio vgn p500 is the proverbial
purse PC with an 8-inch screen
integrated 3g and gps instant on linux
boot and for colored options the 1600 x
800 resolution display really stands out
in at 1.4 pounds and won't be weighing
you down but the 800 to 1400 dollar
price point might toshiba spatial motion
interface lets you flail your arms about
without the need for mo control
equipment the IR sensor and motion
recognition technology translates your
gestures into navigation input they
claim into it we clean neat technology
but not so practical application Itachi
was also in the game at gesture remote
control does this prototype look super
intuitive a minute you look fabulous
waving your hands up out in front of
your TV sony was showing off their new

Sonnen claims the resolution to be
comparable to 1080p at 40 inches neat
technology but tweet me when it's
available at 40 inches the msi x 320
notebook is a macbook air competitor
ringing in at 2.8 pounds with the four
cell battery and acclaimed five hour
battery life it even sports ethernet vga
in more than one USB port the new USB 3
AKA USB SuperSpeed spec which was
recently finalized in november was on
display and actually demoed the
theoretical max of USB 3 is about 5
gigabits per second on the show floor we
are seeing results of about 250 5
megabytes a second I'm very early
Harvard unlike with USB one in USB 2
there is a new connector however the
host device is still compatible with USB
to the ebox be 202 is a 1l sized

adam let me ask you a question we just
got done playing the ion drum set for
rock band now it's a pretty pricey piece
of hardware it for you know what did
what would be termed a game controller
um who is the drum set made for well
it's actually made for die hard rock
band players it really elevates the
level of playing drums in the game to
something a lot more akin to what a real
drummer would would do the other nice
thing about the kit in addition to
learning how to play by basically
putting your hands in the right places
is that you can actually graduate from
playing video games actually playing the
real drum set you can actually take the
game controller module off of drum
rocker replace it with one of a number
of different you know professional drum
brands and turn it into a real
profession electronic drum set so when
you compare it to other profession
electronic drum sets it's actually
extremely inexpensive so you guys didn't
start by doing this correct you've
you've done professional drums stuff for
how many years now oh we've been doing
it for probably six or seven years now
we have a sister company called alesis
which has a lot of play in the
professional audio and musical
instrument markets and alesis is
actually the third largest manufacturer
of electronic percussion products in the
world so we've been doing electronic
drums for quite some time we took that
expertise and applied it to the gaming
space with drum rocker for rock band too
so how long does this I mean this this
looks like a very involved complicated
setup how hard is it and how much time
can a person expect
because you want to get out there and
you want to start playing how long is it
going to take for somebody to set this
up and how easy is it to like take down
you know it's actually very easy to set
up it takes probably about 45 minutes
the first time you set it up they can be
folded in because everything is
completely adjustable so if you need to
for example fold it in for storage you
can fold the side wings in and store it
out of the way pretty easily once you
set it up you're then going to want to
take a little bit of time to adjust it
the kid is fully adjustable like any
real drum set would be so a player will
want to go ahead and fine tune it to the
way that they like to play so that
that'll take a little bit more time for
them to do but once it's set up you can
tighten everything down and you never
have to move it again this is an amazing
kit it when you pull it when I played it
it it feels solid I mean it is solid so
many of the you know peripherals are
obviously just plastic do you guys have
any intention of doing anything other
than drums or is that pretty much it
you're going to stick to what you know
now you know we've done a lot of
controllers in the music instrument
market not only drums but also where we
do DJ stuff we do a variety of other
things so we'll continue to expand the
offerings that we have in the gaming
market just as we have a musical
instrument market so look for more from
on in the future so rather than lugging
around a whole bunch of chargers and
everything technology called a coupled
from Fulton allows you to basically do
wireless power charging devices like
your cell phone or in this utility truck
things as big as power tools it's pretty
simple it's basically just a coil I know
I make it sound so simple it's not
really there's a coil in here there's a
coil on the charger right there I pop it
in light turns green the trap is clean
Michael is telling me about the new
ebike from Schwinn bicycles I just did a
demo next door in the next room and it
was so much fun I almost broke my neck
because I kind of engaged on a turn and
you'll tell me what it engages so we
know but once I got the hang of it it
was awesome so tell me about this ebike
this is the brand new schwinn tailwind
the fastest charging electric bike in
the world and uses toshiba s CIB
technology and it's a pedal assist bike
so while you peddle the power assists
you in three power settings and get you
where you need to go so how long does it
take for one of these batteries to
charge that is a great question the
charge time for this battery is 30
minutes and the industry standard is
three to four hours
so with our battery 30 minutes a full
charge yeah that's definitely a lot
better than that so um where is this
battery the battery and it is mounted in
the the rear of the rack and then very
easily to remove in charge and this what
gets you going and how many charges
would I get out of one of these
batteries the charges that you get on
this battery is roughly at minimum two
thousand and we're looking at a max
about 6,000 industry standard is 500
1000 so significantly longer charge
cycles yep the minimum of two thousand
charge cycles is just under three years
so that it with a maximum of six years
I'm sorry 6,000 charge cycles is almost
nine years of charging let's hope I
don't break my neck again it is a
bicycle you have to pedal for the power
to be engaged once you stop pedaling the
power stops but it assists you with what
you need if you need to get up a hill if
you're tired into the ride with three
adjustable power settings it really
gives you the power that you need your
personal need to assist you on your ride
okay so last thing is it available right
now it is available it's currently
available and we're shipping to
authorize Schwinn dealers in the US and
how much is it it is 3,200 dollars

you made a very interesting observation
on the way Paul plays drums what is Paul
doing wrong flat office he's doing it
wrong but he's actually using his left
foot to play kick drum always playing
the rest of the kid right handed so it's
kind of a unique approach kind of a
Hendricks esque approach to playing
drums damn it he had to go with a cool
analogy all right so I'm here with a
venir the founder creator of boxing and
love you dog after we cover boxing
before on the show we loved it our users
absolutely loved it what are some of the
other things that you guys are bringing
to the boxee application so not just to
Lou about netflix mtv juice the BBC
iplayer CBS comedy central so a bunch of
content sources for our users and the
goal is to try and bring as much as
possible so boxy becomes a real
alternative for cable now why did you
guys choose to use the XBMC project as
your base instead of I mean was it just
that good or instead of creating your
own that was the reason we started boxes
because we were users of XBMC it's
clearly the best media center out there
and as users and fans who always wanted
to take you to the next level and we
approached these guys two years ago told
them what we want to do and got really
friendly and started working together
and contributing code back to each other
and boxy came out so there was no
question no XBMC no boxing XBMC recently
announced that they added Netflix was
that because of you guys or did they do
their own kind of cogeneration on that
unrelated to us unrelated to you okay
what's the business model behind boxy I
mean you guys have to make money somehow
somehow sometime do you have any idea on
how or when yeah we have ideas we have
Excel sheets but 2009 the XL 200 so
we're pretty sure you're going to meet
that target so 2009 is draw the user
base from about a hundred thousand that
it is today
came to a million users and if we get to
a million users we believe we can start
monetizing it so if we can go to hulu
and netflix and amazon tell them listen
yeah we're driving some serious traffic
away you know maybe share some of that
love we think there's some dollars there
and we think some of the device makers
are going to get excited and want to
bring boxy to those devices and these
are big rich companies maybe they can
share a few dollars that way as well now
we use Apple TV for our boxy you know
hardware there have been some problems
with like Hulu and some of the flash
like HD you know stuff like that is
there any time that we can expect the
Apple TV version to be as powerful or is
it just not strong enough it's probably
never going to be as powerful as a mac
mini dual-core you know but the flesh
actually is working better so if you try
out to Lou now which is actually going
to work pretty sweet and we're comes in
trying to improve it but it's it's a
battle because it's a 1 gigahertz
machine 256 Meg's of memory it's just
not powerful enough when can we expect a
windows release of boxing today today so
it's still in closed alpha but we're
releasing thousands of invites every
week now for Windows and hopefully open
it up very soon so today we open it up
for Mac and Linux and Apple TV and
Windows is going into private alpha mode
hopefully within a couple of months it's
going to be open all right after thanks
so much avner the CEO and creator of
boxee an application we love and we know
that you guys love it as well so we're
here at show stoppers at CES and I found
a rat shank auriga's hi you're dramatic
my favorite my favorite lab rat yay
thank you except for bitten boo it's a
fair cop so big news with okay so lab
rats TV if you didn't know okay follow
along and now lab rats TV is working
where can we find it now cuz it's doing
some cool stuff yes we have actually
moved it over to butterscotch calm
butter crotch I love it where can we
find that
I heard what you said that's not quite
true a snack way to butterscotch com
it's a division of tucows corporation so
we're still doing lab rats TV as always
the contents also appearing on
butterscotch but we're also doing
tutorials and you know I know you guys
own noobs we helped noobs okay so so
what are the rat cows do to help noobs
they move a lot no you guys you guys
started at IP TV network that's freakin
phenomenal so what's on the network well
we've got a few shows one of them is
actually called the noob so we explain
basic technology a little bit of history
so did you know that the most was the
original mouse was a wooden box I did
not know that invented in the 60s I'm
the best Watson ever i'm just going to
say i don't know any of that okay well
very good bring out some of these little
bits of you know trivia and then explain
how the things work inside so that you
know your mom or your grandma or
whatever you want to know what a mouse
is and here it is all in captured my
cell things so even people that know a
little bit about technology or the
enthusiasts hopefully we'll learn
something about it too also we have a
new show with our good friend amber Mac
called the a-list it's all viral video
all the time we have again lab rats is
on there we have on deck which is Matt
Harris's behind the scenes show it is a
week a chunker others and walkers Matt
Harris amber McCarthy I mean who are we
missing here we are you get basil we got
basil did you really get basil no
unfortunately basile will be awesome
though yeah you need to get him on the
noob show that would be great well we'll
get them I know I'm gonna make the call
just as soon as we're done here
seriously if if you're Canadian or if
you just ended up getting the torrents
for call for help this is the next
generation right it is we're actually
going to get everyone that was ever
involved with g for canada onto our IP
TV network i love it i commend you good
sir as brothers in our podcasts that
have now moved to networks because
they're fun yeah that's good anything
else what are you doing a CS walking a
lot getting yeah who is it it seen
anything that i haven't already
yes okay what was it not telling you how
tall was she about six foot three cool
well um well he pulls out his iphone and
shows me pictures we're going to throw
it to the next thing that's not listed
this is the a40 headset and this is the
a40 mixamp right here together these are
the official headset official audio
system for the MLG pro circuit this is
what the professional halo player
professional gears players use on the
the mix amps these mix amps when you
plug them into each other give you a
private voice communication network it
also gives each player their individual
game sounds in surround sound in their
individual headset and the other thing
that it does is it gives the MLG kind of
audio feed for all the players so when
you're watching that voice on the game
mount game on demand you can hear all
their team chat and get their strategies
and hear what happened right right when
it's happening this rack takes the place
of the daisy chain connector essentially
for up to five players or four players
plus a coach as they normally normally
play with the the rack is called the the
prorack and this is what you'd see if
you went up to a MLG Pro station at an
event so the players just take their
headset and plug it into the prorack
they're instantly connected with
surround sound and they've got their
voice communication network all set up
now at home we don't usually play with
five other people we're just playing by
ourselves over say xbox live or on PC
well at home it does the same thing but
with xbox live voice communication you
can plug your controller into the front
of this and it combines your surround
sound with your voice communication all
into one and with the balance control
you can discreetly balance exactly how
much voice to game that you want so how
is the base on these things it's really
good because it's a it's a two channel
set up all the surround technologies
done in the mixamp this has got a big
big basie driver gives you a very flat
signal it's not too heavy though because
when you know if you're a gamer you
might know that you need that that mid
bass sound to determine what where the
where the action is coming from and
somebody's behind you you're not going
to know exactly where they are if it's
like really Basie really deep down it's
got to be kind of a mid-range sound for
you to tell
coming from so these aren't really like
wrap headphones they're very flat so you
can tell exactly where people are coming
from when you're gaming are these coming
out anytime soon or are they already out
yeah we launched these in May of 2007
and they've really swept the tournaments
they use them at blizzcon they use them
for all the engineering at bungee and
they obviously are the official headset
of the MLG and basically we started out
kind of slow at MLG but in the middle of
the season you know some some of the
teams that we're winning and then and
all the teams at one we're using them
and then by the end of the championship
all the teams use them so how much are
they these are 199 for the headset the
mixamp is 129 but if you get them
together we call the a40 audio system we
knock off 80 bucks and we saw it four to
forty nine ninety five
so snubs what do you think at the end of
it I love it this is awesome there's so
many video games here maybe you want to
see the like the rest to see yes I have
to just let me kill let me kill one more
guy just one more headshot please this
might take a while
come on we're gonna keep going
