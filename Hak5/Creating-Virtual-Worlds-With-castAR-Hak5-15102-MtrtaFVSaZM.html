by goto assist and now we are back with
Missa jeri ellsworth also from technical
illusions with the hardware side of cast
AR I'm Jerry thanks for having me on I'm
so happy that you're here
I haven't seen you in ages it's been
forever I think last time I saw you was
with the the purse oh we didn't in no
purse yeah crazy inventions all the time
all the time no wait it was the it was
the light bulb yeah the one that reads
your brainwaves that's so cool I haven't
compared carriers that read my
brainwaves oh I love those necomimi yeah
they're exciting maybe I should wear
those for Halloween so we've heard about
the software side of the cast AR but I
really wanted to get a feel of how the
hardware works and how you got the idea
for this I heard a little bit about how
you found this reflective oh yeah just
sitting around somewhere it was a total
fluke running into this this property I
was working on an ear to eye display
it's a display that puts light directly
into your eye so I had a bench mounted
system that had a projector and a bunch
of optics and a beam splitter and I put
the beam splitter in backwards so it was
projecting out into the room instead of
into my eye and I was looking into this
thing and like I can't see anything but
off in the distance I could see this
beautiful image I'm like what's going on
what's going on I tracked it down to
this retro reflective material and then
I discovered that it solves all of these
issues that you have with near to eye
displays like there's often issues folks
have with a display so close their eyes
they have eyestrain sometimes it induces
nausea and by putting the image way out
into the distance projecting from the
glasses out to the surface and bouncing
it back makes it a very comfortable
experience like looking at a monitor
because your eyes yeah your eyes are
converging at the right distance and
focusing at the right distance at all
times no matter where you move around
the surface I actually tried the one of
the other products out there the oculus
rift and when I went up some stairs in
the video that I was testing it with I
got so sick my I just felt nauseous when
I went up the stairs it was like vertigo
and my brain and I had to take them off
so this fixes that problem so the retro
reflective material fixes kind of the
eye strain
problem but another aspect of our
hardware is a super accurate head
tracking system so we we made a sub
millimeter accurate head tracker that
can track your head position throughout
a full 3d volume so you can move
sideways you can get in close you can
move backwards and it's so accurate that
if you move your head a couple
millimeters to the side the computer can
render the correct video of a couple
millimeters of movements and you don't
get this confliction between inner ear
movement and what you're seeing so like
when you're on a boat for instance
people get ill because the horizon is
moving but it doesn't feel like you're
moving and stuff in your inner ear has
problems and that's part of the problem
with some of these other VR X's they
don't have a great tracking system it
could induce nausea
yeah that's happened with me before now
when I was testing this earlier I
noticed that it only works with the
reflective surface and you can you can
only see things if you're wearing the
glasses or if you're like directly
behind somebody yeah so it's it's
directing light directly up yes there's
two projectors that project out to the
surface a stereo image and it bounces
back they're running at 120 Hertz for
production we're going to 720p
projectors the one that you experienced
was standard def yeah and but it's still
look great right yeah even though
because that 3d image and it was very
clever II where you look where the
material is you get new pixels so it
seems like you have a display that's
just like unlimited a number of pixels
out there especially when you add the
material we also developed an ear eye
display adapter you know if you're
accustomed to that kind of having a
display close to your eyes you can yeah
click it on to the glasses and there's a
bunch of freeform optics inside of here
that takes the projections bounces
around and directs it back to your eye
so it is convertible you so you can do
three different types of operations so
with this adapter you can do the
experience without the surface
personally I like the surface because
you don't have any worries about you -
yeah I I'm envisioning myself sticking
this the surface all over the room so
that I have like a complete 360-degree
video game that I can play yeah so along
with the head track
we supply tracking squares which have
infrared LEDs on them they're just a
little square that has an arrangement of
LEDs what are those for those are what
the glasses triangulate your head
position and so if you want to have a
large volume of space where you can move
around and you just put these tracking
squares so the glass is always always
can see them there's about a 110 degree
field of view on our current prototypes
so as you move your head you need to
have these markers so that you can read
a degree yeah we have a lot of other
exciting peripherals that we made for it
also we really think yeah we think that
board gaming is going to be huge with
this so you roll out the mat on your
table you have stereoscopic 3d images
popping out of little characters so we
we built an rfid grid that can go
underneath the surface and it has pickup
coils every inch or so in here and then
we can measure the RF signal strength
off of inexpensive these are like five
cent high tags we cut them down and with
centimeter accuracy we can figure out
where you're putting a figurine so you
slap one of these on the bottom your
figurine put it down and the computer
can know where your figurine is and you
can play D&amp;amp;D type games you put this on
it playing card games or a board game
through VR and we've also developed a
high precision rfid base that can go on
miniatures and other things that gives
you bi-directional communication from
the figurine so you can put buttons on
it so you put it down put it down you
have like several buttons on here like a
tack mode or defense mode yeah
we also envision well you can also send
messages to this microcontroller on here
and so we see things like you could make
remote-control cars that you send
messages from the computer and you could
drive it around the surface and since
we're tracking the position the computer
will know where the car is keep it from
falling off this table the table yeah
and you can with the glasses of course
you can render a terrain yeah
that your cars driving through and it's
kind of a fun application our next
generation of hardware yes it's 720p per
eye and that's what all this is the
prototypes you saw has this huge control
box has like eight chips in it and we
were able to shrink it down to one FPGA
chip that does
the vision for the head-tracking drives
all the displays does all the
communication of the PC so it's digital
video and HDMI DVI and then a USB
connection out Wow
and then 720p projection panels these
little guys or 720p and what's exciting
about this is all the work is done in
this this custom chip so we're moving
towards cell phone support so you can
hook we're looking at Android support so
how before now there was no way to
process image data on cell phones fast
enough yeah through a USB connection
there's just not a pipeline that big so
we only send like 80 to 70 to bytes or
something down and cell phones offloaded
of all that work that's Sophia so say I
want to be able to you know I'm gonna
support your Kickstarter and I get the
glasses in which we just got we just
reached our funding goal today yes it's
not over we we set our goal to the point
where Rick and I could ship product but
we don't have a lot of resources to do
organ ama kick extra games and stuff so
we have new stretch goals that we've
added so cool we reach the next level
we're gonna ship a DND dungeon builder
they can use our magic wand I didn't
talk about what is the why the wand is
essentially a handle with one of the
tracking cameras on it and an analog
stick and a couple buttons we can also
track your hand position in this 3d
space so so can I like interact with
things on the board
exactly so if you have a rendered
character you can reach out and it's so
precise that you can just touch the
pixels that are being rendered there and
you click on them you can move around so
the d dungeon builder really it's
exciting because it works with both the
wand and the rfid grid so if you only
have this our our package that has the
wand you can use it to digitize your
your D&amp;amp;D characters position you go
click on it and but you can play
remotely with other players with this so
wow I put my figurine down I click on it
with the wand and avatar shows up across
the country with my friends and playing
with they
put their figurines down they might have
the RFID grid and it's just as easy as
putting it down it figures out that
they've tapped down there that's and
then it shows up as avatars on my table
and then I can look around the table in
3d I can move around yeah and I see the
right perspective so I'll see the
backside of an example if you're wearing
the glasses and I am on your side you're
going to see his face on my side I'll be
just saying you know his sword and he's
back exactly and that's the property of
this material also yes that it's so
directional the light that hits it
bounces directly back to each user so if
I'm looking at the surface I'm
projecting the stereo image out it's
coming back to me
yeah and then you would be wearing a
pair of glasses you'd be projecting your
own image and you no one no one can see
what we're seeing because it's all
coming back we're seeing completely
different images from well from
different yes oh and I should mention
this material is really inexpensive too
it's it's used for safety gear they sew
it on to safety equipment and it's
washable and it's in in bulk it's just a
few dollars per square meter so let's
let's take these outside and find some
of those bikers that are wearing this
reflective material project on the
project on that sounds so fun now where
can people go to support the campaign
and should get their own okay so our
projects called cast AR so you could
search Kickstarter for that our company
name is technical illusions so you can
find a technical illusions comm
excellent there's where can people find
more about you Wikipedia or just the
Googler
yeah I have a lot of projects out there
if you want to take a look at all my
goofy projects that I do like the light
bulb thing we're trying yeah great thank
you so much Jerry is there anything else
that you would like to inform us about
with your projects oh boy I'm sure I
forgot something but to check out the
Kickstarter and you'll see all of you oh
yeah I'm definitely planning on
supporting it I can't wait well thank
you so much Jerry thank you sir to have
you over here again and we'll be right
back after a quick break
I know how it is working in IT it means
constantly jumping from one problem to
the next and everything of course needs
to be solved past every minute counts I
mean you can't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data
entry that's why I use go to assist

us a photo of his Technol us equipped
with a Wi-Fi pineapple mark for a rubber
ducky and so much more
including his awesome laptop thank you
so much for your support Jermaine I can
obviously tell that you're a hack shop
fan and you can send your photos over to
feedback at hak5 org if you want us to
show them in future shows just put the
subject line as Technol as so we can
find them
well that about wraps up this week's
episode of hack by hi how are you you
just really like portals don't you all
the frames all the frames so anyway the
hack shop yeah I wanted to introduce our
newest product oh that's the place where
they can support us directly you guys
support directly every time you purchase
from the hack shop keeps this thing
going with the free education for the
hacker community and it's awesome
because you were gonna mention this yeah
Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5 so he can dance
you think I like to do this whenever I
see him there you go yeah yes yeah
horns up very exciting so you can get
your own Mark 5 over at hack shop calm
and also of course we value your
feedback so email us all the time all
your emails over at feedback at hack 5
org do you just set up a gmail rules so
that it just sends everything you get to
be back you know why not I don't think
you should prism NSA gov oh and don't
forget that you can find all the way to
follow so over a hack 5 org slash follow
that's where you can find the links all
the social networks and things of that
nature to time doing crazy stuff and I
think that's about it for this week is
that absolutely is returning next week
for a fantastic episode of your big lado
