were diving into the intricacies of the
public switched telephone networks with
pulse amplitude modulation and pull code
modulation this episode of hack five is
brought to you by domain.com got a great
idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
comm freshbooks online invoicing and go
to assist express support smarter with
go to assist Express hello and welcome
to hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
this is your weekly dose of technical
lesson man do we have a great show for
you guys because between this week and
next we have a suite series a series I'm
something that is so near and dear to my
heart but before we get to that I think
we do need to do a little bit of life
update and get you guys clued in on all
things hack 5 right because this is an
odd season which means every other we we
roll into the holidays and as such
things get a little strange with
scheduling and stuff like that so I just
want to let you know hold tight because
they may not be hour-long shows but we
do have some fantastic topics this next
week being one of those so a little bit
more on the left update side here's
what's going on with me I'm flying back
this week to Virginia for Thanksgiving
holiday here in the States and I'm going
to be driving my Volkswagen back over to
the San Francisco Bay Area
while Josette and I are having a great
time riding you know Jesus named my bike
well we're riding all over here in the
SF Bay area it's getting a little cooler
and I don't mind that but the rain is
definitely an issue not that I have a
problem riding in the rain but people
here seem to not know how to drive in
the rain and I don't like to be on the
highway with them when they're freaking
out so that's that I'm looking forward
to getting my car looking forward to
going back to to Williamsburg Virginia
and seeing some friends Paul's going to
be there so I'm looking forward to
seeing Paul and yeah that's what's going
on there and seems that on my way back
I'll be stopping
no Missouri and picking up kirby I know
longtime viewers in fact about Nobu
Kirby is she's my little furry companion
named after Kerberos the handshake
authentication protocol and she's going
to be here with me in the Bay Area it's
gonna be so pretty get the kitty back
but you guys didn't tune in to find out
about me driving across the country or
sniffing Wi-Fi while I'm doing that or
picking up a cat you want to know about
this week's techni list and as I said
near and dear to my heart we are talking
about phone phreaking yeah so the phone
hacking scene been going on since the
60s and well when I got into it in the
90s everything was all digital but
there's still a lot of fun to be had and
know right off the bat we are not
talking about how to get free long
distance I mean really with voice over
IP and everything free phone calls is
like the last of your concerns in fact
when I get into phone phreaking well
that may have been in the lore at the
very beginning I was really just
fascinated with the public switched
telephone network and there's something
really cool about especially at a very
young age I mean we're talking like you
know 12 13 14
getting intimately familiar with things
like pulse amplitude modulation pulse
code modulation time division
multiplexing and things like that and
that's exactly what we're going to be
talking about this week and next so
figured out let's break it down right
now I say when I got into all of this
everything was digital right but it
wasn't always so and I figured why don't
we just go ahead and talk about analog
so that we can totally respect where
we've come how far we've come in and the
digital the digital pots that we live in
now P OTS plain old telephone system
alright we're just going to define
acronyms on the fly so I have right here
a handset this is actually one made by
hair striking and very similar to one of
the ones that I may have obtained when I
was a lot younger we can pick up one of
these off eBay for like 40 bucks or so
and this is really just the the
commercial equivalent of a beige box
you've got your tip in your ring you can
use it to plug it into a telephone box
you get a dial 10 you call China you
have fun but how does all all happen
right so let's just break it down when I
actually speak into this microphone here
I'm doing is I'm making a metal
diaphragm that's got carbon fiber or
carbon bits in it vibrates and what that
does is it produces a waveform right it
actually creates some resistance on the
electrical signal that's going through
there it creates some variation in the
current and that right there is our
analog signal that's actually what
travels between your twisted-pair
your your red and your black or I guess
it's your green in your black or I'm
forgetting exactly the colors but that
you know the two copper wires that go to
the central office and then through some
fun switching systems go to your other
friend in the central office and then
they get routed to their house and then
you can talk right but what happens
though is in the analog world we get
this we get this waveform here right in
this waveform just yet you know every
6,000 feet it needs to get amplified
because it gets all like aah and it gets
all nasty right well before the digital
era that just got nasty or nasty or
nastier and if you were to go calling
from San Francisco here to you know st.
Louis yes that's supposed to be the
Gateway Arch it's not going to sound
that great so thankfully we have digital
technologies where we can or we can do
some fun signaling we can do some
encoding and multiplexing and we can
send things out over you know right here
for example over to a satellite bounce
it back down over to another one or over
here I'm like this is my rendition of
the Sutro Tower over microwave links
line-of-sight probably wouldn't happen
between San Francisco and st. Louis
still we can take all of those and
rather than you know over copper on an
analog circuit we can actually send them
over various mediums and it just allows
the the telephone networks to be able to
save a lot of money without I happen to
you know run so many lines so that's
kind of the topics for this week we're
going to be talking about signaling
we've been talking about encoding we're
going to be talking about multiplexing
and I hope you guys enjoy it we're going
to be using the telephone network as our
example here but really a lot of these
concepts apply to more than just
telephone switching so while I
I'm talking about you know signaling and
digital processing and multiplexing and
stuff I'm going to take kind of a high
level overview approach here because so
many of these apply to different fields
and you know the phone system is just
near and dear to my heart so we're just
going to use that as our example and I
hope you guys enjoy that so it
translates and it's you know this isn't
going to be an exhaustive lesson in the
PSTN I'm not going to get so much into
the variations between D 1 and D for
framing of a t1 link because well that's
really really cool it really only
applies to you know that certain
specification of a t1 so anyway I hope
you guys enjoy I hope you guys have some
questions because we will be doing a
follow-up episode but for right now I
figured with all of that painted a
little overview if you will let's take a
quick break check in with Shannon and we
can get when we get back we're going to
be talking about the pulse amplitude
modulation how's that for a tease last
week's trivia question was since version
4.0 this open source servlet container
features components such as coyote and
Jasper and the answer was Apache Tomcat

family of unix-like operating systems
we'll be right back after a brief word

we've got our Pinot Grigio in hand well
you know because we're talking about
phone phreaking and were you thinking
we've mix a red wine with food and
freaking come on dude that's more for
like bash scripting anyway it's time to
talk about pulse amplitude modulation
it's really just a form of signal
processing so let's get it all down
now pulse amplitude modulation in the
instance of the telephone system is the
first step in our process of taking that
analog signal and converting it into a
digital one so that we can multiplex it
and finesse it and switch it convert it
to this and that and the other thing and
and really it's just a matter of taking
like we said that that sine wave there
that the analog waveform when we you
know speak into our telephone headset
here and create that variation in the
current so say like we've got waveform
that looks like this so we need to take
that and we need to make a digital and
pulse amplitude modulation is going to
help us do that like I said it's a
signal processing technique and in this
case it were at least in the case of the
telephone network it's going to work at
8,000 Hertz
or 8 kilohertz right and what that means
is how many times and in this case we
just can say per second we are going to
sample this waveform so let's just draw
this out right so we've got our waveform
this is time and this right here would
be our bit depth okay and in this case
it's an 8 bit depth right so an 8 bit
number which is from 0 to 255 and that's
how we get 8 bits in a binary get to
that real soon but we're just going to
put 0 down here and 128 here in the
centre and say 255 there okay so this
waveform here can then it be anywhere
between 0 and 255 and that's how we're
going to represent it digitally but
we're going to need to make a sample of
that every well in this case 8,000 Hertz
8,000 times per second we'll just say
that to be easy and that's going to look
essentially like this so we're going to
sample this right here and then 8 you
know every 8,000 times we're just going
to make all these little samples and we
could say hey awesome little waveform
what exactly would your digital
representation be if I had to convert
you know the your variation and current
you know whatever your your your voltage
difference that has been created by the
pressure that a human voice exerts you
know over the air causing little piece
of carbon to vibrating like fluctuations
and in some current right if I had to
sample that 8,000 times a second what
would I get what number would you be I'm
going to assign a number to you that's
going to be fun right so let's uh let's
take this one for example right so at
this point in time right here we're
going to say hey what is this waveform
equal and we're just going to say I
don't know 173 so what that's going to
be so we've got that number 173 and to
give you an example you know we're
talking about 8,000 times per second
that right there is or 8,000 Hertz
right there is what the telephone
network uses however you see these
frequencies a lot more and in any sort
of analog to digital conversion for
example in CD audio that would actually
be forty four thousand one hundred Hertz
so to give you an example difference you
know this is this is phone and that's CD
it's a huge difference in the fidelity
but you know you would think oh man that
must sound like junk right well actually
it's been you know since I some
scientists have kind of come up with the
idea that actually anything over 800
Hertz is is your bare minimum for human
understandability is that a word we're
going to go with that right which leads
me to believe that that gsm and cdma
must use four hundred joking joking but
but all that aside really eight thousand
shouldn't be that bad and to be honest a
landline telephone doesn't sound all
that bad for furry it's eight thousand
Hertz right and then you'll see other
ones like like I don't know 48,000 4800
Hertz and that's what you would see on
like a DVD and even blu-ray would go up
to 96 thousand Hertz right in fact I
think it can even go up to 192 Hertz on
a blu-ray but I haven't seen it so
anyway that right there kind of gives
you an idea of where this all sits least
in comparison to the telephone network
right so when we do that when we make
all of these samples and we make all
these samples with an 8 bit depth and
assign them a number between 0 and 255
we're going to have to you know convert
those to binary and and that right there
is essentially what pulse amplitude
modulation is all about it's just about
taking that that digital is the analog
signal here and converting it into a
digital one so it really looks you know
more like instead of the sine wave here
it would be like
and you know and that right there is our
aliasing it's not beautiful but it's
enough to effectively take that so that
we can transmit it over a digital medium
and then reconstruct it on the other
side play it out a speaker and as far as
a human ear is concerned it sounds like
sound yeah we're going to go with that
so with all of that set we're going to
be back in just a bit and when we come
back we're going to be talking about
pulse code modulation then how we
convert this over to binary and send it
across the network so that you can hear
your person on the other end if you're a
creative professional or an IT
consultant such as myself you'd probably
rather rebuild a Windows 98 box and do
invoicing or at least that's how I felt
until I met our newest sponsor fresh
books their online invoicing system is
the easiest ever it gets you paid
quicker and makes you look so
professional seriously accepting credit
cards PayPal Google Checkout they'll
even print and mail your invoice to your
client that is so cool and it's so easy
to get started it's free to sign up just
go over to FreshBooks comm and they're
doing the coolest thing just for hak5
yours if when you sign up you enter in
hack five in the section where you hear
about us they're going to go ahead and
everyday send one of those entries a
birthday cake awesome it doesn't even
have to be your birthday to win so you
could do whatever you want with your
birthday cake like mine I mean
I've always wanted to do this yeah check
out fresh books hmm all right so we
understand pulse amplitude modulation
it's the first step of converting this
all to digital and the next phase here
at least on the PSTN or in the public
switched telephone network is to do a
little fun thing called pulse code
modulation compulsion or g.711 as per
the itu-t specification is a is just
it's a waveform code it's in fact it's a
very common method of transforming a
waveform into a digital signal you're
going to see it everywhere from CD audio
to DVDs to just about anything that
requires converting audio into digital
and in the United States the version
that we use is actually called u law I
think that's backwards no it's not where
and and that right there is North
America which is all like and then
there's this thing and then oh hey
there's Texas and then California oh
wait that's right America's hat and then
we've got Sarah Palin and then a little
couple islands and that's good oh
there's a big lake right there um yeah
so that's you law right actually it also
encompasses these guys which are Japan
right where as a law is basically Europe
and the rest of the world and no I'm not
going to go there sorry I'm not going to
subject you to my drawings of Europe and
the rest of the world you're welcome but
those are really just designations their
specifications they're they're really at
the end of the day they're just the the
protocol just slight differences in the
way that this works because really at
they still use the same technology here
the pulse amplitude modulation to sample
this and give it a number value and then
encode it so we're not too worried about
the particular is there like I said just
kind of a an overview kind of introduce
you to some of these concepts for those
of you born past the fall of the Berlin
Wall to have no idea about any of this
and yeah let's get down to it so I'm
going to have to make a little bit of
room here so let's get rid of some of
this waveform okay
so we've converted our analog signal
here our blue line in and we've gotten a
digital representation of a binary
number well a number that we're going to
convert into binary if you will we've
sampled eight thousand times per second
and now it's time to create a binary
stream out of it okay so in this example
this 173 well that's actually going to
be represented is an 8-bit byte so 8,000
times per second 8-bit byte and that
right there is going to look like well
in the case of 173 that's one zero one
zero one one zero one how did we get
that pretty much like this so let's take
binary and we're going to do it from
right to left 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 if we
add all of these up what are we going to
get we're going to get 255 and of course
when you're talking about binary math
you always start with a 0 in which case
there are actually two hundred and
fifty-six positions if you will right
there's 256 possibilities there and and
we can create a number anywhere between
0 and 255 and express it as an 8-bit
byte using that method we're not going
to get into hex or any of that fun stuff
but essentially this number here when we
sampled it one of those one of the times
in the 8,000 Hertz right and it was 173
we can express it as 173 is 1 plus let's
see actually I'll just put it out this
way 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 so if we took 128
plus 32 plus 8 plus 4 plus
we would get 173 so there we go we've
converted our analog wave here to a
digital number or to it to a decimal and
then we've converted that decimal over
to a 8-bit binary number and now we can
put that 8-bit binary number into a
stream and when we transmit it over and
still over an analogue medium in this
case we're still talking about copper
what is going to look like rather than
this is where do I have some room is
it's going to look like this so one zero
one zero one
oh we've got two ones consecutive really
watch this one zero one now what are
those numbers what what does this mean
well what does this crazy form look like
this is a zero this is plus three and
this is minus three and what we're
talking about there is volts we're
actually going to send that over the
line and what's going to happen is when
we send this over the line and this is
just a digital representation of this
right here this binary stream this one
zero one zero one one zero one right
we've sent it as these pulses of
positive three zero negative three zero
positive 3 negative 3 zero positive 3
right that right there is eight bits in
voltage across wire now we alternate
that for a couple of reasons first of
all it's actually going to make that
signal a lot stronger second of all if
we didn't do that what would happen is
say we're transmitting this across our
our neighborhood here we've got to get
back to the central office right I'm on
the phone talking my friend my voice
creating you know variations in the
pressure right causing that little coil
to vibrate creating a analog waveform
goes down the street to a little box
that you can get into with an 11
millimeter socket wrench
but be wary because there's a little
switch that you have to push up at the
top and that lips central office that
you're not breaking in probably more
than you need to know don't get in
trouble we're gonna leave it there what
that's going to do is there's a box
that's going to take that and it's going
to digitize it as we've talked about
here it's going to multiplex it and
we're going to talk about that next week
and it's going to ship it over to the
central office as a bunch of ones and
zeros and it's going to look like this
but that central office and it's so far
away eventually this signal is going to
degrade right and what it's going to
look like is something like this it's
going to be like ok and then it's going
to come down right and what happens is
say every 6000 feet a little over a mile
or so there's going to be what's known
as a rectifier now a rectifier back in
the analog days this would have been an
analog amplifier that would have taken
that sine wave that would have taken
that the analog source and just boosted
it up a bit so that you know it still
maintains good signal strength right
well if you do that with an analog line
and we were calling here from like San
Francisco to st. Louis and that's going
to sound like junk it really is and
that's why I'm so thankful for digital
because what happens with these
rectifiers is when it sees this signal
here like moving around like this it's
like oh it looks at this blue line and
goes obviously it meant to be this
orange line and it basically recreates
the signal and that's so cool about
digital that we can do that well if we
were to instead of using positive 3 and
negative 3 if we were just to say do I
don't know
1 0 my pen is dying here let's try
another color pink there we go so if
we're going to go 1 0 1 0 1 what are we
doing here 1 0 right how would it know
when you know when that's when that line
you know when over over a mile or so
over those twisted pair of copper wires
that you see stringing along your street
when that when that gets there it might
look like this and then the signal
processor may not take a look at that
and may not recognize that as two
consecutive ones so you know plus 3 and
minus 3 volts is going to allow it to
have a you know a stronger signal signal
strength and also
let the rectifier just have a better
chance of recreating that signal so that
when it gets is the central office that
they can read it and retransmit it and
send along and charge away too much for
long distance all that other fun stuff
that goes along with Slough aney right
so yeah I know that that right there is
is going to to create a lot of questions
I hope that you send those to feedback
at hak5 org next week we're going to be
talking about what a ds0 is and how that
is important when it comes to
transmitting this over t1 links and just
to give you a little hint
we've got 8,000 Hertz 8-bit bytes right
and what that comes out to is 64
thousand or 64 kilobits per second which
as we know goes into a t1 which is 1.5
for 4 megabits per second 24 times a
little bit of multiplexing teasing if
you will so yeah anyway send your
feedback to feedback at hack 5 or they
look forward to your questions next week
we're going to be talking about the
intricacies of T 1 / e 1 links as well
as time division multiplexing and maybe
even touching on a little bit of code
division multiplexing and frequency
division multiplexing and Wow
multiplexing you know it can be so much
fun anyway at this point I'm just going
