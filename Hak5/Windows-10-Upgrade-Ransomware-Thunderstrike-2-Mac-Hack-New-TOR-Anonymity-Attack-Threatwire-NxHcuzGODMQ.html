Thunder strike to Mac hack new tour
attack and are the US courts actually
helping the victims of identity theft
all that more coming up now on threat
wire greetings ladies and gentlemen it's
a hot miserable Monday morning here in
Richmond California i'm patrick norton
and this is a threat wire for august 3rd
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom a
huge thanks to everyone watching the
show three times a week and supporting
us oh my goodness let's fire it up we've
talked lots about Windows 10 security in
the last week but the nastiest thing so
far I think is a series of phishing
emails pretending to be Microsoft
sending you an upgrade link if you
download and install the upgrade link
hint it's fake it turns out to be CTB
locker ransomware that encrypts your
driver then tells you you're going to
lose your data if you don't pay us like
now the screenshots you see came from
the cisco blog and please don't download
anything linked from an email okay ours
techne reports of a new attack on the
tour privacy network can quote d
anonymize tour with eighty-eight percent
accuracy unquote sounds pretty serious
right researchers from MIT and the qatar
computing research institute told ARs
our goal is to show that it is possible
for a local passive adversary to de
anonymize users with hidden service
activities without the need to perform
and end traffic analysis so the hack
doesn't actually involve decrypting tour
traffic but developing fingerprints that
allow an attacker running a guard that's
the entry point to tour to identify
traffic patterns going through the guard
tor project leader rogered engli dines
hold ours to the requirements of the
attack greatly limited its effectiveness
in real world settings mostly because it
have to be running a lot of the randomly
assigned entry guard machines to have a
chance of someone logging in through a
guard they controlled and then it
wouldn't actually be hard to spoof the
mechanism views for finger protein
traffic which I suspect means we can see
an upgrade to tour in the near future in
good news for anybody that's had
personal information stolen in a data
breach ZDNet reports at the US Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed
a lower court decision that tossed
out of class action lawsuit over a 2014
data breach at Neiman Marcus echoing
actually a recent decision by the 9th
district the judges in question claimed
the victims had quote standing a right
to file a lawsuit in federal court over
concerns of ongoing problems yeah data
theft ongoing problem in secure networks
ongoing problem one I smell Supreme
Court this one's going to get fought to
the top because nobody wants to hold the
bag over there poorly secured networks
to it'd be nice if security got really
serious in the wake of lawsuits like
this and three now if the courts could
just convince the OPM that they need to
take security seriously as of two years
ago Wow never wonder how much is your
stolen identity actually worth well
after research on the darknet search
engine grams quartz says probably around
20 bucks that was the median price for
Foles with like ID numbers name and
address Foles containing credit scores
made for higher prices for the very best
credit scores a 720 and above you can
net several hundreds of dollars for that
information that said I suspect that
twenty dollar median is pretty high most
ID sales are in bulk and fairly
secretive and not out there on the dark
web and in pre black hat and Def Con
news capper skis threat post calm says
that Thunder strike two is coming that's
a fresh take on the Thunderstrike mac OS
10 firmware boot kit as in undetectable
installation of malicious firmware that
survives reboots and operating system
reinstallation that's going to be
dropped to the black hat security
conference this week researchers told
threat post quote thunder strike two is
different from its predecessor in that
an attacker would not require physical
access to a macbook this attack can be
accomplished remotely and exploits
self-replicate via peripherals watch out
OS 10 it's coming speaking of black hat
the whole hak5 crew are going to be at
DEFCON later this week I'll be alongside
Darren and snubz selling land turtles
another hak5 shop gear in the vendor
area before I go I want to give a huge
