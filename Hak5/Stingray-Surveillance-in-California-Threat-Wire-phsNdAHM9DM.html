very closely dirt boxes are flying over
disneyland tourist services aren't so
secure and neither are networking
connections all that coming up now on
threat wire hello world I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
February third 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom we're working our way
towards creating an RSS for threat wire
and you can help by contributing to our
patreon at patreon.com / threat wire
because every little bit helps now who
is excited for Super Bowl 50 this
weekend on February seventh yay it
happens at Levi's Stadium in the San
Francisco Bay Area it's actually like 50
miles south but they are still partying
in San Francisco 1 million people are
expected to travel to the bay area for
the Super Bowl it with that 60 federal
state and local agencies will also be
visiting by the way of surveillance if
you're in the bay area which we actually
are during the big game chances are that
you will be under the microscope of some
kind of surveillance from agencies
across the USA according to the
Department of Homeland Security every
Super Bowl is considered a special event
assignment rating one with help from the
DHS the FBI TSA and the US Secret
Service and many more scoping out the
event these agencies will be looking for
any notable threats to the events such
as violet social media postings traffic
reports phone tips suspicious activity
on security cameras and a lot more they
will also be using license plate readers
which can tell location in date and time
of a passing car facial recognition
technology which isn't new and cell
phone surveillance such as stingrays or
fake cell phone towers used to track
phones now while the exact technology
used isn't necessarily being discussed
by officials many of these are already
in use by local law enforcement in the
Bay Area the task force will work
together out of a joint operation center
somewhere in mountain view which is six
miles north of the stadium there will be
a no-fly zone for drones and planes near
the stadium as well as robots just
hanging out just in case to disarm any
weapons or bombs agencies will also have
people in the stadium to
keep an eye on attendees at their
operation center notable threats will be
processed with as many as 300,000
possible acts per day or more as the
weekend draws near while notable threats
do happen at events and law enforcement
is needed to keep an eye on the public
and keep us safe from attacks if you're
not too keen on the whole idea of a 1984
esque surveillance yeah this best way to
stay off their cameras is just to not go
I think it's vacation time yeah Apache
is a web server used by many websites
around the globe and it turns out if
they're relying on Torah to keep their
service anonymous they may be vulnerable
to a sensitive information leak in the
mod underscores status module found on
tourist services Taurus hidden service
AKA onion allow sites to be anonymous so
whistleblowers dark web markets and more
use them the mod status module creates a
page that shows the admin sensitive
information about the servers such as
CPU usage geographical information and
HTTP requests which is kind of creepy to
check if your server has this issue you
can go over to your servers name dot
onion / server status and if you get a
404 or a 403 then you're fine if not and
you actually receive information about
your server to fix the problem an admin
needs to disable the mod status module
by using the pseudo a to dis mod status
command in the show prime numbers are
one of the most important parts of
encryption techniques they can only be
divisible by 1 or themselves and as such
is very very hard to reverse engineer
when you use a non prime number it's
very easy for an attacker to figure out
the secret key to your encryption and
thus snoop on your connection so cat is
a powerful networking service used to
fix bugs and networks and to transmit
encrypted data which uses the
diffie-hellman protocol for encryption
unfortunately it's been using a
non-prime 1024-bit number which is
proven to be easily cracked a 2048-bit
prime number will be included in an
updated version of so cat an official
with so cat wrote on Monday that quote
since there is no indication of how
these parameters were chosen the
existence of a trapdoor that makes it
possible for an Easter opportu recover
the shared secret from a key exchange
that uses them
not be ruled out so cat was most
recently updated in January 2015 with a
patch by zhi-gang wing introducing the
non prime number but the possibility of
a backdoor is yet to be determined
lastly for today more surveillance in
california specifically in Anaheim which
is home of Disneyland the ACLU has
obtained documents from the Anaheim
Police Department detailing their use of
dirt boxes which are basically stingray
devices mountain on aircraft which
they've owned since 2009 federal law
enforcement agencies have to attain
warrants for stingray and dirt box usage
but local law enforcement has not had to
do this so these products could have
been used as much to their advantage as
they see fit California has passed a law
in place with the same need for warrants
but that wasn't required until this year
in January the devices allow law
enforcement to track location unique IDs
and metadata of calls and texts made and
receive they can also disrupt calls
placed due to their strength now
obviously you can just not carry a cell
phone but you can also use encrypted
email text and call services to kind of
limit the data collected thank you
seriously thank you for being our
awesome bosses we are ad free and we are
independent so seriously this show
happens because you find it worthwhile
and you make really great bosses you
make the show possible by contributing
at patreon.com / threat wire where we
have been sharing lots and lots of extra
content including a monthly security
video by Darren kitchen now if you are a
hush puppy perk patron then we will
feature your fur babies on the show like
Marco the amazing military pup rest in
peace Marco he's got an incredible story
so thank you so much to your man for
sharing this photo now we will be
introducing an RSS feed and another
episode once we hit our next goal so
check the link below for information on
how to contribute and you can find all
