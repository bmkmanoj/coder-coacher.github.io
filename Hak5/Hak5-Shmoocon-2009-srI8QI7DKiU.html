by Netflix Go Daddy and Squarespace
hello and welcome to hack 5 does your
weekly dose of technol us and here we
are at the marriott wardman Washington
DC for shmoocon love this con what's
your feeling ah drug stub he's a little
hungover we partied last night just a
little bit Matt went on a rampage what
about you I'm sore from all that dancing
last night we might they have excellent
parties here at smoke on but on top of
that they have excellent speakers
awesome security professional friends
lots of enthusiasts out here tons of
people coming up to us being like five a
time you know getting bitchy stakin
giving out stickers I love hearing that
so if you ever see it as a con hit us up
now what is it what do you think about
us being like the little what are we
like superheroes now well we've got uh
you know schwag that they've never seen
before you know we have to thank Jason
Applebaum who was kindly operating the
camera right now and being a little tool
behind it but he is the one that
actually created these what would you
call them limited limited edition first
run anything I said like with Shannon
said pimp jacket is probably the
official term yeah so you know maybe
we'll see keep an eye um so yeah let's
uh let's just kick it over and talk to
some of our awesome security
professional friends see what's going on
and we'll see you at the end of the show
fast tracks make it like huge splash
lately what's new with it man ofs track
version 4 we did a complete rehal the
entire code and what we really try to do
with it is is make it an automated
penetration suite for penetration
testers that really just blows the lids
off anything else out there and we've
done a lot of work with payload delivery
options where it hasn't been done before
bypass any type of windows restrictions
that are out there and really tries to
hack the box so what is I mean it's only
been around for like two years right
really made a lot of
what is it that makes fast track so
unique there's a lot of things I mean
the techniques that we actually use
within fast track haven't been done
before when we go through and do the
sequel injection attacks which sequel
injection obvously has been wrapped in
10 years but we spice it up and actually
go through and do full system
compromises without ever having an
egress connection before the actual
payloads delivered so it's like it's all
the tools in it are really just
automated it allows you to compromise
the box with relatively little effort
and really helps you guys find out
exactly where the vulnerabilities are at
give me get an idea of how do this
project kind of started and so I was I I
did a lot of work for the backtrack guys
and it was I think was backtrack to and
really started off with a lot of the
tools and everything in there became
out-of-date pretty quick and so what I
did was I started writing a script that
we just started updating a lot of tools
out there and started started to really
try to automate you know a lot of that
process and basically I was doing a pen
test in China and finally had a lot of
tools out there they either really
sucked or they were non-existent
something okay well it's not for me to
start writing this stuff and now so I
wrote I wrote a bunch of tools within
fast-track that really try to automate a
lot of methodologies for my company
secure state to really try to break into
systems like we would that would
normally take two or three days if not
more and automated to a couple seconds
so this is basically the same syndrome
that any system administrator has fallen
into and that is Wow all of this
exchange administration stuff is mundane
right so you're just doing the same
thing right penetration testing right
and you know and I really wanted to get
it out to a lot of our clients too so
that they can understand what these
attacks were prevent against it and then
we can start doing more advanced a test
because we're breaking into them you
know the first day and so we might as
well give them something that at least
armed themselves with the be able to
test for will we test for and try to
elevate our attacks again and get a
little better of an edge now initially
this tool was just basically a lot of
scripts that kind of like really a lot
of stuff together how has that changed
yeah so all the tools on there are
custom coded so the sequel ownage tool
the super bruder that does the binary
payload injections all those are custom
coded completely independent tools all
code in python and really just you know
or all just independence tools so um is
this working with metasploit like like
the initial version is it an alternative
to metasploit
trying to recreate metasploit by any
facet I mean HD is a brilliant dude and
he knows a lot about you know exploit
development all that great stuff what we
really try to do was take a tax attorney
metasploit incorporate them into
fast-track so the tools that we're
actually using on their custom coated we
do use metasploit for like payload
creations you know there's no no no
reason to read about the wheel and with
the new MSF pelo NM SF encode gets
passed antivirus no problem it was
definitely a good technique that we
wanted a corporate in a fast track can
you tell me about that technique I find
it very interesting that ok so you shone
like lots of different ways in your talk
to get different you know shells on
boxes right but once you've got shell
and box you got to deliver your tools
you know to get your phone on um you've
got a very interesting and creative way
to to do that can tell me a little bit
more about absolutely so most most
people when they do a pen test will do
like an ftp echo file or tftp or
something like that and when I just or
netcat it'll drop net count on the
system which gets flagged by antivirus
if you're doing any type of FTP or tftp
a lot of times egress wise they don't
allow those connections or an IDs or IPs
my flag on it if it's a decent one so
what we try to do was figure out a way
that we can drop a payload onto the
system without ever originating and eat
risk connection until the actual payload
hits so what we end up doing is window
we use windows debug to take hexadecimal
drop it onto the underlying operating
system then we use windows debug to
convert our payload back to an
executable now what's interesting what
this is the windows debug has a 64k
restriction so if you're trying to drop
an interpreter payload or you know VNC
reverse VNC payload it's going to be
above 64 kilobytes so you're really
limited in what you can drop on the
system and so you know with the other
tools fail where they drop neck and neck
after transferring what we end up doing
was we just rewrote windows debug that
takes out raw hacks and spits out raw
binaries so essentially completely
bypassing the windows 64 K debug
restrictions so how do you get your
hacked version of the windows debug on
the window system we use we use the
debug technique to convert on there the
first time and our windows debug cuz
it's under 64 caves under 64 case five
kilobytes there's my boy file there's
something absolutely brilliant and
beautiful about the simplicity of using
the tool to download a hacked version of
itself yeah and so as far as the IDS
concerned if you are like actually
sniffing the wire what would these tools
look like is this all
traffic over tcp so it's text traffic
over tcp it's all I've seen it's all
garbage so the only thing that they
would ever pick up would be that
origination the origination connection
from the pop box out to the internet or
vine shell whatever ends up being that
would be it well patch tracks really
come a long way last few years what is
coming up new in 4.14 put one's got a
lot of cool things in it we got a new
Oracle module that releasing that's
going to go after Oracle and do horrible
image in quite a bit of different
fashions we're also adding a lot of new
features in to fast track that really
incorporate new attack vectors really
it's an ongoing process I you know I run
a practice of highly talented
individuals and we're all just kind of
crunching together putting them some
local stuff in this and getting us the
open source community absolutely love it
where can people go and get their hands
on it if you go to a secure sitcom and
go the free tool section down there you
can also go to the pen test calm and the
pen test calm is where the subversion
repository is a so you can just pull it
down from there it's also got a bug
tracker a wiki great and also you know
we go through we got actually outline
each of the tasks give you movies for
each one of them and how you can use it
and then we actually give you ways that
you can prevent the attacks so it's all
in one so you know see how we exploit
the systems and how you prevent from
those attacks occurring and it's also in
the latest batch right for beta that got
released their awesome Dave excellent
meet you man thank you so much for
coming on yep take care so Joshua tell
me about your software your wireless
mapping software what how would you
describe it so what it does is it allows
the user to visually represent the
information from kismet in a manner
that's flexible so we're able to extract
the information stored in a database and
then query the database to extract only
the information that's it's interesting
to that particular user now why are we
saving it to it a bit database is it not
like just taking the kismet data and
just running a report on it or how does
it differ so you're storing all of the
information that kismet would capture
but this allows us to extract the
information that's useful for the user
so for example we can make a graph a
visual representation of the linksys
access point that we see on channel 6
that are not using encryption how is
this tool being used like paint me a
scenario of what you would use you know
the the GIS kismet for okay so the key
the G is kismet software that I've
I've developed allows for an
organization or a pen tester to go to an
organization and say let's do a wireless
audit and then I can represent only the
information that is unique to you as an
organization so i can map out for
university for example only the
information that a particular college
would have where the you know the group
thats brought in the consultants says i
only care about the information for my
college I don't care about the rusting
university I don't care about the outer
lying you know access points I only want
to see the information that's
interesting when you say see the
information we're talking about a
graphical representation can you give me
a kind of an idea of how that comes
together like what they use is how it
looks sure so what it does is it just
currently we're graphing access points
with a point in a particular place it
stores the information about the access
points you see the list of clients you
see some information about the type
types of clients that are connected the
manufacturers the channels the
encryptions that are being used and you
know any other types of information that
is useful so sweet and you were telling
me earlier about some integration with
google maps can you only have that words
so all of the graphs are currently being
generated are what we're doing is you're
pulling the information into google maps
to visually represent the data so that's
the current graphical napping solution
that we're using so to use this all i
would need is i'm assuming a linux
laptop yep with a Wi-Fi card and a gps
yep exactly and all you need to do would
be capture the information with kismet
and then insert the information in your
room database so it's fairly easy so
where can i get this apparently it's
available online at G is kismet org feel
free to you know send me feature
requests bugs you know happy to fix
anything as open source I guess they're
playing with it get knee-deep in the
code totally open source and it'll allow
people do visually represent you know
the information is interesting to them
and I hear that it's might be part of a
backtrack for coming up yep yep we're
going to include it in the in the back
track for it's very exciting so thanks
for that excellent very cool thank you
very much this month not only do we have
one land party game for you but we have

next up we SAT we have some more awesome
interviews from shmoocon how'd you get
involved in putting together a Bluetooth
monitor how did I get involved it was
but you know I started working with with
the new radio in the u.s. RP actually at
work and it wasn't even really what I
was supposed to be doing in the first
place it was just I started working at
the Institute for tell communication
sciences and there were some interns
there that summer who were basically
given a couple of us are peas and said
see what you can do with it and and like
right after i got back from black hat I
I went to a little presentation that
they gave and here's what we've been
able to do with these us are peas at the
end of the summer you know and what got
him and I said holy cow these have this
has tremendous potential for security
work so I just immediately jumped in and
started learning what I could and and I
don't even know how I started thinking
about bluetooth but i was looking at
what the u.s. RP maybe could do in
general and thinking about all the
different kinds of wireless technologies
that are out there and at some point i
ran across dominicks paper on on using
the the u.s. RP to decode a single
channel of Bluetooth and his very first
implementation of that and that kind of
gave me some other ideas about like well
maybe we can reverse the hopping
sequence so forth and and ultimately i
ended up
contacting him and we just started
working together so why is it that
sniffing bluetooth or monitoring
bluetooth is so much more difficult than
it is with my 802 11 radio I can I just
put in my card in promiscuous mode it's
the frequency hopping and in your 802 11
radio a card pretty much every card has
monitor mode capability these days right
and a lot of them can do raw frame
injection too but that just isn't
available in the with the Bluetooth chip
sets they for example the most common
Bluetooth chip set has a correlator and
that looks for frames and the frame
synchronization sequence is unique to a
particular address so the the correlator
this implement implement in hardware has
you have to plug in an address to it for
it to be able to find packets in the
first place so you have to have prior
knowledge of the address in order to
locate packets unless the packets have
some standard address or something like
the discoverable mode package so so is
that why you can't just do kind of like
kismet for as an analogy akismet for
Bluetooth and then target a single bssid
or mac address or whatever it may be you
could if you had prior knowledge of the
address or if you were only looking for
discoverable devices now it's
interesting that you mentioned kismet
because kismet could be used with other
hardware in addition to off-the-shelf
Bluetooth modules we're talking about
maybe integrating kismet with the usrp
code that we're working on so it would
be a more expensive module than the one
that you have built into your lap right
but it would be we might be able to get
the bringing the capabilities of
Bluetooth monitoring to tools like
kismet Wireshark and so forth now you
when I asked you where the difficulty is
with just using a bluetooth dongle you
mentioned the hopping just some numbers
from your talk you said that there are
79 channels and am I getting this right
that it's around 79 megahertz that's
correct and
1600 hops per second mm-hmm so that
that's a lot of throughput is it one
packet / hop or how to sew it is one
packet / hop there well there is a time
slot that starts every sixteen hundred
times per second there's a new time slot
and at each of those time slots is
there's a new channel selection now a
single packet can span 125 time slots
and it will remain on that frequency for
the duration of the packet so if you
have a very long packet that takes up
multiple time slots then you'll skip
some of the next hops until the next
packet starts it and it'll it'll just
stay on that frequency until that
packets done so the maximum packet rate
is one packet per time slot but it can
be less on than that do two packets
being longer or it can be less than that
just due to the traffic being sparse
like I've never seen a fully I've never
seen a fully busy Bluetooth Network so
far that had every single time slot
occupied even a fairly busy network like
a mobile phone and headset still uses
less than half the time slots now you
came up about this problem by using the
u.s. RP to do the snipping what kind of
what kind of approaches and difficulties
did you first attempt and and learn when
you started to try to actually sniff the
entire spectrum the 79 channels uh well
I knew right off the bat that we didn't
have a way to get all 79 channels
without doing a lot of work Dominic had
come up with this implementation that
did a single channel and I knew that it
should be relatively easy to extend that
to say eight channels in the case of the
u.s. RP or 25 channels in the case of us
are p2 but not likely to be done in real
time so why is that just because of the
amount of CPU time required to process
the raw radio wave form we're dealing
with a lot of bits per second the the
u.s. RP to it
it is spitting out a pair of 32 byte
sorry a pair of 32-bit floats for every
single sample 25 million of them per
second right that's not usb-based
obviously it doesn't fit on the US yeah
but now it was the biggest problem with
the u.s. rp1 right and so that's why
they've had to upgrade it with the u.s.
rp2 has has made it based on a gigabit
ethernet bus instead of USB bus and even
then the gigabit ethernet is the
bottleneck the the fpga on the u.s. rp2
has two down convert from 100 mega
samples per second all the way down to
25 mega samples per second are not down
convert put down sample yeah in order to
just in order to fit it over the gigabit
ethernet bus so that's really our
limitation and then when we get that all
those bits coming in at a very high rate
to the host computer processing them is
very expensive cpu wise and processing
them 25 times as much salute all 25
channel with your typical laptops dual
core system what are you able to achieve
roughly one channel per core so i can on
my laptop that i use in the demo i was
successfully able to decode two channels
have time but i was not successfully
able to decode eight I mean some packets
were detected on various channels but I
dropped a lot well it sounds like a
complicated problems and and at first
when you start thinking about it okay if
I can do one channel per core there's 79
channels just throw a lot of money to
throw a lot of iron through a lot of
brute force at it but that's not the
approach you ended up taking what's the
what kind of finesse did you end up
cheating kind of here to end up getting
that kind of spectrum well we did kind
of 22 different tricks and and
ultimately a big iron solution is really
the only way that you're going to build
a monitor that can detect all Bluetooth
devices on all channels simultaneously
but if you're interested in targeting
only a particular network a single
piconet at a time then that piconet is
only using one frequency at a time so
one the first trick that we use is to
actually follow the hopping sequence
which is a pseudo-random sequence and
that allows us to
select a correctional at the correct
time and only have to decode one channel
at a time instead of 25 or 79 we have to
predict where it's going to hop right
right we have to predict the hopping
sequences a pseudo-random sequence that
is based it's a overly complex algorithm
that basically takes the address of the
master device and the clock of the
master device and crunches some numbers
and spits out a channel number and the
clock value the address doesn't change
so once we were able to acquire the
address we have that the clock value
increments 3,200 times per second and
it's a 28 bit number 27 of which get
used for this this clock hopping
algorithm so we just calculate the
entire table of every possible hop there
every possible channel that occurs at
each clock and then we observe a bunch
of packets and say well we got we got
one at this time on this channel and
then we got one x number of time slots
later on this other channel and we got
one x number of time slots later on this
other channel and just search through
that big sequence until we find a unique
match and sometimes it takes few tries
and we have to get more packets
sometimes until we get a unique hit
actually the the hopping algorithm tends
to result in a lot of repeats and so it
it's it's it's pseudo-random but it's
not very random okay but that's the the
crazy awesome science and so now that
you've you festoon that it's following
that and without getting too technical
and how we're actually tricking the usl
pre RP into doing the aliasing and doing
that let's talk about the practical so
say like we do have the ability to to
snip it right what can we do with that
now and you've shown some proof of
concept code like what what surprised
you about that when you saw it uh what
are we so what do we do with it now that
we have it that's a good question and
it's something a dominant I have it's a
discussion we sort of have put off
because we've been so focused on just
getting packets and there's a little so
much work that has gone into just
getting packets and we're to the point
now where we find
have packets and well yeah we could
improve our code quite a bit but but we
have packets now what do we do with them
is a big question that we just kind of
started talking about yesterday and like
one of the things he threw out there is
is a Josh right did a demo where he used
Dominic single-channel solution to
recover the address of a device and then
subsequently configure an off-the-shelf
bluetooth card to use that device and
spoof the master and convince it so like
the next time that a Bluetooth headset
for example is turned off and then on
again it could connect to the malicious
device instead of connecting to the cell
phone you could also do a
man-in-the-middle attack in that kind of
way that's possible there are a number
of attacks that have been developed
there was an attack that Dominic
mentioned on the pairing algorithm or
the pairing protocol and so we we can
capture the whole pairing process now
and actually try out that algorithm off
of you know live captures that we've
acquired already and we haven't tried
that yet we can also build all kinds of
higher level a higher layer stuff
integrate with kismet integrate with
wireshark and I mean there is a lot that
could be done that we hope that the work
that we've done so far kind of opens the
door to to all this stuff now have you
tried using the u.s. RP to do any sort
of injection that's a good question
because the u.s. RP one of the great
things about it is that it can transmit
and receive it is difficult however to
to have very precise timing with your
transmission received there's some new
code that's being worked on right now
that that allows some in band signaling
to try to fix these problems but but
there are different challenges one of
the things that reversing the hopping
sequence does is it allows us to know
which channel we would have to transmit
on at what particular time in order to
inject traffic into a network also the
clock value is required to
part of a packet whitening process in
addition to knowing what channel to
transmit on you have to actually know
the clock value in order to format the
packet in the first place so we've
acquired the address of arbitrary device
that we can spend we can find we've
acquired the clock value and we can in
theory use that to generate new packets
whiten them and transmit them at the
correct time on the correct channel now
when you first started into this project
how much of the Bluetooth stack did you
know were you familiar went on what
surprised you the most when you started
getting really nitty-gritty with
Bluetooth I think what surprised me the
most was the fact that there are over a
billion Bluetooth devices on the planet
and / almost none of them have any kind
of real security no 0000 is security
right they have they have four digit PIN
yes that are easily crackable even if
they're not 0000 which most of them are
and most of them don't use any
encryption there's something there's an
encryption standard in the Bluetooth
specification but and it's been shown to
have some weaknesses but it's better
than nothing yeah but even so hardly any
devices use it and people are using
bluetooth for amazing things I mean
Dominic was saying that train conductors
in the UK have Bluetooth enabled credit
card readers and in the United States we
have wireless traffic control systems
traffic signal control systems that use
bluetooth so you can go around and like
turn on traffic lights and turn them off
and stuff like that and and they're
being used you know headsets are
ubiquitous and people have private
conversations all the time and you have
a you know you have an encrypted
communication between your phone and the
phone network and but you're
transmitting your that same conversation
in the clear between your headset and
your phone right so given the the proof
of concept how far we are right now with
like research given the the expense of
the USSR
too I believe fourteen hundred dollars
that's for the base model without any
daughter boards so it's a little bit on
top of that do you think and when do you
think if it is possible that there would
be some sort of off-the-shelf solution
for you know Joe hacker to start really
playing with this I don't know right now
you know we've only just gotten to the
point where we have a device that's
that's you know the cost of a nice
laptop that can do this stuff and we're
just kind of exploring what we can do
with that at this point getting to the
point where it's it's as affordable sa a
Wi-Fi a hackable Wi-Fi module we're a
long way from that and if we ever get
there it's probably going to come in the
form of hacking some kind of
off-the-shelf device unfortunately right
now all off-the-shelf devices that we
know of are not capable even with custom
firmware flashed on them of doing what
we're able to do with the u.s. rp2 so I
I I don't see a time in the in the near
future when this technology is going to
become accessible below the
thousand-dollar level ok is there a
place that people can play with the code
or play with the Bluetooth dumps that
you've done yes and we have a project
called gr Bluetooth gr hyphen Bluetooth
and that's hosted on source boards so
just go to a source porridge and search
for GR Bluetooth and we have our first
release was made the other day version 0
dot 2 we're so confident in it that we
gave it a fifth of them and we we also
put together a package of short sample
files that are captured wave forms of
actually the very devices that I was
using in the demo today so you could
reconstruct the codec can actually
listen back to the conversation
theoretically yes you should you should
be able to and that's one of the higher
layer things that we haven't done yet is
a decoding the audio so you can actually
listen to a conversation from the
packets that we've captured right but
theoretically from those those samples
that are on the website you should be
able to decode that audio and tell me
what was so I'm waiting for the email
the first person to tell me what was
being said on that phone call right lab
this is very exciting in these very very
early days of this type of Bluetooth
hacking to see the challenges that have
to be overcome before that the most
simple of tools can be put together to
really take advantage of it or none
practical level Mike thanks so much for
coming on I really appreciate you thank
you very much giving us some of your
time and just thanks for being here Don
all right my last week's trivia was our

hak5 and please don't forget the 3 w's
and i think we got a couple more awesome
interviews from shmoocon for you so mr.
X how did you get involved with with
aircrack so just got interested in
wireless because at the end of during my
studies at the end of the year I got a
new new laptop with a wireless card and
then I started learning everything about
worse because I wanted to test
everything
and then found a crack and God is
interested in in it submitted a really
small patches to to do a few things and
then at some point the the author of a
crack disappeared and with without any
news and was around december two
thousand five and then in February at
the end of every 2006 are started
aircrack-ng because i first wanted to
make modifications and keep the
modification for me but that 20 was a
good idea to share to the community to
have feedbacks and things like that how
is the project evolved since you first
started working on aircrack-ng we have
talked about a lot of new tools like a
base some tools to do w pierre text that
you heard in the news so tell me about
the speeds with cracking what kind of
and if what kind of techniques can we
see in the future or even now to
increase the speed of cracking you can
use Pico cars fpga you can also use GPU
graphical costs but that's not yet in
your quad injury but that's planned you
already know cuda from nvidia and we
will try to support it e stream too so
and that's pretty fast well thank you so
much mr. x thank you so Johnny you right
off the heels of some great selling
books what's been keeping you busy
lately the the book sales have been just
absolutely phenomenal I've been I've
been amazingly blessed by like these you
know google hacking was that was
phenomenal did really well but but then
volume two came out and i didn't expect
it but sales increased you know this
thing was still rolling and then no tech
you know stealing book in the middle
their fourth book of stealing series and
the Noatak it was just like this grand
slam
looks so I've been really happy with
books I ended on no tech hacking which
did great it was it was my style yeah
fun it was a great talk to thanks thanks
and people they really resented with a
lot of people but I got that point where
I was like you know what I'm gonna take
a break yeah a dozen book projects not
only that feel burned out but I felt
pretty fulfilled about it I was like you
know this is a good place to quit for a
while so I did the knotek book all the
proceeds are going back into our charity
so I think that's part of the reason
it's selling really well yeah there
might be some church mom somewhere but
in cases kids in Africa now well you
talked to us about the charity last year
at shmoocon when we did a live show and
then we forgot to plug the little red
and the white wires into the mixer so we
didn't get audio but we had a lot of fun
putting it together it's a lull hack the
law cats episode is probably one of my
favorite yeah yeah because it was just
hilarious just saw Jason Scott New York
and he absolutely loved it as well so he
was on the bus I just like so I'm
planning my own edit of that I'm gonna
do certain parts of it backwards and I
was just so naive cereal so so tell me
how did the the charity come back how
does hacker go into the whole charity
work yeah yeah that's the big question
so um I mean I was I was like most
people in this community I mean you know
trust your techno lust right i mean i
had i had a big time had the you know
staying on the cutting edge you know
doing pentesting doing physical security
stuff i mean you never know what you're
gonna run into so you stay on top of
everything that's cutting edge bleeding
edge on absolutely everything so my wife
wanted to go to Africa it's been like
her whole life she's wanted to go to
Africa work with children so she got an
opportunity to go like 30 church and I
was like go this is your thing do it so
she went and I was it I was at black hat
I think two years ago and I opened my
talk saying you know my just got a text
message for my wife who's in Uganda and
she's telling me that she just got hot
water and chickens walk with her and I'm
like oh isn't that cute and I waltz into
my suite bathroom in in caesars palace
with the marble walls and LCD flat
screen and I'm like wow we're like
worlds away
but she came back with some some footage
that really struck me like you've seen
it National Geographic and stuff you see
poor kids you see skinny kids and you
see the Flies on their eyeballs and like
we've got used to this stuff well she
came back it was her own footage and
she's showing me pictures of these these
kids of joy you know happiness and like
laughing dancing singing and having a
good time and then she shows me where
they live like dirt hut you know one
shirts like rip to shreds oh by the way
this child's parents both died there
orphan living with a family of 12 this
is the aunt and oh by the way they
haven't eaten in a week and I was like
were they happy about you know that that
like sort of stuck with me I was like
you know my latte doesn't have you know
quite the right amount of milk or sugar
in it the morning and I'm like grumpy
yeah these kids you know something
different so I was curious about that
next year the trip came around again I
decided to go with her and that's that's
where things start to get interesting I
was picturing digging in the dirt I was
picturing you know doing some
construction you know typical whatever
instrument houses yeah okay stuff I
could do that I can do manually by could
probably screw it up too fast a hacker
Sally I do the light bulbs be good at
the light bulbs but when I got there
what they really wanted is uh they found
out I was a computer guy and it turned
out the organization i was working with
had computer systems that had donated
that were like overrun with viruses and
needed all this work and so i spent two
weeks doing computer work and never
expected that you know why is it that us
as geeks and you know africa aside but
you can't go anywhere you can't go home
for the holidays without removing the
spyware so I think you know but it's
there's yeah i mean if your if your
computer guy you can fix hardware and
you can do all of this crap and it's
like yeah it's expected but that's
really valuable when I mean that that's
really cool that they've got access and
whatnot so I mean it's while you think
about it it's like you know you go to
Grandma's house for Thanksgiving and you
know her computer's overrun with spyware
and you fix that that's like so valuable
outside the context you know like here
that's not a big deal when you do that
for somebody that doesn't
access to that it's a huge deal but it
was even bigger deal because a virus on
a computer in a third world country for
a non-government organization is holding
spreadsheets of children who are getting
money for food from sponsors probably in
the u.s. a virus a stupid macro virus on
an excel spreadsheet disconnects
everything yeah and now it's like we
have this money where is it supposed to
go you got a kid that's not eating so my
work there open my eyes so when I got
back here and I'm doing cool stuff it
was still great i still love the tag but
it's not like i was saving anybody's
life it was like a big downer and
everybody i talked to was like just give
it a little bit of time you know to
three weeks you'll be over it two months
later i'm still thinking about it so
then as i thought about like our
community all the skill that we have the
idea that i came up with was let's see
if we can connect the skill in this
community with need in underdeveloped
countries and that's where hackers for
charity started so how how does somebody
get involved with hackers for charity
and what could they expect to volunteer
and do if they joined let's will pretty
grassroots right now I mean we're
keeping it small and we're trying to do
a few things well so right now we have a
basic mailing list we got a google
groups list you sign up for that
something comes along and for example a
charity that needs a website who say hey
we got this charity they can't afford to
pay anybody interested in building a
website the idea is what what we want to
do for our technical initiative is we
want to connect people that are looking
for jobs in the community or looking to
improve their careers or some brilliant
hacker as flipping burgers that's not
even working in IT you want to get them
jobs good jobs better job of this idea
yeah and so then what we do is get
connect them will connect them with
people that have the need that can't
afford it it's a win-win and it's all
about this magic word empowerment it's
improving the life of technologists
hackers giving them better jobs by
improve and all at the same time
improving things for a charity and in
turn improving the life of the people of
the charities so so far how has it been
going
it's been it's been overwhelming I had
no idea that there was this sort of
latent goodness in the community I mean
I knew it at a personal level how
hackers are good people we we came in
here and left all of our equipment for
like a well over an hour and nobody's
gonna steal it their all jackers that's
the thing i mean there's this media
perception that hackers are all evil and
it's a side benefit of having done this
but it's the media star to take notice
and go hackers working with charities
you know and they're like confused by
that well they shouldn't be you know
what I mean so to answer your question
it's been really overwhelmingly positive
to the point that I realized I needed to
focus on you know more in a full-time
endeavor so you got the you got the
technology program you know where we're
looking to connect skills with need the
other thing that we're doing is we're
building classrooms computer classrooms
in East Africa now that's very cool yeah
they so a so are you accepting like
hardware as donations for like for the
the classrooms and whatnot we used to
our first classroom was built entirely
out of donated laptops that we lugged
over in our suitcases most of them made
it over unmolested some of one of them
vanished one of them didn't work it was
expensive it was heavy and so we used to
take hold equipment and try to get it
there it's just too hard and it's too
expensive so what we do now is in about
three weeks our sites going to be up
full steam we're in a temporary phase
right now or I'm letting people know
what's going on click a button you say
I've got this Hardware this service i
donate comes in and says we got a buyer
buyers going to pick up the gear takes a
percentage gives us the rest of the
money we buy computer equipment income
raised so then you get the new stuff and
and it's a great way for me to get rid
of all of those pci cards that are
laying around in my closet absolutely so
we wanted to find a way to use your
upgrade trail most people aren't going
to get rid of perfectly working whole
computers or perfectly working laptops
you throw a linux distro in there or
something that's perfectly fine yeah but
people have crap and we want to take
that turn it into stuff that makes a
difference
sounds like a very rewarding endeavor
yeah and that's part of what i want to
encourage people that are looking into
this is that you know once you connect
with something like that that really
that that really changes starts changing
people's lives it sticks with you you
know it's and it's uh it's addictive
it's part of you know giving yeah is
that it is that it keeps going so we're
we've been encouraged by that so where
can you encourage our viewers to go and
get rid of some of their old hardware
donate some of their their web services
or IT skills yeah our website is hackers
for charity org it's right down here
it's a we also have this the tagline is
I hacked charities we also have I
actuary iceberg and that's what raises
eyebrows you know people are like people
that aren't even into computers are like
dude what's that about yeah and so it's
in our websites our websites pretty
pretty low budget right now because we
were completely revamping everything to
honestly to make up for how slammed
we've gotten and how much interest that
that there is so just check out our
website and go more information thank
you so much Jenny costly appreciate
thanks are at me oh and also the the
pineapple the hak5 pineapple yeah the
awesome guys yeah yeah yeahs know which

awesome pineapple in Robin according to
0 everyone was involved vivix there's a
good project okay somebody donated this
awesome pineapple the whole hak5 team
for our silent auction and people are
going nuts for it yeah it's uh it's our
biggest silent auction item so far it's
exciting i've never not I've never made
a pineapple for anyone else so it's
doing great hell I'd sell them left and
right if they were cheap enough for me
to actually do but that's a little side
business yeah thanks a lot of getting of

I come out squarespace com use coupon
code hak5 supports the show and we love
Squarespace so pretty cool now she's a
five you guys excited yes oh well okay
so um 26 episodes that is a season if
you've ever watched a season of star
trek you know next generation you know
what I'm saying whoo and um and
basically we feel that the the gradient
the gradual production enhancements and
everything that you've seen in season 4
have resulted in actually better content
especially the last quarter of the
season you've noticed leaps and bounds
and the amount of research and the
production quality that we can put into
it and that's because we pretty much
nailed down production go in HD was
really trial by fire you want to say
anything about that there's a pain in
the ass we you know we tried a couple
different solutions we had HD cameras
that were shooting composite into a
garbage mixer and bike problems and all
this other bullshit and finally you know
with the help of you knows your guys
donations it really is now not an issue
we can take everything out of the box so
drop the box set everything up in what
45 minutes less than you know so it it's
it's no longer a you know in the back of
our head is you know it's audio right is
you know this rate is you know my god so
it and now that we've actually conquered
that hurdle I feel like it's it's
definitely much better yeah so we've got
the production all nailed out it's still
a very hacker setup because we didn't go
with the 12 grand mixer we can't afford
the telegram mixer but we put together a
little hack solution for a lot less and
we'll show you guys that soon because
it's it's really inventive and and
whatnot um yeah but it's a hack that
works so we're very happy with it so now
that that's out of our mind we're doing
some excellent stuff so season 5 look
for it next week there's no break or
anything you know we've got as you
saying new set congratulate d and a
gradual we're getting a monkey so that's
oh you can send your questions to evil
serve a heck of an org if you want him
to answer those integers be fun so yeah
I just want to thank you guys for tuning
in and we will see you next week so this
is or igual for season four a pack 50
we're reminding you to trust your techno
list
