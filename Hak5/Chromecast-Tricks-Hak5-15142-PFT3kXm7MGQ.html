by goto assist so a little while back I
decided to invest in this $35 piece of
equipment called the chromecast if you
don't know already the chromecast is
basically Google's device that you can
plug straight into your TV and
wirelessly cast things from your PC or
from your Android or iOS devices it's
very easy to use but so far there
haven't been very many applications that
have actually put it to the test
really so today I wanted to go through
some tips and tricks for things that you
can do outside the norm that Google
doesn't necessarily tell you about
because that's what we're here for right
fun times so first off it does let you
do a couple of things if you want to
watch netflix on it there's a plugin so
that you can play netflix movies and TV
shows directly through their browser
video playback and then you can also do
the same thing on YouTube videos so if I
went over to youtube.com
I'll go to our hak5 video channel and if
I wanted to play any kind of video on
here I could click on our newest video
there's a new little button over here
that says play on TV that's basically
going directly to the chromecast so I
can click on that and it'll play right
behind me on my chromecast now say I
wanted to play something else outside of
this well luckily we have the Chrome
browser you can play local media
actually in your Chrome browser so you
could view slideshows for example or
what have you basically whatever is on
your computer as long as you can access
it in your Chrome browser you can play
it so for example if I go over here to
my other tab I have this picture brought
up of me and Dale singing our song
together SSH to your heart very fun song
now if I wanted to play this on the
chromecast I would just put on the link
right here or just open it directly by
right-clicking and choosing Chrome
browser I would go up here to the Chrome
browser plug-in extension link and I
would choose cast this tab to hat cast
now this is going to automatically cast
to the Chrome browser right
me the chromecast so it's very simple to
use if you want to play directly any
kind of like you know home movies that
you have saved on your computer or what
have you all you have to do is put in
that file link now say you have some
videos from your friends that you want
to share as well if you have plex
installed you can actually share these
as well through your Chrome browser of
course if you want to play something
fullscreen that might be a problem going
forth because if you exit out a full
screen it will also exit out of full
screen on your television on the
chromecast so of course if you don't
already know this which you probably do
alt-tab will make sure that to keep your
chromecast settings fullscreen while
you're still browsing on your computer
yeah I can still do exactly what I want
now also something that's very cool is
screencasting of course you can do
screencasting through tons of different
programs but they don't all necessarily
go to your television unless you have
some kind of internet you know
internet-based TV so what I wanted to do
was actually share my entire desktop so
that I could show people a slideshow of
videos or whatnot not have to
necessarily open it in the Chrome
browser now this is according to Google
experimental but it works just fine it's
pretty flawless for me I'll bet it is a
little bit slow so I'm going to stop
casting this tab and then I'm going to
get a nice little arrow right here in
the corner if I click on that I can to
cast and start entire screen now this is
experiment until of course click on that
and then choose hack cast and it's going
to say do you want the Chrome extension
to share your screen say yes all right
now if I lower this you should see it
right behind me haha there we go so now
I can share anything that I have on my
desktop super easy of course a few
noticeable flaws since this is still
experimental you will not see the mouse
however you will see whenever I
highlight a tab for example so you'll
see if I'm highlighting different tabs
up in the corner or different desktop
links that I have installed or whatnot
so once I'm done looking at different
files or what-have-you I can go down to
stop sharing at the bottom of my screen
and immediately stop sharing and it
should go right back to your regular
chromecast wallpaper on your television
now another couple of things that I did
want to mention audio will not work
whenever you're using screencasting
unfortunately so if you do want to play
music or videos or anything like that
you do want to do those in the Chrome
browser and actually use the Chrome
extension for those specific tabs also
if you do want to play audio it's going
to play directly into your TV so if you
wanted to play into say you have a
really really nice sound system in your
in your living room you'll want to buy
something called an HDMI audio extractor
so this is basically going to pipe audio
into another system other than your TV
now the problem with this though the
chromecast is 35 bucks an HDMI audio
extractor is about 50 bucks so at that
point you're going eighty-five dollars
you're kind of getting into the roku
type of territory so at that point I
would say might want to check out one of
those instead since its well a little
bit easier to set up although you can
hack this one so that might be fun now
one last thing
Google's remote desktop app this will
remote into your local computer in
Chrome
now I know that sounds kind of funny but
it actually does work so say you want to
play some video files in VLC you don't
necessarily want to use Chrome or you
have iTunes installed and you want to
play some music in there some podcasts
or what have you
you can use Google's remote desktop app
and then in Chrome you can remote into
your local computer so you're basically
doing a loop and then play all audio
files in VLC or
video podcasts and iTunes or whatever
you want so if you want even more
options as well under the settings this
is really fun too now this is probably
my favorite part I can go into the
settings on my chromecast so I'm going
to go over to the extension and click on
options and I'm going to get just a few
options not too many in here we checked
out a few of these say let's see okay
just three things that's not really fun
is it yeah I agree I can right-click and
go to inspect element now this is going
to show you just a little bit of code
but there is one
a special one in here I'm going to open
this and see that part that says
display:none so I'm going to double
click that and delete it there's another
one down here display:none double click
that delete that now when I come back up
here go ahead and close that oh I have a
whole lot more options that I can go
through custom mirroring settings as
they call them so I can actually change
minimum bit rates and maximum bit rates
I can change the video buffer speeds
everything that I want to all those
really high techy things that you can't
necessarily get into unless you really
know what you're talking about
now disclaimer if you do change any of
these they might have some consequences
so definitely be careful but if you want
to have some fun yeah why not you can
also use the Team Viewer app on your
iPhone and this is kind of a little
extra to cast to your local PC without
having your PC in the same room so that
will let you use all sorts of different
applications on your phone now one last
thing we did find out that you can route
your chromecast I believe they use a
program called flash cast now this does
require a couple of little extra bits so
I'm planning to do that on a future
episode of hack 5 but in the meantime
now these were about seven or eight
different ideas that I found some
different cool little tricks that you
can do for your own chromecast but if
you have some ideas I want to know about
yours as well because I'm always looking
for ways to actually get my money's
worth out of this thing even if it is
just 35 bucks what can I say I'm frugal
now you can email me or comment down
below about what you think and what you
want to see on in future episode of hack
5 having to do with the chromecast and
coming up soon we'll have a quick break
more and more people are working from
