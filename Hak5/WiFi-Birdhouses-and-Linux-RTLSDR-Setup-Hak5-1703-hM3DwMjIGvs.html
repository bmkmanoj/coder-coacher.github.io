by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen and I'm Shannon
Morse and it's your weekly dose of
Technol us yay we're back in the studio
feels so good to be back I know that
with the bricks it's been a while
should we tell them now wait let's wait
wait yeah yes we love the bricks we have
a um thing happening yay hooray for
thing can I tell you a story about the
changes in my life yeah let's just vent
okay now the vent block so I get really
really tired of the fact that businesses
are still living in like the 1980s and
it drives me nuts
it's freaking drives me nuts so I had to
I have to sign up for health insurance
because we're you know I'm a contractor
I do shows and your hustling is and I'm
hustling right I'm hustling me really
right oh I have to do my own health
insurance as opposed to just going
through my employer so I don't have an
employer I have clients there you go
like mister your kitchen so so I sign up
with this this hospitals health
insurance I'm like cool you know I fill
out a form online and says okay it's
processing and then this guy calls me
and he's like oh we need you to send the
marriage certificate so we can prove
your you know your new relationship okay
could you get this passed he says yeah
spell see spells changes your health
insurance so I was like okay no problem
can I just PDF it to you what email
should I use and the guys like oh well I
don't know how they handle PDFs in the
background so you should probably fax it
so here's the number and I was like what
wait I don't have a fax machine he was
like oh well you can go to pretend X and
pay money to have them fax it for you
and I was like I was like I'm not gonna
go like to use my mileage in my car to
go down the road to some FedEx to have
them send this insecure file to you for
my very like private write you know
confidential piece of paper but it's not
like if you tried to do you know it by
email they would even know what PGP is
now do I have no fur no clue but I
prefer to send it over email as opposed
to just well in fact yes well that
anybody could walk up to me like what's
theirs piece of paper Oh who's there you
know so but I guess I can do that oh
yeah but anyway I could so so especially
with those internet
things we did the hack shot yeah I mean
it's sad that we actually have a goddess
life without you know some of those
clients are so you I sent him the fax
through my friend who just so happens to
have a fax machine at his office I'm
like can you just fax this for me he's
like cool shoot no problem so he sends
it I send the guy a message I'm like hey
I sent over the fax how long does it
usually take and he's like cool once
they get the fax they'll upload it
you mean they're just gonna scan you in
tow PDF I just don't want the same I
love it Oh calm down
good just remind just cordially remind
him next time just ask just like Oh fax
fax I've heard of that wasn't there a
patent on the fax machine from oh that's
right 1909 I had over a hundred years
ago mm-hmm I know look it up totally
crazy pants I had what happened to you a
recent issue that was very similar in
fact called a bank because I needed a
statement and I was like hey can you
just you know send me that statement and
they were like oh yeah we can pull it up
and we can email you a PDF and I'm like
fantastic awesome well they did that and
the PDF was pretty much from like one of
the office big scanner printer copier
machines yeah so the they actually
explain to me the process that they went
to the computer printed out the
statements and then took it to the
copier and scan them into a PDF and
emailed me I'm like this isn't okay
so I call them back and it's like hey
listen that's really that's convenient
but I don't feel like doing all this OCR
which and then don't even say OCR
because they don't understand yeah like
what I'm like hex well I can't read the
stuff she's like oh did it did it was it
not high-resolution or whatever and I'm
like no no it's just that the computer
can't read it she's like well I can read
I'm like I know I can read it - but the
cuter can and so I'm like so they didn't
understand that you you can't select
text it up right because it's a bitmap
yes and so and what's hilarious about
this is I've done 10 years assistant
mins so if I've gotten out of that I
never expected that that give this Bank
tech support but I'm on the phone with
the lady
I'm like so um and I don't have no idea
what's on the other end of this esoteric
program at the bank but I'm just like if
you click file do you see an export or
save options she's like no but I see
save to PDF and I'm like click that how
should I put it on my desktop yes sure
and then she send me the thing and then
I'm like selecting the text I'm like
wonderful I have a she's like this is
gonna save a lot of paper Bank which by
the way when I tried to get them to like
hey just send me your your public key
and you know we can PGP buddies and all
that stuff and they were like oh no no
it's secured on our end I'm like right
right book in between like she's like no
what happens out and she's like like
talk to the network administrator the
network administrator told her to tell
her that they have an automated system
that secures the emails when they come
in oh my god that's so bad we should you
don't feedback a hat cloud org
we will share your horror stories uh
tech horror stories oh you know that
could be an entire 2014 so every now and
then you need to vent so ah I near of
hack five now you get some venting why
is this so okay I'm gonna I'm gonna play
with the antennas and Linux today Nexus
you should put that down we all know
you're doing it backwards you can you
put that down we know what happens
whatever you touch sharp things okay
okay well um yes that is that and then
when we get back there is STRs and stuff
BRB
welcome to Point Richmond this cozy
little community here on the San
Francisco Bay coast that is cornered by
industry like oil refineries and well
the termination of a railroad in fact
some may even say it's the end of the
line figuratively literally it's also a
great proving ground for a fun new hak5
project that involves birdhouses it
seems today everything is getting a
Wi-Fi chip be it a phone a tablet a
thermostat a car and while some may say
Internet of Things I say Internet of
awesome ability to capture and monitor
and log
and well I can stand on this street
corner and take photographs all day of
everybody's unique license plate on
their cars similarly I can use a Wi-Fi
pineapple to automate the process
collecting the unique identification
numbers out of say smartphones that
people carry around everywhere just like
your car has unique number plates your
phone actually has many unique numbers
as well and we can actually pick some of
these up over Wi-Fi and use it to
determine say your manufacturer as well
as perhaps when it was made and then
also using time stamps we can actually
record where it was at certain times and
then come up with awesome heat maps and
other really fun graphs and reports
interestingly here in Point Richmond
there are only three entrance and exits
to the downtown which means that with
only three monitoring stations we could
actually record the occurrences of it
Wi-Fi enabled devices like smart phones
that people carry and then over time
create a database that we can then glean
interesting information about when and
what pathways devices took as well as
even perhaps predicting where devices
would be in the future now if you've
been following the show for a while
you're probably familiar with our friend
the Wi-Fi pineapple which does a
fantastic job of doing monitoring of
this nature the packet that we're
looking for in particular frame in fact
is something that modern smart devices
are broadcasting out all of the time
called a probe a probe request right and
whether there are two broadcasts or to a
particular access point doesn't matter
because in that probe request is
something called the bssid similar to an
e SSID is the name of an access point
the bssid
is the name of the device a lot of times
we call it the MAC address and what's
awesome about it is not only does it
tell us the manufacturer of a device in
this case I could actually tell just
from over-the-air that it was
manufactured by Huawei
but I can actually say hey that's that
unique device and I can see the same
device over and over again over time so
rather than use the Wi-Fi pineapple in
its more traditional role as say a pen
test pivot box or rogue access point
we're going to be focusing on passive
reconnaissance meaning we're only going
to be passively recording information
that's already being
broadcast into the air in the public and
then just snipping out the interesting
bits logging to a file with a timestamp
and then over the course of a couple of
weeks with a few Wi-Fi pineapple
equipped birdhouses should have some
interesting data to analyze so here's
what we have thus far
Wi-Fi pineapple inside of a birdhouse
lots of room to grow here and battery
pack and essentially this is just going
to listen for probe requests log them
with the timestamp to a file I'll be
able to grab this over the course of a
couple of weeks come up with an awesome
database and it just chills they're all
inconspicuous like what's interesting
about this project is it is so
multifaceted of course there is the very
first like let's just make it do the
thing there's the hardware there's the
software there's the analyzing the data
but of course an unending hacker fashion
we're going to continue to over engineer
this to enhance the capabilities and
that should be a lot of fun and here's
what's really going to be great I would
love to get you guys involved so if you
have some awesome ideas of what we can
do with this I will be releasing
anonymized data sets so that you guys if
you have some interesting ideas of how
to otherwise visualize that data or
glean some interesting gems from it come
up with that cool Perl Python regex foo
that should be good I just got to figure
out a way to keep the birds from getting
in
it doesn't matter if you're a fan of
free candy so or open sky or petrol or
logic Lang para techie or if the open
source encryption software has been made
by the government the whole time
no we're fob the skated or a frame or if
a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a
port or free mustaches if you have a
conspiracy theory getting to snag a
domain name and web hosting fast boom up
and running you need a website a website
needs a domain and you can get those
over at doum doum domain comm then get
this domain that come they have a very
quick domain discovery system and a very
easy checkout process you know what that
means
boom up and running I don't know where
this is going to check out the first
female pilots we called aviatrix whoa
the guys over at domain.com huge fans of
hack five Knapp told you time and time
again guys domain calm is awesome
because they're affordable they're
reliable they're easy to use they're
super fun but mainly because they're a
fun place to do business they're active
on social media you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why it's just the fun
guys boom up the rank
there's so much fun to do business with
that these guys there's a me these guys
are fun and crazy and they love hack
five and the one to hook you up so
that's why they came out with very easy
to remember coupon code for hack five
viewers like you
it's called hak5 that it's spelled hack
5 and with it with it at domain.com
checkout you get an extra 15% off whoa
when you think domain names think
domain.com that is that right there yeah
see bear graze
it's time for the trivia question of the
week last week's trivia question was
which scientists notebook are still too
radioactive to handle and the answer was
Marie Curie interesting radioactive so
fun now this week's trivia question is
what was Apple's codename for the iPod
the original iPod you can answer that
over at hak5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hack five
goodies good luck one of our super cool
awesome viewers asked how can I get
rtl-sdr working on Linux well it kind of
depends on which distro you're using but
I decided to go over a few steps today
for example we are still using the handy
dandy little DVR SDR dongle that we've
been using up till now and I know that
we've gone over a little bit of Linux
tutorials but for the most part we've
been using Windows 8.1 for practically
everything up till now so if you are
using some sort of debian linux distro
here are the steps that you can use to
actually compile it and get it running
on here so you can actually get your RTL
SDR dongle running through the terminal
you don't even have to open up any other
programs you can just get it running
straight through your terminal so first
off you want to go ahead and run sudo
apt-get update make sure that everything
is compiled and updated on your sudo
apt-get so we'll go ahead and let that
run real quick okay so that finished and
now we're going to type in sudo apt-get
install git which you most likely
already have get on your computer but
just in case and then we'll do sudo
apt-get install see make oops okay so
now that we've got that you also need to
install this thing called live USB so
this one is a little bit different at
sudo apt-get install a lib Li B USB dash
1.0 dash 0 dot and hit enter so that'll
go ahead and install and then
the last thing you need to install is
sudo apt-get and this one is called
build essentials build essential know s
all right so now that you have all of
those done you can finally get to the
RTL drivers so this is similar to how in
Windows we had to use that zadig thing
to install the drivers with this we're
going to clone a git file from osmocon
so this is get space clone
so this clones it get colon slash slash
Osmo comm org slash rtl-sdr dot git and
then it's going to tell me that it
already exists because I've already
created it before but that's what you
need to actually put in so now we can
see over to our new RTL folder rtl-sdr
and in here you want to make a new
directory called build and it's going to
tell me that already exists again but
you want to make the directory called
build and then change the directory over
to oops
change directory over to build there we
go and we want to now make a file called
D install you Dev rules and then turn
that to on so to do this you type in C
make space dot dot slash space - there's
no space after the - and then you type
in D install under school your score you
dev underscore rules equals on and hit
enter go ahead and let that run and then
you need to make that file so hit make
it will go ahead and build all the
dependencies for that once that
completes type in sudo make install and
then sudo LD config ok so we're almost
done now we need to copy some files over
to the rtl-sdr
rules folder so to do this you type in
CP space dot dot slash rtl-sdr dot rule
and then there's a space slash @ c / u
dev slash rules dot d slash and then hit
enter so that'll go ahead and copy over
oh sorry I forgot to add pseudo at the
beginning I guess I should have done
sudo su huh there we go
okay so now it's copied over so now once
that's completed you want to restart
Linux so everything is all set to go and
then you can plug in your dongle and go
ahead and run another file to make sure
that the rtl-sdr dongle actually works
so we're going to test it in just a
moment so I'm going to go ahead and
restart this
okay so I've restarted my computer I'm
going to plug in my dongle and I'm going
to use the same USB port each time just
in case there's any issues so I'll use
that one right there and to test this we
want to type in sudo RTL underscore test
space dash t it's going to ask for your
password so go ahead and hit that okay
so this is what we should see it should
say found one device your real tech with
RTL 2832 you down under here it should
be using device 0 generic RTL 28 32 you
OEM and then some ported gain values
some more information under there
doesn't really matter all that extra
information but basically that's what
you should see if you see any kind of
errors whenever you go ahead and test
the file that probably means you didn't
install it correctly there most likely
means that the are teal is active if
that's the case you need to disable the
drivers to do that I'm not going to run
this but I'll show you what the command
looks like it's sudo RM mod DVB
underscore USB underscore RTL 28 32 28
30 28 xxxx see you there we go
RTL 28 32 there we go so you run that
and it should stop and disable your
current drivers if they are running
you'll also need to run it again if you
unplug the dongle each time if you do
run into errors the first time and of
course if you see any kind of weird
characters show up when you're doing the
test
most likely means that you didn't
install correctly so go back rewind and
do it again now we can download a file
called the art or a program called RTL
FM so this program is what's actually
going to let it work in your terminal so
you want to start with sudo apt-get
install Sox particularly Sox is a sound
processing program for Linux works
really well with the rtl-sdr dongle that
we're using here so make sure that you
have that on your machine and then
you're ready to go so we can go ahead
and start testing it with some different
frequencies if we want to we can change
the gain and stuff like that so I'm
going to try a wideband FM example so
for this one I'll do RTL underscore FM
it should autocomplete for that and then
mode I'm going to change to WB FM tach F
for the frequency for mine I'm going to
do just a local station 96.5 and ko IT
I'm going to pipe that to play tach our
I'll go through all of these at the end
once we actually make sure that it works
TAC team raw as space Tech e s Tech b16
taxi 1 tech capital v1 tech oops no I
tack there we go ok it sounds like crap
but it works and you can see it playing
here too so if you look at my screen
right now it's in the terminal I'll go
ahead and lower the volume because it
sounds terrible right now but you can
see that it's running right now the
output is giving you an example right
here so I'm up to 700 K it'll just keep
on going and if we scroll up a little
bit you'll see that it's basically
pulling up the realtek device it's going
to make sure that it's on the correct
channel with a sample rate if there is
any replay gain and then you scroll down
a little bit and you can see more
information about it the tuner gain is
set to automatic tuned to
96.7 Hertz so that's the channel that I
tuned to any oversampling that you've
set a buffer size exams examples sample
right and so and so forth
so if you want to quit just hit ctrl C
it'll go ahead and abort for you so
let's pull back up for that and I'll go
through all the different numbers and
characters and options on there so first
off was the tak Capital m this is the
mode so that can be wide BAM F wideband
FM so that's WB FM FM radio is just FM
AM is AM
there's LSB USB and raw and then the
tach s that I have in mind is the sample
rate or the bandwidth tech G is gain
Tech L is the squelch level if you want
to add that tech T is the squelch delay
Tech P is an important one that's for
the ppm offset and then TAC D if you
want to you can do multiple dongles on
here as well with tag D if you have a
capital TAC F that's going to be for any
filters that you decide to add on and
then tech R is output sample rate tech
DS for dongle number tech F is for
frequency obviously you need a frequency
and I think that's it so those are all
my different examples in there
so obviously that works but let's say I
want to do a different one let's say I
want to do you know narrowband FM if I
wanted to do narrowband FM we just put
in FM instead of WB FM for frequency it
would probably be something higher I
don't know a logo on off the top of my
head so I'll just put in something like
that whatever why not we'll see if it
works and and I need to erase the rest
of this
then we'll put in tech book s 12k tech G
so the game will be up to 50 actually
mine's closer to 40 to tech l 70 and
then we're going to pipe this to play
tech R 12 K and we'll do tech Tirol tech
e s Tech b16 tech C L and then v1 TAC at
the end so let's hit enter okay well
that's a bad example okay so obviously
it's a fun program that you can play
with in your terminal and definitely
mess around with the numbers and all the
different options that you can put in so
you can find the one that's perfect for
you if you want more information it's
over at km keen comm they have a whole
tutorial on how to use this program as
well as more information on how to get
all the different options working for
you I just went over a few but there's a
ton on this website so definitely go
over there and learn to your heart's
content including they have information
on how to get better sound quality
because it does sound pretty terrible
when you first pull it up and listening
to multiple frequencies at once which
can be super super fun now this is just
for linux mint this is for debian
distros some linux distros though do
have rtl-sdr pre-installed for you for
example there's one called Andes ham
radio Linux which is the cutest name
ever so this one already has it
pre-installed there's Kali Linux of
course we've run over that one a few
times we've used it for our SDR
tutorials before so you could always
just read just install Kali Linux if you
don't have it already
Porteous which i've never used before
this one has it pre-installed and then
the other one that we've messed around
with a little bit is gnu radio live DVD
so we've used the gnu radio programs
before and that's the whole DVD if you
want that one too so if you've messed
with any of those let me know what you
think of them if I should take the time
and check them out in the meantime
I hope you enjoy RTL FM on Linux and a
comment below and let me know what you
think that's it for me but that's just
var opps up this week's episode of hack
5 but before we get going Shannon I want
to want to ask you something
can you tell me what's in the box uh
well obviously it's a carbon monoxide
detector I think actually it's a baby
monitor actually I think it's one of
those things in the bathroom that's fuse
out nice pineapple leaf fresh smells yes
it's definitely or perhaps in fact a
motion detector oh yes oh or one of
those things that keeps rats and other
rodents away good one test thingy or um
check out the ominous box we're really
proud of it it's literally a box but
it's a box with a pineapple in it and
some awesome circuitry with a little
test button and a buzzer and LEDs and
fun stuff it passes the sniff test and I
do know for a fact now that how long has
it been since we went to is August
DEFCON yeah when we go to DEFCON 3 weeks
ago has it been three about yeah okay
alright I'll report back but so far
three weeks I can still log into the
pineapple in the place oh that's uh we
have permission and it's really fun so a
check a shop comm is where you can
support us directly with the fun
inventive stuff that we are doing there
and we absolutely value it your direct
support that way and you you can also
follow us and let us know what you think
yes I have the Twitter's and stuff
yes you can a check a five dot org slash
follow is where all the links are you
can also email us if you super super
hate it when we go off-topic and talk
about strange box or if you have crazy
tech horror stories we should just have
like for Halloween we send them in oh
yeah yes and we will change all the
names you know we won't we won't mention
the fortune 500 that this camp other
seeds are emails feedback at hack 5s
where you can send all those crazy
stories yes and with all of that
I'm Darrin kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
