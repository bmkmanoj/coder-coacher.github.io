mash shop with Yahoo pipes a Windows
PowerShell GUI helix the open-source
forensics distribution plus a ton of
hack snacks to get your grub on
foundation okay stuff yeah we're done
what's the show that was it done bingo
what that was it man
router passwords com you know you're in
your car your wardriving you come across
an open wireless network hey what was
the default password to try and obtain
access to this linksys router we can go
to router password scom find the router
make and actually get an entire list of
all passwords and usernames that came
defaulted on that specific piece of
equipment rated right here we've got an
avid tech networks protocol multi admin
and there is no password router password
com find more tips like this at forums
hak5 org so I go to the hak5 satellite
I've noticed that there's this new
little portion on the bottom right side
where you bring people's uh looks like
RSS feeds in from blogs and things how
do you do that cuz I've I can't figure
out how to there's no plugin that i
found that does that for sure so yeah
that was kind of one of the things that
we did when we did this site redesign
was I wanted fresh content from all the
people that are involved with Axl I
wasn't just boring you know well it's
not a are you doing this like boy you
know what I mean it's 30 there's 30 days
in between the episodes that always
something you know your rashee and yeah
and we have you read right we have the
announcement blog okay but I mean aside
from that you're right there is a noise
press content so one of the things that
I've tried to do is pulling from those
RSS feeds whether it be from the forums
or uh you know your blog and Paul's blog
if you ever had one Matt and you know
you need a movie made a blog fault yeah
so so yeah the way I did that was using
a service from yahoo called yahoo pipes
okay that basically lets you take make a
mash-up of web services using RSS and
atom and cool web standards without
building your own tubes on the internet
exactly okay but this is so cool because
you don't need to know any programming
skulls all right you just need to just
drag stuff around it's so super simple
okay I don't know programming yeah so I
mean I only pretend to be a programmer
and dabble in PHP but if I were to try
to do this myself it'd be just be way
too difficult so Yahoo makes it simple
because we get this crazy squid looking
thing that is the the source code of my
feed generation okay so explain to me
what's going on
hear what what are these boxes yeah so
what happens is rather than programming
in you know functions and code and stuff
like that we just drag these little
boxes into this edit area here and we
connect them with like a vizio format
where you're doing dragon boxes around
looks kind of like that yeah and then
we've got these connectors that we use
to to you know take the output video
information and do things to it yeah we
so for example this one right here we
take the feed from mobic and you know
it's his feedburner feed from his blog
we get the name muaks and the output of
that goes into a rename function and
then that goes into a regex function
which is like regular expressions and
that's how we strip out some of the HTML
and fix up some stuff we truncate it to
to just the latest too so you want to
walk my swapping through building one of
these and with that way we can get a
better picture of how what each step is
and you know how do we actually go and
get a finished product sure well first
thing you need to do obviously is go
ahead is find a good of pipes tell yahoo
com you need yahoo login and from there
you just you can browse their directory
okay which is you know vast and and and
interesting this great place to start is
to look at other people's code okay so
for example i found this really neat
pipe that somebody built called the
price the craigslist price watch okay so
what they did is they created a couple
of input modules that allows me to tell
it what I'm looking for and a price
range and then it searches the feed okay
so i was looking for ipods between 1,500
bucks and you know didn't find anything
that interesting but it's that's kind of
a yeah it's kind of cool so another cool
one is this this porn TV you know series
downloader so this is a pipe that
somebody created that allows you to
search the feeds of I don't know various
I think it's mininova yes so I searched
for battlestar galactica and it shows me
some feet there's some results here and
if I'm trying to make something similar
that's like probably the first place
head start is you grab that and then
build on right so what I want to do here
is view the source and that's great you
can view the source of everybody's feet
of pipes and you can see I've got a
input here okay and the output of that
goes to a URL builder that
looks through the surface and then look
for a specific query yeah and you really
just kind of play around with these you
click into them and when you click these
boxes here at the bottom here what
happens is you get this this neat little
debug window that allows you to take a
look at the night of the code exactly
well this is what the output looks like
quantum processes right so we can look
at the output of this module it's you
know if the series name was heroes
that's what it would look like and then
we click in here and we can see what all
of these look like until finally we have
it looking like what we want it to and
that's the output here of latest
episodes of heroes if that's what you
were searching obviously we don't
download these things no I mean
obviously so no somebody's piping and
discretion when it comes to copyright
infringement but yes so what I started
looking for was a way that I could take
rather than just the latest fee the
latest blog post from Darren and the
lathe blog post from you so you never
said so there wasn't a separate section
for each person hey I would get kind of
complicated that way yeah I take up too
much I just wanted the latest from my
friends so I really just used this Union
operator here okay and then into that I
plugged in a whole bunch of feeds okay
okay so the real simple one is is your
feed right here so there's much type in
this operator here that just I just
enter in the name Chris and I give it
your feed I use this operator to
truncate it I put in the Union and then
from there I just use a sort to make it
so that the most recent items are first
so let's go ahead and add one so I've
got a blog here that's snubs ecomme it's
and if I click the RSS for that and I
can copy that feed I'll go back to my so
when you create a new one other other
templates so you already have looks like
my pipes down here you already have your
own sets of you create this yourself no
well what happens is all of those pipes
that are in the directory you can use
within your own pipe oh I so they're
kind of like functions in programming
language so or classes like you're a
library of yeah so one of them was this
ad feed with label okay
I'm going to drag that in here you see
the normal source is one that comes with
it is just it just gets a fee Darrell it
doesn't do anything to ads just called
fetch feed you give it the URL but you
can't give it a name so for this one I
use somebody else's feed which used
regex expression and that's a little
redundant but just use that and then a
couple other operators that allowed them
to add a name to the prefix of the way
you tell you we're reading somebody
else's yeah so for this i'll give it a
Fenian snubs and give it the URL to the
feed and the next thing i want to do
here is just truncate it right so so we
don't want to pull the entire front page
of the site we'd yeah a couple of them
they just want the first two so for that
I'll good and operators I'll talk about
a lot of them there and pull in and
truncate I'll drag the output of that to
the input of this then I'll be out okay
and then you would do two and then drag
the output of that it would let your
names to me and there we go and your
Union pumps out all the stuff right to
your right i click on my you wanna know
too when they click on my union and look
at my debugger it's got a preview of
what they would look like before it goes
to the next one which is my truncate and
then it instead of having the source
instead of having to save it and refresh
and yeah go back and forth between the
windows and this doesn't require flash
or silver light or air or any of that
crazy stuff this is all just done with
javascript is JavaScript yeah so we have
note so I have to enable my no script of
course yeah but it's as simple as that
and there are so many more pipes to
browse through the directory and get
some ideas of fun things you can do
whether it be geo-tagging flickr
pictures on a yahoo map or just
combining your friends much anyone
content that exists in some kind of feed
form you can just pull it and do
whatever you want with it as a fun
little mashup tool that's where that's
what I our programming experience yeah
Wow so uh where can we find more of your
work daring I know there's this podcast
yeah I don't know I've seen it before
well I've started blogging again I
Darren can channel that net yeah I seem
to revive that yeah and yeah I was able
to recover my wordpress database from
2005 yeah what's really cool know that
you just find the show notes for this
yeah heck fire
place
I've ever wanted to check the strength
of your passwords online there's a lot
of sites out there that do that for you
and one is called password meter com I
like it especially because it actually
grades you on the passwords that you put
in there plus or minus points for
different requirements so I have a
password of my clipboard here that i'm
going to paste in and there it is and it
says i'm very strong i score one hundred
percent i get a plus 56 for the amount
of characters and it looked like minus
eight four consecutive lowercase
characters so you want to watch that
when you type in passwords you'd want to
repeat characters for more tips like
this forms dot hack five dot org so for
the longest time administrating windows
has been like trying to give bomber a
sponge bath not so much fun with all the
gooey and the clicking around but then
with Longhorn days they came up with
school new magical thing called monad we
now know it is powershell it's finally
like a unix way to actually interact
with the operating system without the
clicky clicky and typing typing instead
and well Matt thanks come down to show
us how to turn the type you typing into
the clicky clicky yeah the type II type
he is really nice because it's extremely
powerful and with a lot of these new
manufacturers realizing that you know
with the release of windows server 2008
and with vista you know that the
powershell which is it as it's now
called is a reality it you know not that
it's forced on you you don't need to
download it if you have Windows XP or
anything like that but it is a free
download for you to test and play with
so for anybody that's not really
familiar with the basically powershell
is two windows as bash is to linux
exactly now in powershell itself there's
a lot of if you're setting up exchange
if you're setting up office
communications server a lot of the
microsoft specific servers they require
a lot of PowerShell commands to actually
get working it's a little confusing at
first because you need to know what the
millions of different options are just
like any command line interface to very
brain with whether it be does you know
TCL whatever right exactly so as an
example here what I'm going to show you
guys is a GUI front end for the
PowerShell however a GUI in a man
of it will actually help you learn the
commands that you want to run but we're
not taking two steps for and then
another step back right exactly so we're
not going from GUI to command line to
GUI and then forgetting about the
command line again if you want you can
do all the administration from the GUI
but it's also going to show you how to
actually use PowerShell so PowerShell in
itself looks pretty much just like a
regularly cooling backslash blinky
blinky man problem however we do have
the PS precursor ah so it stands for a
PowerShell means hey you're in the
PowerShell don't take anything up so
we're going to go ahead and type get
dash service and we're going to use
service as an example here because we
don't have an ad an Active Directory
domain in the house so what we're going
to do is just use commands that we can
pull from the local machine here that
we've got an example so there are all
local machines right but this the same
principles then apply to whether if it's
active directory administration or I is
or right know what have rounds now there
are there are some plugins that you're
going to need if you're going to do like
enterprise-wide management but those are
all available from the website so we're
going to do a service list we're gonna
get all the services that we've got and
in its standard state you might as well
just have opened up you know the the MMC
for the services yeah you know shows us
what's running the actual service and
then its description now what we can do
actually in here this is power GUI this
is the PowerShell front-end provided by
Quest Software it is free even though
question char jizz in inordinate amounts
of money for their software this one
happens to be free so what we can do
here is get a list of current running
services we're going to go ahead and
refresh and it's actually going to show
us basically just what you would see in
the standard MMC services snapping now
that being said we can then go in here
and see what it actually ran to get
those results so this is much like if
you're familiar with something like
Dreamweaver or microsoft frontpage
you've got the one
but that's like your fun little design
GUI drag crap around then your other top
being here's actual code that made that
happen right exactly so basically what
we did is we ran get dash service okay
now while it did you know for each loop
we just listed them all out sure the
nice thing about this is a lot of us you
know when we're on a server or something
like that we'd like to see what's
running you know say we want to know if
a service is up and running if it was
supposed to start automatically but
hasn't sometimes going through that list
and sorting and you know all that happy
horse s it's a common thing when you
boot up a server something's not running
what's the first thing you check
services what set to automatic and of
those automatic ones which ones aren't
started right exactly so here we can
actually go back to the UI tab and
automate this somehow we can create a
filter that we're going to say ok the
property that I want is I want the
current status equals stopped okay I
want the property of startup startup
type 2 equal auto and then what it's
going to do is we're gonna go ahead and
hit apply and up look at that the
Security Center is stopped but it's set
to are automatically and print spooler
well here we can actually select this
without having to go into the services
snap in and actually start the the
service gives you a bunch of options you
know what do you what do you want to do
and we just hit okay and it should start
it and now that's left over is the
security thing exactly so after we've
done all that we can go back and see
what actually it ran to start the
service so now we have some code that
corresponds with what filter that we
just made so now we can copy that make a
what is a CMD file or a batch file type
dealy I'm not exactly sure what what
scripts I mean you can run powershell
scripts in a CMD or you know dot bad i
believe as you know
as long as you invoke the PowerShell
first sure they're not going to run on a
basic just like you would invoke a wmi
script right exactly so from there you
know you can you know Dyson decipher it
you can dissect it you know is whatever
working it once exactly yeah great way
to get familiar with this kind of stuff
the the current snap-ins plugins that
are available right now are for Active
Directory for exchange 2007 management
and a couple other basic applications
right now as far as powershell
integration is concerned vmware is
working on a plug-in for powershell so
you can manage virtual machines from the
power shell scripting i know i think
there's like a list of over 250 big-time
corporations that are actually creating
scripts for the powershell so that you
can automate all this sounds like
windows will finally get the power that
unix has had for years i know and it's
about time I mean that's always been as
system administrators our biggest
complaint but now I mean you've got you
know the power of the PowerShell and a
GUI now maybe not replace all the
functionality what well I mean if you're
going to do these tasks on your act
objector on your local machines anyway
with the GUI you might as well use this
GUI so that you're at least learning
some stuff that you can then apply in
the future sounds like a lot easier than
just jumping in headfirst and learning
commands yeah yeah which is never fun no
you know so this one by example right
exactly and the other thing is on your
right pane really quick it's got a bunch
of actions that are common for whatever
plug-in you're using whether it be local
a B whatever so you don't have to go
hunting for those you know hidden
commands that right so hard to find you
use this in the device manager you could
use this in local users and groups
exactly and you can add items as as many
as you want you know common actions it
really is a nice piece of software
especially for being free especially for
when it comes to automating yes that
kind of stuff that that not necessarily
replacing the administrator but making
his life yeah exactly that's what I
that's date and then you'd have more
time for beer more beer time less work
time love it thanks so much where can
people find more of your work uh they
can find it at half
five there you go along with the show
notes and all that other fun stuff
exactly oh yeah all right do you think
that no problem
all right there so what was last month's
trivia question that's ones trivia
question was bout to my firewall oh it
wasn't where was it what was going on
and who gotta read this correctly answer
but dids and he writes bout to my
firewall was made by the shmoo group as
an advertisement for shmoocon 2006 very
nice congratulations did and it's a fun
video you just you gotta check it out
that's pretty much the gist of it go
enjoy my photo wall and you can't go
wrong it was a difficult trivia question
I know hence the thousands of responses
oh I got this one yeah and the guy that
keeps answering about the freeze pop
things and a couple episodes ago we got
it so this month so this month's trivia
question is a toughy to make up for last
month's trivia question this month's
trivia question on a Apple to see what
was the chip directly behind the video
port on the main board of the Apple to
see if you get it right I will buy you a
shirt and send it to you so if you get
it right so you have to come up with the
name of the chip all right you want to
give any hints as to like any no
physical attributes nope just directly
behind the video port so you know go to
your flea market grab yourself an apple
to see or if you've got one laying
around in the house I don't I don't want
that Olivia I don't want a model number
I don't want a serial number off the
chip I want the name of the chip alright
be as it as it were as it were alright
sounds good and of course you can submit
your answer to trivia at hak5 org it
love to hear what you think about that
and of course trivia is brought to you
by our friends over at godaddy we have a
cool thing going on with godaddy calm
right now and that is not only can you
get awesome domain names with ten
percent off using the coupon code jha k
but you can also get ssl certificates
for ten percent off they start at
twenty-nine ninety-nine a year which is
phenomenal trust me i bought three of
them I thought with the coupon code
and it's it's painless you mean if the
$29 tificate you sign up and you've got
your certificate ready in like five
minutes like that i mean if you've ever
dealt with any of the other people on
get nessa tells a little bit difficult
you got to have the DMV numbers or
faxing in whatever it makes it really
simple and tell those people that I love
you rose dream Oh skills I'm just
telling you to go to godaddy on this one
because I've been everywhere else and
nobody's got a better price to save
yourself some money on the ssl cert to
keep your login secure and you can get
that at godaddy.com coupon code h a cape
and I totally went off script on that
but whatever cuz it works yeah so let's
go check out some snackies mmm yummy
have you ever had that issue where
you're trying to copy some stuff in one
place to another and then this that one
file that's like I don't know when you
sore Windows thinks it's doing something
and it just fails the entire copy
because of that one file how ridiculous
don't you wish you could just like
ignore that I'll get back to it later
right or maybe you're just trying to do
some recovery and you need it to like
try a few times well Windows Explorer
file copy is the socket so definitely
check out roadkill's unstoppable copier
this thing is freaking sweet you go
under settings and you have like a
plethora of different options here for
the ways that you want to keep
attributes or the ownership the
time/date stamp you know damaged files
whether you want to skip them retry and
whatever you can pick this up at
roadkill net it's free it's for win it
windows and linux so you're not left out
in the cold and it has saved my butt
just a few times when it comes to those
servers that are busy with some files
anyway check it out and for more tips
like these hak5 org slash forms alright
so Chris girling is here to help us
system administrators who may have
forgotten something when we actually set
up our security in our networks and may
have been come quote-unquote compromised
he's here to show us off helix 3 both
the windows and the Linux components
Chris what do we got for today ok I've
been on instant response seen before and
basically we have this open source
distribution is based on knockin topics
and it's a collection of tools that
allow you to do forensic investigation
and
election in the event that you have a
system that was compromised so I'm going
to go into the windows part first
there's windows and linux you can boot
it up into linux or you can put it right
into your Windows computer now as far as
this Windows component is concerned what
is the purpose of the windows component
you know when would we actually use this
you know when okay the purpose of the
windows part of it is before you shut
the Machine down that you think has been
compromised most malware malicious code
and things like that it has built-in
detection capabilities so if you do
certain things in the machine it will
try to cover its tracks so if you issue
the shutdown command it will know that
you're trying to do that and start
clearing out event logs and things like
that trying to kind of erase the damage
it's done to an extent so the time and
you make the when the forensic
investigator goes in there he's you know
a little stymied so you would put the
window side in first obviously we have
to be a windows server which you'll find
out a lot and it allows you for the most
part you use it to capture what's in
memory running so the virus is running
in memory and you capture it and that
way when you shut this machine down of
course you lose everything that's in ran
right so this is important for your
first step to collect any anything that
might be running and then your second
step would be good to go to the Linux
I'd actually image apart okay so we so
we've we've gone to the point of oh my
god I think I've been hacked and now
we're going to proceed to collect
information on what happened and process
it and so let's go through that all
right so when you when you pop your CD
and you're going to come up with this
there's an exclusive license agreement
and then you come up with the helix
window right here and there's all
there's these different tabs in here
system information acquire the live
image using DD which is a Linux tool for
copying hard drives and Incident
Response tools is where we have our Ram
collection and there's some documents
where you can go in and have to click on
it and it'll power up there we go so
yeah it has different forms and manuals
and things like that and the rest of the
options just have different things like
image searching and things like that
okay so what we want to go to is when we
want to collect our actual RAM and
everything
we're going to go to the winds windows
forensic tool chest okay and we're going
to run that and I'm just going to select
I just made a helix folder here okay and
except i'm gonna make a new folder
because i did make a did this once
already so everything that I dump is
going to go into this folder okay and
there's some there's some options you
can set there's different tools that
they run different special tools that
take along some of them take a longer
time to run than others and some of the
stuff you don't need okay I'm not going
to run the special tools because they
just take too long but there's they
collect different types information like
this one collects mac addresses and
things like that sniffs traffic anything
that the virus might be doing okay so
i'm going to click no to that you would
just type in a case number if you had
one your name so i'm going to do my name
you're about to run and now it tells you
what the command is your running okay
and then you say is this okay yes and
then it'll bring up an actual command
window and it's running this windows
forensic tool chest so here you're
running interact so then you just go
through a bunch of other prompts mm-hmm
and I just you just Steve most the time
you'll just default to pretty much
everything okay and then default path
okay and then for this one I'm just
going to do the c drive okay and the
essence already put that in Chris so
we're just going to go through these
prompts you can actually hash the data
so you can verify it they actually did
it correctly md5 sha-1 okay i just use
default md5 and do you want to run the
tools or slow we're not going to do that
here now in real-world cases you would
actually click yes to all right
different tools you want as much
information as you can get and you do
not want to run tools that can write to
the source system unless you really know
what you're doing and you really
understand exactly how the system is
built because this is meant to not touch
the hard drive and things like that so
we cannot have an impact on what you're
actually coli so you don't corrupt your
everetts okay so i'm going to go to know
and we want to use i'm going to do hdmi
reporting is it Sally easy to read and
no prompting so it'll just run
and then do you want to automatically
open the complete report I actually me
to know because i don't have the HTM
files tied to my browser and is that
okay yes and it'll run and it doesn't
really take that long it'll go through
and there's a I think design it says
they're 139 different executive bills is
running okay and they'll run through
them fairly quickly it might take about
a minute or so and while it's doing that
I'm going to go over to linux side a
little bit i think i can just yank this
and put it over here said all right Paul
okay so well just because it takes about
two or three minutes to run all right so
now on the leg side this is what you
would go into after you've already done
the windows side which we're doing right
now yep we're right water letting that
run and then you would go into the Linux
side and this is primarily used for
imaging the actual hard drive so you can
make a copy of it did for bit and then
you can give it to your friends account
list and he can do whatever he wants to
it load it up you know run everything
and that we'd have to worry about
compromising original harddrive is that
that goes in a bag stays and never gets
touched again all time it comes out is
in court yep so here we'll go in and
there's a bunch of different tools
instant response but we're concerned
about there's forensics tools okay
there's different things in here X
editors but we're not going to go into
those the first one is adept oh and
there's there's two or three different
tools i'm here to do the same thing i'm
just using this one because it's a
little easier to to see what we're doing
okay so i already had a case created on
here and i have an external hard drive
because most time you're going to you
want something where you can push this
image to write you know if this sid
machine example is a for example as 30
gigs okay so i have an 80 gig drive so
we're going to we're going to click go
on here and it'll bring up all your
devices HD asda so i'm going to click
HDA and then i'm going to go to acquire
and then on here it pulls up here's my
device name okay and on my mount point
all right actually it didn't show up in
there oh I didn't it didn't actually
showed before it'll show up though so
I'm going to go from HDA to SDA and I'm
gonna leave everything default you can
select different types of options we're
just going to DC LED which is a it's
just a more advanced version of DD nope
that's all it is md5 it's a kind of
similar to the stuff we were running
over here and I'm going to click start
and it'll automatically and acquire the
drive now this one there's nothing on
either these drives so it's going to go
pretty quick okay and I think it's well
actually this fair if I failed I think I
already had copied it once and it won't
snot going to copy over itself again
that's home but the sense there's no
data it doesn't really matter right but
you would just click start and it'll
copy bit for bit everything it's on that
hard drive and put on the external drive
so and then the other tool that we use
is 4x4 any case which is the accepted
forensics investigation software in
court okay it's been tried and tested
and there's different file formats so
with DD you just get a straight up linux
TV you know image with linen you can
actually make an in case file so that
it'll open native leaning in case in
case won't open DD files natively okay
at least on the versions we have so on
here we just click a choir and it lists
all your disks and we choose HDA and
we're going to do / dev sda1 and i'm
just going to actually i'm just going to
put it default in there you would create
your own folder structure based on the
case you know right information that you
wanted we don't have an alternate path
same thing as in the other one case
number and it doesn't with the stuff
doesn't really matter right now and
we're not going to use compression it
takes a while I'm not going to generate
a hash on this you obviously want to
write no password and usually want to
make the max file size so you can
transfer it easier mm-hmm
and then it'll go through nope it's too
small I think it's our stuff on there
already I did this once before and I
think because I copied it over already I
ran out of room no so let's go back over
to the windows side because i think it's
a it's almost done its hashing right now
but that's that's pretty much it i will
actually switch over real quick so
basically the process flows all gotta
think i've been hacked something to the
sort going to go through copy you know
what's running on you know my mission
critical server would it be you know
your exchange server whether it be you
know a sequel server or something else
like that acquire the information call
the authorities or whoever if you've got
you know in your endurance team exactly
and then let them take it from there and
that will allow you to a cover your ass
and be assist the guys who are going to
be and probably looking at you know
what's going on okay and possibly put
the guy who did it behind bars so if at
all possible if at all possible so i
guess the hash in is going to take a
little while but we don't need to see
the ending of that so and obviously this
this is a very quick the actual process
of doing this takes hours and you would
dot you have to write everything down
yeah document everything and they give
you a lot of good I think I showed this
before it actually gives you a chain of
custody form I don't have adobe install
on this laptop but it gives you all the
forms that you might need now you might
even have your own house team and
everything's but that's that's helix
alright well thanks Chris and if you
guys need a forensic help I'm sure Chris
will have some some links in the show
notes lay around and whatever we've
already cut and not
now when you open your browser it's
pretty typical to have a few sites that
you go to every day for example your
email social sites and various blogs now
one way to do this of course is to type
in the entire URL which save which waste
some time so if you want to save that
time and some finger muscles here's a
quick tip we found on the hak5 form
submitted by inside iya now all you have
to do is go to your bookmarks right
click for properties then type in an
abbreviation or even a few letters that
you want to use instead of typing in
that URL so for Darren kitchenette we're
going to do DK now we select ok and now
we go to our browser instead of typing
in the whole darren kitchen com DK enter
and there you go for more tips like this
check out the forms at hak5 dot org
alright so that just about wraps up this
episode of hak5 release that's how it's
usually done yeah so trust technol us
tonight
alright so that about wraps up this
episode of hak5 hope you guys enjoyed it
but before we get out of here we've got
some bills to pay and one of those bills
be in dreamhost it definitely I've been
with them since 2005 I actually recently
recovered my wordpress blog my 1.1 blog
over there that i use the one-click
install to get going back in the day and
it's back them going and a lot of fun so
dreamhost calm is where you can get
yourself you know your nice little web
hosting with you know just gigs and gigs
and terabytes and Terry got 500 gigs
worth of storage they got five terabytes
where the monthly transfer a lot of one
click installs as Darren was just saying
so it's really easy to set up a blog
form whatever you guys want to do six
months six bucks a month you can't go
wrong and if you sign up using coupon
code HHA the number five you get twenty
five dollars off your order so saving
you some dough keeping us on the air

working on some new swag for you guys
like to get your opinions on those and
guys remember don't whine dunk bone
don't yell just trust your techno luffs
helix an open source does stuff it's got

your the doors doo dah dah deep dude i
found an english translation and I was
like and that's not english no no no
never let us know when you're recording
and if we vary tell you to stop
recording don't can we call them hack
