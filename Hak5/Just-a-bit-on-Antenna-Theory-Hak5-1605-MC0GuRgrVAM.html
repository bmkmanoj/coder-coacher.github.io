by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen this is your
weekly dose of Technol us we've got a
fantastic show you for you guys today
i'm playing with balloons I'm here with
my co-host Shannon
what's up Shannon doing good how are you
I'm alright I'm playing with the
audience hey what's up audience I'm
throwing balloons at you hey hi what's
going on not much
why do we have balloons we have balloons
because we're talking about in tennis
one of my favorite subjects what an
antenna have to do with a balloon up not
a whole lot but it is great for
illustrating things oh okay yes you're
like Bill Nye the Science Guy no not
really
Oh illustrate things with balloons ooh
ooh and there you go don't put that near
the Flynn here's your copper wire copper
isn't it
there you go did you know that
everything in the universe has a charge
everything like my cell phone my laptop
you oh yeah that's true yeah you
probably have a neutral judge like
sometimes a knight no don't put that
near me anyway um yeah I just thought
that's that's pretty cool bring up
because we've been having fun
discussions about all sorts of
university things lately and you know
it's good to go back and remind
ourselves that everything does
everything has a charge just like you
and I are probably neutral I'm probably
positive because I'm just I'm like a
positive person you're such a him yeah I
know I might be and likewise that copper
wire here we go this copper wire has
loosely held electrons so this is really
cool because if I apply voltage to one
end of this it's gonna go ahead and
create a flow of electrons or current
which is great cuz then we can make
circuits yeah it's fun right well it's
one of the aspects of electromagnetic
stuff that we've been talking about
recently
aka radio and we will be getting into
practical stuff here but I would like to
bring up that if you remember from
primary school in science class and
stuff that every atom is made of all
these cool protons and electrons
neutrons that right well as such if
these particles were to say be
negatively charged they would
exhibit an electromagnetic field or just
an electro field they're crazy like feel
an electric field around them they just
would that's just how it works
don't ask me why is the universe and so
if this negatively charged particle
travels through the universe at the
speed of light because you know that's
what particle eyes are wanting to do
it's going to go ahead and cause a
disturbance through all of the other
fields that it passes isn't that
fantastic so it's gonna make them all
like oh oh yeah they're gonna go up
because because they created look at
they were like they're like your
daughter's um niggas political yeah yeah
chill out dude watch my growl negative
right Fran umm and so this is really the
essence of what we're talking about here
when we're transmitting with radio and
when we're picking up these fields and
noticing the disturbances of them and
it's really exciting I mean as we said
last week electromagnetic fields are the
combination of both electric and
magnetic fields and this was actually
really well displayed
explained way way before I ever could
imagine anything back really because I
thought you were really old I am in fact
a vampire I come from the 1800s and I
was friends in fact with this Scottish
fellow he was a physicist by the name of
James Clerk Maxwell I always knew your
Scottish yes well no no not anyway
actually I might be hang on my last
name's kitchen all right that that
notwithstanding there are four equations
from this guy Maxwell that are known as
the Maxwell equations and when we couple
these with a couple of other other laws
basically we can define electro
magnetics as we know in the universe
today and it's really complicated
formulas that I don't want to get into
right now and it's likely that we are
never in this series going to have to
describe these in any given detail
however they are super cool because they
essentially describe the beautiful
relationship between the two aspects of
electro magnetics
let's get it all yeah do that
alright so electric field
as we know right electric fields or e
are basically measured in volts per
meter
though not always and then we have our
magnetic fields or H and they're
basically measured in amps per meters
and so okay get this here we need to
know that necessarily should I be taking
it's not on the test no what's a it's
just good to have kind of like a
background understanding of kind of how
this works so that when you're like
setting up your antenna to be antenna to
be attenuated by a certain frequency and
so that you're kind of understanding
that it's like what these things are
it's not magic it's physics right so
we've actually got a plane here and
we're going to go ahead and look at the
electric field traveling through space
and what not so let's go ahead and see
here that on our y-axis right we're
going to see that just like before when
we were looking at say last week we were
looking at these waves and the amplitude
of them so we were only looking at them
and really one in like two dimensions
yeah we were looking at them as drawings
2d yeah and so if we look at it in 3d
space what we're really going to notice
here is that this electromagnetic field
is made up of both say in this case a
green is going to be our electric field
right and so this would be e e for
electric yes and what's beautiful about
this is it's going to give rise to this
magnetic field here that is going to not
look absolutely horrible because I'm
trying to shift my brain into so it's
kind of like behind it and then it's
above it and above it that looked
horrible so Mason try to control Z right
now well show us with your hands well
okay thank you that'd be a little bit
better okay so if we have like our
electric field unlike this we have one
right up and down then we've got our
magnetic fleur-de-lis rules right like a
school of fish right and then the they
meet now and then they do it I mean they
intersect and they do this really
beautiful like relations
between them I mean essentially what we
have is an electric field that when it's
traveling through space it gives rise to
a magnetic field that's traveling
through time which then gives rise to a
electric field traveling through time
which gives a rise to a magnetic field
traveling through space and so on and so
forth and essentially what you have is
these this beautiful relationship
between electric and magnetic traveling
through time and space that's crazy so
cool it's curly I like it
so does does that ever change um well we
manipulate it as we talked about last
week when we modulate the signal in that
case and I mean I just wanted to bring
this up because I find it it's really
beautiful but essentially all of this
takes us back to the practical theory of
antennas because this right here is
essentially what we're going to be doing
when we build antennas and we start to
go ahead and transmit and harness the
these propagated signals oh yeah so I
mean essentially an antenna as you
probably know it's just it is
essentially a structure that supports
this kind of radiation that we're super
excited about and there are so many
aspects about antennas and we are going
to cover just a few of them here very
briefly not all of them and not any kind
of depth that is going to get you any
kind of classification of a ham license
or anything of that regard however I'm
pretty sure if I'll end there and keep
going he would pretty much take up your
entire day with an episode I do love
this stuff yeah right I did too I think
it's awesome yeah and then you know it's
it's cool because we just take this for
granted yeah and so much on the show
we've been like hey we said this you
know you we send this frame here right
we're like not even OSI level where it's
like we got our application layer and we
got you know or our physical layer and
we've got like our politics layer and
our money layer but anyway um this is
like crazy physics layer yeah right
which is pretty cool because we're not
even like hey send a frame with this
octet of that thing and you know what
well you know like when you do like a D
off attack all right so like rather than
talk about that we're like breaking it
really down to like the weave part
this is cool so when we transmit right
we're really talking about with our
antenna the propagation okay and
propagation is essentially a behavior of
our transmitted radio waves and there's
a lot of factors that come into play
when it comes to propagation we have
polarization there's refraction there's
the atmosphere there's water vapor
you've got the ionosphere you've got the
frequency that we are using have a
different aspects that they are like you
know some frequencies go through cement
really great now there's an answer well
you know human bodies were you know ugly
bags of mostly water so you know we
absorb a lot of frequencies and it's all
really cool but essentially when we're
talking about propagation we're just
talking about spreading you know a
signal from one place to another so if I
take a look here am I very very very
poorly drawn I want to redraw this so
bad
don't touch a here's I get more make
sure that I put an H here to represent
that that is magnetics it's wanting to
be that we're looking at this signal
being propagated in this direction okay
and so let's talk about polarization
because we're looking at it right now so
the propagation of our signal is going
to be impacted by our antennas
polarization and so typically what we do
here is we actually use the electric
field to determine what the polarization
might be and you see right here the
electric field and the y-axis there and
so we could say that this for instance
is a horizontally polarized Oh field but
I don't have a cool you know yes in fact
we could take this entire thing right
here on the table and or our antenna
practically speaking and we just rotate
it 90 degrees and now we'd have a
vertically polarized antenna okay yeah
which is really cool because say you're
over there with your Wi-Fi pineapple
right yes and I'm over here with my yogi
okay so here's the quiz the only quiz
you're going to find on today's episode
of the shows if your little dipole
antennas are sticking straight up like
that
where should my antenna be huh you can
answer in the comments below
oh I can't answer it no I'll answer it
afterwards but it's really important for
example um our friend Allie at the bar
she was complaining that her Wi-Fi was
really weak oh yeah you're um like on
her iPad right and I was like well
figured it was a router problem right
well she's got one of those like router
cable modem combo units that like that's
got the wi-fi's and everything built-in
because you know that's what everybody
does now right just the consumers have
any antennas no it's just on this ugly
black box right and so as you do you
take the ugly black box and you put it
under the TV with all the other ugly
black boxes but of course then it's you
know horizontal right and so she's like
laying on the couch or whatever with her
iPod or our iPad like this right or
let's say for instance like say she's
just using or like this what we got here
is I'm vertically polarized you're
horizontally polarized we're not really
you're not seeing each other as much
there but if I go ahead and rotate it so
what I said to do is literally just put
your modem on its side and when she did
that it was fixed and it got better yeah
that doctor hurts when I moved my arm
like this so anyway that's crazy
yeah but it makes sense it does once you
understand why antennas do that and
we're gonna come back to that in just a
second because it gets even cooler but
first let's talk about the radiation
pattern okay because we're just talking
about this little Wi-Fi pineapple and
it's dipole and you have just made an
assumption here actually because
essentially this dipole is going to go
ahead and emit that radiant energy that
electromagnetic energy and it comes out
in a very particular way see these you
know dipole antennas that we stick on to
you know most consumer device you look
at it and you think that it's pointing
the way that I'm really so that's the
way you think of it see I've always
thought of it as like just a regular
consumer and I've heard this from people
like my mom they think that it just
comes out directly oh comes out the the
tip of it like you would point your
antenna at the okay wait and then what
would she think about this
yagi anyway um well essentially
what we're looking at here is
practically speaking it's an
omnidirectional antenna and there is no
true like practically speaking
omnidirectional antenna because in our
universe there's always going to be the
physical tangible antenna however if you
could get rid of that then you could
probably come up with a truly isotropic
antenna and that is to say a radiation
pattern in which you know it is
encompassing all directions at once so
like a little balloon here okay right
imagine that is a perfect perfect circle
right now we're your isotropic yes right
radiant energy so it's going out in
every direction at once you might have
to squish it yes all over the place just
down a little bit yeah that looks round
enough right whereas this dipole is
actually coming out something more like
I try to do this though Oh like this
looks like a doughnut yes it is a very
tasty doughnut in fact so as you can see
this dipole in fact if I put it right
next to the this this balloon represents
next to this dipole the radiant energy
coming out of it I see in all of those
directions like like that not so great
right above it not so great right below
it but pretty good all around and that's
why it makes a pretty good all-around
antenna that's why we see them on
everything right yeah
and actually we could go ahead and and
like plot the curvatures of these as far
as them being on you know for instance
our elevation angle or you know or
azimuth angle but that's that's not
necessary at this given point you can
we're going to come back to the doughnut
and see why these actually have a
relationship to it but it's interesting
to illustrate how for instance it
compares to something that our hacker
friends are very excited about and that
we have these yagi antenna so you go
ahead and hold this yucky so the same
amount of energy
I know these work the as opposed to the
dipole with that doughnut shaped antenna
we the same amount of energy isn't
actually going to be shaped like a
doughnut in fact it's actually going to
be elongated right here ah you'd like
this right and so it's really great
because we can actually get as you
noticed this doughnut like how far does
it go it goes from like say here to
maybe I don't know we'll just count it
in inches they say it's like three
inches long
hello my squeeze that guy out now I got
a I got a nine inch something that's
fantastic right and that brings us to
directivity right and so we mentioned
isotropic would be you know fully
radiant in all directions and at once
and that would be kind of like our
baseline right and that would be one
decibel that's how we would describe it
directivity Lee speaking now our yagi
antenna that has a very high directivity
because we've focused that energy in
such a way to be powered Street through
at the end of it right we've got
reflectors we've got all these elements
on it that we're gonna get into and what
they mean and we've yeah we've
strengthened the signal we have a higher
DB in fact because we have a more narrow
beam you know likewise with the dipole
and our doughnut here right so we're
going to have you know less DB but we're
going to have more coverage all around
us
so that's why these are better for like
home wireless routers when you have
several different products in an area
that this would be great if you were
trying to gain wireless access from
across the across the road from your
neighbor yeah you point it directly at
there or wireless router than you
receive it not just those we have in
fact here's actually just notice right
behind you uh was one of these I didn't
even realize oh this is love this is
actually part of a reflector from an
antenna that's there is on the roof of
the building here that we put up right
for our long-range Wi-Fi and there's a
panel antenna on the other end and then
we could go on and on with antennas
we've got what's the panel they're just
literally Ifill and this one oh my god
that's why we could spend forever on
this cuz we've got let's see we've got
the yagi we've got the dipole we've got
the panel in the stream this is a yeah
this is a helical antenna that is a
right polarized we've got a right
polarized cloverleaf antenna there are
so many different antennas and for
different purposes like this one as you
know unlike the doughnut it actually
goes up a little bit more which is kind
of rating this also polarized in a
certain pattern so that it gets less
picks up less reflected stuff so we get
less multipath interference when we pick
it up with a similarly shaped wheel on a
tangent now got nicely different size
okay let's break it back down to
something more practical right your cell
phone yes my cell phone does it have a
highly directional antenna or a more
like we're less directional antenna I
would say it's it's less directional
because it has to figure out where to
get that cell carriers wireless signals
from yeah the tower doesn't know where
you are
in fact so you mean you could be like
laying in bed with your phone like this
well you could be standing up with your
phone like this so if it was dancing
this way or that way
it was directional I had I would have to
stay in the same way every day to make a
phone call actually be kind of great
event like like a tower coming off of it
and like a little tracking like locking
into the sick to the tower actually in
fact this is an interesting remember the
old ones that used to have all you have
to pull them up and that may come in two
wavelengths here in a bit but you've
seen a cell tower on the highway right
you haven't noticed that they kind of
like are so they're big Pole we've got a
huge mast and then we've got like
triangles yeah with these kind of panel
looking guys right yeah now they're all
there isn't like kind of an interesting
triangle pattern where they're like you
know it's not four of them so it's not
like north south east west but you know
you cam saying so like some of them are
pointed this way some of them are
pointed that way some of are pointed
back the other right yeah those are
directional and there and and they are
similar to say for instance a satellite
dish which would is also directional
because we're shooting at a fixed place
in the sky we're shooting at that bird
that's not moving and and I think that's
a good example
that's actually going to come in when we
talk about diversity in a second boy but
quick word on efficiency because there
are so many different antennas and
there's so many ways to describe them
and so the inevitable question is which
one is the best and there's no answer to
that however when you take into account
so many factors in fact one's I can't
even get into right now like impedance
and this war and things like that
efficiency is another one of them
there's a number between zero and one
that kind of describes the efficiency of
an antenna
you know we've got impedance mismatches
which may kind of degrade the efficiency
of it and you know things of that nature
for example I've ever seen it one of
those little mini Wi-Fi routers where
the antenna is soldered on to the PCB
oh yeah yeah yeah so they don't have
like like the pineapples got awesome SMA
cables so you can like plug in like a
big ant n stuff right we can separate it
we've got like you know we've got like
what is this like a 50 centimeter cable
here so we can actually get our antenna
away from our transmitter and things
like that
well those ones that are etched onto the
board those antennas are really close to
all the other circuitry yeah I always
wondered about that well they're not
very efficient right and and the reason
for that is because you've got like a
CPU and a bunch of copper traces right
next to your antenna and what do you
think they're gonna do they're gonna
soak up that radiant energy yeah right
and they're not going to be doing
anything useful with it other than
turning it into heat right and so that's
another example of something that's
going to impact your efficiency so heat
can impact it heap can did the whole
weather the weather can it's it's really
amazing I mean in a vacuum all of this
is so much easier if we were just flown
in space this lesson would be like you
know we're giant dishes up there that
are circling the earth and they're able
to transmit you know wavelengths for
ever and ever and ever
yeah because they're using some really
cool frequencies and at some really cool
power and then there's like
organizations like you right to you that
can tell them what they can and can't do
huh yes vacuums are good actually from
space optics are good but that's totally
neither here nor there um coming back to
that cell phone tower right so we've got
that cell phone tower in this
that kind of trying they'll hang on and
I know you've all seen them on the
highway yes um what's really cool about
this is you drive past it right and so
maybe your phone in your car is
connected to one of those towers when
its panel antenna is facing you in this
direction but your car just drives past
it and now you're facing the other panel
antenna that's facing in that direction
by the highway right and so what's
actually happening there is a great use
of diversity I mean diversity is
essentially saying we have a in fact
here's diversity we have lots of we've
got lots of different antennas on the
table right now a diverse set of
antennas yes and so what if we could tie
them all into one system where we could
choose the most appropriate antenna for
the given location so that's why we're
able to make a phone call as we're going
down the road and not drop off every two
seconds right you're on a really
horrible carrier unit well there's ours
I mean there's a lot of other things
that come into play there like handoff
and other stuff like that yeah I mean
essentially it is an example of which um
I'm working on a diversity system right
now for one of my drums where I'm using
a cloverleaf antenna which has like a
really nice kind of ball shaped radiant
what did I say direction right yeah
whereas and then I'm going to couple it
with this helical antenna to get more of
a narrow focused long antenna so that I
can get further distance in one
direction but then also be able to fly
all around a given area and you can just
start stacking these like crazy have you
seen any of the new 802 dot 11 ad stuff
no I have a CF okay well ad is crazy
this stuff is on the 60 60 gigahertz
band right so really really tiny
antennas you can get away with in that
case and we'll talk about that in a
second why but essentially what they do
in those is they're using less power it
may not transmit through walls or such
as much it's really meant for like a
small like a room right but it does a
really awesome job getting a ton of
throughput in a given area because it
actually uses diversity it uses like the
soldered onto a PC board I've seen
really cool
demo boards of these antennas facing in
all these different directions and as
you say move your mobile device whatever
it may be
that's a toe 2.11 ad compliant with a to
its base station it will constantly be
shifting which antenna it's using as to
which one is is a located like making
the most direct connections so think of
it like you know having that like
spinning dish you know that's spinning
radar down at the airport except you've
got a ton of them they're all fixed at
different positions and you can just
choose which one that is so cool yeah um
exciting stuff very exciting now okay so
we've talked about efficiency we've
talked about you know the the
directionality and all of those things
well essentially when you want to get a
an antenna you pretty much want to be
able to quickly and easily identify some
of the core aspects of it without
getting into a whole bunch of like
Maxwell's you know theorems and things
of that nature okay so you know gain is
one of those things that we like in that
regard because typically you know what
we're reporting when we talk about gain
is actually the peak of the radiation
coupled with those efficiency losses so
what I might want to have to calculate
the impedance and all of those are the
things that go games automatically doing
that math for you yeah it's like a
really nice number where I can say you
know if if I can stretch this out like
that then the very end of that I can say
like oh that that's like you know within
a certain area and we're going to get
into that when we actually start
charting these um we can say what the
gain is which is really really cool
because it's a nice way to just quickly
look at and say like oh yeah this is a
what is this guy 16db I gain antenna
whereas like a small dipole may only be
like a 6 DB I gain and then finally this
brings us to and I was just talking
about those micro antennas on that
attitude 11 ad that's at 60 gigahertz
let's dial it way back let's dial it to
like uh one hundred and fifty megahertz
okay that sound familiar yeah
and it does right well remember that
wavelength we can figure out our
wavelength any time given a frequency
okay so for that bright - C times speed
of light equals wavelength there you go
we could do it the other way around
it's algebra so last week we had that
example where you were tuned in to some
FM broadcasts that were somewhere around
145 mega reading to a couple of dudes
just having a conversation yeah it was
really cool er like chatting about the
weather and stuff well it turns out 145
megahertz in wavelength is about two
meters which is about that tall but
anyway that's actually part of the VHF
band or very high frequency band and its
popular I've heard that too
yeah UHF VHF that's were like TV and who
uses VHF and radio operators yes I heard
that's why you're tuned into that it's
so cool yeah so you were listening to a
couple of hams talk about the weather
and there are antennas and stuff and
that's the two meter band so get this
you just had this like generic antenna
that comes with my teeny tiny one yeah
this guy this guy right here yeah so the
wavelength of this antenna isn't
necessarily optimized in any way shape
or form for that frequency however you
were able to pull it up so that's great
um but you could actually build an
antenna and we're gonna do that here
real soon we're actually waiting on an
antenna in the 900 megahertz spectrum so
we can show you guys a really cool hack
but hasn't gotten in yet so that's why
we're doing theory um when we build an
antenna we can do so for a given
wavelength right so all we need to know
is the wavelength of the frequency so
you could specifically design one to
pick up that frequency that you're
interested in it's cool and when you do
that you practically speaking have
pretty much three choices of wavelengths
I have Freddy there's magic numbers here
involved and this is where we just go
that one's good right you've got and you
know geek out in the comments because
I'm loving the comments on this series
right now you've got your full
wavelength
you've got your half wavelength you've
got a quarter wavelength so as you might
imagine a full wavelength for the 2
meter band or 145 megahertz that
be just about 2 meters 2 meters ha ha
yes and so there you go what would have
you know wiggling contender 1/4 would be
1/2 meter or that's about 20 inches
right and so you could just take your
little piece of come bringing it back
here you could take your little piece of
copper here that one's not so by staying
at those lengths I can still be able to
pick up that same frequency yes you can
take your little how weary of length you
know say this is 20 inches it would be
1/4 light wavelength antenna you know me
a paperclip could be an antenna right it
just depends on what frequency it so you
know there we go
so if I ended up with my question though
is no pause no popping the Blues now my
question is if I if I got a quarter size
antenna as opposed to a full-sized
antenna with the full size antenna be
able to pick up better sound and better
audio and things what CH antenna is
better well it depends what are you
using for exactly I mean in fact let me
say while this has you know in fact this
his pink one is just like become a yogi
example it's so stretched out now but
our yogi sure it's gonna have a greater
you know distance in this regard but if
our signals over there and I'm a damn
thing pointed over here you're not gonna
pick anything up right now
maybe if I've got it pointed completely
behind cuz of the back-to-front ratio
but that's another story
so yes ha ha uh and I don't know fully
but I can't wait to find out yeah just
diving into the circle of a bunch of
antennas we should can we yeah why not
I mean let's just apply electricity to
every piece of copper we see and then
find out what it does
yay then the FCC comes it's all building
videos bucko well ago and I saw some
copper pipes maybe we could go to there
we go steel those yeah that's totally
illegal I'm gonna do that down to that
something let us know in the comments
what you think about all of this stuff
guys I'm super stoked to be getting into
this and I want to hear from you guys as
we progress through this I promise we're
getting it back to practical we're just
waiting on an intended
and you know what if it's not here we're
just making it okay because as we know
all we need a little bit of copper and
some balloons and then we're good to go
just stick a balloon on there why is it
not popping why is it that when you want
to etch it of course
okay anyway we're gonna take a quick
break
sure we'll be right back it doesn't
matter if you're into azimuth or
