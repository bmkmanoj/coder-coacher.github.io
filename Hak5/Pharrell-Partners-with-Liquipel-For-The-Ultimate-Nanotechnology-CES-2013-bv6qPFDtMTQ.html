go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Mohr's
coming to you from CES 2013 and I'm here
with Danny and Pharrell hi Danny how are
you good how are you doing doing really
good so I've heard about Liquipel I've
never actually gotten to come up here
and check it out myself now tell me
exactly how does this work it's not like
a bag or something right sure exactly
what it's actually done in a specialized
piece of machinery okay we can do
several hundred or thousands of units at
a time dependent depending if to
manufacture or a retail store so what we
do is we place these devices inside of a
machine our engineers dumbed it down for
us we'd espress a button and then the
whole process takes place our liquid
formulation comes in and actually goes
internal and external of the device the
machine sucks the formulation right into
the phone okay so you're covering up all
the insides like the CPU and all the
ports and everything like that exactly
right yes so and then we back it with a
water damaged guarantee for your cell
phone right that's really nice i know a
lot of companies don't actually have a
guarantee on this kind of stuff so you
don't get in and if it ends up sinking
when it sinks that's exactly right and
it's it's a preventative coating you
don't want to go swimming with it just
because you're Liquipel but in the event
that you do have an accident which
you'll see here in a bit you're gonna be
protected awesome I can't wait to check
that out now before we do that I would
like to speak to Pharrell hi how are you
doing how are you I'm good okay close
get friendly it's like the ackward fam
offered family photo i'm sure you're
familiar with that one so i just wanted
to talk to you real quick you just sign
them with a partnership with Liquipel
and i just wanted to find out from you
what you're expecting from Liquipel and
what you're planning to do with this
well as a partner I just want to expand
uh and and continue to think about the
potential and you know its application
and just explore all the categories you
know when they first showed it to me uh
you know I was I was blown away because
I've never experienced anything like
that before you know this whole
mentality of things being water safe you
know and knowing that there's now an
option to
having your device's much longer your
phones your watch you know you're all
these cameras that are around like you
know imagine you know that just
yesterday before you heard of these
things you know if that camera fell in
the water you would be essentially
taking it to a shop and getting it you
know worked on where is yeah I speak
from personal experience of my camera
has fallen in the toilet and it's not a
really great experience when you dump
your hand in there go oh my god it just
fell in the toilet what am I gonna do
yeah that's never fun yeah it's over so
but with this which is what's so cool
about it is that like once you treat
this phone or your device or whatever it
is in 30 minutes it's like you know for
the life of that device it's now
protected when it comes to anything
liquid and and my job which I don't even
really look at it as a job as a partner
like you know my privilege and my luxury
in this situation is just sit there and
just be a kid in a candy store and just
think about all of the many applications
I mean could you imagine what this
treatment would do to like the whole of
a boat actually would probably make it
much faster you know or like you know
realizing the potential for what it
would do for windshields or in the
automotive industry like think about you
know your paint job being treated with
this you know or think about what it
means for steel you know it essentially
means no more rust because you know in
order to have the corrosion you need the
water yeah I totally agree with you now
coming from like you know back in the
day listening to your music like I have
a couple of years CDs at home are you
planning to coat your CDs with this and
like any of your books to MP like mp3
players what are you planning to do with
this personally is they actually code it
one of the books and we're showing
people earlier they were like freaking
out but but for the most part you're
going to see this in apparel for sure
apparently really yeah and don't confuse
water safe for waterproof it's a
complete different thing what's the
difference waterproofing is like so it's
kind of like you know older technology
that we snap ground upon we totally
respect it but this is kind of like you
know the next level this is this
actually is like a super hydrophobic
nano coating process that actually coats
the internal components of your device
as well as the exterior so you could
drop your iPhone in here and actually
you know go to pictures or go to any
other application will not yours mine's
not covered yet yet but it will be
you've been liquid elde I like that I
just got Liquipel by Pharrell and Danny
thank you so much guys I'd shake your
hand but I'm all wet now it was
excellent speaking with you guys today
and for more coverage with CES you can
go over to revision 3.com sync comes
with an optional voice-activated
navigation system and if you have
previous destinations that you need to
get to or if you forgot how to get home
like I do all the time in the bay area
of San Francisco it's very easy to use
all you have to do is say navigation
destination street address or you could
even say destination home navigation
please say a command destination home
destination home and it knows where
you're going it actually works and it
understands me even though sometimes I
like to talk in my southern accent it's
great all the audio speaker systems tell
you exactly what you're trying to do
turn-by-turn directions thank you again
to Ford for helping me get home and for
powering this hak5 CES special
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
