end anytime soon Safari is facing a
troubling flaw United Airlines has a
depressing bug bounty program and in
Soviet Russia government stopped you
from protesting all that coming up now
on threat wire I'm Shannon Morrison this
is threat wire for wednesday may
twentieth 2015 your summary of what's
threatening our security privacy and
internet freedom first off a huge thanks
to everyone who has supported the
relaunch of the show we couldn't be more
proud of this awesome community and of
course if you're new to threat wire on
the hak5 channel this is the show that
we did for a year on tech feed and now
we brought it back so with that let's
get started data encryption is a growing
trend in the world of mobile with Google
and Apple both encrypting their messages
so only the user holds the private key
to allow the authentication of this
information this is excellent for
privacy enthusiasts and consumers alike
however law enforcement officials feel
differently because of the possibility
for criminals quoted in October FBI
director James Comey said justice may be
denied because of a locked phone or an
encrypted hard drive we aren't seeking a
backdoor approach we want to use the
front door with clarity and transparency
and with clear guidance provided by law
because of law enforcement saan going
fight to remove encryption for mobile
devices a letter was drafted to
President Obama and sent on Tuesday to
the White House from well over 150
companies civil security organizations
security researchers and former
government officials including the likes
of the eff Google Twitter Apple Jeff
Moss who's the founder of Def Con and
Gordon lion who is the founder of nmap
just to name a very few the letter
states quote we urge you to reject any
proposal that US companies deliberately
week in the security of their products
we request that the White House instead
focus on developing policies that will
promote rather than undermine the wide
adoption of strong encryption technology
such policies will in turn help to
promote and protect cyber security
economic growth and human rights both
here and abroad and over in Russia the
Center for Research and legitimacy and
political protest has designed software
called Laplace A's
to search social media posts by known
politically oriented groups in hopes of
preventing mass disorder or as we know
it protests the software went live on
May eighteenth and according to Izvestia
are you will be monitored by scientists
researchers law enforcement and
government officials Laplace's demon
will update every five minutes with post
pertaining to possible unsanctioned
rallies with special interest on Twitter
which just happens to be the lead social
network for extremist content being
involved in an unsanctioned protest in
Russia can lead to a six-hundred-dollar
fine in rubles or 50 hours of community
service ouch researchers have found a
flaw in safari browsers that enables a
URL spoofing attack to occur the
research group called dusan has scripted
a small bit of code that makes it look
like a safari browser is connecting to a
new site when in reality is actually
being redirected over to the group's
website this could be used by an
attacker to redirect a user to a
phishing site for example so far they
found that it works on fully patched
safari browsers running on iOS and OS 10
my fix until the threat is determined
use a different browser our featured
comment today comes from the stash who
in response to the hackers out of play
oh my god story says I'm not quite sure
if chris Roberts actually got into the
flight control system if you watch his
talks where he talks about gaining
access he doesn't go into much detail
about it only alludes to being able to
access the systems with no real evidence
he does make it seem plausible I'm just
not sure that I believe him thank you
this dash this could actually lead to a
huge rabbit hole about what really
happened but suffice to say the only
person that really knows what really
happened is chris Roberts while the
video that you link to is from 2011 and
only barely touches on the subject about
planes he has done other talks as well
about strictly aviation this has been
something the security researcher has
been studying for several years and
whether he deserves the FBI's I or not
my opinion is personally not valid now
what I will say is this over the years
the security of aviation has been a
tremendous interest to those in the
infosec community and lots of problems
in the technology have arisen we need to
take the information that Roberts is
sharing as a strong reminder that if a
technology or
company has a serious security flaw it
needs to be reported to that company so
that they can fix it but if a company
doesn't act on that information how long
do you wait until releasing that
information to the public to gain
traction or do you do it at all do we
have to wait until a plane drops out of
the sky who knows flaws need to be taken
seriously by the firm's that can fix it
preemptively that's the important word
here united has released a bug bounty
program for different floors found in
their systems but bugs that are not
eligible include bugs on with on-board
Wi-Fi entertainment systems or avionics
which is exactly where the problem was
allegedly wit uh it's very irritating
for me thank you for the comment the
stache and if you guys have any thoughts
on today's stories leave them below
before I go I want to give a huge thanks
