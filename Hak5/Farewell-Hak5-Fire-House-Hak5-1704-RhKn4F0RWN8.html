Darren kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of technology annan is afk and this
episode which is kind of a non episode
is for me but in the future and I'm
gonna bring you along so I don't know if
I've ever shared this with you but I
actually have a terrible memory I'm kind
of like that nt4 server in the closet
that sometimes shuts down and doesn't
come up back properly and you're all
like searching around for a floppy disk
well 9 mm dot says and so that's me and
I don't know if I've ever told you I
probably forgot to again bad memory so
in order to remember things I'm gonna
show you thanks and then it'll be like
an archive backup copy you'll be like
linus torvalds source code like giving
it to everyone in the world something
like that isn't that isn't that how it
works
I forget though here we are in the 9th
year of Mac 5 and I would say probably
the 4th generation if you're counting
the places where we have done the thing
we've had the tiny apartment we've had
the hack house we've had Dave's garage
and even the fire house yes that is in
fact a late 19th century early 20th
century fire house a big brick fire
house in the middle of Point Richmond
and it is what we have lovingly called
home for the last few years I think what
year okay so the brick says 1910 which
is kind of perfect because here we are
in Point Richmond which has a point in
it and so does hak5 except it's not hack
point 5 because it's pointless but this
place is like I rule
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com and here it is when we
moved into this joint the landlord told
me that it's awesome because the stairs
came for free offers great exercise
benefits and it has been fantastic for
three years and welcome in fact to hack
5 &amp;amp; Associates I know who the associates
are she's an associate that's Sarah
she's an associate and this is my office
which as you can see has sustained heavy
damage from the earthquake or I just
haven't cleaned it up in some time and
so I'm showing me /you this so we can
remember that hey there is where we make
the pineapple thing and record the stuff
and the IRC with little dinosaurs I mean
we just idle all day but you guys can
find me on a hat Club IRC a lot get your
own goodies and some interesting
juxtapositions that is in fact how pine
ap works in a nutshell and this is the
corner of Brasilia with things like
prototype mark fives and I guess that
never made it and a bunch of other stuff
there's so many little doodads in there
and of course we've got our 3d printer
which we have no place to set up ah my
joy tear bag of course would you still
have an unpacked from Def Con and look
my desk is so nice except not really
cleaned it up it's normally looking like
that and now into the mess that is the
hak5 studio we get whatever the
work-in-progress is working on a drone
working on a birdhouse we're gonna set
of ominous boxes OOP got the new hack RF
and here is the prototype here's the Oh
way to go this is what's up love it and
here's the kitchen
and here we have costumes and such who
got spacesuits and whatever that is more
projects more projects more pineapple
booze and appall hey the pole yeah it
goes well I am recording history that is
back five in its fourth generation yeah
yes
Paul's actually been here since tripods
and the tiny apartment like the can't
lights you buy from Home Depot yeah
still works great you know what
interestingly Paul who has been credited
on every episode of fact 5 didn't join
hack 5 until I say about the third
episode and this is how you social
engineer your friends into getting in on
your projects you just start putting
them in the credits and telling them
they're part of the project and they're
like aha yeah that little podcast thing
uh-huh uh-huh and then eventually you're
like no we've made enough references to
Paul the camera guy you're one of us you
have the idea for it and you're asking
me about like you're thinking about
starting a show and I'm like yeah that
sounds cool yeah yes and then I went and
learned how to write the scripts there
are no scripts man you can't have met
around that yeah of course but yeah I
ended up getting like script writing
software that was horrible I learned
what a teleplay is there's no there's no
telling you what do you what are you
doing what's going on here well I'm
trying to render the Masters for
archival purpose like three octaves
I'm all the way back on 20 or 1626
we'll have fun so I gotta feed it in a
plane Nintendo back there and then the
plane blaster master okay cool and then
we have their blinking lights stack o
hard drives as it were I love this
there's a pretty nice and then right
above it there's just a stack of hard
drives
well no need to now and as we come
around the corner into here we can find
this in fact is this is the hack shop
and that is a Sarabande we actually made
a commit a tutorial on how to hack shop
this is in fact an e-commerce drinking
game for robots so thank you everybody
for supporting us directly in that way
that allows us to have only one sponsor
and have a Sarah bot that makes all the
hack shops happened pineapple this is
Greg and he is one of the stars at hack
shop he you just kind of a cheerleader
of sorts just make sure that everything
happens everything here is running Linux
for the most part Linux Mac shop with
the Janome and not even good know me
three the old school of enemy and this
is where the pineapple candy lives on
the floor because there's no room for it
anywhere else and here is in fact where
our latest edition of the birdhouse is
coming along and say that's going to
hold quite a few pineapple goodnesses so
stay tuned for the rest of that project
is it kind of works out and let's not
forget the wall hanging server think
we've got another one
where'd it go oh there it is
there's just not enough room for
anything here bloodshot green screen
where Shannon does Metasploit minute and
mobic studs hack tip oh yeah and then
there's this other room so as you can
see we're just a little bit overflowing
just a tad bit and this room here is
which houses some of the bigger
equipment like our laser cutter which we
have unfortunately not had a good
opportunity to play with too much
because this has slowly turned into a
stock room with other CNCs and the home
to the giant inflatable pineapple I
guess this is a giant inflatable duck
but she's feeling quite squishy right
now so I'm showing you this I'm showing
me this so we can remember and so
because also we are moving it seems
after the earthquake we decided maybe we
shouldn't be in 110 year old brick
building that's sitting on a bunch of
landfill and so for that in dramatic
recreation we can explain to you a
warehouse where would be awesome and
we'll be able to do amazing indoor drone
flying hacker space craziness and
actually have a place to put laser
cutters and 3d printers another additive
manufacturing goodness so until then I
remind you to trust your technolo
also thanks for sticking with us the
next three weeks are gonna be really
weird mmm you smell that I need to make
lemon flavored moustaches this is the
case this is totally fact its how it
works is now available on the broad
bands for which you too can have a
brilliant idea because when you get that
idea you have to search for it fast and
what's awesome is that domain.com
they've got this quick domain discovery
system making their check-out process
and everything super simple to get you
set up in no time at all fire up that
web server because we're about to get
creative that's a brilliant idea I told
you guys before I love domain
because they're reliable they're
affordable the easy news but most of all
you'll realize that it is a super fun
place to do business
as we have realized as we tweet them at
domain.com and realize wow these people
are just crazy enough to do business
with us they like lemon flavored
moustaches like brand new from the minds
of the domaine place where they dig up
the domains it's so great but you know
what else is crazy the savings you've
used the coupon code hak5 at checkout
you're going to get an extra 15% off
from your mind into the web domain name
website you're up and running so when
you think domain names think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
