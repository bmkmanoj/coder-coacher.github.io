by and GoDaddy Netflix and Intel's Core
i7 processor finders now at M wave comm
and today on the show inside the set cam
helix and live view forensics tools
creating your own Super Mario World
levels with lunar magic tracking log
files with fair tail and Matt's birthday
surprise hey guys I'm here in editing
and I just need to give you a little fYI
about the episode we accidentally chose
the wrong audio source when we recorded
the show and rather than taking the
audio from our awesome little lapels we
got it from our camera so it sounded a
little bit echoey we actually went back
and rerecorded the entire show for you
but the first part of the episode we
couldn't really rerecord so just bear
with it the first 10 minutes it does
sound a little bit echoey it's not up to
par with your high 5 standard but I
promise get better and thank you guys so
much for your understanding
hello and welcome to hack five this year
we've the ghost of techno last we are
your gamers your hackers your IT ninjas
I'm Darren I'm at hey guys I'm Shannon
I'm Chris done excellent show a few guys
and doing a lot of fun stuff video I am
hurting yeah my wisdom tooth is
absolutely killing me right now
I'm not taking vicodin for the show but
I I get inland yeah I wanted to go to
vicodin Lambo good I'm super happy these
days over for the show because I know
that some of us have once lacerated
their pinkies and ended up in Beckmann
land for the episodes yeah and I was
trying to avoid at all costs yeah so
yeah but beyond that I've been doing
live webcams of the hack house where he
has dared about that hire you you came
when it came up with the idea of I mean
one thing you did you did it my
celebrity livestream when we shoot the
episode and then we didn't yeah and it
kind of evolved into a multicam shoot of
our entire house downstairs downstairs
yeah downstairs and shine night vision
in the bedroom no but we have a replica
of the wall up that you guys might
remember well we had the projector up
and everything so we can actually see
your feedback I think we've got about a
hundred people watching us live right
now I love it bring us a lot of energy
yeah so we've got two cams shooting both
sets we've got a monitor we've got a
whole bunch of you streaming flash media
encoder you know it's a crazy setup I
mean you basically told a machine to do
things that are unnatural I believe and
yeah I mean it would have been so hard
if we weren't using the same camera
right we were using to just to answer
this question that everybody has we are
using two sony DCR hcat five cameras in
USB mode to a just a generic Delpy for
running you stream with some external
mics and why tackle lenses and if you
over to hack house
details there so we've been having a
stream in a week it's been it's been
handle you come home and there's the
Internet in your living room and yeah
you're welcome your home yeah it's I
like it it's like having Twitter but in
your holidays it's better than play it
better that's what it is yeah so in the
house what am I having 100 roommates
it's like making new friends of Cyrus
yeah so we've been up to oh man I got
like so many different projects going on
let's say I have actually put together a
list for this um first of all I need to
give a shout out to Shannon our friend
our power oh yeah yeah we met him out in
a torque on and and we were talking
about the pineapple yah Sager and inside
jackin the hamster ferret stuff that did
last episode he actually did his college
project on this was final report by the
way he got an A so way to go man and you
can find his stuff that Bower - power
net and you know I really should have
just given to shout out it didn't even
occur to me with all the you can get
into the electric talk to him yes yes
and then like you start doing the
segments like one day I feel so bad I
feel really bad that and ghosts I feel
bad too because ghosts emailed me and
he's like dude you mentioned the Homer
thing I emailed it there he said I
mentioned that to you I'm like well I
gave credit to Steve because he emailed
me and I didn't find her I am I so the
key here is if you want credit email
dear chatter no yeah you know what
sounds not perfect or from other things
that are going on and related to this
and Bauer mentioned this was that the
SSL thing okay so that that's another
way to protect yourself we talked about
tunneling but you were doing your Gmail
on HTTPS
you're not going to have to worry about
well that hack that we showed with the
hamster fare on the pineapple
not going to really do much good for
that so that would take care of the
whole banking ring although I have been
working with a very often guy on Twitter
by the name of post parade has been
helping me
air base ng and a lot of you've been
talking about this with Wi-Fi Zoo and
checking out Wi-Fi so since it first
came out the developer you know really
sweet stuff to me sooner basically a lot
of you do the same thing as the
pineapple with the whole setup I show
you with fare enhancer just on a single
machine and and would allow you to like
with two Wi-Fi cards share out some
internet to work with like your cell
phone and whatnot do the same thing in
Linux doing it in backtrack 3 and having
a little bit of a problem with DHCP D
assigning some IP addresses so I'm still
working on that but once I get going
basically you would be able to do it
with Wi-Fi Zoo and then all of a sudden
it doesn't matter if it's HTTP or not
because it'll do the fake right it'll do
the fake certificate I mean you still
got it you're still getting noobs that
are stupid enough to add exceptions and
Firefox or click yes to this bogus
certificate naughty or whatever but you
can do that so that's that's another
thing I'm working on cool yeah it is my
birthday today yes I am 26 years old
hi I am 26 12:26 I'm sorry my mother
actually called the house she wasn't
gonna die probably and and she she sang
happy birthday to me in front of
everybody here as well as everybody on
the Internet yeah so I got a little
flush and get a little flushed again but
so yeah 26 years old really was like I
cannot believe place is here and you
know that I use oh isn't that birthday
cuz
I can open his present he's gonna
Express illegal yeah cuz I mean this
place this is an awesome year I'm just a
few and so it's actually a finger puppet
unicorn just put two in the pink and
there you go now you oh that is just
precious
it's to forgive my new girlfriend that's
amazing
yeah so it's going let's go out of these
nuts
um actually q8 yeah okay oh come on
please this is not fastened to the
camera there's two more underneath here
Emily there what no what yeah this is
for you I don't
I actually oh look at Shannon she got me
uh to the bottom only gary vaynerchuk's
look why don't we go on wine cruise but
I don't think that's gonna happen
because we're going cisco and look
another fearfully unicornia magazine
remember how we were talking about that
one night and you said you like unicorns
at dinner so and it looks great you look
great and if you reach underneath there
there's two more
I did actually by your real presence see
ok I come home Christmas wrapping paper
and I'm like okay Christmas bro can you
find any other wrapping paper this time
of year it's all Christmas wrapping
paper you can't buy Palsy always know
you have more coming tomorrow they're
not your hands
trust me and later on at the end of the
show I'll give you the unicorn castle so
you can play with them and a little
pretty princess land yes you know thank
you guys there's a little problem let's
get this show on the road
do you have anything else I've got some
other I'll talk about this at the end of
the show well you know what
put the missiles up against the the
unicorns and see what kind of evil stuff
we can do bitches all right that finds
that horrible are we done
yeah we're done I go insane now yes you
can go in shame and let's go ahead and
kick it over to Shannon and see what's
going on with uh with this week's LAN

please don't forget the www
next up we have person Daren talking
about what is it live viewing Hilux my
view and Hilux but first we're gonna
take a break
so crisp you're telling me earlier about
some tools that you could use to
actually take a bit from the image of a
computer if you were doing like
forensics and be able to play with it
yeah as if you're the actual suspect
okay so what is it so we're talking
about forensics we're talking about
we're going to like a client site here
somebody was up to no good and now we
need today take a copy a pristine copy
of their computer's hard drive and put
it in evidence bag and say this was
never touched but we also need to go and
look for evidence
so what's the deal all right so um with
normal forensics you'll you'll you take
a DD image of a hard drive you know you
get there and and these just a tool
that's gonna do like a bit for bit copy
of whatever you tell it to do we can do
Ram hard drives partitions you know K
typically we just do the whole hard
drive so one one of the tools that we
that we like to use is helix okay and
what we're gonna do here is in helix we
can have this live acquisition thing and
this is just easier to show off here
normally you would have the computer
powered off if you can okay so the the
best way to do this would be to shut the
computer down take the hard drive out of
the machine physically and pop it in and
another special computer and and just
suck everything down exactly so let's
just say in this case that what if my
computer works yeah if it were an
exchange server and you are the feds
then you were like we're doing an
investigation on one of your users I'm
fortune 100 company you're telling me
you want to take my exchange server down
or we're like why 24 hours No thank you
sir I've got a lot I've got business to
do yep
so what is this all right so it's it's
obviously not the most forensically
sound
I mean it's it's probably good enough
there's been you know it's probably
gonna get you by okay um but anyway so
live acquisition we can just select our
physical drive and I already actually
did this so I won't pain this'll you
know I won't put you guys through the
whole watching the you know the meter go
up but uh bars like five so when I
actually hit acquire a little pop-up
will come up and actually if it doesn't
freeze on me right that's fine so what
is it it well the computers running
takes a bit written there there so we're
about to run this this if all is it just
passes a command
this command line and she's command it's
just a DD command and saying here's the
source and here's the destination so in
this case the source while the computer
is running my running is itself and then
I'm writing to the lab try to take this
out and then write it to a location on
the network you wouldn't write to itself
so we're gonna write that out to the
network so we're gonna so don't do that
now cuz I'll take forever so I already
made the image ah
the turkeys has already been cooked has
already been cooked and I opened live
view which I had already installed live
you will download VMware server and the
VMware mounting the mount disk utility
for you and install it for you I have
workstation so ok helix you talked me of
that before it's it's a distribution has
lots of different tools
it's a package for forensics what is
live view live view is written by
Carnegie Mellon cert okay they wrote
this actually for like law enforcement
and this is just an open-source version
from I think it's been 2007 okay and
what it allows you to do is you can take
that DD 5 right because we did that bit
for bit image permit image and normally
that DD file you know you give it to
friends this guy he opens it an in case
and we ethically looks at the file we
start looking at you know all sorts of
properties whatever sure of course was
pretty much what they work oh yeah um so
still this takes that image and and what
kind of special magic we doing with it
we are actually it's it's it generates a
vmx config file for vmware and what that
allows you to do is it will take that DD
image and you're you're not writing to
it it's still be read-only mode yep and
obviously you would do this with a copy
of the file you wouldn't original but um
and it generates a configuration files
and allows vmware to open it ok and that
allows you of course to interact with
that image as if you were booting it up
and you know you're the head and show me
so we've got the DD image located open
we've given it a output location and and
there we go so we were able to gives me
errors it's I understand because you
mean your source was a VM Nam but it did
it did go correctly it's it's actually
written so now I can stabilize this
and if I go into who me get out of this
really quick and actually do a quick
switch that's easiest way to do this so
I'm gonna open this existing VM mm-hmm
that's right a file that it created
right there yep and there we go there's
got a virtual server just like we
regularly okay
oh and I have to actually tell it that
it's Windows that's that's the only bad
part about this is you have to actually
go in and say hey I'm Windows ok cuz the
DD image doesn't know that that's the
case all right
so we start it up and now it should come
right up and let's see windows okay so
now we've taken a bit for bit image of
the entire hard drive now as it were and
and rather than looking at it from like
the outside in we're able to convert it
using the live view into a VMware image
this is just like the suspect was this
is great for like initial incident
response yeah we don't want this this is
great for initial incident response
because a lot of times you'll have a
team you know you have it and maybe one
guy in the team does the actual end case
forensic analysis yeah the really
in-depth stuff maybe you want to
actually boot this up look around in
there try to maybe go at a task manager
and figure out some initial so that you
could say hey man check this because you
would have the system in the state that
it was when you so the viruses are going
to be all they're doing their thing you
know everything that was wrong also
going to be there yeah and and like you
can even do the same thing with RAM so
if we have keys and RAM if we cited some
chat logs stuff so this just provides
you a quick way to say hey hey man I
check this out you might want to look
for this executive or somewhere in here
in your do you know and then they do
their you know sound analysis ctrl alt
insert yeah yeah and and then booting
right up and you'll see a desktop and it
should be the same exact there we go
it's the same exact machine that we just
did DD on yeah
great and then we can explore it is the
quote unquote suspect awesome so you
have a write-up on I will live you now
there's there's a other version that I
take it we can't have yeah the most
current version is law enforcement has
that and that has some extra goodies
that gets you into Windows and
and things like that without having to
authenticate yeah you know the backdoor
stuff that only I can have pretty much
so I mean then you know that and that's
kind of understandable I guess sure you
see how long that lasts all right cool
and you've got to write up on these
tools in your blog at Chris Chris
curling calm awesome let's go ahead and
head over to Shannon and see what's
going with this week's trivia last
week's trivia was what German aircraft
was so large that it required passengers
to move to either side of the fuselage
in order to make turns
and that was correctly answered by Mike
s in the HEC by forums and Mike Congrats
we're gonna send you a WYSIWYG comic
it's a volume one and actually volume 2
just came out yeah we actually just
opened it we're gonna go over that with
Darrin here but yeah I read the first
one it was pretty awesome
yes so I'm pretty excited about volume
to it myself and let me tell you about
this week's trivia based on a narrow
stream of atomic clusters of liquid
mercury or tungsten accellerated by high
voltage what device was invented by
Nikola Tesla in the 1930s and allegedly
stolen by the Russians thereafter and if
you're the first person to answer this
right in the hak5 forums we'll send you
a dual-core CD it's lost reality and I
gotta say my favorite song on here is
the girlfriend song why does that not
surprise me I know could I say we met 88
at 80 at and I actually used the the
dual core songs at the torque on episode
so you guys might remember from there

gonna take a break and then I'm going to
tell you about how to edit your own
super mario level
so shit so mad I love playing video
games good Muhsin fess I'm not exactly
the world's greatest Mario player yeah I
know but you made it a little too easy
for me here I'm sorry
yeah there's no enemies right now I got
nothing that could kill me but oh you do
suck thank you I'm sorry yeah well
admitted yes let's fix that
okay see I found this program online by
Foose oh yeah called the Super Mario
World Editor okay and well it's actually
called lunar magic and it is a super
mario world editor for you to play on
your downloaded completely legal rom
your emulator so that you can play Super
Mario on your computer we would never do
anything illegal
no and it's this program is completely
free you can download it off of
Priscilla's website which I'll put in my
blog okay and then you can play it in
any ROM of your choice pretty much so
basically it's an editor level editor
what are we doing yeah yeah it's it's
basically a level editor where you can
love whatever you can edit everything
from the terrain to enemies which is
with this little guy right here okay so
while I'm not that good I do still like
a challenge here and there so I'm using
all right I think I can do that for you
okay okay I just clicked on this little
button with the Yoshi right there okay
and let's see who do you like I like
rent Koopas you like blue okay we're
gonna put it in some blue coop us okay
so I just clicked on that right there
then I'm just gonna add them in by doing
a right click let's see how many can I
put in here enough that's not good okay
I won't get too crazy with you um let's
see I'll just add a few more right over
here move that guy up right there yeah
okay uh what's what else can I add in
here how about I click on the little box
and add in some coins like coins
I like coins too
I'm right there and right there all
right look good yes okay cool so I've
changed around the editor a little bit
well it's pretty simple I just go to
save level to rhom okay press ok and
press ok again so I should probably make
a copy of my rom before I say in case i
foo bar yeah yeah that's probably a good
idea we don't want any food bars do we
now what if now legally we can't
redistribute around no you can't but you
can redistribute your edited levels okay
that's completely fine it's really easy
to do so you just go to file go to save
level to file okay and then you can
distribute your file so the file is the
changes that we've actually made to the
level to the level itself yeah so people
need they're wrong
yes they need their own rom and they
also need to be on load lunar magic
themselves if they want to do some
editing in that level that you created
gotcha
and then they can play that level I'm
there wrong all right so let's see how
bad I really am in a game okay well I
need you to challenge I need to close
this ROM and reopen it okay so that my
changes will take place all right so I'm
gonna reopen my demo open rom okay and
then it'll start just like you're
familiar with way back in the day as a
child yeah back to the good old days of
16-bit awesome okay so we're gonna go
down here my level yes or your love-life
see the left one the left one oh my
goodness a little Mario oh good job and
look there are my coins coins oh you're
doing a lot better than last time
good job I told you I don't say oh okay
yeah you do dude that's not mine oh shit
that's Paul's dude okay
I hate Super Mario balls that okay yes
all right fine silence all right so
we've shown how to create our own levels
and it levels yep
save levels save roms oh yeah and I
wanted to show you the level that I was
working on for a while see I did have a
problem because if you have way too many
sprites way too many separate things
like coins and enemies your ROM will
freeze so you can only put about like
8383 are so sprites into your level
there's like 83 coins here yeah I know
see I I had like 400 sprites when I
started my level
did your ROM blow up yeah so I got it
down to 200 and I'm still working on how
to make it down to 83 and I really don't
want to delete my cool little hack side
we can really we can replicate this yeah
we could somehow well figure that I
figured out we'll post our changes to
this level on hack 5 forums and we
encourage you guys to make your own yeah
with us so I definitely want to check
those out all right thank you Matt Thank
You Shannon for showing me how much i
suck at supermarket and i'm gonna play
some super mario in own your ass
awesome we'll see you guys after this
break
sup t-money bad as cool with that
bandolier there I gotta say that's how I
roll
thank you very much probably yeah I you
you know girl heed me out on the ponies
and then you have a hammer so you can
beat me in with it don't tempt me
Oh so speaking of tools what I'm going
to show you guys today is something no
oh okay yeah what I'm going to show you
guys today is something that needs to be
in everybody's system in kit for Linux
users they've been using tail for years
now let's face it it's built in okay and
for those that aren't familiar with the
Linux tail come in basically what it
does he's ghetto on file it's right and
it's doing stuff like log files do and
you get to just see what those latest
updates are rather than just like
hitting cat key and then doing cat again
and up and up and up yeah what I'm going
to show you is bear tail that's for
Windows Windows no Matt would this be a
program that makes your Windows systems
administration life a little bit easier
it would indeed geez Matt what do you do
for a living I might be a system okay I
might be keeping the DL don't wanna
scare people all right so what is bear
tale do basically bear tail is tail and
Linux on crack sweet I like math don't
like crack but you know I like programs
on crack whatever let's check it out
so what we're gonna do is we're actually
gonna issue a command that will start
writing a pain to log file okay great
cool and what we can actually do is open
a bear tail and select run and we're
going to see right here that it is now
tailing great the file sweet so what
we're gonna do is we have a
predetermined one here in here before
but the nice thing is is once this
actually Scrolls all the way down yeah
you can actually scroll up okay without
it for like jump back down yeah I hate
that Wireshark kind of does then we were
exact sometimes so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna turn my air port off okay
and we're gonna start seeing seeing
request timeouts now the great thing
about shit that's fine we're going to
delete it but you can actually go in and
specify mm-hm
highlighting for request timed out now
if we look at hardware our one we could
add hardware and hardware err even
though it's probably not supposed
we're going to add hardware error okay
and you can now see that it is with
hardware is gonna be green right so now
we can find the lady proverbial and the
red dress well we're looking at these
log files this sounds kind of similar to
what we've talked about with Chris about
Wireshark and it sounds perfect for
something like if you're watching I
don't like snort logs I mean this is
just no sequel logs you know exchange
logs a lot of BS that you really don't
care about you just want to know what
was really good but now we can highlight
errors warnings you know all that happy
stuff that you know really makes your
life a living hell and not have to sift
through all the same looking text
anytime we see an error or warning that
highlight us again taking the hell out
of iti love it sweet now we have some of
your ID questions coming up but before
that you're gonna tell me about some
awesome fun CPU stuff yeah the i7
processor from Intel has just launched I
can't wait to get my hands I want don't
have the cash to do it right now but if
you want to save some money on your buy
seven purchase you guys can head on over
that om wave comm use the coupon code
hak5 new at $10 off the nice thing about
the core of the i7 is hyper-threading is
back whoa
like like the p4 like the people wore
like a honey the i7 is a quad-core
processor
yes we already have quad core processor
right but these processors are up to 20
percent faster than your current
ice-cream edition we've got quick path
memory controller on board so there's no
more frontside bus whoa dude I didn't
like eighty AMD do that like years ago
well you know what sometimes you gotta
buy but the other great thing is gobs of
memory now nice
the more memory that you can throw at it
the better obviously however you argue
you guys are gonna need a new
motherboard so head on over to my comm
and use the coupon code hak5 and you
guys can get your intel i7 core on i've
purchased from em way before in fact Wes
when he built his first computer built
it and wave and the cool thing that they
do is when you're going to go ahead and
like say
building obviously need a new
motherboard you get that processor
you're like ah you know I want six gigs
of RAM now and you grab some of that
maybe a new video card they assemble it
in the box for you so when you open the
motherboard box hey look here's your
processor with the heatsink your RAM
momentum there's no worrying about the
bending fans or anything like that just
throw away especially back when he built
his first computer is like an AMD based
system that's back when you had to get
like the flathead screwdriver and you
push it down on the motherboard I hope
you don't crack the motherboard cuz
you're like missing and you know slice'
needed he did that one so you actually
pulled right off the capacitor off the
motherboard okay I hear we have a
question saveth Shannon yes we do this
week we have a question from Evan hi
Evan
this may sound noob but if you didn't
see our ready Gmail now has a setting to
always use HTTPS do you think that that
would really help protect anything such
as a pineapple sniffing packets okay
well first of all Evan you're not a noob
in fact you own noobs and and so does
everybody else with one of those Glory's
pet pineapples but when it comes to SSL
when it comes to HD HTTP HTTPS thank you
okay
the demo that we showed last week with
the pineapple and a hamster and affair
is totally not gonna do you much when
somebody's surfing on HTTPS so yes I
definitely recommend checking out that
option and Gmail to say always go to
HTTPS in fact that should just be a best
practice and I know we've drilled into
your heads for the last four years but
we talked about banking sites you're not
gonna get any banking site with hamster
ferry because there's HTTPS unless ever
course and recently I've been doing some
experimentation which we all did in
college with airbase ng and a fun
program called Wi-Fi Zoo I'm going to do
a more extensive segment about this in a
couple of weeks I've been working with
post break on Twitter I'm having a
little bit of an issue here with the
DHCP D assigning IP addresses which I
hear are important for clients trying to
own some time but basically what it
allows you to do is just like hamster
and ferret except oh hey the whole SSL
thing yeah we'll just kind of you
send a fake certificate for you and if
you're dumb enough to click yes oh I'm
going to my bank site oh the ssl
certificate is invalid oh well they were
brought their IT department probably at
lazy and forgot to go to GoDaddy and get
a new SSL certificate so basically don't
want more on browsing HTTPS sites yes
and tunnel tunnel tunnel and we will
talk about that more extensively in a
couple weeks because we've got a big big
big project on that so yeah that's so
that I hope answers your questions if
you guys have questions feedback at hak5
dot org put the geeks on it yep and a
couple things to wrap up the show mm-hmm
