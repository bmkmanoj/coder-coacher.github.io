me TN simultaneously
this week's episode is brought to you by
the US Air Force go to assist Express
domain.com got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain hello
and welcome back live my name is darren
kitchen i'm paul tobias and the rest of
the cast ran away yeah just left with us
right now it's true actually
Shannon was just in Missouri yeah yeah
and then I was yeah they go crazy for
Halloween
like crazy oh yeah oh maybe we could
slip some manners and photos or
something yeah
and then I had to work the weekend in DC
actually like for four days straight
like working in DC and the weirdest
thing was I was doing conference
coverage like so you know and then they
said hey we need you to shoot at the
Marriott Wardman I've been like I've
done that three times that shmoocon it
not an exciting one let me tell you know
I was doing corporate video and let me
tell you there is there's no fun to be
had just a lot of kind of board meeting
wait for word point yeah yeah and you
can't like go up to the presenter and be
like that you need to jazz it up but
they don't they don't get it they're a
bunch of engineers yeah
I don't like us dorks yeah I mean geeks
me nerds take your pick
we've all been working on a lot of fun
stuff I've just been hanging on DC yeah
those good times
um but now you tell me that you're
working on well we've got some device
hacking yeah Shannon's working on like a
little itty-bitty Linux device man yeah
that's the hotness right there got it
running X on debian so you know that's
what she's gonna show yeah I think next
week and and let's see I've got all
sorts of other like our type I've got a
whole bunch of fun hacker segments
coming up so that's gonna be good I'm
spending a lot more time in the shell
yeah and we're gonna be spending some
time out was it Westmore
yeah West we're going west we're going
west we're going to Virginia Tech that's
where we're gonna mount ins I've never
been the Blacksburg
I hear it's fun I guess I'm spent much
time out there
so anyway if you attend Virginia Tech or
you're nearby it you should be there
this weekend because that's what's up we
are going to be there on Saturday
November 7 performing a live show
yes it's hack 5 live at Virginia Tech we
are taking over the campus and you know
owning up some Wi-Fi I mean doing
presentations and fun hacker stuff
there's gonna be a lot of fun yeah come
on see ya hack 5 org slash VT for all of
the details on that we really hope you
can join us it's open for everyone right
yeah I'm getting into some fun microsoft
VPN hacking yeah you know it's taken a
lot of things we've learned and piecing
it all together I mean you can't show
the good without the bad you know I'm
gonna go get behind the console and
switch alright well we're gonna get into
that but first let's take a quick break
and thank one of our awesome sponsors
domain.com want to play all the latest
coops video games but don't have any
friends contract a companion it's a
great idea that starts with a great
domain at domain.com domain.com has
sweet deals on domain names like player
two rentals calm domain names for less
than ten bucks a month without pushy
upsells no commitment web hosting for
under six bucks a month private
registration and even killer virtual
private servers are wide domain.com is
the place to get your next domain best
of all hack five fans get an additional
15% off their orders when they tap the
coupon code hak5 at checkout got a great
idea
it all starts with a great domain at
domain.com
so continuing on with our VPN series I
thought it would be important to
highlight some of the insecurities or
weaknesses in the protocols that we've
used so far now much like we have just a
while ago set up an SSL VPN using a dito
or Open VPN ALS if you will we then
followed that up with the nice little
tool called SSL sniff that basically
allowed us to when we're man in the
middle in our target there go ahead and
make those SSL requests on his behalf
and then send him a unencrypted
connection that looks very similar to
what he thinks he's going to be on and
meanwhile we're seeing everything in
between and yes go ahead and try that on
a detail it'll work and you'll be quite
surprised but you know that's your
inherent weakness in SSL or TLS is hey
are you paying attention to this
now this connection here and what we're
going to do today or attempt to do is to
highlight some of the insecurities and
Microsoft's own protocol or their
default protocol for a VPN server now
you'll notice that or if you remember
you've been following along we've set up
two VPN servers using Windows we set up
the first in Windows Server 2003 using
routing and remote access and that's all
tied in with Active Directory and we've
set one up in Windows XP just using you
know the local user accounts and both of
those or PPTP
or point-point tunneling protocol based
VPNs and that's essentially you know
taking just encapsulating PPP traffic oh
it's it's real good in theory but we're
gonna highlight one of the weaknesses
here in it now if you've been following
along with the show for a while and
seeing our our previous segments on
things like PW dump and rainbow tables
brute force attacking you'll remember
that when it comes to Windows
authentication like I just said either
the Active Directory with Server 2003 or
the local user accounts with Windows XP
there are basically two main flavors
here you've got your land manager hashes
which are made out of watered-down weak
sauce
and Arce acceptable to brute-force
rainbow tables all sorts of fun stuff
and then you've got your ntlm hacks
hacks hashes which you know the
passwords and the the account is stored
in and those are still susceptible to
your time memory trade-off attacks well
today we're actually going to be using a
proof of concept tool so we're actually
just going to be brute forcing but you
could take this to as many levels as as
you see fit but why don't we go ahead
and get a little bit of background on
this protocol now when it comes to your
default windows VPN servers your server
2003 or XP one that we've already
created here in previous segments your
default protocol is PPTP and the modern
authentication protocol for the PPTP is
what's known as ms chap version two now
that's the microsoft challenge handshake
authentication protocol and it's
actually in version two since I think 99
or 2000 and there are some inherent
weaknesses in that it's actually why
believe it's been widely known for like
the last ten years how weak it is and if
you're interested in a very interesting
crypt analysis there's one done by Bruce
Schneier and some of the guys from loft
heavy industries so I'll have links to
that in the show notes but it is your
default option there in your ex piece of
VPN servers in your 2003 VPN servers and
if I take a look here I'm in my server
2003 box and I'll go ahead and take a
look at this routing and remote access
service and under security
authentication methods and we'll notice
here we've got the MS chap and there
really isn't a whole lot of other
options other than less secure
you know mechanisms here like you know
unencrypted or just the regular chap and
and that's a shame
other there are other options that exist
you know maybe radius or maybe even just
using a more secure protocol in general
rather than point in Microsoft's
point-to-point tunneling protocol but
suffice it to say when it comes to PPTP
chap is where it's
so we're actually going to exploit some
of those weaknesses in a wonderful tool
so let's take a look at that tool for
Linux so I'm here in my backtrack for VM
and with the tool that we're looking at
today is called a sleep this is actually
if you're familiar with the tool that we
used I think last season cow patty this
is actually written by the same author
Joshua right and this came out in 2004
and has was updated I think in late 2008
with some other options and stuff but
we're actually going to focus on those
today and to give you an idea about this
tool it's a proof-of-concept tool for
demonstrating the weaknesses in both
leap and PPTP now leap is a like an
extension of EAP it is called
lightweight extensible authentication
protocol and you're only really going to
see this in cisco access points at cisco
gear so that's not really what we're
interested in but it will also do
Microsoft point-to-point tunneling
protocol because they both use the same
mschap version two which is you know
inherently weak and it is because it
doesn't use any salts for the NT hash
and it uses some weak DES keys and it
sends user names in the clear and we're
able to with this tool exploit this and
if we capture using a man-in-the-middle
attack capture that handshake when the
connection is created we can actually
you know either live or with a packet
capture run it through this tool the
dictionary file and some key generation
we can find the last two bytes of the
ntlm or the LAN manager hash and from
there we can actually brute force it
with a dictionary and that's just
because there are the inherent
weaknesses and the way that this is
designed with the DES so that's very
cool just out of two bytes at the end of
you know the hash
willing to able to reverse that and
crack it and so you know that's the
high-level overview of this tool so
let's go ahead and have some fun in the
shell and see what we can get going on
as far as a demo is concerned now we
have our backtrack for VM which is what
we're going to use as the attacker we
have our server 2003 box here with our
VPN server or routing remote access
going on and I've got an active
directory let's take a look
we're gonna have to use a new user let's
call him Paul I'm gonna be hacking Paul
yeah
alright so connecting is Paul we're
going to give him a lame password it
doesn't really matter and we do need to
give him privileges so that I can
actually dial in alright and we have our
Windows XP virtual machine over here set
up Paul named password okay now I don't
want to connect yet because I actually
want to go ahead and initiate from the
attacker side a man-in-the-middle attack
so that I can actually see all of the
packets that are going from the client
to the server and vice versa now
typically you know me I like to do them
with either pineapple or you know a very
festive monkey I think he's been to like
a luau and but for right now just here
in the VMS I'm just going to go ahead
and get this done
with a little bit of our cache poisoning
so let's take a look at that alright so
back and backtrack I'm going to go ahead
and run oh there it is ARP spoof that's
the one and 118 is my target and 147 is
the host so that I get that going in
that direction and
I also have it for the other direction
and we're running into some problems and
I figured it out it's because the VPN
server has two necks I actually need to
run it on its second interface here dot
126 so that was taken care of me so
anyway I've got that going and now as
far as what's happening with this is as
far as the client is concerned I'm the
server and as far as the server is
concerned I'm the client now and I'm
just passing everything in between so
that that actually happens I guess I did
skip one step but I also outlined it two
episodes back when I use the same tool
and that is just setting your IP
underscore forward to from a zero to one
but I'll have that in the show notes
anyway so let's go ahead and take a look
at the the packets going by now I I
would be using like TCP dump but just to
make this a little bit more visual let's
go ahead and fire up Wireshark here and
take a look at our interfaces and we
don't have any available because I did
that wrong let's try this again
yes yes Hey look at that
we have interfaces one of these days I'm
gonna learn to just run his route but
still a little dangerous for me
all right so under F zero we see we've
got our packets we'll go ahead and start
that and all we're gonna see here is a
bunch of Arps because that's what's
coming from us and once we actually do
initiate those connections we'll filter
that so that we are not seeing a whole
bunch of garbage we'll see just what we
want to see so our server 2003 box is
ready let's take a look at our client
all right got our password set and let's
connect and it was that fast I mean BAM
and we are connected hooray
and if I come over here and pause this
or just go ahead and stop it I'll notice
that there's a lot of whoa whoa stop
stop stop
yeah this is RDP to a VM I mean so
anyway we've got all of these PPP
packets here and they are you know the
compressed they're encrypted and we're
not really going to be looking into
what's going on there but if we go back
and actually take a look at when that
session was initiated all right so I've
come up here and I see that we've got
all of these Arps but then down here
this is where we see the PPTP the you
know started connection request and from
here we're going to be able to isolate
this and actually extract the handshake
from this and create our dictionaries
run through some tools and start some
cracking but first let's go ahead and
think one of our great sponsors the
United States Air Force
welcome back we're still in Wireshark
and I'm gonna go ahead and enter a
filter that's going to make this so much
easier up here in the top left I've
entered chap and what that's basically
done is said hey I don't care about any
of that other ARP garbage or any of this
TCP packets what I really want is the
challenge handshake authentication
protocol or chap and it's that's the
beautiful thing about Wireshark that's
why I'm not using TCP dump for this just
makes it so easy to visually see this so
if we actually take a look here under
info we can see our you know it's 118
talking to 147 these IPS here back and
forth and see if I can compress this so
you can see a little bit better but the
challenge which was issued from named
salt remember that's the name of our
server 2003 box and here's the value and
if I actually take a look down here come
here there we go
that yes this is in fact you know it's
GRE so you know GRE 47 we are talking
about
I think port 17 43 or 1473 one of those
two and and we are talking about
point-to-point protocol here and here in
fact is the handshake and if we scroll
down here we'll actually see the
identifier is herb's sorry the challenge
is one I believe one is the challenge
two is the response three is success and
fours failed for whatever that's worth
what's important though it is down here
the data so I'm looking at the data here
and I can see this value here this this
nice little hex code right and we're
actually going to copy this into a
little note file because we're going to
be using it later and I think I have a
little oops you know if that's not it
there we go
yeah so this would be the challenge
and let's take a look at that response
so here we go the MS chap responds and
you'll notice right here so the name
Paul like I said the username sent in
the clear text you might not think
that's a big deal but it kinda is I mean
it's half your authentication right
there and then there's other fun things
tools that we could use to maybe if we
were doing a penetration test in this
organization start using social
engineering techniques throwing a little
to melt ego whatever have you you've got
a username so there's a lot that can be
gleaned just from that and maybe we
should take a look in more detail about
that later on but suffice it to say we
have Paul here the username and if we
look at the data here I like I said code
2 this is the response and then here is
our response it's all of this garbage
here but that is what we want so let's
go ahead and copy that to our clipboard
and where's our notepad great don't need
those trailing dots and this is the
response ok so now that we have the
challenge in the response we can
actually start passing those to a sleep
and see if we can get anything from that
but we are going to need a dictionary
file to to crack this now remember that
I said that we have a user name and
that's important well let's go ahead we
don't actually have a dictionary file
setup so we'll go ahead and set one up
here back in the console and let's open
a new shell and yes I'm just gonna get
that whoo that was not what I expect to
do what I did
Oh sudo do I meant to do sudo su anyway
yeah yeah all right so here we are I'm
gonna go ahead and get that out of the
way right now running his route and
let's take a look at cup 2 all right and
I believe we may have take
a look at this tool before but I'm just
going to go ahead and run it through in
interactive mode because what we need to
do here is we have our target Paul on
this domain and we need to create a
dictionary file maybe we've got a
dictionary PI file but it would be
beneficial if we could add something to
it that would be specific to this user
and this is like I said where all of
that reconnaissance comes into play if
maybe we're using alt ego or some other
social engineering techniques to find
more about Paul that's going to be you
know hopefully helpful when we're
cracking his password because bear in
mind this proof-of-concept tool we're
not using any fancy time memory
trade-off any rainbow tables we're just
doing a straight brute-force dictionary
attack so it's very important that our
dictionary as as robust as possible so
we're going to be using this tool here
cup or the common user password profiler
I believe and it's going to walk us
through a guided wizard if you will
loved learning some information to put
together a very a very targeted password
file that is specific here to Paul so
let's go ahead and fill through this
let's see name all surname Tobias his
nickname camera guy his date of birth
and his his wife's name is Shannon and
her nickname is snobs company named AK
five all right come on no we don't want
to add anything else we're we're pretty
much done with this do we want some
numbers yeah of course we want numbers
do we want elite mode yeah we want leet
mode all right now we actually have and
I'll go ahead and nano this or no we'll
be cool and use vai and we can see that
we have a awesome text file here that
has a whole bunch of combinations of
what Paul's password could possibly be
if he were married to Shannon and had a
kid named Kirby and a pet named
pineapple mmm well anyway let's go ahead
and pair this with a a sleep or a sleep
if you will and and go ahead and get our
cracking on so I'm just gonna CP this
over now before we can actually go ahead
and start the brute-forcing we need to
actually generate some keys we need to
create a we need to take this word list
and run it through genki's which will
create an index and hashes of which
because remember we're dealing with des
here so I'll go ahead and run that and
all we have to do is go ahead and
specify our dictionary that we just
created and tell it where we want to
output the the passwords with our hashes
as well as the index file name so let's
go ahead just tack F and then we'll call
this words to dot dat and for the
passwords and hashes and we'll call this
words to dot idx or index that didn't
take too long now of course we would
want a much more exhaustive word list
but for this example I think it's going
to work alright so let's go ahead and
run this through a asleep now
a asleep when it was first released back
in like 2004 was just a piece of concept
tool for cracking you know those Cisco
access points that used Cisco's leap
which happened to use Microsoft's chap
version to which we know is is
vulnerable well well just by the way
that is it is also a point-to-point
tunneling protocol cracker just because
that's the default authentication
protocol so back in I think oh seven or
oh eight Joshua right actually added an
option where not only can you take a
packet capture or just live over the
wire Amen in the middle just looking at
some traffic and you know crack mschap
for like a you know a Cisco access point
or PPTP VPN gave you the option to
specify those important bits of data
that we were just gleaning from
Wireshark before the the challenge and
the response from the client
so let's go ahead and see what we can do
with those now that we have our hash
file and our index built we can go ahead
and run what we gathered from Wireshark
and let's just pull that up here I think
yeah here we go
our challenge actually these need to be
colon delimited did so limited to
eliminate yeah I'm not even going to try
to speak words tonight it was probably a
much easier way to do that but suffice
to say I now have my keys the way that I
want them so I'm gonna go ahead and copy
these challenge because I am NOT writing
that again and run it through a asleep
so we have the option here for well
first we need to give it our dictionary
so that would be words to dot that and
we need to give it our index which was
words to dot I DX and we'll go ahead and
say taxi for challenge and insert that
challenge there now we need to do attack
our for the response and let me grab
this and insert that response and we'll
notice that we get a little error here
it actually says asleep incorrect
challenge input length specified and
I'll show you why I actually have the
source code pulled up here and this is
exactly what I've run into this case
right here on C says hey if the string
length is not equal to 23 then go ahead
and throw that error and exit that's
what I've been running into some
problems here and I'll go ahead and show
you why because there are some other
examples that I know that work and I'm
not sure if it's just a matter of it
being formatted wrong or I'm not
truncating it properly but I've actually
tried you know okay then maybe just once
the first is the the problem here is
this that 23 well with the colons would
be 16 characters or 8 bytes right but
I'm given 16 bytes in Wireshark when I
look at that so what's going on well
let's take a look I'm going to go
go ahead and open up one of the demo
data files that comes with Wireshark or
I'm sorry that comes with a sleep in
fact if I go over to data you can see
here we have a PPTP dump and if you take
a look at the readme they explain what
the passwords are and stuff for these
demos so you can get a feel for the
program without doing any capturing of
your own well head over to Wireshark and
as I have already done with my last one
I'm filtering for chap and I can see
here we go our challenge and I've come
down here the data you'll notice that
that is just as long as 32 characters or
16 bits because they're hex as is what I
had before the response is just as long
of course the name sent in the clear but
interestingly if I run this through the
cracker it actually works so let's give
that a shot now since this is actually a
data dump so rather than just passing
the taxi for the challenge and the dash
are for the response we can actually
give it a packet capture so if it's in a
you know pcap you know format like we
would get with TCP dump or Wireshark or
you know ethereal or a turk app or any
of those we can actually go ahead and
just run it through the tool it will
find the stuff for us and make our lives
a little easier so let's take a look and
again give it our words debt and our and
in this case I'm just going to enter
tack our to read from a file and say in
data size PPTP dot dump and you can see
that it found the username scotch and
the you know the challenge and the
response and we can actually find the
this right here 81 6b that's actually
the two bytes at the end of the ntlm
hash so from that we can you know once
we have those two ended trailing bytes
of the ntlm hash if it is the the
password of that users in fact in our
dictionary file we're going to find that
now I don't believe that it is in this
dictionary file this is the one that we
created specifically for Paul I believe
the password for this is just a sleep or
QA sleep or something like that
but suffice it to say this does work
sadly I don't have the dictionary file
that still does this but it is the one
that I believe comes to the default
distribution so you know I you know I
read you to go ahead and play with this
tool it's a very cool tool download it
from from will rights blog it's a will
hack for sushi and and give it a try
because you know it only does work I'm
sorry Joshua right and that's her sure
why I said well right anyway but you can
see the the discrepancy there and I can
show you down here where is it LS yeah I
have been spending a long time trying to
figure this out and this is the part
where I actually have a unsuccessful
demo sad I know but but I'm actually you
know very curious as to why this is
Morgan because everything that I've seen
it would indicate that this should
actually be only 16 characters or eight
bytes rather than you know what I'm
getting here so I'm not really sure and
that's why I'm asking you guys and I
will go ahead and you know fire off an
email to Josh right see if I can figure
that out but still nonetheless very cool
tool I could probably take what I have
right here and put it into a text file
with like the user :
and then the challenge : : : : and the
respond and then thread that through
like John the Ripper which I don't think
we've ever talked about here and it's
probably outside of the scope of this
segment and email me if you want to talk
about that because it's probably
segmental and so but anyway you could
probably crack it that way but the point
being it's very cool application tool
here that's going to allow us to take
advantage of the inherent weaknesses in
mschap and I think while my demo fails
here and that I can't get the right
challenge length and whatnot I think I
am successful in in displaying you know
just how weak it is just look in here we
can find the last two bytes of that hash
in the demo file so go ahead and take a
look at the tool
yourself run the demos and and see what
you guys can do and I guess the takeaway
here is really that you know mschap is
inherently flawed it's been 10 years and
maybe it's time to just look at a
different protocol and I'm not even sure
PPTP is is worth you know tacking on
that much more effort when there's other
protocols that we will and the rest of
this VPN series be looking at so tune in
for the rest of the series as we take a
look at l2tp and IPSec and then setting
up here on Open VPN servers and doing
fun stuff with VPS a--'s and tunnels and
home routers and it just goes on and on
but you guys your feedback definitely
very important because it influences
