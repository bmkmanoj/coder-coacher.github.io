by Toyota wit pack 5 I'm Shannon Morse
from CES 2014 at digital experiences The
Wizard of Oz year and I found Mike from
revolve hi Mike how are you good Shannon
how are you it's going great thank you
now revolve I hear that this is going to
make my life so much easier I'm excited
please tell me how this makes my life
easier well revolve is essentially a
smart home automation solution focused
on taking those premium devices like
Philips hue Yale locks nest and sonos
bringing them all together under a
single application and then allowing you
to automate them in ways that you can't
do with just a single native application
that comes with those oh that's
excellent I have like 10 of these apps
sitting around at home because like I
have the hue I have sonos and it drives
me nuts that I have to skip from one lap
to another so is this easy for consumers
it's really easy and actually again it's
a direct-to-consumer play so if you want
I'll walk you through how easy it is we
we pride ourselves on 60 seconds set up
and you'll be up and running discovering
the devices and being able to control
them okay I'm counting do it all right
so I'm going to reset the app here and
the first thing that you'll see is that
we essentially allow you to just plug in
the hub in a central location in the
home you're not tied to your router
which is often in the basement or some
obscure place and the reason why is we
want to get the best signal to talk to
all the devices that you have so the key
though is getting this on your local
Wi-Fi network and what we've done is
created for our prior Terry technology
that essentially takes your Wi-Fi
credentials that you have on your white
on your iPhone or iPad and then
transfers at optically to the hub so if
we just enter our password get done we
place the i pad right over the hub and
optically it's transmitting the data to
the hub and within 30 seconds we'll get
notification that the hub is now on your
local Wi-Fi network
and as soon as it does it'll
automatically start discovering these
great devices like Sonos nest Phillips
you yeah and it's a huge success huge
success the cake is not a lie I love
that reference I'm glad I'm glad we have
a lot of fun engineers on our team i can
tell you so as soon as you have it on
your local Wi-Fi their Wi-Fi network we
already might find devices like Sonos
nest and phillips you and then we can go
in and add other ones you know like
belkin wemo intensity on and some other
devices and you can certainly control
them so like you know i can go into the
phillips you i can pick a different
color here like green and you can see it
automatically changes we can close down
the lock by just double-clicking here in
the lock will change and we can even you
know turn on our music here with sonos
and start playing songs so that's really
cool but what's even cooler is when you
can get all these devices under what we
call automated actions that's so i have
the i'm coming home story here and that
is that when i arrived home i'll hit a
geolocation with the phone in my pocket
and it'll automatically set my
thermostat raise the temperature turn on
my lights unlock the doors and play my
favorite music so when i'm straight from
your app so i don't have to go into the
nest at to get all this to work for me
not only not having to open an app but
the phones in your pocket so it just
stays there ambient lee talking to our
cloud services so yes you're right you
don't have to use the nest app nor do
you even have to open our app to control
those things so it's really about
geolocation and automating around you
and your lifestyle now how many
companies does this work with just these
six or are there more we're really
focused primarily on these premium
connected home devices that are really
driving the smart home automation market
but that said we work with about 20
different companies and about 50
different devices currently so we have
about seven radios in our hub only three
of them are active so eventually we'll
be able to work with hundreds of devices
it is this product secure for me to use
in my household it really is because
we're under your your firewall inside
your your Wi-Fi network not only that
but all communications between the
app in the hub are encrypted so we're
very secure as a system as well that's
always great to hear for our hak5
audience now when can people get this
and how much does it cost so it's really
great is we're already selling we
released two months ago in November and
we're excited where you can go is to
revolve calm that's revolved without an
e or you can go to amazon.com and i'm
happy to say at our announcement at CES
will be available in home depot stores
coming up at the end of january into
februari congratulations that's exciting
well is there anything else you want to
add to this you know I think it's just
fun when you start thinking about the
connected home and it's really fun to
get one two three or four devices but
what's really fun is when you can unify
them under one umbrella and then really
start again automating around you and
your lifestyle but then where we really
want to take the technology is where it
based into the background and it starts
to kind of understand you and will
automatically just kind of work around
you and your lifestyle so that's where
it's going to be fun I totally agree
with that thank you so much Mike it was
a pleasure to talk to you and if you
would like some more CES coverage you
