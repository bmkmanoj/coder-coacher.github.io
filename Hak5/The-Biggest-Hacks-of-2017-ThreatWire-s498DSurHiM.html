vulnerabilities of 2017 all that coming
up now on threat wires greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for December 26 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is the best way to support the show and
help us reach our next goal I hope
everyone is having a wonderful holiday
season this week is my annual 2017
roundup of the biggest and worst hacks
of the year the biggest vulnerabilities
announced and the biggest news so let's
get right into it with the first story
so this one is all about Yahoo it's on
our list it actually happened a few
years ago but the numbers were updated
just this year originally hacked in 2013
and 2014
Yahoo announced in 2016 that over 1
billion accounts were hit over their
ongoing investigation though they then
determined in October that over 3
billion accounts were affected in the
previous hack not actually 1 billion so
basically all yahoo accounts were hacked
data included unencrypted security
questions and answers' names email
addresses phone numbers dates of birth
and hashed passwords which although
hashed would technically be reverse
engineered with enough time yahoo could
not confirm who was behind the hack but
they did release a statement advising
customers to change their passwords
across different sites and while
deleting your yahoo email address might
sound like a really good idea
yahoo actually recycles those after 30
days so it was advised to not delete it
and instead change the password add
two-factor authentication and leave it
open by the numbers this makes yahoo the
biggest hack in history and now it's
time for the biggest 0 days and
ransomware of the year and we have crack
and wanna cry so first up was wanna cry
this was a new form of ransomware that
was detected by Talos at Cisco on May
12th the ransomware encrypts data on
computers and then ask for Bitcoin to
release it which is not new every
ransomware does that the attack asked
for $300 in Bitcoin with
in three days or it would double to 600
bucks and after a week the data would be
deleted it attacked Windows XP all the
way up to Server 2012 but Windows 10 was
not affected the attackers made at least
$60,000 during the time when a cry was
infecting devices and it spread through
the SMB file sharing protocol so if one
PC had access to other machines all the
devices on that network could
potentially be at risk in order for it
to propagate ports 139 and 445 need to
be open to the Internet and the at rest
PC wouldn't be listening for any kind of
inbound connections that PC could also
infect other machines like I mentioned
previously if they were not updated on
the same network
now this vulnerability was fixed in
Microsoft's March Patch Tuesday which
was two whole months before it actually
happened
but many computers were not even patched
in that time
this included critical infrastructure it
included UK hospitals and European train
stations and Spain's telefónica and in
total over a hundred and fifty countries
were hit and three hundred thousand
computers attackers used randomly
generated web domains to allow the
ransomware to propagate and a security
researcher discovered this and then he
registered a domain name and the malware
communicated with it
and it stopped the attack surprise
surprise it was actually a kill switch
so the domain kill switch was probably
used for sandbox testing before
releasing the malware and that was most
likely accidentally left in this did not
stop many variances of one a cry though
from popping up in a recent article
published by Washington Post just two
days before pre recording this very
episode the Trump administration blamed
North Korea for the attack stating that
they had evidence and are not alone in
their findings although no specific
evidence was given in the article now
since it was such a problem experts
advise users to disable SMB turn on auto
updates backup your files do not click
on random links use antivirus and a
firewall and block open ports the hacker
who stopped it his name is Markus
Hutchins was later arrested while in Las
Vegas for Def Con in connection to the
Khronos baking Trojan and his alleged
involvement in create
transmitting the code in causing damage
to computers with that trojan the court
case is still pending on that one now
next up was crack which is a series of
attacks against wpa2 which found the
protocol to be vulnerable
wpa2 or Wi-Fi protected access is used
for secure wireless networks and is much
better than WPP due to its passphrase
requirement of course crack stands for
key reinstallation attack and is a bunch
of different attacks aimed at this very
protocol originally presented at
blackhat Europe several months ago the
attack would require a victim to be
within raat Wi-Fi range to steal private
information from them and inject data it
could work against pretty much any
device running on wpa2 protocols
including clients and routers and the
reason for this the encryption handshake
between clients and between routers
sometimes do not complete for various
reasons then the router restarts that
whole handshake of requests and
responses again you can't see it it all
happens in the background but it
restarts with the same exact encryption
key which could then be manipulated by
an attacker and replayed allowing the
attacker to breach your device sadly
just changing your Wi-Fi password would
not fix it since the vulnerability
doesn't even require the password to
work since it did affect the protocol
all affected devices immediately started
sending out updates to their devices to
fix the hole many of which are still
being pushed out to this very day
dumpster file yeah absolutely fixable
totally but of course it requires
firmware updates in June a marketing
firm contracted by the Republican
National Committee to analyze potential
audiences for advertisements left data
on a publicly facing Amazon s3 storage
server URL with no password protection
deep root analytics had collected over a
terabyte of data on 198 million US
voters which is just about 60 percent of
the u.s. population the data included
names home addresses birth dates phone
numbers religious affiliations
ethnicities and possible stances on real
hot-button political topics
according to DRA a security upgrade
happened on June
first but the data was accessed days
after that by a risk analyst at up guard
the data was public for about 12 days
although DRA does not believe they were
hacked companies like this do collect
data on citizens which is not surprising
but the amount of data was actually
quite concerning the records were
compiled from Republican super PACs and
other political firms and also included
files about 2016 political candidates
lobbyists organizations and more and the
biggest hack of the Year award goes to
Equifax no surprise there in September
they announced a breach that had
occurred in the summer time with 145
point 5 million customers data being
hacked this included full names Social
Security numbers birth dates addresses
and some driver's licenses some
customers in the UK and Canada were also
hit and over 200 thousand credit card
credentials were also stolen
Equifax claimed the discovery came on
July 29th
just days before three top executives in
the company sold shares they had in the
business an Apache struts flaw was the
reason for the hack for which a patch
was available in March unfortunately
though Equifax did not patch in a timely
fashion and the hack happened just two
months later many stressful days and
weeks followed in which Equifax
mishandled the public reply and
information related to the breach their
delay in announcing the breach was
criticized far and wide the executives
who sold shares all claimed to have no
knowledge of the breach before selling
their website specifically created for
the hack was flawed from the start it
had a TLS implementation flaw it ran on
WordPress and it was not registered to
Equifax Open DNS blocked the site and
classified it as phishing and then
Equifax is trusts ID credit monitoring
product site contain Terms of Use that
included an arbitration clause with a
class action waiver updated the day
before
Equifax announced the breach Equifax
responded to criticism by publicly
stating the clause would not apply to
the hack incident eventually it was
actually removed finally Equifax wave
security freeze fees for a month due to
the response
from users and Equifax themselves also
accidentally linked to a phishing site
instead of their own site in tweets they
put up on Twitter that have been clicked
over 200,000 times and then in October
third-party Analytics JavaScript that
runs on the Equifax website was hijacked
and served up malware the same day the
IRS suspended their contractual
obligations with Equifax and security
researchers advised users to get
credit-card freezes at the major credit
bureaus to defend against identity theft
due to this giant hack from Verizon to
HBO to Ober we have several more hacks
this year and from cloud lead to not
petia to voting machines we saw even
more publicly named vulnerabilities so I
want to know what hacker vulnerability
do you think should be on this list
leave your choice in the comments below
I'll be sure to check them out and thank
you again to all of the wonderful people
who have contributed to patreon.com
