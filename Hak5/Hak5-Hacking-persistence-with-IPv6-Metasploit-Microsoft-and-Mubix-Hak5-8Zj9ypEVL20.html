add persistence to our penetration
testing with a little metasploit
microsoft and IP version 6
this episode of high five is brought to
you by domain.com got a great idea it
all starts with a great domain domain
com dice.com the career hub for tech and
go to assist express support smarter
with go to assist express hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
technol us thanks for joining us today
we've got an excellent show as you might
imagine we are going to be joined here
by none other than our great friend
muaks AKA rob fuller you may know him
from room 362 calm it's not rob what's
up man we're breaking the internet again
aren't we always yeah that's what you do
man you you make the lights blink that
aren't supposed to write I try to and
our friend Colleen here behind one of
the cameras we go E is the one that
makes the new lights blink and hopefully
between the three of us we can try to
show you why those lights are blinking
that made no sense to you welcome to an
inside joke but what's up man not much
yeah I'm you talking about ipv6 right
yeah we just finished a great segment on
DNS / forcing and up like that I
figured all right we've talked about DNS
we've talked about IP stuff a lot in the
past but you're bringing something way
new to the table so I PV it's a natural
service and because ipv6 is really
really heavily dependent on Venus yeah
how so so actually before we even get
into that because you know we're talking
the internet protocol here right okay
and the current Internet Protocol that
most of us are using on our little home
routers and all that fun stuff is IP
version 4 the the addresses that were
used to between 02 02 02 0 and 255 255
255 255 which there are like four
billion of who why would we ever need
more than four billion IP addresses rob
four billion yeah 40 billion for bit in
the four billion four million four
billion we're billion four billion that
is what is wrong yeah no that's what it
is and somebody and then anyway yeah
nothing you know but you know what it's
really cool because you can actually
emember those right I kind of 192 168 1
dot 100s really yeah i can remember that
i can say that over the phone but you're
not going to remember to 2200 or 2001
colon 5 8 a-6 whatever and then
128 bits worth it is is that just is
that the difference is it just because I
mean I've seen ipv6 addresses and they
just like like really long IP addresses
with hex because they've got a through f
as well so you throw in the A through F
you throw in more octet there and then
boom you've got like really like how
many addresses we talking about here I
might give us six or in my verse freely
35 trillions yeah so you have a hundred
and twenty eight bits that you can
twiddle mmm okay that's one way to put
it and if you were to map that over the
landscape of the earth you would have
enough IP addresses for every 2 square
inches or something that I have read
that sounds okay really enormous like
that it works for me mad those I can't
remember except for when they are
shortened like colon colon one but
regardless of those wise ip6 important
hell what was wrong with IP five right
now I'm joking I'm joking all right so
ipv6 is important because we're
supposedly running out of space yes when
everybody is usually like internal what
10 dot networks in 91 92 networks now so
it's not really running out of space but
we supposedly are so we've been actually
transitioning to ipv6 supposedly for
like 10 years well I are we've got
plenty of IP addresses here at the you
know the hack garage you know we've got
our addresses scheme is 10 1337x so we
could have 250 for devices on this
network before we'd run into problems
and that's what I'm really gonna I mean
got the Ten Network sorts of class a
okay well if we wanted to we could have
a lot well it is a Class A a 10 XXX
where we could do it 17 to 16 X XOR 192
168 XOX you know like right but that
it's behind a net and it's not public
was that mean I'm asking these questions
because I'm the Watson here but we know
what does that mean well so you can't do
it you can't have anything access it
directly unless you do port forwarding
or something like that so yeah you have
the IP space and you probably don't want
anyone in anyways but say you did so you
want to run your network and
have your own services are you saying
with IP version 6 it's a public IP
address every time or something not
every time you can you can still have
Matt mm-hmm but you have so many IPS and
that like the 35 trillion right you can
actually have all addressable routable
IP s so anxiety or to enterprise so
everyone can be like one of those lucky
sob is like the people over at UC
Berkeley up the road where they all get
public IPS and I'm in that fancy right
on some bit torn service from your dorm
room that's what's up yeah so they're
they're the ones making it so that we
run out of ik you for Berkeley bastages
alright well okay can we get this in I
mean yeah sure you and I we've all we've
gone to linux right still using the
windows for the editing and the fun
stuff like that what versions of windows
are we going to find IP version 6 on
because well sirs bat relates to the pen
testing so respect to it above of XP so
XP you have to install it vista and
windows seven come with it default lee
enabled so nice beautiful okay so we can
get it in XP now what what's involved in
that like just a couple of commands and
one command nice and and is just like
boom you do that and then instantly
their public on the internet or whereas
they're tunneling involved or what's
this the special sauce that it enables
someone to be able to you know turn on
up ip6 on their machine and then have
that become a public IP address that
anyone can use regardless of their net
well nice transition no so if you turn
on ipv6 you're only going to get an Fe
address so that address is actually
linked local which is a certain type of
ipv6 address and that will only be
accessible inside of your network so
it's like a 192 address okay but what
we're going to be talking about today is
tarah dough which is a completely
different set up it was don't remember
exactly who started it but Microsoft
runs the server and it allows someone to
try out ipv6 what
about having to ask for an address from
I Anna or someone who gives it up dude
and and I feel bad for Aaron and I na
and all those people that have to deal
with it 35 trillion addresses yeah it's
somebody's responsibility but that's
cool that Microsoft would offer us a way
to have fun and experiment and play as
we also both of them yeah you say that
with a smirk right I well and you say
that with this morn for a reason because
as a professional penetration tester
which makes me really fun thing to put
on your business card how does ip6
version yes Merlot how does IP version 6
come into play when it comes to the okay
so tear it up testing sottero is set up
so that you can have your own ipv6
address and you can try it out and and
access the ipv6 internet right so what
why is that bad basically when with that
I mean every basically leaves you a
public address yeah okay paint me a
picture here why would that be an issue
it gives you a public address okay so
whatever box you turn ter do on right so
Janice in accounting right so me at 192
168 11 yeah or 100 yeah now I have a
public IP address which equals NAT
equals nothing yeah yeah but that goes
away but you're still behind your
corporate firewall your your router
isn't that good no no this is six but
there are rules in place medics we have
what we can we block facebook into my
space so you can get some productivity
done this and we have some more
tunneling oh so so it goes through the
firewalls right so so basically
microsoft has a back door in it it's a
back door man that's great sort of sort
of yeah so since july since july of this
of 2010 2009 mm-hmm i remember to joy
yeah so they enabled what is called ipv6
protection mode because it wasn't
protected before because lots of allah
kiya p address well yeah can be accessed
over or 445 there's a well yeah there's
a reason that we put our pins
behind nat routers right so we don't
want especially a windows machine she
don't want to plug your cable modem
directly into your Windows machine
because port 443 as we know for our PC
and tear no is exactly that oh oh no
it's nice plug in 0 you do that you put
your Windows machine on the internet but
your window machine on the ipv6 on the
ipv6 internet with its port 139 and it's
poor priority for 45 I corporate thank
you that Wow whatever yeah no no so
that's that's no good so that is that
what you're talking about with the
protector so they supply to patch so if
you are not up to date you might not
this this will be even worse for you
yeah cuz somebody scans all 35 trillion
addresses they might find you in papi
box right so that's why ipv6 is so
heavily dependent on DNS so bad a man
just as a real quick tangent sure zone
transfer yeah on an ipv6 enabled network
how'd it be all of the ipv6 addresses
all the quad a records haha and in a
capture the flag tournament that's how I
got onto their network because they had
all of it ipv6 enabled you zone
transferred initially right off the bat
you might have a little bit you see you
didn't just have the head all there just
every machine I had every mission
universal you had everything from the
the little chintzy Nass device to do and
they lyin that is a really good
transition into talking about firewalls
a lot of the firewalls don't have ipv6
protection so you're saying on by
default a lot of them have it but most
of it but some like old ass watchguard
firebox from like 2002 not gonna know if
not gonna love it yeah no not going to
care so if its rules and everything are
set for an ipv4 address and it sees this
it's just the packages you can flow just
lets it go dude that's sexy all right
but we're going to get back to Theriot
so Tara dough is 62 for tunneling uh-huh
so ipv6 it translates it right it goes
over UDP and will actually talk out to a
Microsoft server and so ipv6 Tara dope
microsoft com
okay okay so it's so great of them to
offer that for us to have some fun right
so we're going to have some fun here on
this show we've got we got a windows XP
box just sitting waiting to be
penetration tested by yeah I was going
to say something else but don't realize
or could kids watching and so yes stick
around so we're gonna pop some box in
and before we do that though we're going
to take a quick break and considering
that this is a blocking and just go
ahead and probably default throw it over
to Shannon find out what's going on with
trivia this week and then thank a
sponsor we'll be right back last week's
trivia question was this member of the
homebrew Computer Club is also known as
crunch man or captain crunch in his name
is John Draper the epic code freak if
you want to win some hack by schwag go
over to hack five dot org slash trivia
and answer the following question this
query and response protocol based on
finger at its origin and ARPANET
nicknamed protocol we'll be right back

it's not tact it's not on dice muaks we
made again I have brought you a windows
XP machine that you can exploit with
your neat tools wow how will we maintain
resistance on the
machine you can't all right well
whatever man like check it out right so
you've popped another XP box because you
know it's 2005 and and you want to stay
on that machine and you know what to say
that but this this wouldn't matter cause
their systems it's called persistent
right what's what's important about
persistence what does that even mean so
alliteration tester all right so say you
get a client-side right so client side
is where you send an email or get them
to surf to a web page or whatever right
so you're targeting Janice in accounting
and you totally know that she likes
Lowell cats and you sent her link and
she clicked it and then all the sudden
it was like oh google needs to update
the blah blah blah well then it will
have the little picture locate and say
you must update google too so here the
local vue de lo que so you click sucker
for it run nice and then her day just
got a lot more interesting right right
but she doesn't know it no but you want
to stay on that machine because it's an
important machine right and there's a
bunch of different ways sysinternals
autoruns tool allows you to look at all
your like things that automatically
start up which is a really good
reference for penetration test hey there
you go well congrats you mark and all of
your awesome sysinternals tools and
they're awful i quite like PS exact
sorry ok so there are a lot of methods
as you would say that to maintain
persistence and then probably say
persistence you mean a connection to
that machine a shell on that machine you
want to know it doesn't actually
necessary a connection really so buying
shells the old way of doing things right
like is to create a service on the
machine sure whether it's all right what
have you made oh yeah so netcat
listening on port 9000 9000 winner or
something high once every week seven one
three two sevens like the default
wouldn't know anything about that so
yeah look on youtube for net cat show
yeah more weight ever here so vine show
so that's the old way of doing things
then then metasploit started doing like
reverse shells and well there's other or
show before that but anyways so that was
the new way of doing things that way you
get it to connect to you awesome cool
stuff I like that
yeah what there's some problems with
that right yeah so the firewalls in
place right you have vampire was always
getting in the way plus a lot of
firewalls or a lot of ids is flag on the
cmds like right if an agenda detection
system notices over clear text that all
the sudden a C colon backslash a windows
Waka is showing up there like hey to
someone pop a boxing or am i Jes and
then yak man lining and that persistence
method has another problem you can't you
can't connect to it whenever you want it
has to connect to you have to wait for
it so we're going to show you how buying
shells can make a comeback okay let's
make it sexy let's let's go ahead and
this is going to maintain it so that you
will be able to reconnect to this box
right whether it's rebooted yeah I mean
that we removed or oh hey don't don't
you dare alright so you get hit by a
pineapple we get to get a show how our
way how do you want and you want to get
a coffee shop at the airport right the
places that we do these things get
persistence you don't want to have to
wait for it to connect back to you
because you'll have to set up something
that either autorun some way yeah
because you know you owned them when you
want to lay over for Chicago and then
they're going on back to Nebraska and
you're like you know still fancy that
box right so other persistence methods
say they go into a network and it
automatically start speaking trying to
get to you right that's got to be no
good it can be setting off alarms wait
you might not want you might want to
connect to have it so that you want to
connect to it like a midnight or
whatever and ip6 is what's going to
allow us to make this all sexy right
true like a weirdo remember how we said
yeah territory gives you a public
address Oh Microsoft how we love thee so
cool walk me through it like okay so
I've got this set up I've got the idea
that the the pitcher has been painted as
to why and how so why don't Lee we get
practical now what are we using all
right so we got a bunt too but the very
first thing on your butt to install is
you got to have ipv6 on your bunch of
machines ok so at get installed
their dough and mere dough is there a
toe yep let's maridel married it was
easier Adele unix / linux / OS x version
of terror dome beautiful so so once we
have that were set to go we've got an ID
pieces right the only thing is like if
you're going to be doing this for a
penetration test you you really really
don't want your mirror doe giving you a
public IP yeah all the time that might
be an issue right so what you want to do
is tell it on this is on a bun to do not
oops weirdo remove so this this is this
command removing it from automatically
starting up oh good because every time
we blew it up we don't want marriage so
we're going to have to start that
service manually whenever we want an IP
6 address on Tamara toe and then we'll
be able to connect to our bitch that we
owned earlier on taradale right and we
really don't care what the IP or the
ipv6 address that we got back is you can
see it reinfect since it's a bind shell
we're connecting to it so we don't
really need to know it right so it's
that 2001 address their correct so taro
and marido get the 2001 addresses ok so
it's 2001 colon and yada yada yada
you've got a bunch of stuff right and
that's going to allow us to talk to to
what now now we've popped that box
actually you haven't clicked on it oh do
we need to do that now yes all right so
I'm going to be Janice in accounting
here and get owned so I already have a
resource file which is a file that
basically is a script that says run this
then this then this and this it's a bash
script from MSF console okay well I'm
just going to make things easy and hey
Janice was a noob and totally clicked yo
let me get owned right no I haven't
started yet oh ok well Janice will wait
for you then so go monk gokal gokal go
Kyle go Kyle go cow let's get the cow oh
no cow alright alright so we're ready ok
so what we've done over here is we
started a
a java-based multi handler and you're
going to click that and we're going to
get show all right Oh hallo cats now the
Java that jar file works on anyways so
this is XP here but it could be like a
like Linux box or a mac or right so if
there was a Mac we could actually do the
exact same thing with port install
married oh nice yeah okay and same thing
with linux like you show it was visible
everything except for windows and this
dis attack is OS agnostic I love that
you don't cross platform goodness is
what it's all about people all right we
got a session nice cool so do we do now
we wait for my shelter so sessions for
its administrator on your PC sessions
that I goes in to second one and none of
this is really important yet but now
we're in what you have a shell we have a
show okay so so this is the initial time
of the image right right so this is the
we have a show for the first time right
and we're like you know it's a tasty
shell but I kind of like to have it
later right and you can actually script
this with interpreter scripts you can
you actually get this going like not
easy all right but we're going to do it
without the scripts let's do it manually
so that we can learn it right so all
right so what's the first part I mean
obviously this machine doesn't have ip6
right SH is the command love that is so
you can either go into net SH or do it
straight from the lines right i usually
use it to do set firewall hablo disables
install so now two states interface ipv6
install they'll say okay in a second so
this enables ipv6 on all here that was
it it's just in salt ip6 there's not no
no big hassle well new all right cool
NAT sh and ipv6 Tara dough or I'm sorry
set Tara dough and it's actually
different on on Windows 7 so Tara dough
is is even more built in I guess so it
actually has its own category inside of
message okay
no no worries Jared Oh enterprise client
now the two options enterprise client
and client so if you said it's a client
it will not get a public IP it will not
set do tarrano or tear dough inside of a
domain oh no that's that's gonna be a
huge problem no everybody mean there
well if they're part of my domain that's
like half the fun boxes you'd want to
exploit anyway well there are some
instances where you wanted where you
want it not to do that so say if you
want your buying shell to not get an
ipv6 address when you're when they're on
the domain right you just want to have
it so that whenever they go home or
off-site nice right yeah okay so there
are instances where you actually want it
to be on client is that a difference
between the version of it now and before
you said that it used to be like like
not protected and now it's the protected
version or how's that no that doesn't
matter at all so we've just initialized
it right alright and then why is it just
gonna get it was like a tooth well how
do we know it's got an address well you
just you can either wait for a second
what it's doing is its probing out for
different nap types ok so the dunes kind
of like a dhcp Ontario sort of it's it's
seen how it can get out it's figuring
out how it can get out and away so doing
all the work for you right so we can
actually see what's going on if we do in
that in ipv6 show Tara dough and what
we're looking for is a qualified and
there it is so has a qualified suit so
state equals qualified means it pulled
up an ipv6 public ipv6 address to the
wrong Microsoft and it's good so we need
to see that right now just by doing like
what an ipconfig like a they say
search all Oh gorgeous I can already see
all those f's and happy hex codes dude
that that is so delicious so no you need
that that f we want to say that because
that is that is not easy to remember no
unfortunately it is not okay so it's in
your clipboard say like this machine
moves you move
whatever right now there is another
setting that I can't recall top my head
but it's in SH ipv6 that will allow it
to not be random I go right in much so
it will get the same one every time oh
you would probably want it to be a
static yes right okay so is that the
gold net SH help ipv6 right that'll
probably give you all the info you need
all right so we are so we've left the
shell hmm we've left the shell now no we
haven't left the show because we haven't
uploaded our fine show okay we haven't
so we have to actually make that so
massive payload windows because we go to
Ritter reverse I'm sorry bind bind ipv6
tcp and we don't have we don't specify a
host because we want it to just defined
on colon colon which means everything
everything yeah all right also L port
what do you want to have a port 1337
that sounds good fun it's not like we're
using it for anything else okay and
we're just going to say bind exe just
because it doesn't matter make it happy
all right and if you were actually on a
pen test you'd want it to be a little
less obvious that's a bit conspicuous
yeah right so help that exe helped under
you see in LA a lot of malware does
svchost.exe of course so we got it we're
good okay you screen back in upload our
fine dot exe done where's that good like
the root no it's actually in your
downloads folder nice might wanna yeah
oh well yeah pens I mean sometimes your
downloads folder has so much stuff in it
it's going to blend it sure that way it
would on mine definite you definitely if
you're on a pen test you definitely
don't want to go into system 32 it might
blend in there
but every AV on the planet looks in
there okay hmm good to know so xq so
we've uploaded it we've execute execute
hidden generalize we don't want to
interact with it and bind you seen ah
fine d fine d done so right now on your
host yeah I know right see box is just
waiting and I'm not going to notice
anything because it's totally hidden
nope we've lost or show oh no so how are
we ever going to get back because you're
not even on this network are you I mean
your novia I'm actually hella cute
through the mifi back here so you've got
your only bring your own internet site
divorce right so you're a 3g network
totally separate from the hack garage
here yep and you're going to reconnect
to this guy right so we were already in
multi Handler and i can show you the
options if you want so that's our stuff
i don't care about the IP because it
changes so sit Caleb so we set it to the
same payload that we already made right
all right all right so used to doing
reverse yeah well that would be the IP
for way to do it sit so are our host is
yeah that really long is a dress okay
and I'm really no awards l port is 13 it
says L port but it's really are bored
and share but it's the local post the
port that we're expecting it to be yeah
right so 1337 you really what she's
totally gonna like throw flags and if
the firewall would even noticed but
farwell doesn't cuz I p6 exactly okay
yeah yeah oh no we're just holding act
by using enter and there we go hacking
the gibson right yep nice so I'm
interpret open one session one open to
that address to that address all
over Microsoft so you're not even on the
network because you're on your own 3g
and you're just using the Microsoft
provided ip6 that you have the exact or
tunnel the IP version 6 address that
Microsoft is provided to your victim
here right so we both got ipv6 addresses
through Microsoft and we use that to
connect and then done yeah done no
firewall needed that's beautiful Rob and
thank you that's that's that's really
something that should be anybody's
toolkit effluent now people can find out
more about that kind of stuff over a
tactical exploitation yes that's where I
do videos and we got a couple other
contributors sir there's a bunch of
different things including like DNS
brute-forcing stuff and like PHP shells
and different the premise for practical
exploitation is to go from zero to like
60 so instead of having the video that
shows you how to use this one thing yeah
it goes okay you can use this then this

on your technol us photo of the way
first Shannon we've got some mafia back
here yes we do that course we always so
much thank you for keeping it short by
the way yeah really appreciate that
Schwartz are so much easier to read and
a lot of times I replied at those a lot
more than I replied to the longer ones
definitely especially if they're easy
questions I like to see all right the
first one is from bezar he said hey
Darren what headset do you have they
look pretty sweet ok so I don't know if
you guys remember from the e3 episode i
did with jen but we checked out these
sweet headphones from Knox audio and i
gotta say i absolutely love these things
I immediately saw them and said dude I
need to pick them up because they've got
the
for conductor pin right check those out
and that's the thing I love the most
right so you're just like and then when
you're when you don't need your gaming
headset you just Ravel that right back
up and I find that I actually use it a
ton on my cell phone because it's got
the poor conductor but it also comes
with a cable to break it out to left and
right audio and then you know so you
twist this guy for that and then you
twist this guy for the volume and I've
had them for a couple months now since
e3 and I love them yeah they're good
it's the quality pretty good yeah the
quality is great and i gotta say like
you know they're comfy that's what i
like about the most yeah my ears always
get hurt from my big headsets that i had
it they're not rubbery is what i like oh
yeah yeah they're made out of it like a
little terry cloth kind of thing going
on I have to pick me up some of those
yeah they're not too expensively you
know so there there's a real road test
of some gear that's been working out for
me Thanks for writing in from mark he
asked what VNC client was Jason using on
his macbook pro Jason uses chicken over
the VNC the most awesome VNC client for
mac exertion really it's taken as you
can as a VNC oh that is kind of cute
yeah easy one thanks for sending back
and our last question this week is I
need some help because I'm a younger
viewer on 13 I'm loving all the
technolon your show and I have just one
problem i love the hacker community so
much that it began to show in my
personality it does for all of us and
well I've tried to talk to my parents
that I'm a hacker and they were freaked
out they were scared they told me I
needed to quit because I'm gonna go to
jail oh so I have to hide it oh man this
is sad so do you guys have any ways that
I can break it to my parents I've
watched hackers are people too and
thought that would be a great show to
show them although with all the alcohol
and the cussing and the sex jokes that
might stop them from getting the whole
meaning so I'm open and i'm still elite
hacker that's from zachary is that great
thing today yeah we get emails like this
a lot and it kills me exactly embrace
your technology it's not something to
hide and your parents just have this
media misconception that's been
been reinforced by mainstream media and
it's totally wrong and hackers are
people too is a great documentary by a
stress wart I'll that that tries to
bring it to light but really I think for
them you might be better off showing
them more of the open source more the
programming you know shown that you're
gonna be the next bill Gates and you're
going to be bazillionaire because you
know how to write a bash script or PHP
or whatever it is that you're into
getting pythons good stuff so uh so you
know maybe you should show them
revolution OS it's a great documentary
about the open source movement and
listen if you guys the viewers have some
suggestions for Zachary as well we would
love to hear what you suggest for
breaking it to the parents it's like you
know when you come out of the closet you
let your parents know you're hacker
there was a movie that I just saw it was
on torrance all over the place and I
just watched it when they didn't come
out because of the one that didn't come
out and we'll put in the lower third
yeah but everybody else you know if
you've got suggestions as well email us
