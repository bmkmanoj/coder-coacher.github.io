by domain.com I'm here in Beaverton
Oregon just outside of Portland checking
out rhino motors and their very first
micro cycle about six years ago what
what happened was I have an email from
this guy named Chris Hoffman and he said
I need some help getting this balancing
unicycle thing running and I was in Bend
Oregon which is like about a three hour
drive over the mountains and I came here
to Portland and he showed me this thing
in his garage and this is what started
it kicked it off his daughter found a
one-wheeled motorcycle in a video game
and decided that what he would she asked
him can you build one of these and the
first thing you do when when people give
you a wacky idea is you try and kill it
with Google so he he googled and
couldn't find anything like what she was
talking about and she sketched out what
she wanted and everything she was a cool
teenager and so he built this and
couldn't get it to balance and so he
called me in because I had been doing
some balancing stuff and and blogged it
on my website so we got this to balance
and thought it was really a cool thing
until we found out that you really can't
steer it with your upper body which we
thought you could use body English in
order to get the thing steering so then
we went to prototype 2 which is this
over here and this allows you to use
your body to steer by swinging the
weight over the sides of the wheel and
this this helped us develop a business
plan something we could show people and
say would you like to invest in so that
we could move to the next step which was
this product the third prototype which
we thought would work well for the
street but turned out that people didn't
like the Radek
design that we had it was a little bit
too Italian superbike looking so then we
move back over to a different design
that's similar to this which I can't
show you because we're in the middle of
building it so anyway the the upshot of
that is we've got some some other stuff
we can show you but I need to go in and
make sure that the the new bits are
covered up okay this basically is is a
lot of pics that are running at 30 myths
that I'm using for redundancy and this
is like the dashboard LEDs so that sort
of thing and you know just just you know
flash the flash the chips and test and
change the code recompile you know the
loop right oh yeah and then have the
bike fall over and then gather the data
and find out why yeah exactly
so yeah that's this kind of how it works
and so I do with Nick's I'm using picks
because they're they're reasonably cheap
they're inexpensive I mean they make
them buy the time and picks have a lot
of features in them that that for an
embedded system is is quite positive I
mean like things like failover circuits
for things like main clock and things
like that so that you don't have to
worry about the things starting up and
then the crystal oscillator failing and
then you have to what do you do next
well it fails over automatically to an
RC oscillator so that you you're always
going and and in in what you have to do
always with embedded systems is have
some way of flagging those failures and
in our product for instance if there is
some sort of a failure
it just dials the speed down so it
doesn't let you go faster than a brisk
walk until you shut the Machine off and
then if you turn it back on and the fail
and the fault is still there then you're
not going anywhere you're pushing it
home
that kind of thing so we've tried
through redundancy and through all of
these other things to try and make a
product that is safe for people to use
and and design the handling of it so
that it's fun for people to use so how
many pics are in it lots of pics I'd say
at least four maybe five it just depends
and so each has a different subsystem
that it monitors Holzer oh yeah there's
one for distillers one for the display
there's ones for controlling the motors
there's ones for checking the balance
and both in the pitch and the roll axis
so there's all sorts of things going on
and we use gyros and accelerometers in
order to get that stable reference that
you need in order to decide the guys
leaning forward so move the motors
forward the guys leaning back so is that
something you have to calibrate every
time no you don't really need to
calibrate it I mean once because it's
it's dialed in to where the center of
the earth is right through the
accelerometers it's it's not an
excessive calibration this is what I was
talking about redundancy we've got like
two thousand watt motors that we're
using to to drive a big wheel that then
drives an automobile rim and when you
put it all together it kind of looks
like this
and so everything lives inside of the
wheel everything lives inside of the
wheel the batteries the electronics the
motors everything except for that little
display which sits on the handlebar
since a few buttons and so is everything
electric we started off with lead acid
but they're so heavy then it makes the
wheel just really hard to maneuver so
let the lithium ions I think are maybe
about a third of the weight but they're
yeah at least three times the cost and
three times the complexity when I'm
charging and everything yeah so the
charges are more expensive the batteries
are more expensive and and that's that's
a leading item for anything that uses a
lot of power
I mean if batteries were cheap everybody
be driving a Tesla right right so that's
well kind of the individual 18 650 that
they put in them is really cheap it's
just that you need 2,000 of them yeah it
is yeah and if you go over to the Tesla
store and ask them it turns out that
they don't just buy them from anybody
they buy special ones that that are made
by Panasonic and so what do you guys use
well we're going through and evaluating
a bunch of battery vendors right now so
I don't have a good answer no okay cool
so is it classified as a motorcycle or
how does that work it's going to be
classified as a scooter personal
mobility device the top speed is twelve
and a half miles an hour so you can use
it and all the different types of
environments that you would not use a
car so you know sidewalk bike lane you
know getting around in that sort of
capacity and our goal is to have this as
a product that you know both consumers
will use it'll be a lot of fun to get
around but there'll also be some other
applications in terms of industrial also
in terms of you know manufacturing
security things along those lines as
well so there'll be multiple channels
that we
are looking to tap into so what did I do
there's the key so the idea is
this one's got a big fan and it so it
makes vacuum cleaner noises so so I'm
just gonna pick this up and lean it
forward and you can see that the wheel
moves forward and if I lean backwards so
that's kind of the idea is when this
leans forward that the motor moves a
proportional amount to keep you in
balance
same thing was slowing down stopping you
lean back just lean forward lean back
and then what you can do and one of the
things we're working on is setting the
balance in a different place depending
on you know your size and your weight so
it's not exactly set up for me right now
because I have to sort of like that and
it might find to do that we can do
another
the cut because I'm having to lean
forward quite a basic eight
okay so you do calibrate it to your
weight it's not necessarily to your
weight it has more to do with them with
your height in living where your body
mass is oh where your Center is so where
exactly because it always knows where
the center there it is and so that's
where it needs to stay so you've got to
get your body weight over the front to
be able to get it to go forward right so
it just depends on where you are and
that'll be different whether I'm sitting
on the front of the bike or whether I'm
sitting on the back of the bike don't
sit on the back if you tend to go back
if I sink more towards the front
so you know that's basically and has a
has a breaking working so I see you've
got a brake lever well you know it is a
brake lever and right now essentially
the we don't like to call it a break
because you're always engaged with the
product so you're never breaking your
actually what we'd like to call it as
the stop assist lever so you know if
you're leaning way forward you're
telling the bike to go forward right and
if you pull the brake then you tell them
to bike to do two things at once
correct right you're telling it both to
go backwards potentially all it does is
it drives the motor a little bit harder
to ride it back in front of you to the
youth it assists you to get your weight
back to slow down so it's not
essentially a brake
yeah so mister pelvic to transfer the
power it's transferring the power and
it's a stop assist to leverage what
we're calling it so is it because when
you're in a full lean you know going top
speed that it's difficult to push
yourself back on the handlebars to a
place in where your weight is in Reverse
that's a good question so it's
interesting it sort of finds this happy
place I guess is the best way to say it
so as you're leaning forward you'll get
up to a speed you're comfortable at and
then once you're there if you find that
neutral spot it'll go so it's actually
not difficult to get your weight back
once you're at that spot but say if
you're example if you're trying to
accelerate and you want to stop fast
that's when you want to start quitting
your way back it'll help you get there a
little bit
but if you're at a constant speed and
you're just neutral you'll just cruise
along and then you just lean back and
you'll slow down fairly quickly yeah
yeah and and the turning mechanism how
does that feel like is it is it do you
ride motorcycles or bicycles it doesn't
feel natural like that or I do right
I've been riding motorcycles for about
20 years I ride bikes as well and it is
definitely a unique different really fun
experience it's essentially in a
straight line it's very much like riding
a bicycle I mean in the sense that you
know you're just there you're engaged
with the handlebars turnings a little
bit a little bit different and that
takes a little bit of practice because
you know you only are you're only on one
wheel rather than two wheels so when
you're when you're turning it I liken it
to riding a bicycle when you're at a
very very slow speed or a motorcycle
where you kind of need to keep your body
weight over you know the top of the bike
so it's more there's a little bit more
hips involved in terms of getting
keeping your body centered and actually
turning at the same time and again it's
one of those things that becomes second
nature you just takes a little bit of
racket right so the handlebars are to
what help you assist you in shifting
your weight on something to work against
or what the handlebar is it is really is
just an idea to bring this suit to make
it much and feel much more accessible I
mean when you don't have anything at all
in front of you if you
it's a true unicycle without you know
without anything in front of you it's a
pretty unnerving feeling and this
actually settles people in but I think
it makes you know this is this sort of
um a build a lot more accessible and
easier for people to sort of wrap their
minds around because I mean as it is you
know people when we take this out I mean
people are fascinated
you know the fact that how do you do
that how could you possibly do that how
could that thing will work and but it
does kind of a new category of a product
I mean we were referring to it is that
and we talked about this a lot what are
we going to call this thing I mean it's
not a bicycle right and by it I mean
technically a unicycle is I guess but I
think it's a little bit doesn't it
describe it as well because it has
handlebars on it which is a unicycle
doesn't and it's not really a scooter
it's not a motorcycle so we actually are
coined the phrase microcycle and
would you say that the technology it's
not inconceivable that one day that
something like this could be on the road
I would say that at this point in this
world that nothing is inconceivable
I mean who who at this point in the
environment that we live in and the
technology and as fast as it's moving
would would put a limit on anything oh
my Sarah yeah would you ride one on the
road
oh I'd I'd write this one on the road I
have written down the road you know
would I when I go 60 probably not I'm
sure they said the first edge I'm sure
they said the same thing the first time
a motorcycle 160 miles an hour yeah and
you know that's also that's today you
know in in 10 years you know I might say
absolutely yeah I you know I would
definitely go 60 on this thing
just give me give it an injection seat
and a parachute all it needs is some
Rockets call it a day yeah
yeah yeah oh you have yeah
gotcha
there we go now I'm starting to get the
feel for this one again let me survive
the other one so
cool can you like spin in place or what
what kind of turning radius to get well
I mean you can turn from probably in a
3-foot radius but that's the other thing
about in terms of you know being in an
environment like sidewalk or a busy mall
or wherever it is you might want to get
around you know your entire footprint
isn't much larger than if you were just
standing so getting on a train or
maneuvering around people and then if
you just want to turn around or move
around at the same to you and then you
could probably turn this anywhere from a
a three foot radius to a you know 20 30
40 hubs are long and wide asleep and so
do you have an idea for like kickstands
or some sort of weight cuz now that the
power is cut it's not balancing it so
that's exactly right yeah there's no
balancing you can roll it back and forth
but you have to balance it yourself and
there you go she's parked nice so yeah
it's a little tricky that the that's a
kickstand for a one-wheeled product
because you've got to have three
purchase points there's only one with a
bicycle or a motorcycle or anything else
you've always got your three purchase
points so we'd have to create three
purchase points with this which is why
the front parking bars make the most
sense at this point and we're working on
you know again this is one of the other
things we're we're working on but again
to have this thing be stable and be able
to just have a kickstand they would have
to be a special customized kickstand so
yeah for now this is how we're how she
parks that's really cool

last week's trivia question was who
originally wrote the code for an egg
drop and when did he write that code now
the answer was Robby pointer in December
of 1993 this week's question is as of
April 2012 what 3d printer was the most
funded technology product on Kickstarter
