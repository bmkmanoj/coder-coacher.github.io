break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're learning
about the fun world of permissions now
Linux computers can be used by more than
one person at the same time multiple
people can log into the same machine
from different locations to work on it
so it's really important for that
machine to allow certain users to do
certain things so that they don't
destroy one another in the process hence
we have permissions now if you've ever
had an output that said something like
permission denied that means that you
don't own the file that you're trying to
change or you haven't been granted
access users can own a file or belong to
a group that has permissions to access
files by the owner the owner of a file
can also grant access to everybody aka
the world and they can check your
identity using the ID command so first
you see the user ID number and then your
primary group ID for example I see
myself so UID 1000 Chenin that's my name
GID which is my group ID the group
number and then the number for ATM and
so on and so forth so these are all the
different groups that I belong to if I
run a file called slash et sleaze slash
passwd it tells me permission denied so
there you go now this is a file that
shows the user accounts while the etc'
Group file shows the group information
the shadow file also found under the
same directory includes information on
the users password these all these
different files will output the
information for the ID command and each
one is updated when new accounts are
created now how do you tell if you can
access a file or not for example I'll
run a text file so I'll call this the
l'Estaque l
example dot txt oh let me create that
file first touch okay so I just created
the file there you go
now the answer you'll find about your
permissions is over in these first ten
characters at the beginning this tack RW
Tech RW Tech our tack tack right now it
doesn't really make that much sense but
it will in just a second now the first
one is the file type and then the next
nine are the read write and execute
permissions for the files owner the
group and everybody else for the file
type tack means a regular file indeed
means the directories so in this case
tack means a file LC and B usually mean
a symbolic link a character special file
or a block special file you won't see
those ones very often a character
special file is like a terminal or a
modem a block special file is like a
hard drive or a CD ROM or which where
data are in blocks now at the beginning
here you see are for each of the user
groups this means that you can open or
read a file or you can check out the
constant contents listed for a directory
W right after the are in the first two
groups means that you can either write
to a file or you can create files in a
directory and if there was an X on any
of these that means that you could
execute the file or enter a directory so
if I saw something that was listed out
like this tack r WX art x or tax that
would mean that I could do read write
and execute for the user the owner but
only read and execute by the group in
everybody else the world if I saw an
example like this where it said d r WX r
tech X tech tech tech that would mean
that this directory can be entered or
files can be created deleted or remain
renamed inside the directory by the
owner but the group can only enter it
they can do anything else and everybody
else they can't even see it they can't
do anything now let's check out changing
file modes after the break now we're
back with changing file modes
now if you are the files owner you can
change the files permissions with the
chmod command which is basically changed
mode to change using a number scheme
which is octal representation you would
need to know the following zero and
octal means zero zero zero an in binary
this means tack tack tack so it kind of
changes between three different versions
zero octal binary 0 0 0 and then tack
tack tack which is what you see in the
output 3 in octo means 0 1 1 which
basically means tack WX and 7 for
another example in octo means 1 1 1
which translates to our WX another
example 6 in octal means 1 1 0 and in
binary this means our W tack and so on
so there's about 10 different ones I
believe or so and each one means a
different name change or a chmod now to
change él está el example dot txt so
that your desired permission output does
something that you want it to do you can
do this LS tack L example dot txt so
right now it has the same mode that I
have left it on and then I can change it
with chmod 6 0 0 so I have 6 for the
first part and then 0 for the group and
then 0 for everybody else example dot
txt now if I go back to it
aha it changed so 6 0 0 this means 6
which is 1 1 0 or RW tak and then 0 or 0
0 0 in binary which means tack tack tack
and tack tack tack for the group in
everybody else so it kind of sounds
really confusing at the moment but once
you do it a couple of times you'll get
the hang of it now you can also change
modes using symbolic notation so there's
new for user G for group owner and then
o for others or the world and then a for
everybody all so for example you tack X
this means that the owner cannot execute
if I pressed in G 0 equals RW this would
mean that the group and others can only
read and write if I put in u plus X this
means that the owner can now execute and
so on and so forth so now that you know
how to use both octal and symbolic
notation you can use the chmod however
you like this can be done through the
GUI as well by right clicking on a file
or a directory so if I went into the GUI
and I clicked on example I could go to
permissions and I could change it for
the owner the group and others like do
you read only for others clothes now
let's see if it changed in here too
there you go
so that's pretty cool whether you want
to change your permissions and Nautilus
and the GUI or if you want to do it in
the terminal either way is up to you and
you have both choices now have you guys
had any weird experiences with
permissions you can make sure to email
me over at tips at hack 5 org with your
thoughts or you can comment below about
what you think and be sure to check out
